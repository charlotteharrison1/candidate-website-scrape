A fine of £75 can be issued to anyone breaking the ban.\nSue said, “What is the point of placing a rule forbidding\nsomething and then not following through and enforcing it?”\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper agreed, “It took Labour nearly 2\nyears following a successful Green Party motion at Kirklees Council to\nimplement the ban. The lack of any enforcement at all at Castle Hill does not\ngive the public confidence. People love Castle Hill but the authorities need to\nprotect it.”\nAndrew and Sue helped local volunteers clear up used\nfireworks from around Castle Hill after Bonfire Night on the 6th of November\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Housing is a crucial issue for all of us - if we don't get well insulated housing to Passivhaus standard as an everyday standard for all our houses, nobody is going to be able to pay their heating bills, and that is from now. For that reason alone, the government should be funding councils all over the UK to make insulation schemes available. A pilot project of 6 houses will not go very far towards solving the problems of people or the planet we live on.

We (in the Green Party Climate Change Campaign Groups) have been talking about how we can make such plans as a part of the Green Party's next campaign after Breathing Cities. I think that making them for particularly 3 sectors - transport, food and energy - makes a lot of sense. Most things connect or are somehow linked with these at a council level. Maybe logistics and provenance or procurement can be argued as a cross-cutting or another sector, but I would say it fits into transport and energy by proxy. <br /><br />All of these need planned for transitions, if we aim to reach the 2030 targets set by Green Party Policy (or even in some cases the 2025 targets set by XR) rather than the laggardly targets of 2050 set by the Tories - though I think they are beginning to waver and trend toward 2040. <br /><br />What can be useful is if we have beacon projects and councils (anywhere in the world, but EU, Northern EUrope or UK are better for our purposes of promotion) to showcase these, highlight what we have done as councilors and councils with a Green conscious and even more to provide contacts for others to follow.Coatlesshttps://www.blogger.com/profile/06202458933343469368noreply@blogger.comtag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7196059482061221339.post-65364399131192262062018-11-26T06:37:05.533+00:002018-11-26T06:37:05.533+00:00The Greens'success in Altrincham has less to d...The Greens'success in Altrincham has less to do with any \"comfy persons luxury\" and more to do with a well organised and committed group of people, working bloody hard in their community. Greens were also elected in the Labour strongholds of Prescot, Birkenhead and Burnley. <br />The Councillor who introduced the commitment to becoming zero carbon by 2030 was is from a ward that was almost lost to the Greens in May.

Their impact in pr...LDC's are great in theory . Their impact in practice is limited heavily by Westminster funding in the UK. Manchester has recently stated commitment to some wonderful policies most of which are undermined by abysmal levels of government funding and further by a dreadful lack of autonomy . Practically every meaningful attempt to 'green' my home city is beyond the remit of local people , councils and MP's . Transport , housing, education, health , social services , infrastructure , taxation , housing benefit levels - are all determined by an antagonistic Tory ideology. All of these factor into not only the plausibility of change on an administrative level but also on a very personal level vis a vis priorities : survival, shelter, food and income . The only Green councillors are in the leafy, wealthy part of my borough of Trafford . My guess is that those that have successfully attained a comfortable level of personal living have the time and inclination to think about global issues - the rest are either protecting their wealthy privilege or concerned about how to change a system that leaves them insecure and lacking any prospects . For many years I supported the LibDems ( only for the promise of PR ) so I'm aware of the stigma attached to a party that is neither hard left or hard right and how hard it is to stand apart from tribal , ingrained political views . In my opinion the Greens need to take a position that is opposed to neoliberal ideology ( which is vehemently against anything but growth and profit - end of story ) and place itself as firmly on the side of : people , planet , ecology, justice ; and against unfettered, unregulated corporate avarice however that may manifest . At present that is clearly NOT the perception or place that Greens hold in the UK - they are a comfy person's luxury , not a poor person's saviour; a country folk's dream and an urban irrelevance. A group in Trafford ( Breathe Clean Air Group) do sterling work ; many other small groups work on a similar fringe way and badly need the exposure that a political party could ( with will ) promote as frontline policies to the wider public & parliaments. mark gibsonhttps://www.blogger.com/profile/15360852797774641416noreply@blogger.comtag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7196059482061221339.post-26898300789076464672018-11-04T11:21:39.238+00:002018-11-04T11:21:39.238+00:00I agree with you Andrew.

From school transport, library services, dog wardens, home care,\nroad maintenance and a whole range of other services provided by local\nauthorities government funding is being reduced.\nCuts to the police service already mean\nthat there are 5,000 fewer police officers available to answer 999 calls than\nwhen this government came to power, with more cuts to follow.\nChanges proposed for the legal aid system\nmean that no help will be available for medical negligence or domestic violence\nclaims. Or to fight the withdrawal of benefits or refusal of invalidity claims\n(which currently have an appeal success rate of 70%)\nMany people wrongly believe that the\nsweeping changes to the welfare benefit system in place already or shortly to\nbecome law, will only affect the unemployed.\nWhile the cuts will affect those seeking\nwork, they will also affect people with severe medical conditions who will find\nit harder to qualify for invalidity benefit. It will also affect those on low\nincomes that receive help with their rents, as well as\nthose receiving council tax discounts and exemptions.\n·\nFrom April 2013, national\ncouncil tax benefits will be abolished and replaced with a raft of local schemes.\n·\nThe age at which single people\nwill only be allowed housing benefit for shared accommodation is to be raised\nfrom 25 to 35.\n·\nWorking tax credit will now\nonly be available for people working a minimum of 24 hours a week rather than\n16.\n·\nUnder occupancy rules mean that\nHousing Benefit will not be paid towards bedrooms deemed to be unneeded. (A son or daughter at University will be\nclassed as living there, rather than at their parents address, and same sex\nchildren of any age will be expected to share a bedroom.\n·\nHousing Benefit for rented\naccommodation will be capped at the bottom 30% of the market rate and any extra\nwill have to be found by the claimant.\nIt is unlikely that any resident will be\nimmune from the cuts, either personally or through the experiences of family or\nfriends.

This was the fulfilment of the successful Green Party motion to have meetings webcast that was passed well over a year ago. With actual attendance usually around the less than 20 mark this was a real step forward in engagement with its citizens.\nSo what did the citizens of Kirklees make of all this? Well one friend texted me to say,\n“All u do is bicker! It’s ace. If you were kids you’d have got your arses slapped”\nSo there is entertainment value at least! But what the public got was the authentic council experience. The test will be if the public view this and recoil in horror at how they are governed or regard it as robust political debate. It will be worth checking out the Huddersfield Examiner Website Forum pages for comment. That is usually a good (if not necessarily representative) source for vented spleens. Ultimately if we see a backlash we might see a change in approach in the Council and a bit less nonsense (from the Tories usually)\nFor my part I did some, but not much commentary, via twitter.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2012_11_book-review-huddersfield-official_html/content_89.html": "My eldest son is doing\nhis Duke of Edinburgh voluntary service in the Oxfam Bookshop in\nHolmfirth. I went to pick him up a few\nweeks ago and spotted a book with a plain blue cover with the embossed words\n‘Huddersfield – Official Handbook’. I had a scan\nthrough it and saw it was produced by Huddersfield Borough Council and on the\ninside cover was written “With the compliments of , Mayor\nof Huddersfield, 1960-61, Alderman Norman Day ”. I bought it on the spot for £39 but even a scan\nthrough told me it was a real find. It was published as the modern age was\nbeginning and the second world war was still a fairly recent memory for most\npeople. It was a very different place and every now and again someone of\ncertain age will say wistfully to me “why can’t we go back to the old\nHuddersfield Borough Council”. Well what I had purchased was a snapshot (as\nopposed to a moving picture) of that 'Nirvana'.\n.\nHuddersfield - Official Handbook' is a treasure trove\nfor Council geeks and particularly a Huddersfield Councillor. Inside there is a\nfairly detailed history of the Huddersfield area from pre-history to the\npresent day. There are maps showing the Huddersfield area and Town Centre prior\nto the ring road going in (it was being planned at the time). There are pages\nof information about the Huddersfield Borough Council and the\nservices they provided. Some things are different but much is the same. There\nare photographs of the recently completed Salendine Nook Secondary School\nlooking pristine before it deteriorated in the 70s when I attended and the\nconcrete started falling away from the metal window frames.\nWhat I found\nparticularly fascinating was all the adverts in it. Some from companies that\nsurvive to this day, some that I can remember and others that by most people are\nlong forgotten from over half a century ago. There are adverts about how to get\nyourself set up with gas heating and smokeless coal to comply with the Clean\nAir Act and where you can purchase radios with the new fangled stereo or ‘3D\nsound’. There is a photo of an unnamed Huddersfield’s oldest resident of 103.\nThis chap is sitting there with a smile looking healthy and hearty with a pint\nof bitter and holding his pipe and he must first have been born in Huddersfield\nI guess around the 1858 mark. There is a large section on the manufacturing and\ntextile industry of Huddersfield and interestingly it is also translated into\nGerman and French. I guess this was to stimulate trade with that place called\nEurope across the sea. There are the names and addresses of all the Councillors\nand key figures from the time most of whom I never knew or met with the odd\nexception such as Tom Cliffe who was a Councillor I came across in the distant\npast.\nYou really get a sense\nlooking through this time capsule of Huddersfield of the span of years and how it\ncontinues and has its own life beyond that of the lifetime of those of us who\nreside within it. We all experience change in the local environment around us\nand sometimes its for the better and sometimes definitely not. My own personal bug bear is how the Burns\nTavern with its long wooden bar got demolished to become Burger King.\n‘Huddersfield – Official Handbook’ is now a prized possession and it would be interesting to do something\nsimilar for someone else to discover 50 years hence. Things are however so very\ndifferent. The information in this book is probably not stored or accessed\neasily anywhere digitally. A lot of the same information today could be source\nfrom a number of websites. Huddersfield as an administrative area is gone and we\nhave the not very much loved Kirklees Council so the point of doing it might be\nlost. We can’t recreate the past nor should we attempt to do so. Like those\nbefore us we just have to do our best to make a better future and much as I\nenjoy having a ‘proper gander’ at ‘Huddersfield – Official Handbook’ it is in its own\nway propaganda showing our town 52 years ago in the best possible light. Still\nabsolutely fascinating all the same.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Greens had always made appropriate donations at the meal to the Mayors Charity but we know that it was usually a significant proportion of the total for the evening, from our one table. Last years Mayoral Dinner, though to be paid for, was well attended and we had a good group from Kirkburton Parish Council who attended and filled a table. There was however a 'principled' boycott by incoming Deputy Mayor Councillor Ken Smith who didn't see why Councillors should have to put their hands in their pockets and off he and some colleagues went to have a curry elsewhere. Now Ken is up for Mayor he has used his Mayors privilege and reverted to the freebie meal again. So next Wednesday, when Ken and his consort Ex Kirkburton Conservative Councillor Christine Smith, are tucking into their chicken, Green Party and Valley Independent Councillors will be at Bar Maroc (the old Long Island Bar) having San Miguel Lager and eating their delicious vegetarian pizzas, at our own cost.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

This agreement runs out next year but households are already seeing the consequences of this as the cost of their renewal premiums drops through their letterbox. One householder in Runnymede was quoted £10,000 for their home insurance due to flood risk. So what can be done to address this problem? In the short term we need to do all we can to reduce the impact of flood and heavy rain events though strategically placed resevoirs, sustainable urban drainage systems and putting measures in place which reduce damage to homes at risk of flooding through flood secure doors and higher electrical sockets. It almost goes without saying that we need to take ongoing urgent action to reduce our carbon emissions but the issue of insuring homes remains.\nLast week, as Chair of the Local Government Associations Inland Flood Risk Working Group I facilitated a meeting last week between DEFRA, the Association of British Insurers and Councillors from around the country who had been badly affected by flood events. The ABI's proposal to government is called 'Flood RE' where government will underwrite the cost of insurance for major flood events. It is estimated that the cost to government could be around £100- £200 million per annum. It is based on a similar agreement between Government and the ABI called ' Pool RE'. 'Pool RE' is nothing to do with pools of water, or Religious Education come to that, but is how the government helps the insurance industry insure property against the risks of terrorism events. Basically Flood RE is a guarantee by government that they will step in if flood events occur and help with cost. I've asked to see the details of 'ABI's 'Flood RE' proposal so the the Local Government Association can comment and if happy with it lend its support to the document.It seems a good principle for government to 'underwrite' the risk to the people they represent who find themselves in dire unaffordable circumstances due to no fault of their own. DEFRA is due to report back in 'Spring' this year. Admittedly I don't feel Spring has really sprung yet but we should know something shortly I guess.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2013_01_blue-hotel_html/content_1306.html": "| The George Hotel |\nJust before Christmas I went with a couple of work colleagues from out of town to 'The Head of Steam' for lunch. It was heaving and there was no way we were going to be able to get a meal so we went across St George's Square to 'The George Hotel'. We went through the deserted lobby into the deserted bar. It was properly deserted with no staff behind the bar and we had to go hunting around the building to get some service. The meal was OK but there was no draught lager or bitter behind the bar so we had Guinness. Things were clearly on the slide. The George was moving from the faded grandeur stage into just plain tatty with poor service. Now it has sadly gone into administration with it sole occupant being a security guard.\nFor years The George had things pretty much their own way with very few hotel options for people visiting the area that could be regarded as vaguely upmarket. There was the business rates dodging 'Huddersfield Hotel 'at the bottom end of town opposite the former pole dancing club and empty former Bingo Hall. Then more recently we have had both a Premier Inn and a Travelodge come to Huddersfield within a stones throw of the town centre. These modern budget hotels are part of a national chain were bound to draw trade away from places like 'The George'.\nIt is ironic that in recent years the Council has invested considerable funds into St George's Square, the Chinese granite and new fountains (one looking like a urinal), the Festival of Light and Food and Drink Festivals. None of this investment has been enough to help save the Hotel from its fate. It feels like watching someone dying of thirst next to a spring of fresh water (or a fountain). Apparently during the Food and Drink Festival 'The George' was fairly empty unable to capitalise on the tpotential trade on its doorstep. It all smacks of poor management and a disengagement from the town and the opportunities that presented themselves.\nSo what's the future for 'The George'? It could get another owner to limp along in the same old fashion . Inevitably a year or two down line they will probably be in the same position. 'The George' needs a vision. It can't be a budget hotel as the competition is too great, it needs to go upmarket a bit and that will need investment to give the place a significant facelift. It will need to re-engage with the town and have a high profile Hotel Manager with strong marketing skills to draw on. 'The George' has a lot going for it, history, character, the birthplace of Rugby League in 1895 and more recently Yorkshire and Humber Microgeneration Partnership (OK only me and a few others know or care about the latter). So I and the town in general will watch with interest to see what happens next. In the meantime here's 'Blue Hotel' by Chris Isaak who is a great live act if you get chance to see him.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Again!\nGordon Brown is (we are told) going to put us out of his misery tomorrow and call an election. We know it must be on the cards because he's running out of time anyway and he's really being practicing 'that smile'.\nWhat can we predict over the next few weeks. Lots of muscle flexing over who's toughest on dealing with the deficit is a sure thing but of course tough in a 'responsible' fashion. The truth is that a double dip recession is already in the pipeline. Hundreds of thousands of public sector jobs are certain to go within the next 2 years. This goes way beyond the efficiency savings we would all like to see in Councils and the Health Service. The loss of these incomes will impact on the spending power of many households and have a knock on effect on the economy as a whole. Have political parties not learnt anything about how you come out of recessions e.g Keynesian economics? the New Deal?\nIn their desire to appear 'tough' things could get very tough indeed. What we are experiencing now is the logical conclusion of policies started by the Conservatives in the 80s and embraced by New Labour. The lack of financial regulation got us into this mess and now we are going back to the regressive public finance constraints of the Eighties.\nInstead of the Labour's rather barmy idea of comparing David Cameron to a politically incorrect but popular figure (Gene Hunt - Ashes to Ashes) they would have been much better comparing him to a vacuous american getting into a De Lorean that flies!

The evidence is plentiful. The debacle over the Council breaking it's promise to host the National Rugby League Museum in The George Hotel, the A629 road widening project which will see the felling of 126 trees on an iconic entrance way to Huddersfield, Labour Councillors backing the building of a modern hotel on Castle Hill, the site of an Iron Age hill fort and the Leader of the Council proclaiming he had encouraged the environmentally disastrous Amazon Warehouse development near Cleckheaton then denying later he had any view on the planning application. Leadership on Kirklees Council has been sadly lacking and the Labour Group seem unable or unwilling to address the problem.\nOn Climate Change, Labour in Kirklees are a pretty average Council but talk as if they are national leaders. They just aren't. Climate Emergency UK who independently assess councils responses to Climate Change gave Kirklees a humiliating 0% due to their lack of a Climate Action Plan to address the problem. This was confirmed this week when a report by the University of Leeds identified the lack of a Climate Action Plan. As the report is published on the Council's website and has the support of the Kirklees Climate Commission it is pretty clear it's accepted by Kirklees. The fact is that many other Councils have got Climate Action Plans and have done much more than Kirklees on Climate Change.\nThe Labour Administration of course wouldn't accept they are poor and would point to some of their activity which you will find on the Kirklees Website. One such example is the pilot project retrofitting 8 council properties on Abbey Road in Fartown. Labour Cabinet members trooped up there for a photocall with Labour Leader Keir Starmer. It looks like some good work has been carried out there but it is a one off pilot project with no plan to be replicated and no funds to do it again. In the Green Group Budget Amendment we proposed using the Energiesprong approach used by among others Nottingham City Council. With no funding coming from central Govt this offered a self funding and economically sustainable model. Labour rejected it. There are other examples 6 years on from the All Party Passivhaus report that recommended making the Passivhaus Standard the norm for Kirklees new build housing projects, Labour are finally doing a 6 house pilot project. We have no idea really what will be learned from the pilot that can't be gleaned from just asking more forward thinking Councils like Exeter City Council that started on the Passivhaus approach 15 years ago. It is another example of timidity and tokenism when we need real leadership.\nSo the possibility of a Labour Council with a majority doesn't exactly fill me with hope and joy just potential disappointment. Don't get me wrong there are plenty of good people in the Labour Party and I would much rather have a Labour Party that I could work with than what we have in Kirklees at present. So on May 5th vote Green, elect more Green Councillors and let's play our proper part in tackling climate change and the cost of living crisis.\nWell said Cllr. Cooper. Housing is a crucial issue for all of us - if we don't get well insulated housing to Passivhaus standard as an everyday standard for all our houses, nobody is going to be able to pay their heating bills, and that is from now. For that reason alone, the government should be funding councils all over the UK to make insulation schemes available. A pilot project of 6 houses will not go very far towards solving the problems of people or the planet we live on.\nReplyDelete",

By not allowing people their right to peacefully protest North Yorks Police unequivocally put themselves on the side of Third Energy and against the right for people to legally demonstrate their opposition. Instead people were effectively 'kettled' and risked arrest if they moved outside the police cordon. Police on the ground appeared to be ready to facilitate the request but were overruled by their remote commanders demonstrating their poor leadership. Not their finest hour but sadly not their worst either at KM. They have effectively 'upped the temperature' by taking a draconian approach that overtly favours the Fracking company.\n| 'Tea Lady' Jackie Brookes on the left with frien |\nThe cost of policing at the Fracking site at Preston New Road in Lancashire has been estimated at £450'000/month. With the heavy and excessive police presence we saw today then we would expect a similar figure for Kirby Misperton. There are enough reasons to oppose Fracking in its own right, but now we have the waste of millions of pounds of police resources protecting corporate interests that threaten our environment and our communities as well.\nThe Kirby Misperton site is expected to commence Fracking within days and is the frontline in the battle against corporate greed, climate change and threats to our fundamental liberties. People of goodwill need to act and get themselves up to Kirby Misperton as soon as possible and as often as possible.\n| With Carolyn Popple, one of the Core Group of No Fracking Way walkers from March this year |\n| Outside the entrance to the Fracking site |\nyou get a good idea from watching the footage on face book that the police don,t care about human rights or the fact their dealing with none violent none criminal people who just happen to care about the future of the world we all live in unlike the greedy corrupt system we call a Conservative government that could even risk the water supply that so many people depend on a Tory vote is a pro fracking vote don,t forget that at the next election.\nReplyDeleteWell done and good luck Andrew.\nReplyDeleteThank you for this report, good to see that the Police's facilitation of the gas company is getting out. May I make a small correction though. Jackie wasn't arrested, she was kettled, surrounded and intimidated by Police \"for her own safety\" as a pallet tower (which was very stable) was suggested to be dangerous (utter rubbish!) It was horrific to see our lovely Jackie in such a situation but she's a stoic lady and wasn't moving readily for the bullies!\nReplyDeleteWe know the police don't care. Look back at the miners strike. Take care people. The policeman is your friend, unless ordered not to be by their superiors, who are never around.\nReplyDeleteI'm astonished that you think the police scored an own goal. They were right in this instance.\nReplyDeleteYou'll know that the law requires the organisers of a moving protest to give written notice to the police. I don't know what the notice period is in North Yorkshire, but around 6 days notice is the norm. Yes, it's bureaucratic and frustrating but it's the law.\nA little slow march would come under the heading of a moving protest. Officers had organised numbers to police a static protest, not a march.\nWithout giving written notice, the slow marchers commit public order offences and their \"peaceful protest\" is unlawful (so no longer 'peaceful'). The police commander on the spot is not in a position to help protesters break the law by saying: \"Oh alright then. You're such nice people and its only a little slow march, so I'll say 'yes', but don't tell anyone that I made an exception of you!\".\nWhen celebrities and public figures make guest appearances at demos, protesters are tempted to put on a show, like a slow march, for their and social media's benefit. When the police say No to facilitating an impromptu demo or anything other than a static demonstration, they get criticised for not playing ball. They are called uncaring, heavy handed and brutal even. A balanced view might take into account that (a) they had to say NO, and (b) that local people and other Tax-payers might prefer to have officers back in their communities rather than facilitating protesters' youtube videos and facebook selfies.\nWhen the police become the target of resentment and frustration, rather than the ministers of state that granted the fracking licence, then I fear that activists, supporters and well-wishers are in danger of taking their eye off the ball.",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2020_11_green-councillors-call-on-secretary-of_html/content_267.html": "We the undersigned councillors request that you call in Application 2018/93591 that was passed by Kirklees MBC on the 28th October 2020 and we wish to support the call in by Huddersfield Civic Society.\nCastle Hill is a significant landmark of special merit in Kirklees, the whole monument and its surrounds are a scheduled ancient monument sited in the Green Belt. The site is visible for miles around and is an iconic landmark of national importance and any development here would have a detrimental visual impact.\nWe support Historic England’s recognition that this hilltop fort is a rare and important asset of local, regional and national importance.\nThe majority of the community, who submitted comments were against the proposal and we as councillors instantly had emails and calls from residents questioning how and why the application was approved given the evidence provided. However, this was not reflected in the verbal submission by the officer and the report, while acknowledging the responses, somehow chose to focus on the few that met the recommendation’s view.\nThe Council and the Strategic Planning Committee (SPC) needs to be impartial when it comes to such highly sensitive applications that will affect the community for decades to come. This unfortunately didn’t appear to happen with one of the Councillors on the SPC reading from a prepared script (visible on the Teams virtual meeting and another stating that she was speaking for the silent majority who might want a development on Castle Hill. Where was the evidence for such a statement and what happened to SPC members being impartial when making decisions?\nWe believe the granting of the application fails to fulfil the requirements to allow the application to proceed.\nThis is an application to build a commercial restaurant/café/bar with six guest bedrooms in the middle of Green Belt within the curtilage of the Scheduled Ancient Monument and adjacent to a grade II listed building (Victoria Tower).\nWe believe the Kirklees planning process was flawed and the evidence fails the test of Green Belt and Heritage protection.\nThe document that was presented to the SPC (ref. 2018/93591) demonstrated there was clearly no robust evidence to support the approval and opinions given in support of approval of the application were thin and not evidenced.\nThe same document also demonstrated there was a) significant opposition to the application and b) could not demonstrate how the evidence supported an approval.\nThere are a number of concerns we have about the processes and procedures the planning team and Strategic Planning Committee carried out.\nWe aware of the Huddersfield Civic Society’s objections and concur with their evaluations.\nOur main concerns are as follows:\nNPPF Green Belt\nThis site is in Green Belt and the benefits proposed by the applicant have not been quantified or proven and as such, claims by the planning department in the Council that ‘very special circumstances’ (NPPF cl 1..) have been met and properly evidenced to make such claims.\nThe Council planning department are ignoring the Council Local Plan Policy requirements without clear and robust evidence of why such activities can be ignored. This particularly comes to the fore with Local Plan LP13 and LP16 which require a sequential test of any town centre uses outside of the defined centre boundaries. There was no evidence that such tests had been carried out and this was admitted in the officer’s verbal summary to the SPC. In SPC Agenda pack of the 28/10/2020 item 9 page 61 paragraph 10.15 confirms that LP13 and LP16 requirements to carry out sequential tests and an impact assessment were not carried out. Again what is the evidence that these requirements were unnecessary? Given the town centre and rural communities are already suffering economic harm from COVID-19, we can’t understand how such a test, had it been carried out, would have met such a test as to allow a town centre development at the heart of the site. There are already amenities in the town centre and rural communities offered in the application under-utilized, so how does this outweigh the harm caused in Green Belt.\nThe evidence submitted by the applicant was generic with little detail to make judgements against. The Council report clearly demonstrates that the NPPF conditions for very special circumstances had not been demonstrated and yet the officers highlighted a few selective clauses and statements to reinforce a predetermined recommendation to approve the application of an inappropriate development in the Green Belt.\nParagraph 145 of the NPPF states that the construction of new buildings is inappropriate in the Green Belt, and paragraph 143 states that inappropriate development is, by definition, harmful to the Green Belt and should not be approved except in ‘very special circumstances’. We do not believe that allowing the public limited access to use the toilets within a commercial venture meets this criteria.\nHeritage\nHistoric England as we understand maintain an objection to allowing construction on Castle Hill which will substantially harm a heritage asset of national importance. The size and nature of the proposed development makes clear that servicing heritage visitors is not its primary function.\nIn addition to the above issues raised re the Green Belt we would highlight similar serious concerns with regards to NPPF clauses 193, 194 and 196 which we believe have not shown the benefits outweighing the serious harm.\nKirklees Processes and Procedures\nWe believe that the written report determines that application should be rejected, however, a few statements made were selected to carry more weight than the evidence provides. The recommendation, in our view, flies in the face of the evidence.\nThe processes and procedures within the planning system appear to be biased towards accepting a recommendation that is not evidenced adequately. For instance, it was stated that this is a new application and yet it is an existing application, which has not been approved in the past and yet, with little additional information (except a new design, with even more impact on the heritage) has now been approved.\nThree of the SPC members recognised and stated that there was insufficient evidence to make a planning decision on and yet the recommendation and subsequent vote was to approve the application, without any consideration of the consequences of failure of such a business on the site. To date there has been no business plan submitted that we are aware of.\nThe reliance on planning conditions being set after approval for such a significant site demonstrates to our minds that the applicant’s documentation has not covered all the bases prior to approval. Significant issues such as drainage, transport and security issues, that all could have a detrimental effect on the public benefit are being left until after the approval is given and s106 conditions if not robust and fully fulfilled will leave the site in a significantly poor/damaged state.\nIt would appear that SPC members were coming to the meeting as if the decision had already been made, particularly evidenced with pre-written statements that were read out.\nThe information verbally summarising the report were heavily biased to the recommendation to the point that consultees views that were not in favour of approval were effectively ignored and a few that appeared favourable were given more weight.\nIn conclusion we believe the recommendation to approve this development flies in the face of the evidence or lack thereof and the strong public interest warrant the close examination and inspection of this application.\nYours sincerely\nCllr.

You knew exactly what you were getting with David. No\ndouble dealing, just straightforward and honest. Sure sometimes he’d get things\nwrong, he would do things I didn’t agree with, but you could trust him and trust\ncan be a rare and precious commodity especially in the world of politics. I\nwish him a speedy recovery.\nNow to today and we are offered a new Leader of the Council\nand as a hung Council it needs to be someone who can secure the trust, support\nor acquiescence of at least one other Political Group on this Council. I have\nto say to you today that Councillor Pandor will not have that support from\nCouncillors in the Green Party and Independent Group. Trust is vital in the role\nof a Leader. Trust in their ability and trust in what they say. We understand\nthat the Labour Group were told by their new Leader some days ago that our\nsupport for his administration had been secured. It had not. If a Leader cannot\ntell the truth to their own political colleagues, no matter how unpalatable\nthat might be, then how can he be trusted with the Leadership of this Council?\nThis bid to lead Kirklees Council is not built on\nprinciples, policies or a programme. It is a bid constructed of personal\nambition, fuelled by promises and secured by patronage. It cannot stand. It\ncannot be supported.\nKirklees Council is on the edge of a precipice, our budgets\nare declining and the longer we leave the administration in this chaos, the\nharder it will be for any administration to fix. We have a Draft Local Plan\nthat, if delayed, could leave our communities at the mercy of developers. Labour Members as the largest group on this\nCouncil have a special responsibility to recognise the reality of this crisis,\nto heal your internal wounds quickly, hard though I know that is, and to come\nback with an answer that unites not just your own Party but that of the Council\nas a whole. If you don’t then it is not just this Council as a body that you\nwill be letting down but all the communities of Kirklees.\nI say directly to Labour Members and particularly to those\nwho may have supported Cllr Pandor that he cannot lead this Council. Your\nloyalty to your Leader has been demonstrated by you putting him forward today\nas your Groups nominee to lead our Council. If he does not succeed in that, then\nthat reality has changed, all bets are off. The Labour Party will need to come\nup with a new solution and quickly. We will help you where we can to secure a\nstable administration. It is the responsibility of every Kirklees Councillor of\nwhatever Party today to help achieve that.\nThis is no 'Game of Thrones'. This is 'Game Over'.\nThis is no 'Game of Thrones'. This is 'Game Over'.",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2013_10_press-release-fracking-under-spotlight_html/content_666.html": "A public meeting on ‘Fracking and the clean energy alternative’ will take place in Huddersfield next week. The Green Party event will include speakers from Friends of the Earth and No Dash for Gas as well as Kirklees councillor and Energy spokesperson, Andrew Cooper. The meeting that will be chaired by Councillor Julie Stewart-Turner, will be held at 7pm on Thursday 10th October at Huddersfield Town Hall. The meeting will be an opportunity for members of the public to find out more about the dangers that fracking poses to the environment and dispel some of the misconceptions about its potential impact on energy prices and security. It follows a summer of protest in Balcombe over this unconventional fossil fuel. In the past month high profile figures such as the economist Lord Stern and the ex-Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir David King have expressed concerns about fracking. Sir David King has spoken out about the ‘enormous environmental consequences’ of developing fracking while Lord Stern spoke of the ‘baseless economics’ of the government’s claim that it will reduce energy prices. Fracking will not provide a reduction in energy prices as we have seen in the United States. The US is essentially an isolated market. By contrast, the UK is plugged into an integrated European market where gas is sold to the highest bidder, whether inside or outside the UK. Experts say that even a huge increase in the amount of domestic gas the UK produces would be likely to dent the wholesale gas price. Nor is it clear that it is a ‘green fuel’. Studies have shown that fracking can have a higher global warming impact than coal due to methane emissions. It is also likely that fracking will be a distraction from the primary task which is fully developing the green economy by investing fully in renewable energy and improving energy efficiency. In addition to greenhouse gas emissions, fracking causes environmental damage through water use and water pollution as well as geological disturbance. All are welcome at the meeting to express their views and provide questions for the panel about this important issue about the UK’s energy future\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2009_10_solar-energy-in-huddersfield_html/content_635.html": "Huddersfield is a great place but I think you would be hard pressed to find anyone who would regard it as the solar energy capital of the UK. Yet it undoubtably is.\nThe first solar panels were for water heating and were installed in Council Housing in Kirklees on Tolson Crescent in Dalton in 1995. 8 properties were helped but in retrospect it was a poorly conceived project and I was responsible. 6 of the properties were flats with pensioners living in them with very low hot demand and as the Estate Management Officer at the time I sourced funding from Kirklees Environment Unit to get them installed. Half the Councillors in Kirklees at the time traipsed through the tenants houses feeling their sun sourced hot water. Another 7 properties were installed the following year at St John's Avenue in Newsome (pictured) as Labour's attempt to show there was no need to vote Green. As I remember I was specifically not required for the photocall on that occasion. Though I was the project manager I was also the Green Party's Campaign Organiser and that didn't endear me to the Labour administration of the time.\nThere followed a bit of a lull until 2000 when we established the Renewable Energy Fund and since then it has been project after project. In Newsome Ward alone we have a multitude of projects including Primrose Hill Solar village, around 120 properties with solar PV and some solar thermal, Castle Grange Residential Home with 10kWp of solar PV, the new Hillside School with a range of renewables, Croftlands with 30 or so properties with PV, Civic Centre 3 with 18kWp on the roof, Lowerhouses Junior and Infants also has a small pv system and not forgetting our solar street lights on Edale Avenue. With the RE-Charge scheme that we established for private householders taking off we have another 15 or so PV systems going in soon along with PV going in on the Edale Avenue sheltered block.\nIt is all exciting stuff and with the Clean Energy Cashback coming in next year we should be in for another boost. I have proposed a £5 million project to use the new feed in tariff to fund the capital outlay of purchasing and installing the photovoltaic panels. This will effectively mean we will be able to install as many solar panels on Council buildings as we like for free with no impact on the Council Tax. All we need now if for Government not too muck up the legislation and we will be fine. I also have to think of a name for the scheme. Ideas welcome.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

With 3 Councillors in each ward each having a 4 year term this gives one year in 4 without an election. In the Counties we do have elections but not in Metropolitan Districts like Kirklees. There is however 1 election posterboard up on a lamp column in Kirklees. It is a Labour poster on Colne Road which has now been there for 1 year. I guess they must have forgotten all about it when the Labour campaign left the Newsome Ward after the last local elections and this one got left behind. It is not an unusual phenomonen for Labour to leave a board or 2 behind and I tend to refer to these as\nZombie posterboards as they continue to stalk the area long past their lifetime but this one is certainly one with long life.

Green Party Energy Spokesperson Councillor Andrew Cooper who will be attending in Marrakech has called for all fossil fuel subsidies to be phased out globally over the next 3 year to help acheive those targets. Councillor Cooper is part of the EU Committee of the Regions delegation that is representing the position of Local, Regional and Devolved Governments from across the European Union.\n\" This huge subsidy puts into context the recent $1 Billion Low Carbon Fund offered by Big Oil and Gas companies. This fund represents a very small drop in an ocean of oil money supported by huge subsidy from Governments around the world. We should be clear that this is no where near enough to mitigate the damage their industry inflicts on out environment on a daily basis\"\nCllr Cooper called for those subsidies to reinvested into positive actions that help combat climate change\n\"Imagine if the amount of subsidy to the fossil fuel sector was instead invested in large scale energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes to fund the transition to a low carbon economy.\"\n\"We need a quick end to all fossil fuel subsidies. Direct subsidies should be stopped. Other subsidies should be removed by imposing carbon taxes sufficient to pay for the damage caused by burning fossil fuels. The needs to avoid major economic disruption and to protect the poor mean that this cannot happen overnight but it must happen quickly and to an agreed timetable. The poor and those on low incomes should be protected against price increases and be the first to benefit from renewable technologies and energy efficiency measures i.e. solar panels and insulation measures to homes,\nFor this proposal to be successful we need each\ncountry to create and publish a subsidy phase out plan within 9 months for\ndiscussion at the next Climate Summit, COP23.\nIt is going to be interesting is to see how the UK Government representatives in Marrakech justify their current policy decisions which fly in the face of the scientific evidence. This year has seen £1 Billion in tax breaks for oil and gas companies in the North Sea, planning and financial incentives for shale gas companies, cuts in support for renewable energy and energy efficiency and the bizarre and wrong headed proposal for a third runway at Heathrow Airport. The UK Government is fast reclaiming our former title of 'The Dirty Man of Europe'. We need to see some rapid acceptance from Prime Minister May that we need less warm words on Climate Change from her Government and more properly insulated warm homes powered by renewable energy.\"\nIt is going to be interesting is to see how the UK Government representatives in Marrakech justify their current policy decisions which fly in the face of the scientific evidence.

It was the fact that the sport originated from a meeting in The George Hotel in 1895 that was the clincher. At the opening representatives from the Council and Rugby League Cares held a press conference. The Leader of the Council Shabir Pandor said,\n\"This is absolutely fantastic news and we’re really excited to get started and bring Rugby League home\"\n“It is so much more than a building to local people and to Rugby League fans across the world. This is where it all began for Rugby League and there is no better place to create a museum that celebrates and remembers the history of the game.”\nNews broke last month that Kirklees was to renege on it's promise to have the Rugby League museum in the hotel. This has provoked much anger by Rugby League fans around the world as the Council had used The George Hotel to secure the Museum and also some external funding. The Council now says that the business case just doesn't stack up and so it would be now sited in the 'Cultural Heart' of the town that is being developed as part of the Huddersfield Blueprint. At Wednesday's Council meeting, in response to a question I asked on the proposals, West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin let slip that the Council was proposing to put the Museum in what is currently the Huddersfield Library and Art Gallery on the other side of town from 'The George'. As someone who is elected to represent the ward that includes the Town Centre finding out this way, by accident was to say the least annoying.\nWhen the Council said it was buying The George Hotel I was very supportive but at the time I asked to see what the Business Plan was going to look like and kept asking. More recently Conservative Councillors have also been asking about the Business Plans. Now we are told the numbers for including a Rugby League Museum in The George don't stack up, but still we haven't seen the papers that demonstrate this. As a local Councillor I'm just asked to trust the judgement of officers with no detail, no business case, no options to weigh up. It is all deeply disappointing and the big question is how did we end up in a position where the Council made such a firm and public commitment and a partnership with the Rugby League and then had to make such an embarrassing climbdown? As someone who is elected to represent the Council I would really like to know the answer to that question.\nA bit of nostalgia now. Here's the joint Kirklees/Rugby League event announcing the Museum last year.",

We have seen some progress in recent years with Metro and First reintroducing services on Boxing Day on many routes, but unfortunately not all. There is a lot of talk these days about a ‘big society’ and about volunteers running services. This is an example of where we have been doing exactly that long before the words ‘Big Society’ were ever used. Our aim has never been to replace existing bus services but to encourage bus companies to reintroduce regular services during holiday periods”\nThe Newsome Bus Service starts at 11.00a.m and runs for 8 hours allowing people to go to Town do their shopping, visit friends and loved ones in Huddersfield Royal Infirmary or just to simply to go for a festive pint in the Town Centre.\nThe Greens ran a Bus Service on Boxing Day this year linking Flockton and Grange Moor with Huddersfield. Kirkburton Green Party Councillor Derek Hardcastle who drove the bus said,\n“It was a huge success and we had over 70 people use the service to visit relatives. People were really enthusiastic about it and it allowed people who don’t have access to a car and can’t afford Taxis to get out of the house.

As you\nwould expect it is a mixture of good and less good and areas for improvement.\nThat is the point of the exercise. There’s praise in the report for the Chief\nExecutive and the Council Leader and recognition for the ambition in the\nHuddersfield Blueprint. There are also observations and suggestions for changes.\nOne of the most perplexing statements in the report for me\nwas this one,\n“ The Cabinet and senior leadership team work well together,\nhowever sharper delineation of roles between Cabinet Members and senior\nofficers needs to be articulated as there is some confusion between the roles\nof Members and officers. Members should develop policy and officers should\nimplement and deliver it.”\nTalk about stating the rather obvious! What could have\nprompted such a statement. Perhaps things like when senior officers do the media and TV\ninterviews particularly when there is bad news. It also indicates to some\ndegree that there is a lack of political direction in the cabinet or parts of\nthe cabinet. This is worrying. People go to a lot of trouble to get elected So if and when they are and they don't have an agenda and are simply officer lead it is disappointing and a waste of peoples valuable votes.\nThe action to address this point that the Council has decided to take makes no reference to the Cabinet at all and instead defaults to addressing the relations between all members and officers. This is wilfully and conveniently misinterpreting the recommendation from the Peer Review Team.\nAnother part of the report states that\n\"The business community is keen to work with the Council and its voice needs to be strengthened as currently they feel outside the tent.\"\nI guess this may reflect the poor communication that many indoor market traders feel they have had regarding their future in the Huddersfield Blueprint. Or perhaps the creation of One Huddersfield and the excellent work they do is partly a reflection of the need for business to develop a stronger voice when dealing with the Council. Of course there is a danger that if you have a \"We know best\" approach you are by your very nature going to exclude all sorts of people, businesses, Councillors from other parties and anyone who disagrees with you. Maybe the statement in the Report that says there is a\n\"outmoded paternelistic approach which the peer team heard still exists in some parts of the organisation\"\nis a big part of the problem and if that is reflected in some Senior Politicians then that is a cause for concern and stands in the way of us being a modern forward thinking Council that is open not only for business but for fresh ideas and approaches.\nThe Peer Report also asked us to review our electoral arrangements\n\"Consider reviewing the electoral cycle to bring it in line with councils that have adopted a longer, more stable electoral pattern with the strong leadership model\".\nThe UK Government has a 5 year cycle (usually!) North Yorkshire County Council has 4 year electoral cycle, many Principal Councils have a 4 year electoral cycle, our Parish Councils have a 4 year electoral cycle but not us. I appreciate the arguments made about accountability to electors but former leaders and Chief Executives of this Council have identified the continual cycle of annual elections as a barrier to good and sometimes difficult decision making. I also think we will have better quality elections if we have them every 4 years. Parties will be able produce manifestoes that demonstrate a programme of activity that could seek radical and positive change. Timidity and risk averse decision making would be less likely. As the report says\n\"The peer team identified a lack of risk appetite in the Council, which could constrain the Council’s pace and ambition. A bolder approach to risk and opportunity is required throughout the organisation and existing governance processes should be strengthened to support this.”\nSo my suggestion would be that we establish as well as the Corporate Risk Register we already have a Corporate Opportunities Register where we systematically look at the opportunities that this Council could take to put up front to Councillors showing what we could do if we had the capacity and political will to do so.\nThe action to address this point that the Council has decided to take makes no reference to the Cabinet at all and instead defaults to addressing the relations between all members and officers.

In 6 minutes.\nWhat needs to change? In 6 minutes.\nThe short\npithy answer is of course lots and quickly. The IPCC Report told us that we have\nonly 12 years to get a grip on carbon emissions as if there wasn’t enough\nevidence already. What frustrates me is the lack of urgency from\npolicymakers on reducing emissions. It is like we have all the time in the\nworld and sadly we simply don’t. We are not treating this as the climateemergency that it clearly is.\nThe final\nstatement at COP24 in Katovice last December, which the UK Government signed up\nto, called for a much stronger relationship between national governments and\nLocal Government on achieving the Paris Climate goals. There now needs to be a\ngenuine and much deeper partnership between Local and National Government to\nwork together to reduce emissions. That simply isn’t there at the moment and we\nneed it. Used imaginatively Councils can be a swift and effective tool to deliver\nprogrammes to reduce emissions and engage citizens. We have Nationally Determined Contributions towards acheiving the Paris Climate goals why not Locally Determined Contributions or Regionally Determined Contributions.\nSo housing\nand specifically new build housing. In July Government told us that Councils\ncould set our own energy efficiency standards in our Local Plans for new\nhousing. That’s good and I am pushing for the Passivhaus Standard in\nSupplementary Planning Guidance to the Kirklees Local Plan. If Kirklees agrees\nit and government allows it and I\nsucceed then that will be one Local Authority out of hundreds. Why doesn’t\ngovernment just improve building regulations and actually properly enforce them\nwith an independent publicly managed Building Control system to ensure their quality of build and energy performance.\nRetrofit\nhousing. We all know that one of our biggest challenges is the existing housing\nstock and that we need to rapidly improve the energy efficiency of the existing\nhomes to reduce energy demand with all the health and income benefits that\nwould come with that. So we desperately need a mass retrofit programme. The\neasy stuff has largely been done in terms of loft and cavity wall insulation.\nIt is the solid wall properties with attic rooms that we need to address with\ninternal drylining, room in roof insulation and external cladding where\nappropriate and we need to aim for the Enerphit standard for retrofit. Yes it\nneeds paying for and a combination of ramping up the Energy Company Obligation\nand use of general taxation is what is required. We can spend countless billions\non HS2 and the expensive dangerous folly that is Hinckley C but wouldn’t it be\nbetter to invest those funds in a programme like this that would directly help\nmillions of people, with substantial additional benefits.\nWe need to\nreboot and re-energise the mass solar PV sector and give it a sustainable\nfuture with no chopping and changing of Government policy every 6 months. This\nwould enable it to be a mass market product again but this time with a strong\nfocus on community owned renewables and energy storage.\nThe\neffective ban on onshore wind projects needs to be lifted. It is ludicruous\nthat our cheapest form of renewable energy is basically a non starter and if we\ndo re-energise it we need to encourage more publicly owned and community owned\nrenewables.\nRenewable\nheat and Combined Heat and Power needs to have a much stronger focus from\ngovernment. I’m not a big fan of the incineration of waste but it’s not just the\nwaste that goes into these that I object to but the waste heat going up the\nchimneys. Some great work is going on in Leeds and other authorities but it is not the norm. It is not mainstream.\nWe need to stop\nsubsidising fossil fuels. We hear all this talk from some politicians about the\nrenewable sector having to stand on its own two feet in the energy market yet\nwe subsidise fossil fuels to the tune of £12 billion/year and renewables £8.3\nbillion/year. The balance is wrong and doesn’t reflect where Government support\nis needed. Local Government and wider public bodies need to divest from fossil\nfuels which if we are serious about addressing emissions will become worthless\nstranded assets (according to the Governor of the Bank of England). Some have\nalready done so, others need to like the West Yorkshire Pension Fund for\ninstance.\nI’d love to\nsee a mass tree planting project with large scale civic engagement and I hope the\nNorthern Forest proposal becomes that. Every school child in the UK should be\ngiven the chance to plant a tree.\nThe\nrevolution in electric vehicles needs to be accelerated and Councils and large\nfleet operators incentivised to act more swiftly with infrastructure and in\ntheir own procurement. Leeds is doing well with 200 electric vehicles. Kirklees\nhas 3. Come on Kirklees!\nFracking. We\nneed to keep it in the ground. Ban it like so many other civilised countries in\nthe world have and Scotland.\nWe need to\nensure we do these things but focus on those on the lowest incomes first. We\ndon’t just save the world we must create a better world.\nDo all this\nand it will be a good start\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

We commissioned local architects, One17, to help us realise our vision for the building and to assess the maintenance and improvments we will need to make to the building. We have raised funding to pay for the building and carry out some essential repairs. We have secured planning permission from Kirklees for change of use from a place of worship to a community centre with ancilliary cafe. That is the short version of the story. There have been some frustrations and bumps in the road along the way.\nWe know that getting ownership of the building is only the beginning of the journey. The roof will need replacing. We have a variety of tarpaulins and buckets collecting rainwater from various points in the roof. The kitchen and toilet block are in a very poor state and we need a small extension and a refit to bring it up to modern standards. There's a lot more that we have planned including upgrading the heating and insulation, creating meeting rooms, removing the pews to give us a usable halls for dancing, exercise clases and events.\nWe have got local people together to discuss our vision for the building and to get their ideas and input. As local Councillors we have initiated saving the building for the community but now we will need the help of the community to ensure it has a sustainable long term future. There is a lot of work to do but it will be worth it.\nIf you can donate to our Crowdfunder it would be really appreciated\nMake a pledge to The Newsome Centre (Phase 2) Proposal on Spacehive\n.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

So we started to see what could be done. In the meantime I had been asked by the Green Party if there were any good examples of positive things Green Councillors had managed to do during the Covid crisis. This looked like a good example so on Thursday I appeared in a Green Party Political broadcast that went out on national TV. There I was in my kitchen over Zoom and I said the words,\n\"In Kirklees, Green Councillors saw that younger pupils were missing out on vital IT equipment to enable them to learn from home. They weren't being helped by government or council schemes so we stepped in to help using our local budgets.\"\nThe next day I get an email from Labour Councillor and Cabinet Member for Education Carole Pattison\n\"Andrew, I hope you read or have read the briefing that I am\nputting out to all councillors about the provision of laptops to children in\nKirklees Schools. You will note that Kirklees has distributed the 3rd\nhighest number of laptops in the country and that we are providing an extra\n1000 plus out of the council’s budget for them, your statement during your\nbroadcast last night was completely at odds with this. If any schools in your\nward are in need then please point them in the direction of the Learning\nService because we are trying to make sure that all children in Kirklees have\nequal access to the devices that they need and that none go wanting, again in\ncontradiction to what you implied last night.\nI had a number of problems with this email. The briefing was sent out in the afternoon that very same day and so of course I hadn't read it. Why would I withdraw a statement about some positive action we had taken in November because Labour had just announced a scheme 3 months after the one we did. A cynic might think that Labour's briefing went out as a hasty response to the publicity for our successful scheme and they didn't like the idea of anyone else other than themselves getting recognition for positive action. I also pointed out to Councillor Pattison that Kirklees Headteachers were not all aware of this offer from the Council as only this week we had contact from neighbouring schools asking how they could get funding for laptops like that we have provided in the Newsome Ward. It is all just a bit disappointing really. The most important thing is that children get the support they need and I am pleased that Kirklees is now providing the support that is needed. There was really no need for this petty politicking.\nHere's the 'offending' part of our broadcast.",

Using the same logic the 5 members\nappointed by each constituent Council should be referred to as “Premier Class\nMembers” as their support is required to approve the above matters.\nAll Councillors need\nto be represented on the Mayoral Combined Authority\nOver 8% of elected Councillors in West Yorkshire are from\nparties other than Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats. All these\nCouncillors are members of the LGA Independent Group. Current proposals would\nmean that these Councillors and the communities they represent would have no\nrepresentation at all on the Mayoral Combined Authority. Provision should be\nmade on the board to represent all groupings represented by LGA Political\nGroups including the LGA Independent Group which consists of Independent and\nGreen Party Councillors. We propose an additional member for political balance\nto ensure Councillors who are members of the LGA Independent Group, and\ntherefore the people who vote for them, are represented.\nThe proposals for 2\nDeputy Mayors are undemocratic\nThe proposal for the Mayor to be able to simply appoint 2 paid\nDeputies is undemocratic and will most likely be given to ‘Party worthies’ as a\nform of patronage. If it follows the model of the West Yorkshire Police and\nCrime Commissioner the Deputy Mayors positions will attract an allowance of at\nleast £50k/year with no democratic mandate. The Leader of Kirklees Council has\nstated at a Kirklees Scrutiny meeting that a Deputy Mayor position will be\ntaken by a Leader of one of the Constituent Councils. There is no reference to\nthis in the Governance Review document.\nMayoral Compulsory\nPurchase and Development Area powers should need approval of a meeting of the\nconstituent Full Council\nThe Mayor will have the power to compulsory purchase land\nwithin each Combined Authority area and set up Mayoral Development areas.\nBefore any of these powers are put into effect they should require the approval\nof a vote in Full Council in the constituent Council affected.\nAs with the Compulsory Purchase powers we strongly believe\nthat proposals to establish a Mayoral Development area should also require Full\nCouncil approval.\nIf London can have\nthe GLA why can’t West Yorkshire have an elected assembly?\nIt is not at all clear that powers will not be taken away\nfrom Councils and given to the Mayoral Combined Authority - the exact opposite\nof devolution.\nIt is our view, for Devolution to work in this area it needs\nto have a representational assembly elected by proportional representation to\ncover the whole Yorkshire region with similar powers to those of the Scottish\nParliament or the Welsh Assembly. Yorkshire has a population somewhat greater\nthan Scotland, and significantly larger that Wales. What’s good enough for\nScotland & Wales is good enough for Yorkshire.\nSpecific Governance\nproposals\n·\nAllocation of places to be based on LGA Groups -\nGreens and Independent councillors would all fall under the LGA Independent\nGrouping rather than being treated as small parties or individuals.\n·\nThere should be 4 balancing members on the\nMayoral Combined Authority. This would create a more balanced authority giving\n10 voting members. 4 balancing members would currently result in 2\nConservative, 1 Lib-Dem and 1 LGA Independent Group members.\n·\nEqual voting rights for all Mayoral Combined\nAuthority members on all matters not reserved to the Mayor. The proposed\nstructure creates 3 classes of voting member.\nThere is no justification for the Mayor and the balancing members to be\nexcluded from key decisions, and there should be only 1 class of voting member\non Combined Authority decisions.\n·\nIn the absence of an Elected Assembly there\nshould be all member assembly from the constituent councils for key decisions -\nAs far as possible all elected members should be involved in the decisions that\nwill shape and determine our shared future.\nQuestion 2\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer transport functions and new transport related\nfunctions to a West Yorkshire Mayor and mayoral combined authority?\nDisagree\nAdditional Transport\nfunding should simply be passed down to each constituent Council\nWhile we would welcome some of the potential powers that\nwould be granted to the Elected Mayor in relation to Public Transport and\naccess to funding, we believe that Government should simply devolve this\nfunding and powers to the Local Authorities without requiring the establishment\nof a new undemocratic Mayoral Authority.\nTransport funding\nshould not be used to support higher carbon emissions\nThe Key Route Network proposed could involve the\nestablishment of new roads encouraging car use and destroying valued green\ncorridors. This would also be inconsistent with WYCA’s commitment to have a\nzero carbon economy by 2038. It might be noted that while WYCA have stated a\ntarget of 2038, Leeds City Council, via a motion of Council, set a target date\nof 2030 – We believe that within the boundary of Leeds the Elected Mayor, if\nbrought in, should implement the Zero-Carbon economy by the 2030 date.\nWe would oppose the use of funding on any projects that\nwould enable expansion at Leeds Bradford Airport by the Mayor and the Mayoral\nCombined Authority. Any such funding would be contrary to reaching Zero-Carbon.\nWe acknowledge that delivering a mass transit system has\nlong been the plan for Leeds City Region, and aligns with the move towards\nbecoming Zero Carbon. However, the need to progress at pace to achieve modal transport\nshifts in order for Leeds to reach its Zero Carbon target of 2030 may require\nthe mass transit system ambition to be revisited. Funding is needed now to\ndevelop an effective and responsive bus system, the means for all transport to\nbe Zero Carbon and to greatly increase active travel. Planning for low carbon\ntransport is no longer good enough; travel needs to be Zero Carbon, and this\nmust include ensuring that the electricity for electric vehicles is generated\nfrom renewable sources. We welcome the plans for improvements at Leeds city\nstation as long as the modal shift is to Zero Carbon transport.\nQuestion 3\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer skills and employment functions to a West\nYorkshire mayoral combined authority?\nAgree with some reservations\nWhile we would argue that Adult Education – lifelong\nlearning – is about more than those outcomes linked to employability and the\nminor extensions into Community Learning covered by the current AEB, the\nquestion asks only about the current system.\nWe are conscious that levels of participation in the\nYorkshire & the Humber region in the forms of Adult Education covered by\nthe AEB at 30%, are only just above the lowest level nationally (29% in the\nSouth West)\nThere is a concern about the unpredictability of funding\nlevels, which have seen a 45% fall over the last ten years. Clearly if the\nmayoral region is to plan for provision in the long term it needs assurance\nthat funding will reflect levels of commitment made and increase at the very least\nto cover the inflationary costs.\nWe are conscious that the administrative and procurement\nprocesses that have operated at a national level have shown great weaknesses\nthat have undermined provider confidence. We would want to see devolution of\nthe budget linked to the power to simplify rules, make required outcomes\nclearer and support provider confidence. The devolution of the budget has\npromise, but only if the administration can be simplified and made more\ntransparent. If devolution is to mean anything it must include devolution of\ndecision making about the outcomes wanted in the region.\nThe region as a whole, and the West Yorkshire region in\nparticular have great potential in building the new green economic order that\nis needed. There is a strong skills base that can be built on in the provision\nof training, and this development should take place not just in the context of\nthe 2038 Zero carbon Agenda target of the WYCA, but also reflect local\ncommitments, such as those in Leeds to a 2030 target.\nAs such we would favour further devolution of the budget to\nthe five constituent authorities of the sub-region and not just to the WY\nmayor, and for the opportunity for lifelong learning to become an offer that is\navailable very locally, for example from community centres or schools.\nQuestion 4\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer housing and planning functions to a West\nYorkshire Mayor and mayoral combined authority?\nDisagree\nPlanning decisions\nshould be taken at a local level\nWe do not support the granting of any land assembly or\nplanning powers to the Elected Mayor, these should be held by the appropriate\nLocal Authority, as those councillors have the local knowledge to be able to\nmake these decisions. Clearly, it is our view if this function were to be\ngranted to the Elected Mayor and, we note that the local authority will have a\nveto, we would like to put in the safeguard that any decision taken by the\nElected Mayor in this area should have to be endorsed by both the Executive\nBoard and a meeting of the full Council of that particular metropolitan\nauthority.\nThe Mayoral Combined\nAuthority should be able to suspend the ‘Right to Buy’\nOne function we would like devolved to a local level is the\npower to suspend the Right to Buy scheme. We have seen a massive reduction in\nCouncil Housing at a time of high demand for income particularly for the\nmillions left behind in the policy push over the last 40 years towards home\nownership. Not everybody can own a home and we need a secure affordable option\nfor the millions who cannot. Suspending\nor preferably abolishing the Right to Buy would boost the business case for\nCouncils wanting to build new affordable homes.\nThe power we need is\nto insist on higher energy efficiency standards for buildings\nThe Mayor will not have powers to insist on higher building\nstandards in the region such as Passivhaus for all new build. This would be\ncompatible with WYCA’s stated commitment to a Zero Carbon Economy by 2038 but\nis a power that we won’t have.\nWe need a 2030 Target\nfor the West Yorkshire Zero Carbon Economy\nWe strongly believe that the Mayoral Combined Authority\nshould set a new, more ambitious target for a Zero Carbon Economy by 2030 in\nline with the conclusions of the report of the United Nations Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change. This would help support our argument for stronger\nhousing and planning policies either at the local or regional level.\nQuestion 5\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer Police and Crime Commissioner functions to a\nWest Yorkshire Mayor?\nStrongly oppose\nPolice and Crime\nfunctions are even more unaccountable under the Mayoral Combined Authority.\nThe appointment of a highly paid, unelected Deputy Mayor to\nlead on the Policing function, however, just makes matters worse. It will undoubtedly put an unelected\npolitician in a role where the people scrutinising them will have a democratic\nmandate (albeit through FPTP), but they will not.\nQuestion 6\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer additional finance functions on a West Yorkshire\nMayor and mayoral combined authority?\nStrongly oppose\nNo taxation without\nadequate representation and scrutiny.\nOur opposition to these additional powers is due to the lack\nof a suitable democratic mandate as we have detailed in our answer to question\n1 and/or the lack of suitable scrutiny and powers to limit the powers of the\nMayor by a democratically elected Assembly.\nThe power to charge a precept for policing would mean that\nthe funding gained could be the responsibility of an unelected functionary and\nor ‘Party Worthy’.\nQuestion 7\nAre there any\ncomments you would like to make that you do not feel you have addressed in your\nresponse?\nWhat about the\nchallenge of Climate Change?\nThe West Yorkshire Authorities Governance Review document\nhighlights the major challenges to the sub region. It includes growth,\nproductivity, diversity, innovation and trade but Climate Change is not\nidentified as a challenge bizarrely. The self-declared target of having a Zero\nCarbon Economy in just 18 years’ time is a significant challenge but it is\nconcerning that it has not been included here. For the record the Green Party\nbelieves that our target should be 2030 not 2038 in line with the evidence from\nclimate scientists.\nWhat about a\nresilient economy?\nAnother significant challenge highlighted by the COVID19\ncrisis is the need for a resilient economy that is less affected by global\nfactors such as international trade, the money markets and financial speculation.\nA more resilient economy would have an emphasis on local\nproduction for local need, more locally owned and managed businesses trading\nwith each other ensuring money remains within the regional economy. This is not\nidentified as a significant challenge and therefore cannot be regarded as a\npriority by the Mayoral Combined Authority. This is a major weakness in the\nGovernance Review Document\nA Devolution Deal for\na Post-COVID/Post-Growth World\nThe proposed devolution deal was prepared in the pre-COVID\nworld, and therefore it will need significant rethinking in order to align with\nthe new normal that individuals, businesses, communities, councils, regions and\nnations are now preparing for. Recently 200 leading UK businesses, investors\nand business networks, called on the Government to deliver a Covid-19 recovery\nplan that builds back a more inclusive, stronger and more resilient UK economy that\naligns with the UK's wider social, environmental and climate goals. There is no\nmention here of economic growth. More and more people with vision are realising\nthat growing an economy is at odds with tackling climate change. What we can\nhave instead is a strong, vibrant, inclusive and sustainable economy and that\nshould be the vision that underpins the devolution deal. We have an opportunity\nhere in West Yorkshire to be leaders in this new green recovery world.\nIn view of this, the metrics used for making the 5 year\nGateway Assessments on which ongoing funding may depend cannot be based on\neconomic growth, but on other measurements of a vibrant economy. In the new\nCOVID 19 world economic growth may be a thing of the past anyway. In particular\ndecisions must not be made in order to meet the Gateway Assessments that will\nreduce the capacity of Leeds to meet the Climate Emergency commitments.\nLet’s have Real\nDevolution not Faux Devolution\nIn our view this is only partial devolution to, effectively,\nan elected dictatorship, and not a proper democratic body. The area covered,\nthe County of West Yorkshire, is a failed concept of the early 1970’s and does\nnot cover the economic footprint of the Leeds City Region. To have real devolution\nwe need an Assembly and First Minister with powers similar to those granted to\nWales, and Scotland, but based upon the region of Yorkshire. The proposal\nstates that this agreement is the first step in the process to further\ndevolution, therefore a Yorkshire Assembly should be seen as the assumed next\nstep, which should be included in this devolution agreement. Devolution for\nYorkshire has wide support, including in the Sheffield City Region where\nreferendums held in Barnsley and Doncaster, indicated an overwhelming\npreference for a One Yorkshire deal over the South Yorkshire deal.\nDevolution that\nacknowledges the Climate Crisis\nOn October 8 2018 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange issued a report, in which they stated that ‘Limiting global warming to\n1.5°C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all\naspects of society.’ Other parts of the report state that ‘With clear benefits\nto people and natural ecosystems, limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to\n2°C could go hand in hand with ensuring a more sustainable and equitable\nsociety’. We are already seeing the consequences of 1°C of global warming\nthrough more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice,\namong other changes. The report finds that limiting global warming to 1.5°C\nwould require “rapid and far-reaching” transitions in land, energy, industry,\nbuildings, transport, and cities.’ It is already widely acknowledged that the\nUK’s zero carbon target of 2050 will not achieve the limiting of global warming\nrequired, which is why councils around the UK have committed to achieve zero\ncarbon much sooner.\nSo it is within the context of the Climate Emergency that\nWest Yorkshire now has the opportunity, through devolution, to set truly\nambitious plans to lead this country in a green economic recovery from the\nCOVID pandemic, a recovery that will achieve the challenging but necessary zero\ncarbon targets that have been set. This will require public support, and that\ncan only be achieved through the democratic processes and structures that are\noutlined in our response.",

Seemed to bat that one off OK! The best and most definitive answer I gave to a question at Conference was from a delegate who asked me \"Do you know where I can find Andrew Cooper?\"\nThe principal speeches were all good in different ways. Natalie's Leaders speech delivered the key messages we needed to get across very well. Caroline Lucas was passionate and engaging the audience as she always does. The Deputy Leaders definitely delivered. Amelia Womack was on form but the real and unexpected revelation for me was Shahrar Ali our Male Deputy Leader who gave a cracking speech on climate change full of humour and anger. Just good really.\nSpirits seemed pretty high at the Conference and some of the fringe meetings seemed about as well attended as some of our Conferences have been in past years.\nLots more to say but lots to do at the moment!\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2012_04_bnp-my-part-in-their-downfall_html/content_19.html": "When the close of nominations came through for the Kirklees Elections in May the BNP were notably absent. No BNP candidates! Hurrah! Dewsbury, once described as the jewel in Nick Griffin's BNP crown was now free of the peddlars of electoral hate. It was a by-election in Heckmondwike which saw their breakthrough in 2003 and this one was followed by another Councillor in that ward and one in Dewsbury East. In 2007 predictions of 5 or 6 BNP Councillors being elected were being whispered by Kirklees Party leaders. When the results came they failed to gain the 3rd seat in Heckmondwike and there were no BNP gains elsewhere.Their bubble appeared to have burst. The slide had begun and they lost seat after seat. In 2010 they lost their last seat on Kirklees following internal BNP wranglings which saw one of their Cllrs attempt to challenge Nick Griffin for the leadership. The BNP did stand in the Newsome and Kirkburton Wards in some elections and it was here they usually recorded some of their worst votes in Kirklees. They didn't seem to be able to get any traction in the wards where we were strong. Was this because having a strong Green Party presence had helped make people liberal, enightened and reject racism and hate? I'd like to think so but really I think we had cornered the market in the anti 'major ' party vote and there was no room for the BNP. Outside our target wards we decided not to stand a candidate in the Heckmondwike ward on a number of occasions. The rationale was that our vote there was around the 200-300 mark and would not transfer to the BNP easily if we weren't standing and would in fact be more likely go to the party most likely to beat the BNP. I'm sure this tactic helped Labour who have turned the tables on the BNP rather spectacularly.\nOn the council the BNP Cllrs were oddly silent, never produced a budget amendment that I can recall and you wonder why they wanted to be Councillors in the first place. They did say they weren't the most right wing members on the Council and named a right wing Conservative Councillor who admittedly is rather unpleasant. I did my fair share of challenging the BNP on the Council. On one occasion the Council was proposing something a bit authoritarian and the comment I made was \"If Kirklees did this we'd be behaving like fascists and 66 members of this Council don't want to behave like fascists\" As there were 69 Councillors in total the BNP took this as personal attack and they surrounded the Councils Solicitor demanding action. She had to point out that I had not in fact called them fascists it was simply their assumption that I was referring to them. Heaven forbid!\nHaving said all this we can't be complacent about the BNP or their ilk and we all need to make sure they don't gain a foothold again. In many ways we are fortunate that they have imploded before the financial crisis really took hold. Entering a time of economic strife could provide fertile ground for right wing extremists. So where have the BNP gone? Perhaps they've gone to the dark side of the moon! Here's the first 4 minutes of the new film Iron Sky\nThe concern is that the EDL have been making noises about having Candidates.\nReplyDeleteYou are correct in saying that the current political climate would be an ideal breeding ground for extremism. In North Kirklees this threat is the greatest.\nI heard about the EDL thing and the possible head to head wth the BNP in one of the Dewsbury wards.\nReplyDelete",

Despite this fact the Lib Dems have a ‘balancing\nseat’ on the Combined Authority and the Greens are not represented at all. Also\nthe Liberal Democrats have 6 out of 48 seats on the Combined Authority’s\nScrutiny Panels & the Green Party just 1 seat. That one seat is held by me and I'm our sole representative on WYCA and I sit on the\nCorporate Scrutiny Panel.\nThis is not about the Green Party but about the 61,101\nvoters who made us West Yorkshire’s third most popular party in last May’s\nlocal elections. We were ahead of the Liberal Democrats who got 53,433 votes.\nThat the Lib Dems should get 5 more seats on the Combined Authority’s Scrutiny\nPanels is clearly unfair and undemocratic and contrary to the views of West\nYorkshire voters.

The most numerically obvious one was that in both Newsome and Kirkburton Wards the Green Party got exactly the same vote - 2447. In Newsome this was enough to win it in Kirkburton unfortunately it wasn't.\nApart from the numerical freakiness the actual results didn't bear a lot of relationship to natural justice or effort expended.

I do know that the term 'Independent' can cover a range of political views. My Grandad, on my mothers side, was an Independent Councillor in Newcastle under Lyme and he was a Daily Express reader with views probably not too distinguishable from a Conservative. Though we have worked with Conservatives on Kirklees in the past it would be totally inconceivable for us to feel comfortable working in a group with them or people who to all intents and purposes were Conservative in all but name. The Independent Group leader Terry Lyons had been a Labour Party member and Edgar Holroyd-Doveton (who has his own blog) is a former member of the Green Party before he moved to Kirklees. So we were not dealing with any 'Con-dependents' here.\nWe spent the best part of the last year working together on the budget and other issues. So we have built trust and dialogue to better understand where we were both coming from. We both rejected the 'Party whipping system' and therefore the use of 'Party discipline' on dissenting members. A respect for difference of opinion was shared and therefore if on occasions we disagreed it would not necessarily be a huge issue. Consensus, mutual respect and leadership by consent, as opposed to coercion, were at the heart of this partnership. Following the local elections when the Greens won in Kirkburton and the Independents in Holme Valley North this took us over the magic 7 threshold with 8 Councillors. Another thing that bound us together was our shared experience of being elected largely through our own efforts regardless of the national swings to and from the larger parties. It makes getting elected harder but once you're there you should be more resilient to the ups and downs which effect the larger parties.\nThe 3 wards we each represent share a common boundary so over a wide area of Kirklees people are now used to electing representatives who are not party of the big 3 parties.Providing real choices for people is important and showing they are not constrained by traditional parties is empowering to communities freeing them from the paternalism which often characterises the larger parties.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2011_02_kirklees-budget-meeting_html/content_657.html": "| The Council Chamber, just add Councillors. |\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper, Leader of the Green Party Group speech at the 2011/12 Kirklees Budget Meeting\nGreen Party Councillors will vote against this budget.\nWe all know the background to these cuts. A lack of regulation of financial institutions by successive Conservative and Labour Governments and the almost collapse of the banking system.\nWe know the consequences for us as a Council. £80 million cuts over 4 years up to 2000 Council jobs can and are being lost. We know that Tory Councils in the leafy south such as Dorset actually got an increase in funding. We know that Eric Pickles sought to mislead people about the scale of the cuts by referring to Council cuts in ‘spending power’ rather than the harsh reality faced by many councils.\nThrough the budget meetings and process the Green Party have held one principle firm throughout . Whatever we did we would not sacrifice social services for solar panels. It became clearer and clearer throughout, that the funding available via central government made that impossible to achieve over the 4 years of the Comprehensive Spending Review. So consequently we have seen the budget for Care for older people reduced from £52 million to around £40 million over the next 4 years and Day Care Services to drop from £5.3 million to £1.5 million and all this at a time when the demand for these services is likely to rise due to demographic change. I don’t really know what a Big Society is but I know what a civilised society is and this cut in funding for those in the most need should not be regarded as civilised by anyone.\nThere is a real question mark over whether or not the councils stated priorities of supporting older people to be ‘healthy, active and included’ and ‘Enhancing the life chances for young people’ will be achieved through a budget such as this. If you don’t really believe that so much more can be achieved with so much less funding will Kirklees be really doing what it says on its Corporate Priorities tin and if not is this a budget that any Councillor should support?\nSo, at a national level, what have the ‘conscience of the coalition’ the Liberal Democrats done to help. Over 90 Lib Dem Council leaders and Group leaders wrote an open letter to Eric Pickles in The Times. And a very polite letter it was too. The letter was not so much focussing on the scale of cuts but more on the phasing of them. Somehow or other even this mildest of mild letters was beyond the pale for any Lib Dem Councillor in Kirklees to sign.\nOf course I am more than expecting cries of derision from the larger parties on the council asking ‘Where is your alternative?’ and it is a valid question.\nI could point out that this is the first time in the 12 years that I’ve been a Councillor that the Green Party has not put an amendment to a Kirklees Budget. We have always sought to use the opportunity that being members of this council brings to improve the quality of life of residents of Kirklees. It is however the third time the Conservatives have failed to produce an amendment. 2 of those occasions were in much less difficult times than this. So I will take no lectures off them.\nI could show that there is an alternative to the Government’s austerity package being inflicted on people locally and nationally. That we don’t need to make 2000 people redundant that the government doesn’t need to force a million people into unemployment across the country. Tackling Tax evasion and avoidance could raise £10 Billion /year yet the government is laying off staff at HMRC, a tax on international transactions could raise £10Billion year, putting a higher rate of tax for those earning over £100,000/year could raise billions as could of course taking proper action to tackle the banks who have quite frankly got away with murder . The recent changes to Corporation Tax will mean that Banks will be perversely better off at a time when they openly pay huge bonuses to staff. You have to ask ‘How is it that a Cabinet packed with so many millionaires and stockbrokers could act in such a way?’. The answer is of course very, very easily!\nAnd of course people have an alternative. In a very real way locally they have an alternative vote already. You don’t have to read the report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies to see that is the people in the most dire circumstances who suffer the most under this government. People have the alternative not to vote for parties who penalise the poor to the benefit of the rich. They can send a message to the government and vote out of office Councillors from Parties in the coalition who have put Kirklees and other Councils in the country in this position.\nThe Green Party will not support this budget it is a matter of principle and conscience. We will not compromise our principles or the people of Kirklees. We leave that to others.\nThe Liberals used to make speeches like this when they were not in government. The art of politics is compromise. Principles included.\nReplyDelete\"The art of politics is compromise\" - you're not a Thatcherite Conservative then.\nReplyDeleteIt is a pity you aren't standing in Newsome again you could put \"I will compromise my principles\" on your election leaflet.\nI notice they are doing a Zombie Walk soon in Huddersfield - good to see some of the three main party councillors were practising for it at the meeting; at least I thought they were, given their level of shambolic rhetoric and mindless arguments.\nReplyDeleteGood to see you and Graham making both the moral and practical case - the others are condemned by their lack of imagination and horde mentality!\nNobody sets out to compromise their principles. When standing in an election you will put your principles up for scrutiny. When elected, if not in power, you can stand by your principles. If in power, circumstances can mean you have to make decisions you do not really want to. Happily that is a position neither you or me will ever be in.\nReplyDeleteThanks for your opinion. Actually I have been in that position as a Cabinet member for 3 years and when the budgets of Kirklees in the past have been dependent on our support. I don't recall an occasion when I've had to do anything that conflicts too deeply with my principles. You seem to have a narrow view of power and where it is. It can be with those in the administration, it can be in the officers and it can with the electors. Power lies in not compromising your principles as it frightens the hell out of those who do.\nReplyDelete",

Along the way we will be highlighting the dangers of Fracking to local communities and the global environment. We will also be talking about the alternatives to Fracking such as energy efficiency programmes for existing and new homes, renewable energy for communities and also at scale.\nIt is a tough walk but we're hoping to meet lots of people along the way raise the profile of community campaigns against Fracking and the importance of electing politicians who will consistently oppose Fracking in Yorkshire, Lancashire and everywhere beyond.\nSymbolically we'll be carrying some soil from near the fracking site in Kirby Misperton to Preston New Rd. As soil from Yorkshire is deposited at the fracking site in Lancashire we'll emphasise that the assault on the environment at one site is an assault on us all and that the aims of the protectors in Lancashire are shared by Yorkshire Anti Fracking activists and thousands of campaigners across the world.\nThere will be daily video diaries of our march (in March) across the North of England and evening meetings at each point along the way. It is undoubtedly a challenge and one I approach with a certain amount of trepidation as a 52 year old man who could do with losing a bit more than a pound or two! I've always felt that if things are hard to achieve they will have more meaning if you actually achieve them and so it is with this particular challenge. Bring it on!",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2017_08_no-fracking-way-preparations-january_html/content_1288.html": "The date was set, the route vaguely agreed (between me and Googlemaps) and at least one walker recruited - me. There was clearly more to do. How many people could we get on the core group of walkers? Where would they sleep? How sure were we that the route Google picked would be suitable?\nThe first job was to test the route. So in January myself and Ann Forsaith, Coordinator of Yorkshire and Humber Green Party began a 2 day recce in her car of the route. We met at Leeds Station and made our way North to Kirby Misperton Protection Camp. We arrived pretty much first thing at Kirby Misperton. The camp was on land owned by nearby Flamingo Land and permission for the protectors to occupy the land had gone from no permission, dubious permission and now was assumed permission. Word had reached the folks at the Protection Camp and we met the head honcho Ian Crane to discuss our plans. Ian was clearly well connected. We met in a 'studio area' at the camp constructed out of reclaimed wood pallets and plastic sheeting with a comfy sofa and chairs. When I mentioned the Leo Sayer inspiration for the walk he clearly was on more than nodding terms with Leo. He was unsurprised Leo hadn't answered my emails asking him to join me on the No Fracking Way and reckoned my dreams of Leo strutting, singing and dancing with us the 120 miles to Blackpool were unlikely to come to fruition . He did however suggest that he might be able to rustle together a Samba Band to see us off which sounded nice.\nMe and Ann set off in her little blue car to map the route to our intended first stop Easingwold about 20 miles away. Ann had got a load of secondhand OS maps of various ages that covered the whole route which we could use to map out the route in more detail. Easingwold was the village where Fracking loving Tory MP (and once owner of 2 castles) Kevin Hollinrake had his office and perhaps we'd arrange something later in the walk there. The route to Easingwold was lovely and flat, with quiet country roads, not too busy.if it was going to be like this all the way to Blackpool it would be fine.\nWe got some lunch in picturesque Easingwold and carried on to map Day 2 to Harrogate. Again not too bad until we reached Knaresborough then a bit of a steep patch up into Harrogate. So far so good. The next intended route was the A57 from Harrogate to Skipton. It looked fine on Google, a nice straight road. We drove along it for a while but it was clear that this was just plain dangerous. A dual carriageway, busy traffic, no pavement that went on for miles and miles. It was raining with heavy trucks when we did the recce. It could well be like this on the walk itself. \"We would die on this road\" I said with feeling. We would clearly have to find another way. Another way would mean Skipton as a place to walk to would now be out of the question. We would have to walk a more southerly route towards Ilkley and Silsden but there were no obvious roads that didn't take us well out of our way. We did however find a route across country which knocked miles off our route and took us off road all together which would be a relief.\nMe and Ann set off in her little blue car to map the route to our intended first stop Easingwold about 20 miles away.

We did however find a route across country which knocked miles off our route and took us off road all together which would be a relief.\nDay 1 of the recce ended and we met up with Harrogate Greens at Shan Oakes and Bill Rigby's house where they were planning for a By Election in Knaresbrough with the exotically named Green Canidate Boadecea MacLeod. Shan and Bill were the owners of a beautiful Esse wood burning stove and oven that I coveted and Bill, the Mayor of Knaresbrough was the proud owner of the same name as my maternal Grandad 'Bill Rigby' who was an Independent councillor in Newcastle under Lyme (back in the day). The good natured meeting was chaired by the cheery Gilly Charters and there were a dozen or so of round the table. Ann and I explained where we'd got to with the No Fracking Way planning and the Harrogate Greens agreed to arrange an evening event and join us for some of the route. All good.\nAnn went home to Leeds and I stayed with my younger brother Richard in Harrogate. Me and Richard have a lot in common. He trained as an election agent and so did I. We both were elected as Councillors on the very same day in May in 1999 and we both lead our political groups on our respective Councils. That's pretty much where the resemblance ends as he is the Tory Leader of Harrogate Council and is pro fracking. When the subject of me and my brothers differing politics comes up someone usually says something like \"Christmas must be fun?\" Actually we do usually get together as a family and things are pretty survivable and even pleasant. We did have one dodgy moment when my youngest son Toby at a family Barbecue said to Uncle Richard \"Dad says all Tories are scum\". Some time and some wine later we dealt with that issue. Our 2 boys have been exposed to our political views over the years and if something like the Bedroom Tax or ATOS assessments is featured on Channel 4 News the words \"Tories are scum\" may pass my lips. Actually if all Tories were like my brother and one or two other Tories I know then we'd be in a much better place. Well we would be remaining in the European Union at least.\nDay 2 of the recce saw me and Ann carry on and work our way from Silsden to the Lancashire border. We found a lovely straight rising country road that took us up to remote 'Welcome to Pendle' sign. A symbolic and important point on our journey. We stopped and I posed with my passport by the sign. Not far beyond the sign at a junction was a pub. That might come in handy!\nFrom there we had to cut short our recce to go and meet some Lancashire Greens in a cafe in Burnley to do some planning with them. It was a lovely break and we met about 8 Greens including longstanding stalwart Green Party member and all round good guy Dave Penney. A number of really good things came out of that meeting. Jai Redman of Burnley Greens said the whole of the Core Group of walkers could stay at his big house in Burnley on the last night of our walk. A meeting was arranged for the evening in Burnley and best of all we met George. She was a keen cyclist and route finder extraordinaire and would do the Lancashire recce to Preston New Road for us and send us a GPS Map of the route. This was great Lancashire Green Party had done us proud. We left for home, back to Yorkshire in good spirits.\nFrom there we had to cut short our recce to go and meet some Lancashire Greens in a cafe in Burnley to do some planning with them.

Today myself and Cllr Julie Stewart Turner got a good look round and it is impressive and will be a much improved teaching environment for a school which is performing well.\n| The new Mount Pleasant Primary School |\n| The School Hall with Headteacher Naeem Nazir on the right |\n| All classrooms equipped with smart boards |\n| Artists impression |\n| New School on the left old School on the right |\n| New classroom looking out on the old school |\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

What has been nice has been all the concern for my well being from all sorts of people. Thanks folks but I'm absolutely fine. I made it a personal rule not to start thinking beyond Polling Day and thereby raising my own expectations. Winning was clearly a possibility and a number of opinion polls gave us cause for optimism but the surge of media fuelled protest votes, for the Party which has had far too many mentions and coverage already, put paid to that.To avoid overusing the name of the Party for the purpose of this blogpost lets just call it 'Adolf'. A name I picked at random.\nI enjoyed the campaign and attended lots of hustings meetings. Adolf didn't turn up to at least 6 meetings. They later claimed they hadn't been invited to these meetings which contradicted what I was told by the various organisations arranging the Hustings. The opportunity to take on 'the bad guys' in these meetings was one I got a real kick out of. My favourite moment was when one of the Tories asked what was stopping the Government passing its own policies to protect workers rights rather than being lead by the EU? All I had to say was 'because you're Tories' This got quite a few laughs but drove the point home about the value of EU rules in protecting people's employment rights,\n| Notre Dame College Hustings in Leeds (note Green Euro Candidate Kevin Warnes playing Dimbleby) |\nThe role of the media in the Euro Campaign remains controversial. The OFCOM ruling effectively elevated Adolf to major party status and cut the Greens out of the vast majority of TV coverage and was a constant source of frustration. Clearly the result putting us ahead of the Lib Dems vindicates our claim that this was a 5 party contest not a four party one. We beat the Lib Dems and gained an MEP despite the media and I can't help wondering how different things would have been if we'd had the exposure we deserved. I believe there were very genuine attempts by the BBC regionally to give us what they regarded as fair coverage within the rules they set themselves (as guided by OFCOM) . I think we do however have a very strong argument that those rules were flawed as they didn't actually reflect the support we were polling or indeed the end result. What I really wanted was to be included in the studio debates something Green Candidates in other regions did manage to do.\n| Being interviewed by Len Tingle at Stirley Farm at our launch |\nThe real buzz I got in the campaign was working with committed Greens from across the region working together in a common cause. I really felt we pulled together and had a pride in the message we were delivering and the principles we stood for. I focussed on drawing in resources from the EU, improving energy efficiency of buildings, addressing fuel poverty and meaningful jobs for young people in particular.The 6 Green Euro Candidates we fielded were all capable, worked well together and were a real pleasure to work with.\nDuring the campaign we had several encouraging polls which showed us about where we needed to be to win a Euro seat in Yorkshire and The Humber. I even wandered into the count at Leeds Town Hall to be told by one of the Labour team that they thought I might get the 6th seat but unfortunately not. My main disappointment was not having the opportunity to push for an EU target to reduce fuel poverty. The great thing is that we got another Green MEP elected in the South West. Molly Scott Cato will do a great job and I'm really pleased for her and yes a bit jealous.\n| At Green Party Spring Conference with Lead Candidate for Eastern Region Rupert Read and Lead Candidate for the South West Molly Scott Cato MEP |\nI just wanted to say Andy that I thought you brought a new dimension to the national team with your expertise. Rupert and I have said we won't be looking for the lead nomination in our regions next time (we've both had 2 goes at it). I've made it clear that I'd like to see someone from the next generation of the party lead the list in the North West next time, but I hope you will consider a second shot at it in Y+H in 2019.\nReplyDeleteThanks Peter. I'm not too beat up by the contest and quite enjoyed it, though trying to organise 2 target wards and run as a Lead Candidate was a bit gruelling. 5 years is a long way off and a lot can happen between now and then but thanks for the thought\nReplyDelete",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_search_label_Locally%20Determined%20Contributions/content_569.html": "At COP24 I was on a mission to get the concept of Locally Determined Contributions (LDCs) accepted by the UNFCCC. LDCs were to give the ability for Local and Regional Authorities to set their own carbon reduction targets in conjunction with Nationally Determined Contributions which are the responsibility of national governments. This would establish a clearer role for sub-national bodies like Councils and Devolved Administrations in taking action to reduce carbon emissions and help towards achieving the Paris Climate goals. I had some excellent support from staff at the EU Committee of the Regions and Locally and Regionally Determined Contributions were backed by the LGMA, the body that represented Local Government globally.\nIn the end we didn't get LDC's adopted but we had moved the debate significantly and there was a statement in the final text on how to assess Nationally Determined Contributions that referred to \"preparing implementation plans to include domestic institutional arrangements, public participation and engagement with local communities”. In the UK context this basically meant Governments would have to work more closely with Councils on action to address climate change. Then (in the UK at least) nothing happened. Councils still had no official role. the UK Government continued to make statements and policy about climate change with no significant involvement with Local and Regional Authorities.\nThe Green Party made one of our goals in the run up to COP26 to push Government to set up a joint Central/Local Government Taskforce to put pressure on Government to act. Then at the end of last month the Government produced their Net Zero Strategy and in it there was a statement saying they would establish a,\n\"Local Net Zero Forum to ensure that there is direct input from local leaders. Chaired by BEIS, the Forum will be cross departmental and bring together national and local government senior officials on a regular basis to discuss policy and delivery options on net zero. The forum will build on our current engagement mechanisms through the representative bodies such as the Local Government Association (LGA), Association for Public Service Excellence (APSE), Core Cities and the Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning & Transport (ADEPT)\".\nSo a Taskforce and a success of sorts!\nI first raised the need for National and Local Governments to work more closely together in Paris at COP21 back in 2015 in a side event where I was representing the EU Committee of the Regions. So my own involvement in calling for something like this degree of cooperation is nearly 7 years old. All that really has happened, with the establishment of the Net Zero Forum is that a structure is now in place so we can have discussions, there is still a lot of actual work to do! Though the Forum will be chaired by BEIS the culture of the Forum should be that all participants come to the table as equals and that it is not dominated by national government. We need initiatives for policy change to be able to come forward from local government. After all it will be councils that will have to deliver a lot of the action needed to reduce emissions so why not allow the practitioners the chance to be the policy makers as well?\nThere is a lot to do. Changes to Building Regulations, a revised National Planning Policy Framework that takes into account climate change, addressing skills gaps and the need for a large scale domestic retrofit programme, all these need serious attention to get us on track towards a genuinely Zero Carbon Strategy for the UK.\nLets get to work!",

Councillor Cooper made the proposal at a September meeting of the EU Committee of the Regions, the body that represents local government and devolved administrations across the European Union. It was originally agreed in September but right wing groups the European Peoples Party and the European Conservatives & Reformists (which includes the UK Conservative Party) bizarrely backed out of supporting a joint statement they had originally agreed to following a unanimous vote. The statement on the vehicle emissions scandal was put to the vote again but this time was passed by a majority vote but this time with the open opposition of the right wing groups including the UK Conservative Party.\nCouncillor Cooper said,\n\"I am delighted that the EU Committee of the Regions has finally come out in favour of a 'polluter pays' principle on vehicle manufacturers who have falsified their emissions tests. The impact of them flouting the law on exhaust fumes has a direct impact on peoples health. The effect on respiratory illnesses is real and we need car manufacturers fines to be invested in cleaner transport alternatives in our communities to help repair the damage they have done.\nI simply can't understand why anyone would back car manufacturers who have been forced to admit they cheated on emissions tests against the people who's health could have been adversely affected by this additional pollution.\nWe now know that car makers have falsified emissions tests on carbon emissions as well. So the issue has become a climate chamge issue as well as a public health matter.\nThe EU Committee of the Regions has made a strong statement on the scandal we need to push harder on national governments, the European Parliament and European Commission to back this principled stand.\"\nDetails of the September EU Committee of the Regions ENVE Commissions meeting\nhttp://www.greeningkirklees.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/eu-committee-of-regions-enve-commission.html\nLink to official EU Committee of Regions Pres Statement\nhttp://www.cor.europa.eu/en/news/Pages/ENVE-declaration-car-emission-test-scandal.aspx\nContact - Councillor Andrew Cooper - 07721 348619 andrew.cooper@kirklees.gov.uk\nStatement below\nA statement from the ENVE Commission of the Committee of the Regions on\nthe automotive emission tests' scandal\nThe ongoing scandal of certain car manufactures cheating on vehicles (diesel and petrol powered cars) emissions' tests is a matter of great concern for local and regional authorities, as those most affected by these situation are the people living in our towns and cities who breathe in these emissions with serious impact on their health. It has also become clear that similarly misleading information on C02 emissions has been provided by certain manufacturers, which risks undermining our efforts at combatting climate change.\nThe ENVE commission members welcome\nthe fact that new test cycles which are based on real-world driving conditions\nwill finally be introduced at the EU level, but they wish to express their deep\ndisappointment that national governments in the Council of Ministers have\ndecided to still allow car manufacturers to exceed more than two times the\nemission limits required by EU law as of 2017, when testing will have to be\nmoved from laboratories to roads. The ENVE members believe this relaxation of\nrules should not be accepted, as the CoR has previously underlined the crucial\nimportance of addressing air quality problems at source.\nPoor air quality is responsible for\napproximately 400,000 premature deaths in the EU ever year and has a\ndisproportionately severe impact on the health of people with respiratory or\ncardiovascular conditions, the very young and elderly people.\nAs representatives of local\ncommunities and regions, ENVE members strive to ensure public health of our\ncitizens and we expect national governments and the EU level to do the same and\nnot tolerate fraudulent practises which cause serious harm to our citizens. We also\nbelieve that appropriate forms of compensation must be paid by companies found\nto be responsible and that local authorities should receive a fair share of\nsuch compensation for the damages their citizens suffer, and to enable cities\nand regions to better implement clean-air programmes.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

There have been several damaging cuts to what were already pretty miniscule programmes to support low carbon technologies. These have destabilised small renewable industry installers particularly with regard to biomass. With the cancellation of the Low Carbon Buildings Programme grants and uncertainty over the Renewable Heat Incentive struggling biomass installers are up against it.\nThere was hope by some that the Lib Dems would make the Tories green rhetoric a reality but little evidence is forthcoming yet. During the election campaign Friends of the Earth released lots of yellow balloons outiside parliament representing all the Lib Dem candidates who had signed up to their key election asks (and a few blue ones). When I asked them why they hadn't released any Green ones for all the Green Party Candidates who had signed FOEs asks (like me!) they said that they went out to buy green ones but there weren't enough. Hmmm..... with 'friends of the earth' like these who needs enemies.\nCuts to low-carbon technology programmes:\n- £12.6m from The Carbon Trust's grant for low carbon technology and business support funding from DECC\n- £6.1m 'efficiency savings' and under-spending on programme budgets within DECC\n- £4.7m by cancelling final rounds of Bio-Energy Capital Grants Scheme and Bio-Energy Infrastructure Scheme\n- £3m by reducing the scope of the Offshore Wind Capital Grants Scheme\n- £3m from closing the Low Carbon Buildings Fund early\n- £2.9m by reducing the scope of the government's Low Carbon Technology Programme\n- £1m cut to funding for development of deep geothermal energy generation\n- £700,000 by closing the Energy Saving Trust technology trials early\nFriday, 9 July 2010\nNew Carbon Emissions Reduction Targets what the government should do!\nThere is some good news in the Con Dems new approach to Carbon Emission Reduction Targets for energy utilities. There will be a much greater emphasis on insulation schemes with 68% of the funding going on such schemes and they reckon that around 3.5 million homes will be insulated by December 2012. There is also to be less emphasis on gizmos and gadgets, I guess they mean Energy Display Monitors - which might be a mistake if applied too rigorously. There is however still no statement from the government as to whether or not the previous governments target of insulating all homes by 2015 remains a target. So there are still significant questions over the governments ambition but if schemes like the Kirklees Warm Zone are to take effect what should we be looking for in the new CERT regulations? Here's my top 5 'asks'\nArea Based Approaches – Area based approaches will be positively encouraged under new CERT arrangements particularly for insulation based schemes. A minimum of 75% of CERT funding, allocated to insulation measures, should be dedicated to area based insulation programmes. Area Based approaches are by their nature more cost effective as more installations can be carried out in a day by crews working in the same street and better prices can be achieved through the tender process. In this way economies of scale can be more easily realised and reduce the cost of carbon saved.\nLocal Authority linkages - All area based programmes shall be delivered in partnership with local authorities who will be encouraged to link them with with a income maximization advice/benefits advice package to reduce the likelihood of households being in fuel poverty.\n‘Free’ Area Based Approaches – It is recognised that take up of insulation measures is much greater in area based schemes where there is no upfront cost or where the offer is free of charge. In Kirklees it has been shown that 3 times more measures are achieved than ‘Able to Pay’ Warm Zones. Priority should be given by utilities to Area Based Approaches where additional funding is offered by partner organisations (such as local authorities) which enable the scheme to be delivered free of charge to all householders. CERT regulations will be adjusted to encourage these initiatives. An alternative to the universally free insulation offers would be a Pay As You Save type arrangement repaid through energy bills but only if this will be feasible for this round of CERT.\nReal Time Displays – It is recognised that Real Time Displays have a real role to play in helping householders reduce electricity consumption and raising awareness of energy use. There is however a danger that they could be the new giveaway taking over from CFLs. We propose that RTDs are only given away to householders as part of area based approaches and are installed in the home and demonstrated to the householder by Energy Advisors trained to at least City and Guilds Energy Awareness level.\nEnergy Advice – This will be credited by CERT but only where it is delivered in the home as part of an Area Based Scheme by trained staff to at least City and Guilds standard.\nMonday, 5 July 2010\nVote 'Greening Kirklees' you know it makes sense\nWhere else would you go for the very latest in cutting edge green policies and politics. It is of course this very blog 'Greening Kirklees'. Would I get some momentary satisfaction if I git a high ranking and a big vote in Total Politics Best Blogs awards. Of course I would, I'm a politician.\nLib Dem Voice are one of the sponsors of these awards so we should be expecting a dodgy graph shortly showing how its a 2 horse race between them and the Tories to win!\nSunday, 4 July 2010\nWhat will become of Performance Indicator 185\nAs human civilisation begins it's planned collapse ( at least north of the home counties) you have no doubt been losing sleep over how the cuts in public spending are going to affect national performance indicator 185. For the benefit of the half dozen people in the UK who don't know, 185 is the measure by which we judge how individual local authorities are doing in terms of reducing carbon emissions resulting from their own operations. This generally means things such as carbon from the vehicle fleets, use of energy in public buildings, powering the councillors free beverage machine in Crown Court buildings etc. With the abolition of the Comprehansive Area Assessment Regime (star ratings for Councils) the whole performance framework and what it's for is thrown into disarray anyway. I mean to say if civilisation is going to collapse and you're the government in charge you don't want anyone actually measuring it do you?\nIf we are still measuring emissions for national government (I guess we are but must find out) then its just been a good week for 185 in Kirklees. The Environment Unit has just moved out of Estate Buildings on Railway Street and gone into relatively more carbon benign premises in Civic Centre 3. With staff cuts already coming into affect the opportunities to fit more staff in less buildings is finally becoming a reality. Gone are the plug in electric heaters in victorian stone built offices and now into gas heated offices with solar water heating and electricity and the erm... wind turbine, wel the one that's still working anyway. The Environment Unit move is just one example of the reorganisation of the Councils offices and of course reducing costs is a bigger driver right now than reducing carbon emissions. The question has to be asked though as to whether or not this is a good thing? Estate Buildings is still there, it has not had a snazzy eco-refurb with internal insulation and a biomass communal heating system installed. Presumably if someone came along tomorrow and wanted to rent that office from the Council then they would soon be in there using plug in electric heaters.\nReducing Council carbon emissions is of course a good thing, but it should demonstrate an approach which improves the Council's carbon hungry stock or our vehicles not simply discards them to be used by others. Of course that would require money! Difficult things have suddenly become more difficult.\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",

Last year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the United Nations sponsored body produced a special report on Climate Change stating that serious action to limit emissions was too slow and that if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change then action needs taking now. Currently it is estimated that the Earth's temperature rises by an average of 0.2 degrees every 10 years. So with global temperatures already estimated to be nearly 1 degree above post industrial levels we need to act very swiftly to have a chance of stabilising our Climate. Last years IPCC report said within 12 years it is now 11 years and the clock is still ticking downwards.\nSo what does this mean for us as local authorities?\nMany of us (over 100 now at the last count) have declared Climate Emergencies. The first was in Bristol City Council following a motion proposed by the Green Party Councillors there. Many Councils have now followed their lead including my own Kirklees Council.\nIn Parliament the Green Baroness Jenny Jones introduced a Climate Emergency debate to the House of Lords and Caroline Lucas MP raised it first in the Commons as an Early Day Motion and in May Labour tabled a motion which was agreed.\nLast week Leeds City Region announced that all the Councils within their boundaries will be net zero carbon by 2038. This target is undoubtedly tough but not enough. 2038 according to the science is 8 years too late, but it is a start and we should embrace it as an encouraging first step. Leeds City Region is a huge area consisting of the Councils of Leeds, Bradford, Wakefield, Kirklees, Calderdale, Harrogate, Craven, Barnsley, York and Selby so to get this degree of joint commitment is impressive.\nThe new Leeds City Region Climate Coalition needs a new committed partner and that has to be the UK Government. All the Council Leaders in the City Region need to send a letter to whoever the Prime Minister is next month and tell them \"Congratulations you are now a member of the Leeds City Region Climate Coalition!\". With membership comes responsibilities and we need their commitment to ensure we reach even the 2038 target and certainly the 2030 target that we really need to achieve.\nThe concern now is that feeling that the Councils that make up the Leeds City Region don't really appreciate what they have signed up to and consider it 'Business as Usual' but with a few green initiatives. What is needed now are robust action plans that demonstate what actions will be taken and by when and how much carbon emissions will be reduced by and how quickly.\nA demonstrable sense of urgency is essential in a climate emergency\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

By not allowing people their right to peacefully protest North Yorks Police unequivocally put themselves on the side of Third Energy and against the right for people to legally demonstrate their opposition. Instead people were effectively 'kettled' and risked arrest if they moved outside the police cordon. Police on the ground appeared to be ready to facilitate the request but were overruled by their remote commanders demonstrating their poor leadership. Not their finest hour but sadly not their worst either at KM. They have effectively 'upped the temperature' by taking a draconian approach that overtly favours the Fracking company.\n| 'Tea Lady' Jackie Brookes on the left with frien |\nThe cost of policing at the Fracking site at Preston New Road in Lancashire has been estimated at £450'000/month. With the heavy and excessive police presence we saw today then we would expect a similar figure for Kirby Misperton. There are enough reasons to oppose Fracking in its own right, but now we have the waste of millions of pounds of police resources protecting corporate interests that threaten our environment and our communities as well.\nThe Kirby Misperton site is expected to commence Fracking within days and is the frontline in the battle against corporate greed, climate change and threats to our fundamental liberties. People of goodwill need to act and get themselves up to Kirby Misperton as soon as possible and as often as possible.\n| With Carolyn Popple, one of the Core Group of No Fracking Way walkers from March this year |\n| Outside the entrance to the Fracking site |\nTuesday, 3 October 2017\nReturn to Kirby Misperton\nFeeling a bit nostalgic today as I headed back to Kirby Misperton for the first time since beginning the 120 mile No Fracking Way trek there in March. Going along the same roads we walked when we began the walk and when I was quietly wondering what I'd let myself in for.\nToday was a positive day. Green Party Co-Leader Jonathan Bartley was doing a visit to the Fracking site to lend his support the dedicated band of anti fracking Protectors (not just Protestors). What was very apparent was the excessive police presence on site. They lined up outside the gated entrance to the Fracking site and we lined up alongside them for a photocall with Jonathan. On a whim I suggested a Mexican Wave and said once the wave had got to the end of the protectors then the Police might want to join in once it reached them. We tried it a couple of times but they weren't playing and stubbonly stood there with their arms folded. \"Boo! You're no fun!\" To be fair I guess they were just trying to be 'professional' but they could have lightened up a bit.\nDespite the lack of Mexican Wave participation today was not a day when relations between the Police and protestors were at a particularly low point. We've seen some real lows at the Preston New Road fracking site near Blackpool and also with the first arrests at Kirby Misperton. Some of the policing has been videoed and has been, lets say, 'heavy handed' and definitely out of proportion to, what have been predominantly peaceful protests. This Policing has to be expensive and is being bankrolled by central government in these times of limited public funding. I asked one of the Police what he would be doing if he wasn't here today and he told me he would be dealing with day to day issues such as domestic violence, attending burgalry scenes etc.\nThe Scottish Government successfully voted to ban Fracking today further demonstrating that the United Kingdom is far from united on yet another issue. This further fuels my, admittedly unrealistic, fantasy of Yorkshire becoming annexed to an Independent Scotland free of dominance by largely southern based, public school educated Tories. We are having to fight our London based Government here while the Scottish people are supported in their opposition to Fracking by their Government. Just doesn't feel right.\nThere is real opposition to Fracking from people across the political spectrum. The Conservative Government is out of touch even with its own electoral base on this issue. A large number of the people there today were retired and some had definitely not been active campaigners before. Fracking is producing a new form of useful productive energy, but it is not what was intended. It is people power and it will grow.\nToday was a positive day.

A cameraman was on hand from Lancashire TV after a short walk out of Longridge we were walking across fields, got lost in the wrong field for a bit then carried on till we came to a footbridge over the M6. Very soon we were on the muddiest canal bank you can possibly imagine. Almost impossible to walk on in some parts but we did. We were greeted to the sight of a heron tackling an eel on the canal bank which held us up for a bit of a natural history display, then we carried on. Leaving the canal we headed towards the penultimate village before our destination: Kirkham.\nIn Kirkham we met at the pre arranged Pub with up to a hundred people there to walk with us for the last 5 miles to Preston New Road. Among them was Natalie Bennett, former Green Party Leader who had come to join us on the last leg. We set off and the drumming and chanting from our long line of fellow walkers. I just felt carried over those last few miles. The Core Group were subsumed within the mass of walkers as we headed by road to our destination. Then we arrived. As destinations go it was not in itself particularly inspiring. A Heras security fence with a row of dayglo guards behind it The chanting continued from us all on the opposite side of road \"No Fracking in Yorkshire, No Fracking in Lancashire, No Fracking Anywhere\". The 8 of us from the Core Group crossed the road with a banner standing in front of the fence for the photo opportunity. It was a lovely moment. To have actually made it the whole 120 miles and to be there with those who had shared the experience, the joy and the pain of walking all those miles.\nWe left the site and walked a short distance to a nearby Garden Centre that had allowed the local Anti Fracking Activists to use a huge polytunnel as their HQ. Lined up in a row at one end were 8 chairs with bowls of warm soapy water in front of them. we were handed red and white roses to hold to symbolise our 2 historic counties unity in the campaign against fracking. I addressed the crowd while standing in a bowl of water. I've got to say that is a first for me. The things I remember talking about was that the struggle we face against fracking being as much a global as well as a local issue. When I talked about the kindness shown to us on our journey I did start to feel a bit emotional as I it had really touched me but held it together as any repressed 52 year old Yorkshireman would. Then I reached into my rucksack and pulled out the Harrogate toffee tin filled with 'holy Yorkshire soil' from Kirby Misperton Protection Camp and we went outside and planted a Yorkshire Oak tree in Lancashire soil and symbolically mixed the soils of our 2 counties around it. Duncan from Blackpool Green Party said a few words and a poem. There were hand shakes and hugs and it was over. Simon Duffy from Huddersfield Green Party was on hand to take me and Louise home to Huddersfield and back to what passes for normal every day life for me. Some time to heal, sit on the sofa and watch crap telly. Heaven!\n\"So did you save the world from the Frackers then?\" was one mildly sarcastic question I have been asked. No unfortunately we didn't that day. If anything it is the people who go to Preston New Road and Kirby Misperton nearly every day to protest who deserve the most credit and will hopefully save the UK from the Frackers I believe. The aim of the No Fracking Way walk was to show that Fracking is not simply a NIMBY issue but that an attack on the environment in one place was an attack on us all. A sort of NATO pact for the Environment. For those places to be in Lancashire and in Yorkshire with all the historical connotations of supposed rivalry gave it additional significance. Walking a 120 miles in 5 days on roads is hard but then we know that if it had been easy it wouldn't have been newsworthy or drawn as much attention and support from people across the North of England as it did. Division is everywhere in the UK. North and South, Lancashire and Yorkshire, Leavers and Remainers and so all actions which reach out and bring people together across divides are intrinsically a good thing to do. So as a proud Yorkshireman I'm also now the proud owner of a Frack Free Lancashire t-shirt. I hope to be wearing it at Preston New Road again very soon.\nSunday, 20 August 2017\nNo Fracking Way - Day 4 - Colne to Longridge\nThe Core Group assembled in the Black Lane Ends Pub car park, just over the Lancashire border, that we had left from the previous night. Today was going to be a manageable 25 miles but because we had fell short yesterday we had to add another couple of miles to take us into Colne. It was a nice morning and the walk into Colne was an easy start down country roads. Psychologicaly we were in the home straight now. One more sleep before Preston New Road Fracking site near Blackpool, tomorrow was a theoretically easier 19 miles.We were well past half way. This morning it felt possible\nAs we reached Colne we were joined by Diane Green from Marsden who was to be with us for the rest of the day. Then it was a long trog towards Barrowford along the side of a busy A road. I was just glad it wasn't going to be like this all the way. Then we turned off to a deserted back road with hardly any traffic with a great view of Pendle Hill. It was eerily quiet and for no apparent reason as I was wandering along I saw a small tree done up with baubles. All quite magical really.\nIn Whalley we stopped for lunch and met up as pre-arranged with 3 Lancashire Greens who were going to be joining us for the rest of the day to Longridge and act as our native guides. As we left Whalley in the far distance a long ridge of land was pointed out to me. At the top of the ridge was the aptly named village of Longridge. It became clear that our day was going to end with a very steep climb. Oh joy! Colin was now comfortably positioned in the passenger seat of Ann's car. Comfort for Colin I guess was anything that didn't involve standing up and walking.\nAs we came to the bridge at Ribchester to pose for a photo a Police van stopped to 'have a word'. All very pleasant but I could hear over the radio someone in another vehicle or a control centre somewhere saying the words 'Fracking' and 'Green Party'. clearly we were being kept an eye on and this was not necessarily a chance encounter. I wondered whether as we got closer to the Preston New Road site tomorrow that we might have our way impeded. Still we had got a plan for that! Some more locals joined us at Ribchester for the last haul up to Longridge and it really was a haul just like the previous day. Another hill that rose for several miles. Our group was stretched out again as we each plowed on at paces we were each 'comfortable' with. In retrospect we should have stuck more together as it wasn't always clear to us all which roads we should take.\nThe light was fading as we reached the Longridge pub where we had agreed to met a great crowd of Lancashire Anti frackers and Green Party members. We sat down exhausted and were gratefully to be plied with sandwiches, chips and beer. From there we were whisked off quite a way to Burnley for a Public meeting at the Methodist Church in the Town Centre. We had a good Lancashire audience and I explained the thinking behind our walk, showed the audience the 'holy soil of Yorkshire' in my Harrogate toffee tin. I could sense other members of the Core Group had heard the same 'jokes' now for 4 nights on the trot. Well I say 'sense' they had actually told me.\nWhat was really lovely was that on our last evening all the Core Group were going to be all together. Burnley Green Party members Jai Redman and Andy Fewster had a huge Victorian house and served us a beautiful meal as we talked about the last few days and looked forward to tomorrow. They really looked after us.\nOne thing I was acutely aware of was that I was now sore, very sore! It was a great house that we were in and I was on a comfortable blow up bed on the very top floor. I made my way up the stairs gingerly and wondered about tomorrow. The idea of walking 19 miles in this sort of pain was not appealing yet it had to be done. Following a bit of research for reassurance on the web, Compeed wasboldly carefully applied to places it may never have been applied before. Feeling a bit more confident and patched up a bit I fell into a deep sleep. Preston New Road and the end of our quest tomorrow.\nAs we reached Colne we were joined by Diane Green from Marsden who was to be with us for the rest of the day.

Then came Ed Carne to join us at the starting point that day. Ed told us how he was always walking round here and knew the paths really well. Ed talked to Nigel Corser (ex Army) and they nodded in agreement a lot while looking and pointing at the map. Ed knew what he was doing. Ed wore a bushmans hat! I had been usurped as the Fellowship of the Frack's navigator and felt pretty good about it! Colin Noble on the other hand did not feel good. He had applied 'Compeed' to his blisters the previous day and then removed them in the evening. Compeed acts like a second skin and isn't supposed to be removed like a plaster. Consequently Colin's feet had gushed blood rather spectacularly. He decided to soldier on and recompeed at the earliest opportunity.\nWe set off and soon our footpath entered a muddy farmyard as I passed the farmer I asked him \"Is this the way to Blackpool?\" and smiled. Then we were crossing boggy fields, went over a river and started working our way up the hill and foumd our way onto another farm driveway which became a country lane and at the top of the lane we met up with a group of about half a dozen Greens from Ilkley and surrounds. They were going to be with us all the way to Lancashire. We were back on country roads again and had saved ourselves a huge detour.\nIt was now a tale of hills. Down we went into Ilkley around lunchtime and we went into Boots to buy up all their Compeed, pain killers, cushioned insoles, that sort of thing. As we got to the main street we were greeted by a big crowd of new walkers plus a table with tea, coffee and cake. My feet were tired. I didn't know before this walk that feet could get tired but they undoubtedly were and we had another half of the day to go. So after posing with a huge banner our much enlarged group set off towards Silsden and back\n| Clive Lord - No Way Fracking! |\nHeading out of Silsden along a canal was a novelty and a nice break from the traffic, not that we had seen that much on the roads we had taken for most of the day. Then we were heading up another long deserted road. I remember this from the recce I had done with Ann Forsaith in January and of course it seemed much shorter in the car but I knew that near the top of the hill was a sign saying 'Welcome to Pendle' and therefore Lancashire and shortly beyond that a nice looking Pub. When one of the people who joined us that day pointed out a footpath we might take that might be a little shorter and take us all the way into Colne I could see us losing the picture of us entering Lancashire. I decidedfor good or ill we would plough on. It was a very long way and the group must have spread out over a mile. By the time we all reached the 'Welcome to Pendle' sign people in the Core Group , now at the end of Day 3 were exhausted and some us were very clearly in considerable discomfort.\n| Lancashire border - no checkpoint! |\n| Janet Russell |\nTime to take stock. It had been tough and the Core Group were clearly not all in the best of shape. My chafing required a wee bit of attention. Colin's feet were shot and he clearly wouldn't be walking tomorrow and was assigned to help Ann in the support vehicle. Otherwise we were all up for it. Getting into Lancashire, going past half way and the warmth and care we'd had at the end of the day were all good reasons to carry on. Back to Andy Brown's, topping up the Compeed, the careful application of soothing creams, on with the compression tights and sleep. Onward to deepest Lancashire tomorrow.\nTuesday, 15 August 2017\nNo Fracking Way - Day 2 - From Brafferton to Harrogate and Beyond!\n| Day 2 start in Brafferton |\nThen we set off. 4 Days to go. We were joined by a woman who'd been searching around for us. More the merrier on our rolling band of folk. Next stop Boroughbridge. The way to Boroughbridge was long stretches of busier straight roads with rather flat featureless fields. It was clear that Tom was suffering and as we got to Boroughbridge he sensibly bowed out. We'd lost our Gandalf and his nifty satnav GPS gizmo. He would make his way back to York but not on foot! Not to be defeated Tom did later did make the 120 mile journey a few months later but this time by on the bike with a group with the inspired title 'Tour de Frack'.\n| Boroughbridge |\n| No Fracking Way enters Knaresborough |\nKnaresborough which we were about to go though. The political nature of our walk meant that he couldn't offer us a Civic Reception, wear his chains of office or offer us the Freedom of Knaresborough but he could walk with us and welcome us to his Town. From what I have heard of Freedom's of the Borough this honour usually gives you the right to let your flock of sheep go through the Town Centre unimpeded or you can march your battalion through with bayonets fixed. We definitely weren't sheep neither did we own any and there was probably more than enough pacifists in our group to ensure that we would never have need of bayonets. There was a particular pleasure however of shaking the hand of a Green Party Mayor by the 'Welcome to Knaresborough' sign.\nAfter a tasty lunch in Knaresborough at a great cafe called Henshaws staffed by people with learning difficulties we headed off towards Harrogate. I got a garbled, difficult to hear, phone call from someone called Brian who said he'd come from Darlington to join our walk. We caught up with him, a white haired pensioner and it appeared he wanted to come along for the whole thing and join our Core Group. OK this required a bit of logistics regarding where to sleep. It got sorted by Ann in the support vehicle. Thanks Ann!\nHarrogate Centre was where I wanted to stop but we still had about five miles to go to the end of our walk. I was very conscious that every mile we didn't do one day would be added on to the following day. So the Core Group started making our way out of Harrogate leaving our friends from Harrogate Green Party behind on a constantly rising path by a very long busy road which seemed to be unending. Surely it was shorter than this when me and Ann recce'd this back in January in the car? I wondered why the path was there anyway much as I'm in favour of facilities for pedestrians. Who used it? Who would want to use it? I was glad it was there but I reckoned we were the most pedestrian traffic it had seen all day. Mercifully we got off this main road to a still rising country road heading towards a National Trust car park rendezvous out in the countryside. Eventually we got there with a great view of Fylingdales 'Golf Balls' across the Moors. It was beautiful, the sun was low in the sky but it was still light. This was to be the beginning of a cross country section across footpaths and little used country roads but most of that was for tomorrow.\nWe decided to finish by going across a short section of woodland that took us to another road and another car park rendezvous. I had the map and I lead the way! It didn't look too far on the map. The\npath we started walking on became muddy, then boggy, then it was clear that it was getting darker, then I started doubting I was leading us on the right path. I was quietly 'crapping it'. The small hut we passed in the forest had the look in the fading light of the sort of place your average axe murderer might hang out in. I ploughed on walking along something which only vaguely resembled a path. Then I heard cars, a road, was that a gate? Thank f*ck! I was relieved and my attempts to style it out with the rest of the Core Group when we reached the Car Park of course didn't wash.\npath we started walking on became muddy, then boggy, then it was clear that it was getting darker, then I started doubting I was leading us on the right path.

I was relieved and my attempts to style it out with the rest of the Core Group when we reached the Car Park of course didn't wash.\nWe were picked up by Harrogate Green Party folks and taken back to a bar for another evening bash in town. I got my bag out of Ann's car and found that you entered the bar by walking up some stairs. It hurt! We got beer and pizza and I said a few words. We all looked pretty knackered. There were blisters on feet, some of were hobbling a bit having stiffened up. Compeed had been applied to feet. We weren't yet half way and I was worried. I knew tomorrow was another tough day. Then the pro fracking Conservative Leader of Harrogate Borough Council arrived bought me a beer and gave me a bed for the night. He is my brother after all.\nSaturday, 12 August 2017\nNo Fracking Way - Day 1 - Kirby Misperton to Brafferton\n| Dawn at Kirby Misperton |\nThe makeshift, homemade camp had its own charm. Temporary looking and colourful with banners from frack free organisations from all over the country. Colin Noble was already there. I spotted him by the wood fire having a cuppa. A few of the campers were there to see us off including Ian in his bushmans hat. Then I met Nigel Corser for the first time. He was carrying a large blue plastic barrel full of food supplies that he wanted to put in the support vehicle. The support vehicle was Ann's little blue Peugeot hatchback which was already crammed with our bags and a large supply of protein bars, a sapling etc. The barrel stayed at the camp!\n| Gathering 'sacred' Yorkshire soil |\nI remembered! \"I have a toffee tin to fill with Yorkshire soil\" I found a suitable patch of earth, posed for the photographer, smiled and filled the toffee tin with 'holy Yorkshire soil'. It is God's own country after all! I wouldn't even let my atheism interfere with that firmly held belief. I put it in the bottom of my rucksack. Time to get everyone together.\nThere was the Core Group of 7 plus about\nanother 10 hardy souls who joined us for the first few miles. We posed for more pictures and then turned left out onto the road ( just as the original Fellowship did when they left Rivendell). We were off! No Samba Band as Kirby Misperton residents wouldn't thank us for that at this hour. No Leo Sayer! His agent had ignored my emails. We were walking with 120 miles to go.\nAbout half a mile into the walk the BBC Radio York van had stopped and the reporter wanted to interview me live for the morning show. I stopped by his radio van and all the other walkers carried on as they should do. I explained about the walk, its purpose and how great I was feeling about it, which I did! Then the reporter recounted a recent encounter he had with someone who said that all these people walking in the road were more dangerous than fracking. I pointed out our 'No Fracking Way' Hi Vis vests, the Highway Code rules that we were following for walking in the road. Interview over and the other walkers were now nowhere to be seen. I pegged it up the road and caught sight of them just heading into the Kirby Misperton village proper. Once I'd caught them up we walked on for about another half mile and came to the point where the fracking site was to be developed, just opposite a farm with a few cows looking curiously at us. This was the point when the Core Group parted ways with those who'd come to see us off. We said our goodbyes, shook hands smiled and hit the road.\nThese were country roads, B Roads, quiet but long. We were to go on a trek from village to village. We came to our first village 'Great Habton'. I'm sure people who lived there thought it was great but like many of the placesit was just a lovely little village. We posed by the boundary sign and I tweeted. This was to become a feature of many of our triumphant entries into hamlets, villages and Towns throughout the walk. We were really getting a pace up. We made our way through Amotherby, Appleton Le Street and Slingsby ( I believe they make Gin there). As we entered Hovingham we were met by a group of about half a dozen folks from Frack Free Ryedale. This really lifted our spirits. People were thinking about us on the way, were tracking our progress and wanted to join us on our quest.\nAs we entered the beautiful village of Hovingham we made a stop at the Worseley Arms Hotel. A country hotel with nice carpets and big sofas. The sort of place that well to do country folk might frequent but on this occasion it was just us. Boots, walking gear and placards. We looked out of place but were made very very welcome sitting by the roaring fire being provided with tea and biscuits. I felt a certain amount of guilt. This was all too pleasant and not what I was expecting at all on this trek. The Manager of the Hotel proudly showed me his 'Frack Free Business' sticker alongside those from Michelin and Trip Advisor. Opposing Fracking was clearly good for business! We set off with still a long way to go. The good news was that for several miles the road we were to take out of Hovingham was closed to traffic for maintenance, but not to us so the next few miles we were able to bomb along without having to be too concerned about traffic. We were joined by Ian and Wendy from Rotherham Green Party. Wendy to walk with us and Ian to take some video footage of us on our trek.\nEntering Easingwold at about 4ish meant we still had a fair trek of another 7 miles before we hit Brafferton where we due to finish for the day. If we didn't crack on we were going to lose the light. In retrospect we spent far too much time in the Pub before setting off. Some of us were looking a bit knackered. It seemed like a very long 7 miles and the sun was starting to go down. Only Louise Galvin had a head torch and someone else had a hand torch. The sharp bends with hedges made this all feel really dangerous and it seemed to take ages before we actually entered our end point, a pub car park in Brafferton, in the dark after 30 miles feeling pretty tired and done in. We were relieved to be retreived by members of York Green Party in a couple of cars. They took us to York for an event in a local Hall in our honour with music, poetry, food and beer! When we got there the boots and walking shoes all came off and we hobbled around or sat down as if we were never going to get up. June Tranmer from York Greens provided us all with a foot massage and we each had some quality time in a footspa she brought. Heavenly! Then I saw Tom Franklin's knee. It had ballooned rather spectacularly and worryingly. He was clearly in some pain. We would just have to see what tomorrow would bring but the thought of losing Tom, our guide, our Gandalf was pretty worrying. This was the first of 4 evenings where we looked after by local Greens and Anti Fracking Activists along the route I was immensely touched by all the care we received along the way. So I stiffly rose and went off with my host for the evening, shared a glass of wine with him before going to bed, donning my compression tights and falling immediately into a deep sleep.\nAs we entered the beautiful village of Hovingham we made a stop at the Worseley Arms Hotel. A country hotel with nice carpets and big sofas. The sort of place that well to do country folk might frequent but on this occasion it was just us. Boots, walking gear and placards.

Louise's Facebook feed was full of pictures of her on various runs and fell races looking terribly energetic. Her bandana proudly declared 'vegan runner'. If I had to get a suitably descriptive bandana it would have to say 'omnivorous slob'.\n| Louise Galvin |\nGeorge (Georgina) Perry was from Leeds Green Party and worked in the health sector. For a while I'd got her mixed up with the George (Georgina) from Lancashire who had helped us work out the route. I'm easily confused.\nSo we had a magnificent 7 walkers plus Ann Forsaith in the support vehicle. I christened us 'The Fellowship of the Frack'. There were 8 of us, just like in 'The Lord of the Rings', we were being guided by a tall guy with a beard (Tom). I of course was the moody, good looking (self deluding) Aragorn. I would have to be careful about how far I should take the analogy because that would mean we would be equating our final destination in Lancashire with Mordor, the home of the army of Orcs and that\n| Colin Noble |\nwere seeking to seeking to send.\nThe day of the walk drew near. We were to assemble in Scarborough at a 'kick off' meeting in the towns Central Library on the Tuesday night. After a leisurely trip I met up with Louise in Scarborough she found a Vegan Friendly cafe on her Vegan eating app and we strolled towards it. I remember thinking it was a bit of a long walk to the cafe (it wasn't) and then thinking If you think thats a long walk Cooper what sodding chance will you have of completing this walk you fool!\" I can be a bit tough on\n| Georgina Perry |\nanimal unfriendly burger and chips. We strolled towards the Library. I remember feeling stuffed and unenergetic \"No backing out now Cooper you idiot!\" I thought. The hall in the Library was beginning to fill up a bit for our 'send off' event with about 40 or so in the audience and a panel I was on with representatives from the Green Party, Frack Free Scarborough, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats and me for the Core Team of Walkers. All good earnest stuff from all the speakers about why Fracking was such a bad thing from different perspectives. I stood up to talk about the walk itself and it occurred to me that I didn't know who Carolyn Popple was or Georgina Perry. I knew Nigel Corser was meeting us the next day at Kirby Misperton Protection Camp where he was camping. In a moment of inspiration I said \" Can\n| Ann Forsaith |\nto applause! Ah! Carolyn Popple doesn't always wear reflective sunglasses. She must be George. Right got that! I then went on to explain that we were the 'Fellowship of the Frack' and that every Fellowship should have a 'precious'. I revealed an old battered Harrogate Toffee Tin which had been the repository for our tea bags back home before I liberated it. I explained how soil would be dug up from Kirby Misperton Protection Camp and carried all the way to Preston New Road where Lancashire and Yorkshire soil would be mixed together. Then the soil would be used to help plant a self seeded oak tree sapling that Ann Forsaith was bringing with her from Yorkshire. This was to be a symbolic act to demonstrate that an attack on land in Lancashire would be an attack on land in Yorkshire. Our soils were mixed, our fates entwined.\nThe meeting ended, we did some photos and went off to our respective beds for the night. We were to set off from Kirby Misperton at 7.00a.m. The next morning we would be on the road. Here we go.\n| The Fellowship of the Frack assembles (minus Nigel Corser) |\nNo Fracking Way - Physical limitations\nWhen people asked about what physical preparation I made so I was able to walk the No Fracking Way I generally replied that I received some good advice, \" 120 miles in 5 days? Don't do it!\".\nAs a guy who could do with losing a pound two or more realistically a stone or three, I approached the task with a certain amount of trepidation. Having come up with the whole idea and fronting it up, the prospect of making a complete 'balls up' of it and having to drop out after a day or two would not go unnoticed and be quite embarassing. Some degree of preparation would have to be done. The walk between our house in Brockholes and Civic Centre 3 in Huddersfield Town Centre was exactly five miles. I tried to get as many of these walks there (and occasionally back) as possible just to build a bit of stamina and confidence. I could bomb along quite happily. It was just like leafleting without having to walk up the driveways and I could do that for hours. On average it took me about an hour and ten minutes. So given the fact that our longest walk was supposed to be 30 miles all I had to do was times my morning walk to work by 6 and it would all be done in 7 hours. This of course assumed no breaks for lunch, no stopping for 'natural breaks', no late starts and no days when we didn't quite make where we were scheduled to be at the end of each day. All of these things happened to some extent or another so we ended up walking from 7.00 or 7.30am most mornings till the sun started going down at dusk at around 6.00pm. So pretty much 11 hour days with occasional breaks.\nI and my fellow walkers were in pain to a certian extent a lot of the time so a couple of paracetemol with breakfast helped. No drug testing on the No Fracking Way fortunately.\nI did get some good advice besides 'don't do it'. The best advice I had was from my old friend Robin was to wear compression tights to sleep in. Normally if I do a long stint of walking for several hours after a long leaflet drop I'll wake up in the morning with stiff legs and walk like your average 90 year old for a couple of hours. After the first night I woke up in York took off the tights and I was amazed it actually worked and the legs were fine. Feet on the other hand were a different matter. I got some good advice on footwear from the Manager at Outdoor World on the Piazza in Huddersfield, which seems to be having a permanent closing down sale. He was really knowledgeable and got me lined up with a good pair of Merrell walking shoes with plenty of cushioning and '1000 mile' walking socks. All good but 10 hours + pounding on tarmac a day takes its toll. I got off relatively lightly on blisters but all of us in the Core Group of walkers got blisters to some extent or another. We discovered the joys of Compeed. Huddersfield Green Party Chair Simon Duffy had told me about Compeed, the plaster that you put over the blisters which then acts like a second skin. We were all using this wonder material that enabled us to carry on walking and according to its website it also helped women in poorly fitting high heels dance all night as well. Though blisters weren't that much of a problem for me the tiring effect on your feet of walking on tarmac meant that every time there was a nice level grassy verge I'd end up walking on it for a bit of relief. Having a camelback in my day sack filled with water and electrolyte to stop me getting cramps was more good advice. It also meant I could drink easily out of a tube without having to go in and out of my bag. Other physical effects of the walk were a certain amount of chafing here and there and the application of soothing creams to tender areas was essential. No more detail on this will be provided you will be relieved to know! Except I'm told it is the area \"between the Funfair and the toilets\". Don't ask!\n| compeed |\nI and my fellow walkers were in pain to a certian extent a lot of the time so a couple of paracetemol with breakfast helped.

There was clearly more to do. How many people could we get on the core group of walkers? Where would they sleep? How sure were we that the route Google picked would be suitable?\nThe first job was to test the route. So in January myself and Ann Forsaith, Coordinator of Yorkshire and Humber Green Party began a 2 day recce in her car of the route. We met at Leeds Station and made our way North to Kirby Misperton Protection Camp. We arrived pretty much first thing at Kirby Misperton. The camp was on land owned by nearby Flamingo Land and permission for the protectors to occupy the land had gone from no permission, dubious permission and now was assumed permission. Word had reached the folks at the Protection Camp and we met the head honcho Ian Crane to discuss our plans. Ian was clearly well connected. We met in a 'studio area' at the camp constructed out of reclaimed wood pallets and plastic sheeting with a comfy sofa and chairs. When I mentioned the Leo Sayer inspiration for the walk he clearly was on more than nodding terms with Leo. He was unsurprised Leo hadn't answered my emails asking him to join me on the No Fracking Way and reckoned my dreams of Leo strutting, singing and dancing with us the 120 miles to Blackpool were unlikely to come to fruition . He did however suggest that he might be able to rustle together a Samba Band to see us off which sounded nice.\nMe and Ann set off in her little blue car to map the route to our intended first stop Easingwold about 20 miles away. Ann had got a load of secondhand OS maps of various ages that covered the whole route which we could use to map out the route in more detail. Easingwold was the village where Fracking loving Tory MP (and once owner of 2 castles) Kevin Hollinrake had his office and perhaps we'd arrange something later in the walk there. The route to Easingwold was lovely and flat, with quiet country roads, not too busy.if it was going to be like this all the way to Blackpool it would be fine.\nWe got some lunch in picturesque Easingwold and carried on to map Day 2 to Harrogate. Again not too bad until we reached Knaresborough then a bit of a steep patch up into Harrogate. So far so good. The next intended route was the A57 from Harrogate to Skipton. It looked fine on Google, a nice straight road. We drove along it for a while but it was clear that this was just plain dangerous. A dual carriageway, busy traffic, no pavement that went on for miles and miles. It was raining with heavy trucks when we did the recce. It could well be like this on the walk itself. \"We would die on this road\" I said with feeling. We would clearly have to find another way. Another way would mean Skipton as a place to walk to would now be out of the question. We would have to walk a more southerly route towards Ilkley and Silsden but there were no obvious roads that didn't take us well out of our way. We did however find a route across country which knocked miles off our route and took us off road all together which would be a relief.\nMe and Ann set off in her little blue car to map the route to our intended first stop Easingwold about 20 miles away.

We did however find a route across country which knocked miles off our route and took us off road all together which would be a relief.\nDay 1 of the recce ended and we met up with Harrogate Greens at Shan Oakes and Bill Rigby's house where they were planning for a By Election in Knaresbrough with the exotically named Green Canidate Boadecea MacLeod. Shan and Bill were the owners of a beautiful Esse wood burning stove and oven that I coveted and Bill, the Mayor of Knaresbrough was the proud owner of the same name as my maternal Grandad 'Bill Rigby' who was an Independent councillor in Newcastle under Lyme (back in the day). The good natured meeting was chaired by the cheery Gilly Charters and there were a dozen or so of round the table. Ann and I explained where we'd got to with the No Fracking Way planning and the Harrogate Greens agreed to arrange an evening event and join us for some of the route. All good.\nAnn went home to Leeds and I stayed with my younger brother Richard in Harrogate. Me and Richard have a lot in common. He trained as an election agent and so did I. We both were elected as Councillors on the very same day in May in 1999 and we both lead our political groups on our respective Councils. That's pretty much where the resemblance ends as he is the Tory Leader of Harrogate Council and is pro fracking. When the subject of me and my brothers differing politics comes up someone usually says something like \"Christmas must be fun?\" Actually we do usually get together as a family and things are pretty survivable and even pleasant. We did have one dodgy moment when my youngest son Toby at a family Barbecue said to Uncle Richard \"Dad says all Tories are scum\". Some time and some wine later we dealt with that issue. Our 2 boys have been exposed to our political views over the years and if something like the Bedroom Tax or ATOS assessments is featured on Channel 4 News the words \"Tories are scum\" may pass my lips. Actually if all Tories were like my brother and one or two other Tories I know then we'd be in a much better place. Well we would be remaining in the European Union at least.\nDay 2 of the recce saw me and Ann carry on and work our way from Silsden to the Lancashire border. We found a lovely straight rising country road that took us up to remote 'Welcome to Pendle' sign. A symbolic and important point on our journey. We stopped and I posed with my passport by the sign. Not far beyond the sign at a junction was a pub. That might come in handy!\nFrom there we had to cut short our recce to go and meet some Lancashire Greens in a cafe in Burnley to do some planning with them. It was a lovely break and we met about 8 Greens including longstanding stalwart Green Party member and all round good guy Dave Penney. A number of really good things came out of that meeting. Jai Redman of Burnley Greens said the whole of the Core Group of walkers could stay at his big house in Burnley on the last night of our walk. A meeting was arranged for the evening in Burnley and best of all we met George. She was a keen cyclist and route finder extraordinaire and would do the Lancashire recce to Preston New Road for us and send us a GPS Map of the route. This was great Lancashire Green Party had done us proud. We left for home, back to Yorkshire in good spirits.\nFrom there we had to cut short our recce to go and meet some Lancashire Greens in a cafe in Burnley to do some planning with them.

This was great Lancashire Green Party had done us proud. We left for home, back to Yorkshire in good spirits.\nSunday, 23 April 2017\nNo Fracking Way - the beginning\nThe No Fracking Way was inspired by Leo Sayer though I'm not sure to this day that he knows it. Eclectic though my musical tastes are I'm not your natural Leo Sayer fan. He doesn't make me 'feel like dancing' but I came across a song of his on Ŷoutube called 'No Fracking Way' a rock anthem in support of the Austalian Anti Fracking Movement. I immediately learnt things such as Leo Sayer had moved to Australia, he didn't like Fracking and he could knock together a tune that I did quite like. Then it occurred to me, \"What if there was a real No Fracking Way like the Pennine Way or the Wolds Way?\" This would be a Way where you could walk between 2 relevant Fracking points.\nAt the time we had 2 approved Fracking sites in the North of England. The Planning Application to allow Fracking at Preston New Road, near Blackpool had been rejected by Lancashire County Council but they had been overruled by the Conservative Government in Westminister displaying their customary lack of respect for local democracy. No such minor inconveniences in North Yorkshire as the Conservative County Council did the bidding of their Whitehall masters and passed the plans despite huge local opposition.\nI had attended the first day of the 2 day planning meeting in Northallerton to decide whether Fracking was to be allowed near the quiet village of Kirby Misperton. The evidence provided by those opposing was considerable and compelling on health, transport, climate change and other grounds. North Yorkshire County Council was aware there was a lot of public interest in the Planning Application and set aside 2 areas for supporters and opposers of the Planning Application. On the left hand side of the path to the Council Offices it was like a festival. About 300 colourful protestors with banners including the 'Nana's from the Lancashire Anti Fracking movement were demonstrating not just their solidarity with us Yorkshire Folk but also showing that women of a certain age can be full of passion, vitality and political awareness. Very inspiring. So what about the right hand side of the path? Well it was fenced off like the left hand side. Sensible precaution to avoid mingling and potential trouble between opposing groups. Likewise there were portaloos provided. How thoughtful. The principle difference was the lack of anybody on that side whatsoever. You'd have thought the Fracking Company would have instructed all their employees to have a picnic there but obviously that didn't occur to them. It was pretty clear where the strength of public opinion lay. The proceedings of the meeting were transmitted to the crowd outside to the sound of cheers and boos as appropriate. In my role as Green Party Energy Spokesperson I gave interviews to the Yorkshire Post and to the BBC. In fact the BBC made me give 2 interviews as I couldn't be there for the 2nd and final day of the Planning Committee meeting. One interview was my reaction if the Planning Application was refused and the other if accepted. I was in turn jubilant and outraged. The following day I was outraged. The Conservatives and an Independent Cllr had accepted the application against the express wishes of their communities. Like many my view was this wasn't the end of the matter and was in fact was a call to arms.\nSo back to the No Fracking Way. We had our 2 points to walk between, both provided by the Conservative Party. So a check of the distance on Googlemaps indicated around 120 miles. I thought doable in about 5 days but then I am by nature fairly optimistic/foolhardy. I emailed the Yorkshire and Humber Green Party Chair Ann Forsaith with the idea and she immediately liked the concept but not my idea of doing it in January. I was keen to get the whole thing out of the way early in the year before the election season kicked in. I was due to be helping get North Yorkshire Greens in their elections in May so didn't want to be wrapped up walking for days really. I was overruled and quite right too really.\nI'd originally thought I'd be doing it on my own or I would walk one way and Green Lancashire County Councillor Gina Dowding would walk the other and we'd meet in Skipton. I did ask her but she wasn't too keen on that due to lack of availability. Now we had more time to plan and prepare, we could recruit a core team of walkers. Dates of Wednesday 8th March to Sunday 12th March were agreed as when we were to undertake the walk.\nThis thing was actually going to happen.\nThis thing was actually going to happen.\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",

The course was run by Chris Bax and Caco of 'Taste the Wild' who run wild food and foraging courses. The idea of foraging is not to replace your weekly shop by scavenging around the countryside but to increase peopes awareness and connections with the local environment around you by having knowledge of food that you can use in cooking that could be growing on a verge in a hedgerow or a local field. Chris was clear that the rise in interest in local food has been fuelled by the television programmes of Hugh Fearley Wittingsall and Ray Mears. There were a good dozen or so folks, mainly from Newsome, on the course and everyone seemed to enjoy learning about wild food on a sunny day around Stirley. The use of nettles, rosebay willow herb and sorrell were all explained and I'm looking forward to feeding it to the kids! Here's some pics from the day.\n| The spear thistle - unexpectedly tasty |\n| Once stripped the Spear thistle is quite like celery and goes well in a stir fry |\n| Chris with a pig nut.

Would you agree with me that equating her actions to that of the supporters of Al Qa'ida or ISIS is wholly inappropriate? Given that there may well be protests against fracking in West Yorkshire, how are you going to ensure that the people who are trying to protect their communities from fracking are not put in the same category as people who support violent terrorist activities and are treated accordingly by West Yorkshire Police?\nThere is at the heart of this issue an interpretation of the ‘Prevent’ Strategy that seems to label all people who oppose Government policy as extremists. This is not the approach that we need if we are to have a healthy democracy. Don't you agree?\nOf course we would like an apology from West Yorkshire Police, but we would also like to offer to meet to discuss how West Yorkshire Police can have a better understanding about the activities and motivations of Green Party activists and other peaceful protestors. I think this is essential to ensure protestors are understood by the Police and are treated respectfully.\nYours sincerely,\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper\nLeader of the Green Group on Kirklees Council\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

There will be a much greater emphasis on insulation schemes with 68% of the funding going on such schemes and they reckon that around 3.5 million homes will be insulated by December 2012. There is also to be less emphasis on gizmos and gadgets, I guess they mean Energy Display Monitors - which might be a mistake if applied too rigorously. There is however still no statement from the government as to whether or not the previous governments target of insulating all homes by 2015 remains a target. So there are still significant questions over the governments ambition but if schemes like the Kirklees Warm Zone are to take effect what should we be looking for in the new CERT regulations? Here's my top 5 'asks'\nArea Based Approaches – Area based approaches will be positively encouraged under new CERT arrangements particularly for insulation based schemes. A minimum of 75% of CERT funding, allocated to insulation measures, should be dedicated to area based insulation programmes. Area Based approaches are by their nature more cost effective as more installations can be carried out in a day by crews working in the same street and better prices can be achieved through the tender process. In this way economies of scale can be more easily realised and reduce the cost of carbon saved.\nLocal Authority linkages - All area based programmes shall be delivered in partnership with local authorities who will be encouraged to link them with with a income maximization advice/benefits advice package to reduce the likelihood of households being in fuel poverty.\n‘Free’ Area Based Approaches – It is recognised that take up of insulation measures is much greater in area based schemes where there is no upfront cost or where the offer is free of charge. In Kirklees it has been shown that 3 times more measures are achieved than ‘Able to Pay’ Warm Zones. Priority should be given by utilities to Area Based Approaches where additional funding is offered by partner organisations (such as local authorities) which enable the scheme to be delivered free of charge to all householders. CERT regulations will be adjusted to encourage these initiatives. An alternative to the universally free insulation offers would be a Pay As You Save type arrangement repaid through energy bills but only if this will be feasible for this round of CERT.\nReal Time Displays – It is recognised that Real Time Displays have a real role to play in helping householders reduce electricity consumption and raising awareness of energy use. There is however a danger that they could be the new giveaway taking over from CFLs. We propose that RTDs are only given away to householders as part of area based approaches and are installed in the home and demonstrated to the householder by Energy Advisors trained to at least City and Guilds Energy Awareness level.\nEnergy Advice – This will be credited by CERT but only where it is delivered in the home as part of an Area Based Scheme by trained staff to at least City and Guilds standard.\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2021_10_facts-and-nothing-but-facts-labours_html/content_562.html": "I got accused of a number of things at the last Kirklees Council meeting by Labour Cabinet members including \"politicking\" \"spinning\"and \"making up my own facts\". I found this particularly annoying as all I did was quote the facts provided by other independent and professional people with no political axe to grind . Facts that the Labour Administration of Kirklees found inconvenient to say the least\nI raised the issue of Kirklees Council's plans to remove over a 100 mature trees as part of their road widening plans on the A629 at Edgerton. Since the previous Full Council meeting a number of inconvenient facts had emerged that didn't fit their narrative. The first of these was the response to the Planning Application of the widening scheme from the Council's own Tree Officer. He gave a number of facts in his submission. These were:-\nIn the report\nit says,\n“There appear\nto be several errors and points of confusion in the document.”\nIt goes on to\nsay\n“This document\ndoes not provide underlying evidence to validate its claims and the underlying\ndata does not appear to have been published. Without such data it is almost\nimpossible for the reader to have meaningful engagement with the assessment.”\nIn detailed\ncriticism the report cites serious defects in the report\n“The accurate\nquantification of emissions must be questioned when over 8000 of the\napproximately 8900 HGV movements described are effectively ignored by assuming\nthat the majority of the construction waste will remain on the site”\n“Where does\nthis material go and how much Greenhouse gas is not accounted for if removed?\nEach of those waste materials stored on-site will need removing at some point.”\nThe report goes\non to cast doubt on the accuracy of the measurements made in the Council\nreport.\n“If all of the\ndocument has had the CO2 divided by 3.67, then the whole of the emissions\nreported in the document could be significantly out by a factor of\napproximately two thirds.”\n“In summary the\nreport says without an appraisal detailing the whole life benefits or\ndis-benefits of this scheme; and without having a Kirklees wide road map in\nplace setting out year on year emissions savings required across the KRN, it’s\nimpossible to state whether any benefits predicted as part of the A629 will\nsupport Kirklees in meeting its objective”\nAnd the highly respected Woodland Trust said in it's submission to the Planning Application\n\"should not be taken forward on the grounds it does not comply with national planning policy\".\nWhilst the council has pledged to plan more than 700 new trees to compensate for the loss of those being chopped down, the trust says the offer is not sufficient.\n\"New planting simply cannot replace the value lost when mature trees are removed, and such planting can never replace the loss of ancient and veteran trees.\n\"This large-scale loss of trees from a council scheme is simply inappropriate and alternative solutions must be found to prevent the loss of these trees.\"\nIt also considers the plan to be \"not consistent\" with the council’s own policy within its Local Plan.\nThese are not my \"made up facts\" but the views of respected organisations and professionals.\nThe A629 Widening scheme has a serious credibility problem and at present Labour appear to be doubling down in their backing for the scheme but they risk blowing their claims to having any legitimacy to be a leading 'green' Council. They may make the mistake of believing that this is between me and them. It isn't. They risk alienating the large community of informed environmental organisations in Kirklees who are their real critics. Critical friends should be valued and their evidence not dismissed and negated.\nSo what next? There are all sorts of ways of addressing an issue like this. If I am cast as an opponent as opposed to the critical friend that I regard myself as, then I'll just have to reconsider how to affect change. I have some ideas.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Imagine if this sort of refurbishment was carried out to the millions\nof old draughty homes across the UK. Millions of people would save hundreds of\npounds in energy costs that would go back into the local economy.

Despite this I have still got a number of things to report back on in from the past year.\nI spoke out at the Kirklees Council Budget meeting this year against the cuts which were being imposed on us by central government. I and my Green Party colleagues are opposed to the reductions in budgets and services for elderly and disabled people. Green Councillors engaged fully with the budget process to understand in detail what the implicatoions of the cuts were and what, if any room for manoeuvre there was and in truth there was very little. What disappointed me was real cuts in provision being presented by the Labour Party as ‘improvements’. We should be straight with people about the impact of decisions we make even if they are unpopular.\nI was actively involved in the protest on the land between New Laithe Hill and High Lane earlier this year. It was great to see so many people turn out and the photograph of the crowd there has been used on a number of times in the Examiner highlighting our opposition. The land is used regularly by walkers,especially dog walkers & children as recreation area's If this land and the land adjacent to Jackroyd Lane and Newsome Road was developed Newsome would lose its individual identity and become an extension of the town centre.\nI also spoke out at the scrutiny enquiry into the future management of council housing in Kirklees. I thought that the proposals to include non housing services in the new contract needed more work to see if they would benefit tenants and also that there had not been enough information or consultation with tenants on how the new proposals would affect them. I am pleased that this matter was then referred back to Cabinet and it has now been agreed that the management contract will continue on the existing terms until more information has been provided to tenants and that tenants and there representatives will be fully consulted to see if they agree with any proposed changes before they are implemented.\nMy main activity this year as a Councillor has been to take up local issues and concerns. Here are just some examples\n• I asked Kirklees Highways to address an issue on Colne Street, Aspley by the carpet warehouse and the Flyboat Pub where the road surface was worn down to the cobbles in places and had numerous potholes.\n• I sought to get a supply of grit for the residents of Aspley some of whom are unsteady on their feet.\n• Another road issue I took up was potholes on Daisy Royd Newsome.\n• Drains on Cross Lane Primrose Hill were overflowing at the bottom end of the road and I asked Kirklees Highways to get these cleared.\n• I was contacted by local residents about Bankfield House in Taylor Hill. Planning permission was granted in 2008 and the site was secured, work started and construction materials were brought onto site. However nothing has happened for the last couple of years and residents are concerned that the site is not secure and boundary panels frequently fall over or are vandalised. I asked the Council to contact the owners to ensure the site was properly secured. This is an issue I’ll be keeping a close eye on\n• I have taken up a number of complaints regarding empty properties around the Newsome Ward. At a time when we are under pressure by the Council and central government to build more houses it makes no sense that we have so many standing empty\nThese are the ‘bread and butter’ issues of being a local Councillor which affect people’s everyday lives.\nI’ve played a key role in getting the thousands of leaflets out to you that we get printed and distributed using our own funds and legwork. If you’d like to help us with either this would be greatly appreciated.\nI have joined my fellow Green Party Councillor Andrew Cooper at some of the Green Party advice surgeries at the Monkey Club, Armitage Bridge that we hold on the first Sunday of the month between 1pm and 2pm. Please come along if you have any issues you would like to bring to our attention.\nA Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you all\nCllr Graham Simpson\ngraham.simpson@kirklees.gov.uk Mobile 07814 239317\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

They were elected by 24% of the electorate and with 37% of the 'popular' vote. Due to the quirks of mathematics in our flawed First Past the Post electoral system the Tories are the UK Govt with 100% of the power. I don't regard them has having any real democratic legitimacy. They don't even have the good grace to behave like a benevolent illegitimate Government. They trash industries which will give us a safer environment, they make poor people poorer and give tax breaks to the rich. The lack of compassion and arrogance of the Government is contemptible.\nSo other than having a bit of a rant what am I trying to say here? Well if they are an illegitimate Government behaving against the interests of large swaithes of the population then I regard them in the same way as I would regard a hostile occupying force working against the interests of many people. It is genuinely how I feel and I think it is dangerous when people find themselves feeling about the Government of their country in this way. Imagine if you can a Labour Government getting elected on similar quirky mathematics as this bunch of gangsters. Sure, it may well behave in a more benevolent fashion but its legitimacy is just as questionable. Until Labour genuinely embrace electoral reform they will not fundamentally change our country for the better and our society , our communities and our country will remain divided, angry and unstable.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2016_07_my-7-priorities-as-deputy-leader_html/content_801.html": "Winning elections at all levels of Government is important to convey our ideas and to put them into practice. We need to value the people who work on the ground to make our Target to Win Strategy a reality. We also need to celebrate good practice and electoral success much more in the Party to build a culture of contesting elections professionally and to' demonstrate that we can win to a wider proportion of the electorate. Andrew has organised successful election campaigns in Kirklees for over 20 years. As a Target to Win Pioneer he will be a strong and informed advocate for those needing support for their election campaigns.\nGiving a voice to the Regions\nSome good progress has been made through the appointment of Regional Campaigns Coordinators to help build the capacity and capability of the Green Party at the local and Regional level. The Party needs a perspective in the Leadership Team that can speak with experience and authority from outside London and the South East. As a Councillor From Yorkshire with 17 years experience as a Local Cllr, Andrew is ideally placed to fulfil that role.\nInvolving members\nAn active political party needs to be able to respond quickly to changing events. We should also ensure we involve our Party bodies and members in strategic decisions as much as possible. The Green Party needs to avoid situations where our position on key issues are made by pronouncement. One very practical issue Andrew would pursue if elected as Deputy Leader is to initiate a consultation with local parties on 'Progressive Alliances' asking for views and opinions to feedback to relevant Party bodies so your views are taken into account.\nWidening our reach.\nThe Green Party's support is often perceived as being white and middle class. There are some good examples around the UK where that stereotype is challenged due to dedicated work by local Parties but we need to do more. Andrew is already working closely with groups like Muslim Engagement and Development MEND to challenge Islamaphobia and the Governments ill conceived 'Prevent Strategy'. As someone who has been elected to an ethnically diverse area of Huddersfield Andrew has strong links to community organisations representing BME communities at the local and national level. We also need to show how we are relevant to the many communities who are suffering most from our deteriorating services. We need to demonstrate that Green policies provide workable solutions addressing the need for secure affordable housing, worthwhile rewarding employment and ensuring the people with the greatest needs have good support and good services.\nThe benefits of a Councillor as our Deputy Leader\nThe Leadership of the Green Party is likely to have a strong Parliamentary focus. As Deputy Leader and an experienced Local Councillor Andrew would provide knowledge of the impact of Government policy on the ground. Andrew will provide practical input based on the real life experience of implementing policy at the local level. Elected politicians bring an additional degree of credibility to our Leadership Team whether they are an MP or a Councillor.\nWorking with others to address Climate Change\nDeveloping workable plans and policies to address climate change should be a top priority for the Green Party. As Deputy Leader Andrew would forge stronger relations with NGOs and businesses that share our objectives to build our credibility and provide a robust challenge to Government and other Parliamentary parties on practical action to achieve the Paris Climate targets and beyond. Andrew has worked for over 20 years in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sector and has strong connections with key organisations.\n'Progressive Alliances'\nThe idea of a Progressive Alliances is on the Green Party's agenda as a Strategy being considered in the run up to the next General Election, whether that is in 2020 or possibly much sooner. To be successful a Progressive Alliance will need to have a popular programme that can draw support across a large proportion of the population. It will need to have more broadly based policies than being simply about achieving Electoral Reform. If it is to have wide appeal we will need to demonstrate that Green policies can provide jobs, tackle climate change address poverty and provide secure and affordable homes. Acheiving policies which reflect Green Party values will need to be a key part of any deal. Andrew is a skilled and experienced negotiator who has delivered Green policies on the ground on a Council that has been hung for 17 years.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2016_07_speech-to-yorkshire-says-no-to-fracking_html/content_932.html": "I’m Andrew Cooper, a Councillor in Huddersfield and the Green Party’s National Energy Spokesperson.\nI was in Northallerton when the Kirby Misperton Fracking\nApplication was being considered. The evidence was poured over for 2 days and\nNorth Yorkshire County Council were well prepared. They set up 2 enclosed areas\noutside County Hall in Northallerton both were considerately provided with\nPortaloos. One area was set aside for the Protestors and another area was set\naside for the Fracking supporters. Now I’m pretty sure that no one used the\nPortaloos on the Fracking supporters side due to the simple fact that there was\nno one there to make use of these facilities. What did happen in Northallerton\nto the shame of the County Council was the decision to allow Fracking near the\nvillage of Kirby Misperton. The decision was met with disbelief. Of course given\nthe same evidence as a Councillor with years of planning experience I would\nhave voted against.\nOn my own Council, Kirklees, I am proposing an addition to our Local Plan documents so when 3rd Energy or Cuadrilla put an application in our area, to extract shale gas they will have to demonstrate that their application will not result in a net addition to CO2 emissions. Now I don’t think that’s possible but at a time when we have the 14th or 15th highest global temperatures ever, I believe they should have to prove it as a part of any planning application.\nNow a word for my Labour opposite number Lisa Nandy MP the Labour Opposition Energy and Climate Change Secretary (Is she still? I don’t know) Her response to the Kirby Misperton decision was this,\n“ We need robust rules to offer communities reassurance that\nthe environmental risks will be properly managed.”\nLabour doesn’t get it. Even if you trusted the companies\nreassurances, even if you regulated it\nto somehow or other make it safe, you still cannot manage the environmental\nrisks of extracting and burning more fossil fuels when we need to keep those fuels\nin the ground. Our local and global\nenvironments simply cannot afford to let fracking happen. It must not happen.\nThe alternatives to fracking are available now. Energy efficiency, insulation are the way we should be ensuring our energy security, by making homes warmer and reducing energy demand, but Government has cut funding massively for these measures while keeping energy demand high and reducing costs for those poor hard pressed energy companies.\nSo we have the wrong energy priorities from Government, a\nfundamental misunderstanding of the problem with fracking from the opposition.\nSo it comes down to us. We are the people and we are the ones who are going to\nhave to stand tall, to speak truth to power. Simply being right is not enough.\nWe must challenge robustly every application, every proposal, exercise our\nright to peaceful civil disobedience and protest, refuse to pay fines. Make a\nnuisance of ourselves.\n2016 has been a bloody awful year so far. Friends let us come\ntogether, let us be united and let’s tell them NO Fracking Way!\nENDS\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Not so much chance to be torn to pieces there. He enjoys the limelight!

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2017_05/content_475.html": "The Democracy Commission Report is significant and its recommendations\ncan take this council further forward with our engagements with local citizens.\nThere are however some real missed opportunities that could have made this\nreport even more far reaching than it is.\nThere are 4 areas I’d like to\nhighlight which I guess form my minority report.\nProportional\nRepresentation for Local Elections\nIn Scotland they have just had their local elections using\nthe tried and tested Single Transferable vote method where the percentage of\nvotes more closely align with the number of elected Councillors. Proportional Representation. This fairer\nsystem doesn’t favour particular parties it favours the electorate and their\nwishes. So under a First Past the Post System in Scotland at the last elections\nall but 3 MPs came from the Scottish National Party whereas in the local\nelections that they have just had the number of Cllrs elected reflects the vote and\nbizarrely one of the beneficiaries of this system was the Conservative Party\nwho would have had far less representation in the traditional archaic electoral\nsystem we have for local elections in England. I’ll leave that there and to be\nfair it was always a non starter as a recommendation sensible though it would\nbe.\nOther potential recommendations should have been less\ncontroversial.\nLocal Elections every\n4 years\nAs Commissioners it was our role to go where the evidence\ntook us and the vast majority of it said that all out elections every 4 years\nwere good for the governance of public bodies like the Council. Of course there\nis concern about how accountable this makes us politicians but there lots of\nprecedents for elections every 4 years e.g. County Councils, the Greater London\nAssembly, Scottish Local Authorities, Doncaster Council, Rotherham Council and\nour own Government. This Council can be in a state of almost constant electoral\nwarfare. No sooner have we finished one election than we start another.\nDifficult decisions that need to be made due to financial pressures get fudged.\nWe need to be able to present a programme to citizens for a four year term so\npeople can really judge how well their council is over a reasonable amount of\ntime. Local elections every four years could become event not the usual trek\nfor the faithful few to the polling station. This is not one of the recommendations\nbefore you and in my view it is a shame.\nReducing the number\nof Cllrs\nAnother recommendation that is not here is to reduce the\nnumber of Councillors. Some good arguments have been put as to why we need to\nmaintain the number of Councillors we have and to be fair I agree with those arguments.\nSo what is the proble?m. Well I also agree that we should not be cutting funding\nfor roads. I also believe that we shouldn’t be shutting Libraries. I firmly\nbelieve that many of the 1000s of people that have left the Council’s\nemployment were doing a good job and I think perfectly good arguments could\nhave been made to keep many of them. The problem is that our budgets have been\nslashed hugely by the Government. We need to demonstrate to show the public\nthat elected representatives share the organisations pain. It is about giving\npeople confidence that we as Councillors don’t regard ourselves as untouchable\nor insulated from harsh realities\nHuddersfield Town\nCouncil\nThe last thing I’ll mention is not specifically excluded\nfrom the report and that gives me hope and that is establishing a Huddersfield\nTown Council. Next year will be the 150th Anniversary of the founding\nof the County Borough of Huddersfield and it would be marvellous if we could\nmake some real progress to establishing a new council for the area. Town\nCouncils have recently been established in other areas. They have access to\nfunds we don’t. By their nature they are closer to the people and have a\nstronger local connection by their very nature. As Kirklees considers the abolition\nof district committees, as funding is cut back we need to provide people with hope\nand show them that there is a plan to not simply manage decline from Kirklees\nCouncil but find new forms of democracy that they can identify with, be part of\nand know is on their side.\nTogether these 4 proposals would provide a radical and I\nbelieve popular change to Democracy in Kirklees that would capture local\npeoples imagination, trust and enthusiasm",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2020_03_corona-virus-crisis-what-do-you-need_html/content_609.html": "Kirklees Councillors were informed by email on Tuesday that the funding would be added to the Ward Budgets that they control for activity in the wards they represent.\nKirklees Green Party Leader and Newsome Ward Councillor Andrew Cooper said,\n\"This funding provided by the Council at this most difficult of time is very welcome. What Newsome Councillors want to do is get people to give us their ideas. The sort of ideas we are looking for are things that help morale in the community, provide support to vulnerable people in the community and ensure that we come out of the crisis with local businesses intact. The funding is not limitless but I'm keen to harness the power of the community to help us through this public health emergency. I and my Newsome Ward colleagues have been impressed by the willingness of people to help their neighbours in this most unprecedented of circumstances. These are the people who can see the needs that may not be being met and the things that may make life a little better. \"\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

In reality their view on this reflects a lot of Tory grassroots and backbench views and you can imagine a lot of defections of Tory activists who prefer UKIP populism to what they regard as 'political correctness gone mad!\" - wipes foam from mouth.\n| Nigel Farage on climate change |\nThere's a lot that has been said about UKIP in the last few days, probably too much. How can yet another right wing free market party make a real difference to British Politics. Do people really want another party that wants to make the rich even richer than the Coalition are doing? Will their Councillors who have been elected so easily be any good or do they merely represent a snapshot in time of dissatisfaction with the current larger parties by voting for one which in reality is very similar to them if more unpleasant with a speciality in being against UK membership of the European Union? Any envy here? You bet there is. I very much wish the Green Party were celebrating as many gains in UKIP rather than the steady progress we make at each local election? Our steady progress may be more lasting and sustainable but it is darned frustrating.\nWhat I'll concentrate on is UKIP and climate change. For one thing they don't believe it's happening. They are in the late stages of 'Canute Syndrome' - see earlier post. They fit into the 'climate change is a left wing green theory to damage our economy' camp. Classic conspiracy theory folks with all the contrived unscientific un-peer reviewed 'evidence' to back up their stridently expressed views. \"Climate Change? as harmless as smoking in pubs\" they might say. This has led to a 'policy' urging Councils to get rid of 'useless Climate Change Officers'. It exhibits a total lack of understanding of the fact that many of the staff with these titles have already been made redundant not because they were 'useless' but simply due to the financial pressures Councils have been under . Kirklees itself has lost many staff in the Environment Unit in the last few weeks. Staff working on climate change don't simply sit at their desks musing about global climate change most would be running programmes to improve the energy efficiency of council buildings, reducing energy costs and saving money as well as carbon emissions. They would be in charge of projects drawing in millions of pounds of finance to insulate homes saving householders money and tackling fuel poverty.\nThe UKIP stance on climate change officers is just one example where prejudice drives their policy rather knowledge or experience. In reality their view on this reflects a lot of Tory grassroots and backbench views and you can imagine a lot of defections of Tory activists who prefer UKIP populism to what they regard as 'political correctness gone mad!\" - wipes foam from mouth.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

I came out as 75% green. Then on Politics compass my dot was right on top of the green one. If I'm honest, I didn't know that the greens had policies on anything aside from the environment, so it came as a surprise to read the policies on education, immigration and defence. However, now I have read them, I feel that I can run along quite nicely with the greens (as long as they can accept that I like my hybrid 4x4 and I'm not vegan).

We (in the Green Party Climate Change Campaign Groups) have been talking about how we can make such plans as a part of the Green Party's next campaign after Breathing Cities. I think that making them for particularly 3 sectors - transport, food and energy - makes a lot of sense. Most things connect or are somehow linked with these at a council level. Maybe logistics and provenance or procurement can be argued as a cross-cutting or another sector, but I would say it fits into transport and energy by proxy. <br /><br />All of these need planned for transitions, if we aim to reach the 2030 targets set by Green Party Policy (or even in some cases the 2025 targets set by XR) rather than the laggardly targets of 2050 set by the Tories - though I think they are beginning to waver and trend toward 2040. <br /><br />What can be useful is if we have beacon projects and councils (anywhere in the world, but EU, Northern EUrope or UK are better for our purposes of promotion) to showcase these, highlight what we have done as councilors and councils with a Green conscious and even more to provide contacts for others to follow.Coatlesshttps://www.blogger.com/profile/06202458933343469368noreply@blogger.comtag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7196059482061221339.post-65364399131192262062018-11-26T06:37:05.533+00:002018-11-26T06:37:05.533+00:00The Greens'success in Altrincham has less to d...The Greens'success in Altrincham has less to do with any \"comfy persons luxury\" and more to do with a well organised and committed group of people, working bloody hard in their community.

Manchester has recently stated commitment to some wonderful policies most of which are undermined by abysmal levels of government funding and further by a dreadful lack of autonomy . Practically every meaningful attempt to 'green' my home city is beyond the remit of local people , councils and MP's . Transport , housing, education, health , social services , infrastructure , taxation , housing benefit levels - are all determined by an antagonistic Tory ideology. All of these factor into not only the plausibility of change on an administrative level but also on a very personal level vis a vis priorities : survival, shelter, food and income . The only Green councillors are in the leafy, wealthy part of my borough of Trafford . My guess is that those that have successfully attained a comfortable level of personal living have the time and inclination to think about global issues - the rest are either protecting their wealthy privilege or concerned about how to change a system that leaves them insecure and lacking any prospects . For many years I supported the LibDems ( only for the promise of PR ) so I'm aware of the stigma attached to a party that is neither hard left or hard right and how hard it is to stand apart from tribal , ingrained political views . In my opinion the Greens need to take a position that is opposed to neoliberal ideology ( which is vehemently against anything but growth and profit - end of story ) and place itself as firmly on the side of : people , planet , ecology, justice ; and against unfettered, unregulated corporate avarice however that may manifest . At present that is clearly NOT the perception or place that Greens hold in the UK - they are a comfy person's luxury , not a poor person's saviour; a country folk's dream and an urban irrelevance. A group in Trafford ( Breathe Clean Air Group) do sterling work ; many other small groups work on a similar fringe way and badly need the exposure that a political party could ( with will ) promote as frontline policies to the wider public & parliaments. mark gibsonhttps://www.blogger.com/profile/15360852797774641416noreply@blogger.com",

Well if they did they were right in many instances. The obsession with European Union membership, climate change denial, despite no real scientific backing, moral outrage at gay marriage and a belief that all wind turbines are the spawn of Satan are all characteristics of the 'swivel eyed'. Some of these characters seem to be in a permanent state of anger about the wrong things. They are usually so opposed to what they regard as 'political correctness' that they make a virtue of being politically wrong on most issues. Throw into this mix the rise of UKIP (where being swivel eyed is a condition of membership) and you have a potent mix of rabid Tory activists, posh Tory grandees born to rule and a Party which welcomes the deluded with open arms. They can go to UKIP Conferences and presumably be as offensive as they like without anyone raising an eyebrow so long as they're a bit discreet about it. Quite a few of their new Councillors have recently failed the discretion test and are now being taken to task in the media.\nThere's probably about 3 or 4 potential Tory Councillors in Kirklees who I could see jumping on the UKIP bandwagon on the basis of their 'swivel eyed ness'. In many ways these defectors would probably save the local Tory leadership a lot of hassle. More significant for the Tories would be the defection of people who feel overlooked by the grandees, who see others, who they regard as having less ability being promoted over them - a couple of characters in the Lords who have somehow achieved ministerial rank immediately spring to mind. Even more damaging still would be the loss of the saner grassroots Tories who may just feel that Central Office has just lost the plot.\nWhat I find most bewildering about the 'swivel eyed' is the perception that the Tory led government has somehow been held back by the Liberal Democrats. A mouse hanging onto the tail of a charging bull would have more effect at slowing down this right wing government than any number of Liberal Democrat MPs. Now hopefully their own internecine warfare will slow them up, but more likely they'll accelerate to prove how truly mad they are to satisfy certain sections of their rank and file.\nThis is not the end of this Tory story. A madness is descending. Lets watch.",

Huge\ncuts in budgets, totalling £152million, redundancies of over a thousand already\nmade and at least the same again to come. The governance of the Council remains\nwith a minority administration in this instance the Labour Party. It was against this backdrop that I proposed\nat the last Full Council meeting an All Party Shared Adminstration with a\nCabinet composed of leading members from all political groups to work together\nto tackle the problems facing the Council. It is fair to say that it\ndidn’t go down well.\nIf you want to watch the debate starts at 2.44.50 here\nIf you want to watch the debate starts at 2.44.50 here\nCllr Nicola Turner, the new Lib Dem Leader’s line is that\nshe doesn’t have to be on the Cabinet to influence the Council. This is of\ncourse true and is true of every Councillor of every Party but it is a bogus\nargument. The Council’s power lies in the Cabinet as that is where decisions\nare made. To be part of the Cabinet\ngives real power and real responsibility just as the Lib Dems claim they have\nin Government. Maybe they are not so keen on power as they used to be.\nThe real vitriol came from the Conservatives. The\nConservatives usually deploy Cllr Andrew Palfreeman during the budget debates\nto attack the Greens and they rolled him out to address our motion. He often\nuses humour to good effect but not on this occasion. Andrew accused me of being\n‘naïve’ and claimed we had, ‘kept Labour in power’. In reality no other group put themselves\nforward to run the Council following the last local elections and Andrew was\nconveniently forgetting that the Conservatives actually put Labour in charge of\nthe Council in 2012 in return for a disproportionate number of Committee\nplaces. He’s also forgetting that the Greens have supported both Conservative\nand Lib Dem minority administrations over the past 15 years when we have felt\nthere was a benefit to Kirklees in doing so. He referred to the ‘incompetence’\nof the Labour administration which rather begged the question as to why they\ndidn’t want to be part of the administration to deal with it if he really felt their 'imcompetence' was\nsuch a problem. He went on to say that the Greens should, ‘get to the back of\nthe queue where they belong’ and that we needed to be ‘put in our place’. Well\nI guess that was exactly what I was proposing. As the smallest group on the\nCouncil we would have a proportionately smaller voice in a Cabinet formed from\nmembers of all political groups. If anything I was asking the Conservatives to\nactually ‘get in the queue’ and take some responsibility but alas to no avail. Cllr Palfreeman used a quote by George R R Martin the writer of Game of Thrones in his speech saying I was denying a 'hard truth' that the Greens had put Labour in power. Of course the most famous, and oft repeated quote from his book/hit TV series 'Game of Thrones' is ' Winter is coming' meaning there are hard times ahead. Hard times are coming for Kirklees and the Tories want no part in managing the depleted finances that their Government have given us.\nThe meeting ended in shambles. The Mayor didn’t allow me to\nsum up at the end of the meeting and no vote was taken on the motion which\nprobably suited a lot of people in the room who weren’t over keen on being\ncounted on this issue. Cock up? Conspiracy? Who can say? What the debate did\nmanage to do was to shine a spotlight on the fact that running Kirklees Council\nis not a particularly attractive prospect. In hard times the sidelines is a\nvery comfortable place for some parties to be. There are Parties who say a Green\nvote is a wasted vote. Voting for Parties who won’t take responsibility sounds\nlike a wasted vote to me.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

I should get a good book you might say, but my reason for reading this was because I'd been informed that it would prevent small community organisations installing solar PV panels benefitting from the Feed In Tariff if they had received public money. This was particularly important in Kirklees due to the Community Buildings Energy Grants which had appeared due to a Lib Dem amendment to the council budget last year (for details see this blogpost from Feb 2010). Ironically the Con/Lib Dem Government now threatened to pull the rug from under the scheme taking all the lasting benefits and making the 'Big Society' somewhat more difficult to acheive. Schemes like the solar panels for Newsome South Methodist Church were under threat.\nI spent a good hour or so reading, and re-reading the document to make sure I was right but could see that according to the 'Amendment to article 8' on page 4, that if grants were paid to community organisations before the end of June and the solar panels fitted before October then the Feed In Tariff would remain intact for those churches, sports clubs and community groups seeking funds from the Community Buildings Energy Grant. I made the relevant officers and the Leader of the Council aware and soon the Chief Exec was geting involved finding ways to fast track the grants. Hopefully many schemes which were under threat will now proceed but this is a one off loophole which will soon close. With further reviews of feed in tariffs on the cards confidence among the renewables industry is not exactly at an all time high.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Obviously the Tories abstaining at the Annual Council meeting on the Leadership and allowing Labour to run the Council presented him with a bit of a dilemma. Here's how he dealt with/rationalised it and my response below that.\n“Local people gave the Labour Party an increased number of\ncouncillors showing we’re in tune with residents,” were the resounding\nwords of Clr Mehboob Khan after his re-election as leader of our\ncouncil.\nI and others were unhappy that the Conservative councillors decided to abstain from the vote.\nThis is to a degree understandable when all they would face would be derision at failing to oust Clr Khan from his secure seat.\nIf the Conservatives had voted against Clr Khan it would have made\nno difference whatsoever. He is leader by the constitution for four\nyears even though he puts himself up for re-election each year it’s a\ncase of the winner of this year’s one horse race is. The Labour Group\nhas 32 members and the Conservatives have but 18.\nIf, however, Conservative Clr Robert Light had put up for council leader not one of the other groups would have supported him.\nThe Greens would not have voted for an alternative. It was the votes\nof the four greens three years ago which lost the Conservatives control\nof the council. The Lib Dems would not support the Conservatives nor\nwould the Independents.\nThe four independents – three of whom are now in with the Green\ngroup – voted against and the other independent voted for Clr Khan.\nThis year was the first time the Greens voted against Clr Khan and\nthe main reason being they did not get the chair of Scrutiny Panel or\nany chairs of major committees which they wanted.\nThey therefore voted as a matter of pique rather than policy.\nLabour is the largest party and so by the constitution has to form\nthe administration. All other minor groups would not support the\nConservatives running the council.\nPerhaps Clr Andrew Cooper and Clr Kath Pinnock would care to explain\nwhy they would not support the Conservatives in running the\nadministration as the major opposition party thus trying to break the\ncycle of negativity from the clueless Labour party.\nR J Bray\nShelley\nAnd my response\nR J Bray says in his letter (Examiner, May 28) “Perhaps Clr Andrew\nCooper and Clr Kath Pinnock would care to explain why they would not\nsupport the Conservatives in running the administration’’.\nThe fact of the matter is that they never sought support and never made a ‘pitch’ to other groups.\nI tried to get the non Labour groups round the table on a number of\noccasions to discuss how to address the leadership of the council and to\nput pressure on the Labour Party on issues of mutual concern, such as\nthe libraries, but to no avail.\nThere simply wasn’t the will for joint discussions from the Conservatives.\nPersonally I have no particular enthusiasm for either Labour or the\nConservatives running the council but my prime concern, in a hung\ncouncil, would be about the policies they were seeking to pursue and\ntheir willingness to involve other groups in decision making.\nThe Greens have supported (and opposed) all the other political\ngroups on the council at different times on different issues on the\nbasis of the policies and their impact on local people.\nAnother statement by Mr Bray in his letter was “the Greens voted\nagainst Clr Khan and the main reason being they did not get the chair of\nthe Scrutiny Panel or any of the chairs of major committees that they\nwanted”.\nThis maybe what he believes but it simply isn’t true.\nClr Khan threatened to remove the Green Party from chairing the\nResources Scrutiny Panel if we didn’t support him as Leader before we\nmade our decision.\nIt would be true however to say that these threats did inform our view of his character as a potential leader of the council.\nIn the end we didn’t support him because we couldn’t get a firm commitment on policy issues, including the libraries.\nAs a consequence of our decision at the annual council meeting\nLabour voted in favour of the Conservatives taking the Chair of the\nResources Scrutiny Panel from the Green Party and Valley Independent\nGroup as punishment to us and as a reward to the Conservatives, for\nabstaining on the vote on the leadership, thus allowing Mehboob Khan to\nbecome Leader of the Council.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper\nCo-Leader of the Green Party and Valley Independent Group\nA blog by Green Party Councillor Andrew Cooper about Green Politics, action on Climate Change, Kirklees Council and our activity to improve the local and global environment (and also anything that I fancy talking about) Promoted and published by A Cooper, 76 Brockholes Lane, Holmfirth HD9 7EB\nShowing posts with label Lib Dems.

I feature towards the end with our new Cllr Robert Barraclough\nAt the count giving an interview for the Kirklees Election tales team.\nAt the count giving an interview for the Kirklees Election tales team.\nTuesday, 9 August 2011\nWalking the walk\n| My preferred mode of travel |\n\"Fact of the evening (according to Cllr Khan at least): #Green Cllr Andrew Cooper has four cars #doastheysaynotastheydo\"\nIt's difficult to work out who to be more annoyed with, Cllr Khan for lying or Cllr Blanchard for repeating it.\nThe truth is that we have only one car in our household and went down from 2 about 2 years ago and have never had more than that. Also I generally don't use it as I either walk to Huddersfield or use the train or very occasionally the car if I need to go somewhere where I'd need a car or to trasport something heavier than I could carry any distance. I also use City Car Club if I need a car but my better half needs ours.\nMy advice to Cllr Blanchard would not to necessarily believe everything Cllr Khan says nor to repeat it without checking it out first. He could also have a look at Cllr Khan's car. Very nice and flashy with a personalised number plate.\nThursday, 28 April 2011\nGreenbelt letters\n| Also available in pork! |\nGreen view of Lib Dems - Examiner - 26/4/11\nI SEE the Lib Dems’ claim to aim to protect the green belt in their manifesto.\nThis at odds with Lib Dem and Conservative Policy in government where brownfield quotas for building land are being abolished, putting more pressure on the green belt.\nThey also claim to want to protect services for the vulnerable, having voted with the Conservatives for huge cuts to these services in Kirklees.\nPeople are not stupid and the Lib Dems and Conservatives should not only be careful in their public statements, but should also aim to be credible in their stated policies and not try to mislead people. Otherwise the view many people have of them following the tuition fees fiasco will be reinforced and politics as a whole will be further devalued in the minds of the general public.\nClr Andrew Cooper\nLeader, Green Party Kirklees Council\nWe protect green belt - Examiner - 27/4 /11\nI SEE that Clr Andrew Cooper is once again castigating the Lib Dems and Conservatives over green belt policies (Examiner Mailbag, Tuesday April 26).\nOne of the most effective ways of protecting the green belt is by sitting on Huddersfield Planning Committee or the Heavy Woollen Planning Sub-Committee where decisions about green belt and brownfield sites are made. Yet no Green Party councillor will sit on any planning committee.\nSo, when Clr Cooper talks about responsibilities, policies and green belt, he needs to look to his own party first, particularly here in Kirklees.\nPerhaps the electorate, whom he purports to represent, should start to ask questions as to why the Greens will not sit on any planning committees where decisions concerning green belt are made.\nClr Christine Smith\nChair of Planning and Highways Committee, Kirklees Council\nAnd my response...............\nCouncillor Christine Smith , Conservative , criticises the Green Party for not having a Councillor on Planning Committee. As she well knows despite not being a member of Planning Committee I have been a regular attender of it, referring applications for decision and representing views of constituents. I was the only Councillor who was not a member of Planning Committee to make representations regarding the Tesco’s Development and the proposed replacement Hotel on Castle Hill. The real scandal here is that the larger parties rarely send anyone to Planning Committee to represent the views of constituents. As Cllr Christine Smith also knows being a member of Planning Committee restricts the ability of its members to represent local people effectively as they are bound by planning protocols. Ironically you can be a much more effective at protecting your local green spaces by not being a member of the Planning Committee and she knows this as someone who has voted for development on Lindley Moor.\nI do notice however that in her criticism of me and the Green Party she does not contradict my view, and the Campaign for the Preservation of Rural England’s view, that the latest Coalition Planning Policy statement made during the budget is a significant threat to our green belt and greenfield sites. I would be really interested in her role as Chair of the Planning Committee how she responds to CPRE’s and my concerns.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper\nGreen Party Leader – Kirklees Council\nTuesday, 5 April 2011\nThreat to greenfield sites from the Liberal Democrats\nHere's a letter I sent to the Examiner in response to a Lib Dem Councillors letter praising the total hash the goverment seem to be making of planning policy at the moment. On the one hand offering 'localism' on the other making it easy for developers to build on green spaces:-\nLib Dem Councillor Tony Woodhead amazingly makes a virtue of the Coalition Governments relaxation of planning rules (Examiner Letters 4/4/11).

There is to be a presumption in favour of development, quotas for bulding on previously developed 'brownfield' land are to be abolished placing more pressure on greenfield and greenbelt sites. Councils are to be encouraged to auction off land in their ownership. I find it unbelievable that the Lib Dems and their Conservative masters regard this as good news. Are these the same Lib Dems and Conservatives who are saying how keen they are to protect the greenbelt in their rather misleading leaflets?\nThe Campaign for the Protection of Rural England said of the Coalition Government planning statement,\n\"The planning measures present a potentially devastating threat to the countryside and are unlikely to boost long-term economic growth. To suggest, as successive Governments have done, that planning is a key impediment to growth is just wrong. The planning system exists to prevent unsustainable, unwanted and environmentally damaging development\".\nCouncillor Woodhead and the Lib Dems/Conservatives cannot have their cake and eat it.

Many appear to have the memories of goldfish where Labour is concerned and of course we'll never know what the alternative universe would be like if Labour had won the General Election but I reckon it would have still been a slightly different but still the unpalatable cocktail of cuts that we are experiencing right now.\nSo now we head into May, the local elections and the Alternative Vote Referendum. This I think was the Lib Dems single biggest error during their coalition agreement negotiations. The inequities of the first past the post electoral system are well known. Governments can be chosen by a minority of the electors and most constituencies are 'safe seats' so it is only the votes in a minority of constituencies that decide the election. This is not a matter for a referendum it is about what's right. Either the Tories should have simply agreed to a system of proportional representation or there should have been no deal, this should have been a 'red line' for the Lib Dems. Instead we have a question on an inferior version of 'PR' on offer which is acually not even proportional. A binding agreement to support the introduction of the Single Transferable Vote was what the Lib Dems should have insisted on. Of course we need to back the improvement that AV offers in the referendum but it's association with the increasingly unpopular Lib Dems might ironcallly work against it in the ballot. The word 'fair' has been so contaminated and misused by this government that valuing 'fair' votes and been seen to be rewarding the Lib Dems by supporting AV might not sit well with many people. I mean how do we feel about putting the duplicitous Nick Clegg in a position of power after the next General Election? Though electors may have the memory of goldfish where Labour are concerned I don't believe they are going to forget the broken Lib Dem pledges for a long, long time.\nMonday, 13 December 2010\nThank Goodness it's not too bad in Surrey!\nToday the Government revealed the impact of it's cuts on Local Government across the Country. As you can imagine I've been concerned about how leafy Tory Surrey might fare under a leafy Tory Government. I needn't have worried just a 0.3% decrease. Naturally I also was wondering what might happen to Dorset fortunately the Government saw sense and actually raised their funding by 0.25%. The good news just kept coming with Hampshire, West Sussex, Buckingham and Richmond Upon Thames all escaping the worst of the cuts.\nYou can imagine what would have happened if these Councils had received the same level of funding cut as Kirklees or Leeds or Bradford with all the job losses, cuts in services and closed libraries and facilities that these Councils are likely to face. Fortunately for us Northern types there is an answer for the jobless provided by David Shakespeare Conservative Leader of the Local Government Association. David suggests we could all come down south and pick fruit on their farms. This would have the added benefit of taking jobs away from Romanians. Smart eh! David is also the Leader of Buckinghamshire County Council with a very reasonable 0.6% cut so naturally he's fairly pleased and feeling generous enough to let us help out on their farms.\nSo are the Conservatives and their Lib Dem 'pets' out of touch? Well we are 'all in it together' but in the North we are up to our necks in it while in the south it barely reaches beyond the soles of their green wellies.\nYou can imagine what would have happened if these Councils had received the same level of funding cut as Kirklees or Leeds or Bradford with all the job losses, cuts in services and closed libraries and facilities that these Councils are likely to face.

Was there a value in it? Yes I think so. You could certainly get an insight into our meetings you wouldn't have had otherwise. Take for instance the Lib Dem amendment on opposing the cuts to provision for Schools Sports Partnerships. The Greens supported their amendment. When I tweeted to this effect the twitterfeed from Kath Pinnock rather churlishly said 'Shame that 50% Green Group absent from Council'. For those of you who don't know there are only 4 us. One of our 4, Cllr Julie Stewart-Turner had to leave the meeting as she was a Governor for Newsome High School, a Specialist Sports College and had an interest in the motion, and Cllr Graham Simpson was late because he was attending a Tenants Association meeting. So a rather unpleasant attack on the Greens who were actually supporting a Lib Dem Amendment. I thought they could do with all the support they could get at present.\nAnother Lib Dem Amendment we supported was one on Planning Protocols. The amendment insisted that Cllrs on the Planning Committee attend training on Planning (what else). The Conservaties were opposed to this as many of them hadn't gone to training and were quite happy to spout away in an uninformed fashion at Planning meetings potentially leaving the Council open to challenge during an appeal process. My contribution to the debate was to point out that decisions backed up by knowledge should be more important than simple opinion on planning matters. This provoked a rather unpleasant verbal barrage on me by Conservative Councillor Mrs Christine Smith which I found fairly amusing to be honest. I'm not on her Christmas Card list!\nDuring questions I asked the Labour Cabinet Member Councillor Mr Ken Smith what his opinion was of the impact of the rise in Tuition fees on young people in Kirklees. He gave his view that it was potentially disastrous and agreed to my request to write to the Government to express this view. This provoked much comment from Lib Dem Cllrs who defended the tuition fees policy. This directly contradicted the expressed opinions of Lib Dem Candidates during the General Election which I pointed out (and they ignored). I also asked Cllr Peter O Neill what his views were on 'The Big Society'. He gave me a very full response. So much so that I was unable to get my supplementary question in before time was up unfortunately.\nOver 600 people watched the Council meeting on the Web but according to Kath Pinnock webcasting of Council meetings 'doesn't work'. Yes there have been some technical issues that some people have encountered but generally it has gone pretty well. I think the problem for Kath is that it was a Green Party proposal and that gives her a rather jaundiced view on the subject. Cest la vie.\nAfter the meeting I collected a large sealed envelope with the papers for the 'Star Chamber' meeting on Friday and Monday to discuss the Kirklees Budget for the next year. In the envelope are the officers views of how we will acheive the Lib Dem/Con Governments spending cuts. This will not make pleasant reading.\nSaturday, 27 November 2010\nSupermarket Sweep?\n| Dale Winton of Supermarket Sweep fame. |\nWe need to understand how 'the Golden Rule' will work, which says that any savings made will greater than the cost for paying back the measures. With so many different house types, with different usage patterns, different heating requirements this is going to be a tall order and if the golden rule isn't convincing for all householders whatever their circumstances then confidence in the Green Deal will be severely shaken. The other good news is that Private Landlords could be fined if they don't improve the energy efficiency of their dwellings, with Local Councils being able to penalise them up to £5000 for non compliance.\nThis is all good stuff and credit where its due. I don't however believe that Greg's yet given up on his supermarkets as a major deliverer. Lets hope its not a clean (supermarket) sweep when it comes to who actually does the Green Deal and Local Authorities that demonstrate the capability to deliver also get the opportunity.\nSaturday, 20 November 2010\nFeed In Frenzy?\n| A solar farm under construction |\nThe Feed In Tariff for renewable electricity is working and working well. So well, that the Con Dems are already contemplating cutting back on it. When the scheme comes up for review in 2012 they are planning on ‘reducing projected costs by £40 million by 2014-15’. You have to wonder why though. Government does not pay for the Feed In Tariff through taxation, we all do through our energy bills so why is government so concerned? They would have been right to be concerned about ensuring that lower income customers benefit from the FIT through solar installations on their properties but fairrness doesn’t seem to be a priority for this government.\nThough 2014-15 sounds a long way off DECC Minister Greg Barker has said that,\n“in the event of deployment running ahead of published projections would we bring forward that review. But, to reassure the industry further, we will announce the trigger for such an early review shortly”.\nSo there we have it if the policy is working too well the FIT will be cut and soon we will know the limit of the government’s ambition for FIT funded renewables.\nAnother aspect for concern is the Government’s desire to limit large scale ‘solar PV farms’. This statement by Greg Barker in the House of Commons last week sent shivers through the solar industry,\n“we inherited a system that simply failed to anticipate industrial-scale, stand-alone, greenfield solar, and, although we will not act retrospectively, large field-based developments should not be allowed to distort the available funding for roof-based PV, other PV and other types of renewables.”\nThis is clearly nonsense. The Conservatives supported the Feed In Tariff in opposition and were fully aware of the 5MW limit on installations. What is described by Greg Barker as ‘greenfield’ developments could equally be large installations on derelict, brownfield land with little agricultural or amenity value. Far from distorting the market for microgeneration these large PV developments could help drive down the costs of renewables for householders by growing the solar industry and creating large economies of scale.\nThe Government, and particularly the Lib Dems, have made great play of the fact that they will now allow Councils to keep the revenue they make from renewables through the FIT. A prime example is Cornwall Council which is soon to install a 5MW array and this will be a real money spinner for the Council at a difficult time. One of the greatest opportunities for Councils to make back some of the money taken from jobs and vital services in the cuts could be from large scale PV arrays on land that otherwise would have no value to them or to the communities they serve. It now appears that the Government are effectively removing that solar silver lining from their cloud of cuts.\nThursday, 21 October 2010\nLib Dems - They don't like it up em!\nSeeing a Lib Dem motion to Kirklees congratulating the Coalition Govt on it's commitment to tackling climate change was somewhat annoying having seen cut after cut in energy programmes and broken promises associated with the new feed in tariff. So the Green Party Amendment listed many of these and annoyed the Lib Dems because of the length of the amendment but then there were a lot of cuts and broken promises. They also claimed the amendment was inaccurate but never really identified exactly what was inaccurate about it. There was an inaccuracy in the amendment. It said that funding for the Green Investment Bank had been scaled down from £6Billion to £2 Billion. Following the Spending Review yesterday this figure went down to £1Billion. Our apologies!\nThe focus of the Lib Dem motion was the new right for Councils to sell renewable electricity they generate back to the grid and this is indeed welcome but there are a few 'howevers'. One particular 'however' is the fact that a promise to extend the Feed In Tariff to early adopters of renewable technologies such as pioneers like Kirklees has now been dropped by the Coalition government. This means that thousands of pounds worth of funds that could have come to Kirklees now will not. The Lib Dems called for a Green Energy Action Plan to take advantage of the Feed In Tariffs. At no point in the debate did they mention the programmes already being planned such as the £650k worth of PV for Council Buildings or the £12 million for Council buildings, probably because they've had nothing to do with it. You can imagine however that a few months down the line a Lib Dem leaflet will appear somehow linking themselves with these developments. They do have some form in this regard. They poured scorn on the Green Party amendments for a free area based solar photovoltaic programme across Kirklees saying it was 'unaffordable' and a 'fantasy'. They are clearly not following developments in the capital financing of PV projects across the country where all the capital costs and more of the projects are being met by the feed in tariff. Indeed businesses are being set up seemingly weekly offering free PV. A Council led scheme could offer value for money and spread the benefit to households beyond those which are dead on due south with large roofs.\nAnyway for your delectation here is the Lib Dem Motion and the Green Amendment. For the record the Green amendment was defeated by the Cons and Lib Dems but was supported by many Labour Cllrs. The Lib Dem motion was passed.\nLib Dem motion\nCoalition Government's Commitment to Tackling Climate Change\nThis Council congratulates the Coalition Government for their positive commitment to tackling climate change.\nCouncil welcomes the decision by the Climate Change Secretary Chris Huhne to allow local councils to sell renewable energy to the grid, overturning a ban on this activity by the previous Government.\nCouncil recognises that we have a vital role to play in the switch to a new low carbon economy. This decision will allow us to take full advantage of the feed-in tariff and deliver long term benefits to support services delivered by this council.\nThe availability of feed in tariffs will provide this council with an opportunity to generate a significant income and reduce our energy bills via increased micro generation.\nThis Council therefore calls upon the Cabinet to urgently develop a “Green Energy Action Plan” to maximise the benefits and identify potential savings that can be delivered via the use of feed-in tariffs.\nGreen Party Amendment\nDelete all after ‘This Council’ insert\n‘questions the Coalition Government’s commitment to tackling climate change based on:-\n• the breaking of a promise by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats prior to the election to include early adopters of solar panels such as Kirklees in the Feed In Tariff\n• the abolition of the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Spatial Strategy which would have provided strong policies to encourage microgeneration in new buildings.\n• the breaking of a commitment by the Liberal Democrats not to support new nuclear power stations the cost of which will now be borne by the public.\n• the end of a commitment by the previous government to insulate all lofts and cavity walls where technically possible to 2020.\n• the abolition of the Sustainable Development Commission which actually saved the Government money.\n• Cuts of £12.6m from The Carbon Trust's grant for low carbon technology and business support funding from DECC\n• Cuts of £4.7m by cancelling final rounds of Bio-Energy Capital Grants Scheme and Bio-Energy Infrastructure Scheme\n• Cuts of £3m by reducing the scope of the Offshore Wind Capital Grants Scheme\n• Cuts of £3m from closing the Low Carbon Buildings Programme early\n• £2.9m cuts by reducing the scope of the government's Low Carbon Technology Programme\n• £1m cut to funding for development of deep geothermal energy generation\n• £700,000 cut by the closing of renewable technology trials early\n• The damage caused to the solar thermal, biomass and heat pump industry by the long period of speculation over the future of the Renewable Heat Incentive\n• The damage caused to the solar PV and small wind industry by long speculation over the future of the Feed In Tariff\n• The reported reduction in the Feed In Tariff by 10%\n• The halving in funding for Carbon Capture and Storage Projects\n• The reduction in funding from the proposed £6Billion to £2 Billion for the Green Investment Bank\n• The proposed abolition of the Warm Front scheme for Low Income households\n• The 10% increase in funding for nuclear decommissioning\n• The cancelling of the Severn Barrage which could have provided 5% of the UK's electricity needs\nThis Council has the following concerns about the Coalition Government’s ‘Green Deal’\n• An over emphasis on supermarkets as the deliverer of the Green Deal when clearly Council schemes such as the free insulation provided by Kirklees Council demonstrably deliver high numbers of measures while schemes lead by supermarkets have performed poorly.\n• The reported omission of microgeneration from the Green Deal finance package\n• A loan mechanism will not be the most cost effective way of funding low cost measures such as loft and cavity wall insulation.\nThis Council calls on the Coalition Government to ensure the Green Deal\n• makes Councils a key partner and/or deliverer of the programme.\n• enables area based approaches for the delivery of insulation and microgeneration measures\n• has a cost effective way of delivering low cost measures such as insulation measures\nThis Council calls on the Cabinet to\n• develop a free area based solar photovoltaic programme to be made available to all households where technically possible and where there is no impact on Council budgets.\n• Add carbon reduction as a 5th Council Priority\n• Develop a comprehensive action plan to reduce carbon which based including energy conservation, energy efficiency, behavioral change and green energy.\nSunday, 3 October 2010\nThe pickled politics behind local government budget cuts\n| Jabba the Hut - Intergalactic Gangster |\n\"Instead of demanding that councils report back to me on everything they do, it means expecting that they become much more accountable to local residents instead\"\nSo lets get this right, the Coalition Government cuts funding to local authorities and then Councillors have to be accountable for the 'choices' they make. Of course there's very little choice in reality. This week has been redundancy/retirement week at Kirklees Council. The numbers of staff leaving the Council is huge, around 500 are gone with around another 1000 to go over the next few months but even this will not be enough services will have to be cut further to satisfy government demands or as Eric puts it,\n\"For the first time, councils will have real power and a real say over how money gets spent. \"\nanother particularly irritating quote,\n\"We've cut the apron strings which have tied (Councils) to Whitehall for too long, giving them freedom to act on behalf of their residents,\"\nThis is just utter tosh and a degree of spin that would make Mandelson blush (OK maybe not). People are being 'freed' of local facilities, services and income. He makes a virtue of getting rid of reporting such as that needed for the Comprehensive Performance Assessment and more reporting to citizens on how ther money is spent. OK but we do need to report on the impact on public services, the jobs lost, the impact on the wider economy, the health and social impact of cuts, the loss of public facilities. The Conservatives and their Lib Dem henchmen should not be allowed off the hook for their actions.\nThey are accountable too!\n,\nLabels:\nConservatives,\nemployment,\nKirklees,\nLib Dems,\nrecession\nSaturday, 25 September 2010\n\"We're all in it together\" - if you use Public Transport\n| Huddersfield's Free Town bus |\n\"Cllr Andrew Cooper is playing party politics as it is not the government that is choosing to cut this service. The decision is a local one!\"\nYou have to ask yourself what cuts passed down by national government could the West Yorkshire Integrated Transport Authortity make that aren't to public transport! It is what they do after all. If the government gets off the hook as easily with the chap who said this they can cut us to oblivion with impunity.\nThen of course there are the environmental implications of a diminished public transport sector but then this is \"the Greenest Government ever\".\nLabels:\nConservatives,\nHuddersfield,\nLib Dems,\nTransport\nSaturday, 21 August 2010\nGreen Deal or No Deal?\nWe've had the first 100 days of the \"greenest government ever\" and following on from my post on the subject last month we have a number of other green question marks over the Coalition Government's commitment to addressing climate change.\nIn abolishing the Regional Spatial Strategies, where the primary purpose was to abolish housebuilding targets, the government have also abolished the regional renewable energy targets. These were supposed to drive the installation of wind turbines, solar panels and other clean energy sources. With this gone there is very little hope of the UK hitting the EU's 2020 target of 15% of the UKs energy from renewable sources unless government acts quickly to put new policy drivers in place.\nThere is also concern over the government's commitment to high Environmental Performance Standards for new power stations and whether or not carbon capture and storage technology is yet mature enough as a technology to make coal fired plants viable. It is likely that though the Lib Dems supposedly are against using public money to finance new nuclear power stations that ways will be found in making them a reality. This will probably be though our energy bills. So no public money just the publics money. Fiendish or what! Despite all the public statements by politicians on the need for nuclear the case has never been properly made. Most opinions on this seem to be based on belief not facts. Lots of evidence contradicting assertions that we need nuclear energy 'to keep the lights on' can be found at http://www.noneedfornuclear.org.uk/\nSo we are left with reducing energy demand in the home as our best hope for reducing carbon emissions. The 'Green Deal' not the 'Green New Deal' (as promoted by the Green Party at the last election) is what the Government is pinning its hopes on. Roughly the Green Deal will be a loan arrangement linked to the properties energy bills where the cost of measures will be recovered at a rate no greater than the cost of energy saved making it a win win scenario. This is due to be introduced in 2012 as primary legislation will be required to establish the property linked loan. So far so good but the devil is as always in the detail. There are contradictions to overcome. Within a month Greg Barker MP, Tory Climate Change Minister has said solar panels/microgeneration will not be part of Green Deal's finance package and Nick Clegg, Lib Dem leader has said they will. There are questions over whether simple cost effective insulation measures are best dealt with through loan arrangements in value for money terms compared with public/CERT funded area based initiatives like Kirklees Warm Zone. The answer is probably no. So if microgeneration is not to be included and low cost insulation measures are not appropriate that leaves us with solid wall insulation which may be a 'hard sell' for many households. So there are more questions than answers yet and the governments stated belief that somehow finance packages and project management by supermarkets hold the key to reducing household carbon emissions does not bear much examination. If anything it is local authorities in conjunction with energy utility partners that have the best models for delivering mass energy efficiency measures to households not Tescos.\nThere is always hope however and we need to see what can be done to steer the Green Deal on the right path in a world where public money is tight and where the risk of a double dip recesssion is ever present. There are more questions than answers at present and the danger is that models for delivering energy efficiency to householders are designed by people who have never had to deliver a successful energy efficiency project of this kind using untested policy models but I'm sure the government wouldn't do that!\n(Pictured Noel Edmonds creator of Channel 4s Deal or No Deal gameshow and of course Mr Blobby, proponent of cosmic ordering and also an anti wind Campaigner who created the Renewable Energy Foundation that campaigns against renewable energy. I'm not a fan,)\nIn abolishing the Regional Spatial Strategies, where the primary purpose was to abolish housebuilding targets, the government have also abolished the regional renewable energy targets. These were supposed to drive the installation of wind turbines, solar panels and other clean energy sources. With this gone there is very little hope of the UK hitting the EU's 2020 target of 15% of the UKs energy from renewable sources unless government acts quickly to put new policy drivers in place.\nThere is also concern over the government's commitment to high Environmental Performance Standards for new power stations and whether or not carbon capture and storage technology is yet mature enough as a technology to make coal fired plants viable. It is likely that though the Lib Dems supposedly are against using public money to finance new nuclear power stations that ways will be found in making them a reality. This will probably be though our energy bills. So no public money just the publics money. Fiendish or what! Despite all the public statements by politicians on the need for nuclear the case has never been properly made. Most opinions on this seem to be based on belief not facts. Lots of evidence contradicting assertions that we need nuclear energy 'to keep the lights on' can be found at http://www.noneedfornuclear.org.uk/\nSo we are left with reducing energy demand in the home as our best hope for reducing carbon emissions. The 'Green Deal' not the 'Green New Deal' (as promoted by the Green Party at the last election) is what the Government is pinning its hopes on. Roughly the Green Deal will be a loan arrangement linked to the properties energy bills where the cost of measures will be recovered at a rate no greater than the cost of energy saved making it a win win scenario.

I'm not a fan,)\nFriday, 16 July 2010\nHow is the \"Greenest Government Ever\" doing?\nIt is still early day for the new Government but the early signs are not good for David Cameron's claim that this would be the 'greenest government ever'. There have been several damaging cuts to what were already pretty miniscule programmes to support low carbon technologies. These have destabilised small renewable industry installers particularly with regard to biomass. With the cancellation of the Low Carbon Buildings Programme grants and uncertainty over the Renewable Heat Incentive struggling biomass installers are up against it.\nThere was hope by some that the Lib Dems would make the Tories green rhetoric a reality but little evidence is forthcoming yet. During the election campaign Friends of the Earth released lots of yellow balloons outiside parliament representing all the Lib Dem candidates who had signed up to their key election asks (and a few blue ones). When I asked them why they hadn't released any Green ones for all the Green Party Candidates who had signed FOEs asks (like me!) they said that they went out to buy green ones but there weren't enough. Hmmm..... with 'friends of the earth' like these who needs enemies.\nCuts to low-carbon technology programmes:\n- £12.6m from The Carbon Trust's grant for low carbon technology and business support funding from DECC\n- £6.1m 'efficiency savings' and under-spending on programme budgets within DECC\n- £4.7m by cancelling final rounds of Bio-Energy Capital Grants Scheme and Bio-Energy Infrastructure Scheme\n- £3m by reducing the scope of the Offshore Wind Capital Grants Scheme\n- £3m from closing the Low Carbon Buildings Fund early\n- £2.9m by reducing the scope of the government's Low Carbon Technology Programme\n- £1m cut to funding for development of deep geothermal energy generation\n- £700,000 by closing the Energy Saving Trust technology trials early\nMonday, 14 June 2010\nKirklees Leadership - You can have any colour so long as its red!\nKirklees Council’s Annual Meeting, following the last local elections were in many ways business as usual and in some ways very different. As usual no Party had an overall majority on the Council. In fact no single Party had even a third of the seats. Labour were the largest Party following the election with 24 out of 69 Councillors and they put their leader forward to lead the Council for the next four years. The Conservatives with 19 Councillors did not put a candidate before the Council to lead Kirklees and instead, and bizarrely nominated the Leader of the Liberal Democrats with 20 Councillors forward. What was bizarre about this was they hadn’t even asked her before the meeting whether she was willing to be put forward and of course she wasn’t. It was just some strange political game being played out.\nSo the Labour leader Mehboob Khan was the only one put forward. His term is supposedly for 4 years but local elections and votes of no confidence could conceivably bring that date forward as could Cllr Khan’s promise to submit himself for re-election before the Council each year despite their no longer being any legal requirement for him to do so.\nSo the only option put before the Councils was a Labour leader. The four Greens on the Council backed the Labour leader on the basis that we would work together on protecting the local economy as much as we could from the effects of the recession.\n(The picture is from Star Wars and is Garven Dreis who narrowly missed blowing up the Death Star and was shortly after killed by Darth Vader. And the relevance is? His callsign is 'Red Leader'. I guess I could have just put a picture of Mehboob Khan up there but where would be the fun in that?)\nSunday, 16 May 2010\nCon-Dems. Where's the fire?\nThe Con-Dem Coalition Government has a large section on the environment. Leaving aside for a second the fact that the targets they have adopted for reducing carbon emissions are inadequate it is certainly more ambitious than the Labour Govt's programme. As always implementation is the test. It will be interesting to see how the Cons try and get round the financing of nuclear without using public money. No doubt there will be some dodge somewhere that they have in mind. We'll see.\nThere was specific mention in the Con-Dem agreement for support for a \"full establishment for a feed-in tariff for electricity\". What this means we will see but if the Tories are true to their word this will mean that solar photovoltaic installations installed prior to the 15/7/10 will qualify for the feed in tariff. There are lots of ways that this could be interpreted to be more or less generous so the devil is as always in the detail.\nThe Environment section on Energy covers most of the main high level policy areas but oddly there is no mention of the proposed Renewable Heat Incentive due to come into being next April under Labour's timetable. In what has been a fairly lacklustre performance on the renewable energy agenda by Labour this was a real innovation a genuinely ground breaking proposal. It promised a huge growth in the biomass, heat pump and solar thermal industries with users of renewable heat being rewarded with a dedicated tariff.Of course it's omission does not mean they won't pursue this policy but it certainly worth a Parliamentary Question at the very least.\nThe other Labour Government target (which they had no plan to acheive) was to insulate every loft and cavity wall in domestic properties by 2015. It would be interesting to see if this policy is retained and how it will be implemented. The Kirklees programme is due to finish in about 6 weeks with over 50'000 properties insulated in the last three years. So we have acheived the Government target 5 years ahead of target! So another Parliamentary Question worth asking Mr Chris Huhne.\nIf only we had a Green Party MP. Ah we do!\nMonday, 5 April 2010\nBack to the Future.. Again!\nGordon Brown is (we are told) going to put us out of his misery tomorrow and call an election. We know it must be on the cards because he's running out of time anyway and he's really being practicing 'that smile'.\nWhat can we predict over the next few weeks. Lots of muscle flexing over who's toughest on dealing with the deficit is a sure thing but of course tough in a 'responsible' fashion. The truth is that a double dip recession is already in the pipeline. Hundreds of thousands of public sector jobs are certain to go within the next 2 years. This goes way beyond the efficiency savings we would all like to see in Councils and the Health Service. The loss of these incomes will impact on the spending power of many households and have a knock on effect on the economy as a whole. Have political parties not learnt anything about how you come out of recessions e.g Keynesian economics? the New Deal?\nIn their desire to appear 'tough' things could get very tough indeed. What we are experiencing now is the logical conclusion of policies started by the Conservatives in the 80s and embraced by New Labour. The lack of financial regulation got us into this mess and now we are going back to the regressive public finance constraints of the Eighties.\nInstead of the Labour's rather barmy idea of comparing David Cameron to a politically incorrect but popular figure (Gene Hunt - Ashes to Ashes) they would have been much better comparing him to a vacuous american getting into a De Lorean that flies! But then it would be equally fair to superimpose their faces over Marty McFly's visage.\nBack to the Future indeed!\nLabels:\nConservatives,\nGeneral Election,\nLabour,\nLib Dems\nThursday, 18 March 2010\nCarry on Planning!\nThe people of Huddersfield have strong views on Castle Hill and quite rightly so; it is a site of great historical significance, as well as being very much part of Huddersfield’s heritage. People who don't want a public house/hotel there have strong arguments, which I also happen to share. I do, however, accept there are also many people who would like to see a hostelry of some sort built there and have perfectly valid reasons for holding that view. The common factor though, is that people really care about Castle Hill and what happens to the site.\nWith this in mind I was therefore absolutely astounded by the turn of events at today’s planning meeting, when the subject of Castle Hill came up. The two Liberal Democrat Councillors from the Almondbury Ward had to leave the Planning Committee; this is even more outrageous as one of them is Chair of this Committee. They had no option but to leave because they had prejudiced their position by stating prior to the meeting, in one of their election leaflets what their views were on developing the site. They had effectively ruled themselves out of having a vote on a subject which is so vitally important to many people, because they wanted to simply and irresponsibly posture in one of their leaflets. What exactly is the point of voting for Councillors who through their own irresponsible publicity remove their own right to vote.\nThe Almondbury Liberal Democrats irresponsibility on this matter is truly staggering especially as they are supposed to be experienced councillors.\nSaturday, 20 February 2010\nKirklees Budget Amendments - Good, Bad and Bogus\nSo all can now be revealed. The time for amendments to the Kirklees Budget has passed. We will go the budget meeting next Wednesday with a Labour budget based on the financial constraints forced on us by this Government following their mismanangement of the economy. There are 3 amendments, the Conservatives, the Green Party's and the the Lib Dems. We have gained some things out of the budget process. In our amendment we have the extension of the free insulation scheme Kirklees Warm Zone for another 3 years. I tried to get them to rebrand it 'Green Zone' to avoid confusion with the Governments 'Warm Zone' scheme but also to annoy the Lib Dems (see previous posts!). Of course they weren't having it but the issue of confusion between the 2 schemes is genuine and will have to be addressed at some point soon. Not least because 'Warm Zone' is a brand that we have to pay for. There are also opportunities to bring new measures to the scheme free draughtproofing for vulnerable households, electricity saving measures such as Real Time Displays and Powerdown and deliver them on an area by area basis.\nOther things we acheived were in the 'side agreement'.\nWe have a commitment to continue to support the core funding costs of 'Build' the body which provides training in skills for the building trade for brickies, plumbers and decorators until these are picked up thorugh supportive contracts such as Building Schools for the Future further down the line. This is exactly the sort of project we should be supporting at these times.\nWe also have a commitment to develop support for projects promoting local food producers in the area. This has been a strong theme for Julie Stewart-Turner our first Green Party Mayor during her year in civic office.\nThere is a commitment to come up with proposals for a free bus link from Huddersfield Town to the Galpharm Stadium possibly electrically powered. This would provide a link to all the sports and leisure facilities in the area and reduce the need for car travel at a venue which isn't directly served by Public Transport and where the car parks are often full at peak times.\nOur big hope is that we will be able to establish a free solar panel scheme for private householders with the capital costs for the Council being met by the new Clean Energy Cashback being introduced this April. We are due a report in June on whether or not it is a goer. The Lib Dems don't like the idea of this scheme and didn't believe it was much worth pursuing. No doubt if we make it work it will be appearing in a Lib Dem leaflet as one of their initiatives. Bitter? Moi? You bet I am!\nWe have already established the principal of self funding capital for solar projects with the £5million agreed for solar panels for council buildings last year. Providing free solar panels at no net cost to the Council for private householders is more difficult but I don't think impossible.\nSo what of the Lib Dems Budget amendment? Well surprise surprise we have £2 million to upgrade the insulation of Council Tenants. But I hear you say 'Didn't they claim they had already acheived this in that scurrilous leaflet they posted in Almondbury in December?' (see December post 'Dem Fibs from the Lib Dems') Well yes they did. So they lied, it's what they do. More energy stuff from them £300k for Solar PV for community buildings, some additional monies linked to the boiler scrappage scheme and an energy advice project for the elderly. All good but there is nothing else! If you didn't know better you would think they were desperately trying to win back lost ground on the energy agenda. No matter, if that's the case then the Green Party has acheived more in this budget than simply getting our own initiatives passed we've pushed the other parties on or agenda and got gains for local people.\nThe Conservatives submitted an amendment it means their Council Tax is a 1% increase instead of a 2% increase. To do that they have further decimated jobs, services and cancelled anti recession measures, but they have the cynical 'We're cheaper' headline for their leaflets.\nI'm definitely getting grumpier as I get older.\nLabels:\nConservatives,\nEnergy,\nInsulation,\nKirklees,\nLib Dems,\nLocal Food,\nrenewables,\nsolar\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2017_12_fire-without-smoke-green-councillor_html/content_515.html": "|\n| From 'Huddersfield - The Handbook' 1960! |\nThe whole of Kirklees is a\nSmoke Control Area This means that if you burn fuel that gives off smoke you could be fined up to £1000. The original Clean Air Act was introduced in 1956 as a way of dealing with the epidemic in respiratory conditions arising from people living in an environment with thousands of chimneys belching out smoke. Most homes were heated primarily by housecoal, which is not smoke free. The introduction of smokeless coal and more homes getting connected to gas meant that air quality was vastly improved. The whole of Kirklees is a Smoke Control Area which means that it is effectively illegal to burn housecoal anywhere in the district.So if it is illegal to burn it why can you still buy it? You go to petrol stations, hardware stores and solid fuel merchants and they stock it and they presumably sell it. The people who buy it I'm guessing don't just stockpile it to look nice for display purposes only. I can't really imagine someone proudly showing their visitors their huge bile of the black stuff saying \"Come and have a look at my heritage coal which I can't burn. Looks great doesn't it! Really black and dirty.\" So tonnes and tonnes of this stuff flies off the forecourts and coal yards each year and adds to the atmospheric soup of pollution we all breathe in. So one idea I'm exploring with Kirklees Legal officers is whether we can establish a local byelaw to ban the stuff. It should be uncontroversial. Why are people allowed to buy a fuel they can't burn anyway? I remember when smokeless fuel was a bit rubbish and difficult to light compared with housecoal. Now smokeless fuel is a better product and some even boasts it contains 50% renewable components like\nEcocoal. Smokeless or not, coal is bad for our global environment in terms of carbon emissions but dealing with the immediate health impacts of housecoal by restricting it's sale should be something we had done years ago so lets see if we can do it.\nWhat happens next having advocated a ban on the sale of housecoal is a chorus of \"What about you greenie types and your woodburners? That may be renewable but it gives off smoke?\" This can be true if you have a poor wood burner and fuel with a high moisture content but it doesn't have to be like that. Kiln dried fuel and\nDEFRA approved wood burners/boilers can ensure smoke is kept to a miminum. The other benefit is that you can help support local employment by buying a DEFRA approved\nDunsley Yorkshire Boiler like mine, manufactured in Holmfirth .No I'm not on commission!\nVery good points, Andrew! Ive always been amazed at the loophole that has traditional, dIrty, coal on sale everywhere across the Clean air zone of Bristol, when it can't be legally burned.\nReplyDeleteAnd as you say we need better promotion of how essential it is to use DEFRA approved stoves for wood burning and a supply of clean, dry, wood fuel. People are already using the particulate pollution of wood stoves as a distraction to say the illegal and lethal pollution from cars should not be curbed.",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2010_02_carry-on-cabinet_html/content_387.html": "As it looked like an interesting Cabinet meeting I decided to go along. The decision to provide Council land for Yorkshire Housing to build 35 houses in the Newsome Ward came up. The standard of build for these properties was Code for Sustainable Homes Level 3. A high standard but the minimum for new social housing developments and would not necessarily incorporate renewable energy such as solar photovoltaic panels. I had suggested when consulted as the local councillor that we might be able to have solar panels installed on the properties at no net cost by using the new Clean Energy Cashback to finance the capital costs. Officers chose to ignore this advice and it wasn't included in the report. Another good reason to attend the meeting.\nCoincidentally today was the day that tariff rates were announced by the government and it looks increasingly likely that my suggestion would be possible. But it didn't stop there Councillor Shabir Pandor the Cabinet Member responsible for Housing was very, and repeatedly, insistent that it wouldn't be legal for a 'commercial' body like a Housing Association to take advantage of the tariff. Fortunately the Council Leader Cllr Mehboob Khan decided to take my advice and check it out and involve me in the decision for which I am most grateful. I've now sent them both the relevant section of the Government policy document that shows that Registered Social Landlords can indeed use the new 'feed in tariff'.\nLast year the Green Party persuaded the Council to identify £5 million in the Councils Capital Plan for solar photovoltaic panels on the basis that the capital borrowing would be paid by the revenue costs of the panels. This looks like it will now happen and even more council buildings will have solar, our energy costs and carbon emissions will also be reduced. Exciting times indeed!\nHi Andrew,\nReplyDeleteI thought you might appreciate me flagging two info sites we have built - www.fitariffs.co.uk and www.rhincentive.co.uk. They are designed to help people understand what the tariffs are and how anyone can benefit, including your council's project.\nScott\nThanks Scott much appreciated. I'll circulate widely. It will be helpful for work colleagues I'm sure.\nReplyDeleteAndrew, I enjoyed the read but please try to smile on your photographs rather than the serious expression, this even worked for Nixon!\nReplyDelete",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2013_09_missing-eu-renewables-target_html/content_885.html": "At the Green European Foundation Seminar in Brussels this weekend I had a detailed look at how European energy policy was developing and a 'heads up' some of the issues that will be facing the European Parliament over the next couple of years.\nOne speaker had a slide that caught my attention. It showed a map of Europe indicating progress towards the EU 2020 Renewable Energy Target and the UK standing out as one country that was looking unlikely to achieve due to slow progress. The target is legally binding for each member state so each can play their part in achieving an overall 20% of total energy to be derived from renewable sources by 2020. This target does not just cover electricity but also embraces heat energy and transport fuels and the UK proportion of the 2020 renewables target is 15%. This lower than 20% target reflected the UK's poor starting point when the directive was signed. At the time only Malta and Luxembourg had a lower proportion of their energy coming from renewables. Other countries which had made more progress had higher targets such as Sweden and Germany to help make up for those countries that had been historically backwards in promoting wind, wave and solar technologies like the UK. It was a bit humiliating, I felt, that we had such a low target but even this was regarded by many in the last Labour Government as a tall order. The story goes, apocryphal or not, that we thought we were signing a Renewable Electricity only target and didn't realise that we would also have to make significant progress on renewable heat and transport fuels. True or not, it has all the characteristics of the sort of cock up we might expect from a Blair Government which never really grasped or understood the potential of the renewables sector.\nSo what of the 'greenest government ever' and their action towards achieving the target? A couple of years ago as the cuts to the feed in tariff for solar was being introduced I shared a platform at an event in Westminster with Climate Change Minister Greg Barker MP and I made the point that the drastic cut in the level of feed in tariff would massively slow down the deployment of solar photovoltaic panels and put at risk the likelyhood of us hitting our EU target. Minister and officials insisted I was wrong and they were confident that the target would be achieved. I left suitably chastened. Well maybe not!\nSo why are we where we are? Why are we behind the curve compared with other countries on renewables? Onshore wind has been slow to deploy due to many applications being held up in the planning process. Offshore wind has made significant progress, is less controversial for some (not Donald Trump) but is expensive to install with long lead in times. Solar is quick to deploy but the FIT cuts massively slowed down this mass market and popular technology. Co firing of coal fired power stations with wood, with its dubious environmental credentials, also hilt the buffers with Drax shelving plans to go 100% biomass. A lack off assurances from Government on funding made them drop this one. Renewable Heat has been slow to get off the ground. The last Labour Government first consulted on a Renewable Heat Incentive RHI (a sort of feed in tariff for heat) in 2009 and now the domestic element of this will be introduced next year, nearly 5 years after I installed my panels on the back of the announcement. To be fair though the RHI looks like a good scheme and will be popular with those industries that install solar thermal, heat pumps and biomass boilers. The transport element of the target is dictated by the biofuel content of petrol and diesel. This has been an area of conflict between the renewable energy sector and environmental NGOs both of who often seem to take absolutist positions on what has unhelpfully being characterised simplistically as a 'food v fuel' issue. So the pressure to achieve the target has been heaped onto the electricity element of the target and wind in particular.\nOf course there is another approach to this whole issue. Rather than simply seeking to accommodate demand we should be seeking to reduce energy demand through energy conservation measures but we lack effective, fit for purpose policies and mechanisms to deliver energy efficiency measures at the level we would need to make a difference. Reducing the total amount of energy we use would make a percentage target easier and cheaper to achieve. Predictably The Green Deal is not turning out to be as popular as the Coalition hoped and the Minister has talked of a long term 20 year timeframe for it to come up to speed. 'Green Deal' is now being reframed to refer to action taken as a result of Green Deal assessments and installations under the Energy Company Obligation. We have now entered the 'throwing money at it' phase with an initial £20million being offered by Government to Councils who can come up with plans to promote Green Deal finance in their areas. When that fails , as it inevitably will, we will then enter the 'who's to blame' cycle and hopefully the development of an energy efficiency mechanism that will actually work.\nHere ends my first Blogpost typed while travelling on the Eurostar hopefully more to come over the next few years should all go well next May.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

It is\nsimply replacing a remote Westminster politican with a remote individual who is\nsupposed to represent 2.3 million people which they cannot. When mayoral models\nhave been put before local people in referenda before they have rejected. Now\nit is proposed to impose a Mayor on West Yorkshire without a referendum.\nThe Mayoral Combined\nAuthority – Some members are more equal than others\nThe proposed West Yorkshire Combined Authority will have 11\nmembers. 5 of these members will most likely be the Leaders of the constituent\nCouncils. These will be Councillors who have been elected by the unfair first\npast the post electoral system unlike the WYCA mayor. Having members of the\nsame body elected by different electoral systems is bizarre and perverse. The\nproposed 3 additional members will also be Councillors elected under the first\npast the post system but these places will be allocated on the basis of the\nnumber of Councillors in political groups on the constituent councils not on\nthe basis of popular share of the vote. We believe that West Yorkshire should\nhave an Assembly like the GLA in London elected by Proportional Representation.\nIf it is good enough for London why not West Yorkshire?\nThe 3 additional constituent council members on the Mayoral\nCombined Authority appointed for political balance should be referred to as\n“Second Class Members” as their support is not required to pass the Mayor’s\nSpatial Development Strategy, the designation of land for a Mayoral Combined\nAuthority Area, the compulsory purchase of land, decisions that could incur a\nfinancial liability on a constituent council or any matter pertaining to the\nMayoral Combined Authority’s Constitution. Using the same logic the 5 members\nappointed by each constituent Council should be referred to as “Premier Class\nMembers” as their support is required to approve the above matters.\nAll Councillors need\nto be represented on the Mayoral Combined Authority\nOver 8% of elected Councillors in West Yorkshire are from\nparties other than Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats. All these\nCouncillors are members of the LGA Independent Group. Current proposals would\nmean that these Councillors and the communities they represent would have no\nrepresentation at all on the Mayoral Combined Authority. Provision should be\nmade on the board to represent all groupings represented by LGA Political\nGroups including the LGA Independent Group which consists of Independent and\nGreen Party Councillors. We propose an additional member for political balance\nto ensure Councillors who are members of the LGA Independent Group, and\ntherefore the people who vote for them, are represented.\nThe proposals for 2\nDeputy Mayors are undemocratic\nThe proposal for the Mayor to be able to simply appoint 2 paid\nDeputies is undemocratic and will most likely be given to ‘Party worthies’ as a\nform of patronage. If it follows the model of the West Yorkshire Police and\nCrime Commissioner the Deputy Mayors positions will attract an allowance of at\nleast £50k/year with no democratic mandate. The Leader of Kirklees Council has\nstated at a Kirklees Scrutiny meeting that a Deputy Mayor position will be\ntaken by a Leader of one of the Constituent Councils. There is no reference to\nthis in the Governance Review document.\nMayoral Compulsory\nPurchase and Development Area powers should need approval of a meeting of the\nconstituent Full Council\nThe Mayor will have the power to compulsory purchase land\nwithin each Combined Authority area and set up Mayoral Development areas.\nBefore any of these powers are put into effect they should require the approval\nof a vote in Full Council in the constituent Council affected.\nAs with the Compulsory Purchase powers we strongly believe\nthat proposals to establish a Mayoral Development area should also require Full\nCouncil approval.\nIf London can have\nthe GLA why can’t West Yorkshire have an elected assembly?\nIt is not at all clear that powers will not be taken away\nfrom Councils and given to the Mayoral Combined Authority - the exact opposite\nof devolution.\nIt is our view, for Devolution to work in this area it needs\nto have a representational assembly elected by proportional representation to\ncover the whole Yorkshire region with similar powers to those of the Scottish\nParliament or the Welsh Assembly. Yorkshire has a population somewhat greater\nthan Scotland, and significantly larger that Wales. What’s good enough for\nScotland & Wales is good enough for Yorkshire.\nSpecific Governance\nproposals\n·\nAllocation of places to be based on LGA Groups -\nGreens and Independent councillors would all fall under the LGA Independent\nGrouping rather than being treated as small parties or individuals.\n·\nThere should be 4 balancing members on the\nMayoral Combined Authority. This would create a more balanced authority giving\n10 voting members. 4 balancing members would currently result in 2\nConservative, 1 Lib-Dem and 1 LGA Independent Group members.\n·\nEqual voting rights for all Mayoral Combined\nAuthority members on all matters not reserved to the Mayor. The proposed\nstructure creates 3 classes of voting member.\nThere is no justification for the Mayor and the balancing members to be\nexcluded from key decisions, and there should be only 1 class of voting member\non Combined Authority decisions.\n·\nIn the absence of an Elected Assembly there\nshould be all member assembly from the constituent councils for key decisions -\nAs far as possible all elected members should be involved in the decisions that\nwill shape and determine our shared future.\nQuestion 2\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer transport functions and new transport related\nfunctions to a West Yorkshire Mayor and mayoral combined authority?\nDisagree\nAdditional Transport\nfunding should simply be passed down to each constituent Council\nWhile we would welcome some of the potential powers that\nwould be granted to the Elected Mayor in relation to Public Transport and\naccess to funding, we believe that Government should simply devolve this\nfunding and powers to the Local Authorities without requiring the establishment\nof a new undemocratic Mayoral Authority.\nTransport funding\nshould not be used to support higher carbon emissions\nThe Key Route Network proposed could involve the\nestablishment of new roads encouraging car use and destroying valued green\ncorridors. This would also be inconsistent with WYCA’s commitment to have a\nzero carbon economy by 2038. It might be noted that while WYCA have stated a\ntarget of 2038, Leeds City Council, via a motion of Council, set a target date\nof 2030 – We believe that within the boundary of Leeds the Elected Mayor, if\nbrought in, should implement the Zero-Carbon economy by the 2030 date.\nWe would oppose the use of funding on any projects that\nwould enable expansion at Leeds Bradford Airport by the Mayor and the Mayoral\nCombined Authority. Any such funding would be contrary to reaching Zero-Carbon.\nWe acknowledge that delivering a mass transit system has\nlong been the plan for Leeds City Region, and aligns with the move towards\nbecoming Zero Carbon. However, the need to progress at pace to achieve modal transport\nshifts in order for Leeds to reach its Zero Carbon target of 2030 may require\nthe mass transit system ambition to be revisited. Funding is needed now to\ndevelop an effective and responsive bus system, the means for all transport to\nbe Zero Carbon and to greatly increase active travel. Planning for low carbon\ntransport is no longer good enough; travel needs to be Zero Carbon, and this\nmust include ensuring that the electricity for electric vehicles is generated\nfrom renewable sources. We welcome the plans for improvements at Leeds city\nstation as long as the modal shift is to Zero Carbon transport.\nQuestion 3\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer skills and employment functions to a West\nYorkshire mayoral combined authority?\nAgree with some reservations\nWhile we would argue that Adult Education – lifelong\nlearning – is about more than those outcomes linked to employability and the\nminor extensions into Community Learning covered by the current AEB, the\nquestion asks only about the current system.\nWe are conscious that levels of participation in the\nYorkshire & the Humber region in the forms of Adult Education covered by\nthe AEB at 30%, are only just above the lowest level nationally (29% in the\nSouth West)\nThere is a concern about the unpredictability of funding\nlevels, which have seen a 45% fall over the last ten years. Clearly if the\nmayoral region is to plan for provision in the long term it needs assurance\nthat funding will reflect levels of commitment made and increase at the very least\nto cover the inflationary costs.\nWe are conscious that the administrative and procurement\nprocesses that have operated at a national level have shown great weaknesses\nthat have undermined provider confidence. We would want to see devolution of\nthe budget linked to the power to simplify rules, make required outcomes\nclearer and support provider confidence. The devolution of the budget has\npromise, but only if the administration can be simplified and made more\ntransparent. If devolution is to mean anything it must include devolution of\ndecision making about the outcomes wanted in the region.\nThe region as a whole, and the West Yorkshire region in\nparticular have great potential in building the new green economic order that\nis needed. There is a strong skills base that can be built on in the provision\nof training, and this development should take place not just in the context of\nthe 2038 Zero carbon Agenda target of the WYCA, but also reflect local\ncommitments, such as those in Leeds to a 2030 target.\nAs such we would favour further devolution of the budget to\nthe five constituent authorities of the sub-region and not just to the WY\nmayor, and for the opportunity for lifelong learning to become an offer that is\navailable very locally, for example from community centres or schools.\nQuestion 4\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer housing and planning functions to a West\nYorkshire Mayor and mayoral combined authority?\nDisagree\nPlanning decisions\nshould be taken at a local level\nWe do not support the granting of any land assembly or\nplanning powers to the Elected Mayor, these should be held by the appropriate\nLocal Authority, as those councillors have the local knowledge to be able to\nmake these decisions. Clearly, it is our view if this function were to be\ngranted to the Elected Mayor and, we note that the local authority will have a\nveto, we would like to put in the safeguard that any decision taken by the\nElected Mayor in this area should have to be endorsed by both the Executive\nBoard and a meeting of the full Council of that particular metropolitan\nauthority.\nThe Mayoral Combined\nAuthority should be able to suspend the ‘Right to Buy’\nOne function we would like devolved to a local level is the\npower to suspend the Right to Buy scheme. We have seen a massive reduction in\nCouncil Housing at a time of high demand for income particularly for the\nmillions left behind in the policy push over the last 40 years towards home\nownership. Not everybody can own a home and we need a secure affordable option\nfor the millions who cannot. Suspending\nor preferably abolishing the Right to Buy would boost the business case for\nCouncils wanting to build new affordable homes.\nThe power we need is\nto insist on higher energy efficiency standards for buildings\nThe Mayor will not have powers to insist on higher building\nstandards in the region such as Passivhaus for all new build. This would be\ncompatible with WYCA’s stated commitment to a Zero Carbon Economy by 2038 but\nis a power that we won’t have.\nWe need a 2030 Target\nfor the West Yorkshire Zero Carbon Economy\nWe strongly believe that the Mayoral Combined Authority\nshould set a new, more ambitious target for a Zero Carbon Economy by 2030 in\nline with the conclusions of the report of the United Nations Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change. This would help support our argument for stronger\nhousing and planning policies either at the local or regional level.\nQuestion 5\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer Police and Crime Commissioner functions to a\nWest Yorkshire Mayor?\nStrongly oppose\nPolice and Crime\nfunctions are even more unaccountable under the Mayoral Combined Authority.\nThe appointment of a highly paid, unelected Deputy Mayor to\nlead on the Policing function, however, just makes matters worse. It will undoubtedly put an unelected\npolitician in a role where the people scrutinising them will have a democratic\nmandate (albeit through FPTP), but they will not.\nQuestion 6\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer additional finance functions on a West Yorkshire\nMayor and mayoral combined authority?\nStrongly oppose\nNo taxation without\nadequate representation and scrutiny.\nOur opposition to these additional powers is due to the lack\nof a suitable democratic mandate as we have detailed in our answer to question\n1 and/or the lack of suitable scrutiny and powers to limit the powers of the\nMayor by a democratically elected Assembly.\nThe power to charge a precept for policing would mean that\nthe funding gained could be the responsibility of an unelected functionary and\nor ‘Party Worthy’.\nQuestion 7\nAre there any\ncomments you would like to make that you do not feel you have addressed in your\nresponse?\nWhat about the\nchallenge of Climate Change?\nThe West Yorkshire Authorities Governance Review document\nhighlights the major challenges to the sub region. It includes growth,\nproductivity, diversity, innovation and trade but Climate Change is not\nidentified as a challenge bizarrely. The self-declared target of having a Zero\nCarbon Economy in just 18 years’ time is a significant challenge but it is\nconcerning that it has not been included here. For the record the Green Party\nbelieves that our target should be 2030 not 2038 in line with the evidence from\nclimate scientists.\nWhat about a\nresilient economy?\nAnother significant challenge highlighted by the COVID19\ncrisis is the need for a resilient economy that is less affected by global\nfactors such as international trade, the money markets and financial speculation.\nA more resilient economy would have an emphasis on local\nproduction for local need, more locally owned and managed businesses trading\nwith each other ensuring money remains within the regional economy. This is not\nidentified as a significant challenge and therefore cannot be regarded as a\npriority by the Mayoral Combined Authority. This is a major weakness in the\nGovernance Review Document\nA Devolution Deal for\na Post-COVID/Post-Growth World\nThe proposed devolution deal was prepared in the pre-COVID\nworld, and therefore it will need significant rethinking in order to align with\nthe new normal that individuals, businesses, communities, councils, regions and\nnations are now preparing for. Recently 200 leading UK businesses, investors\nand business networks, called on the Government to deliver a Covid-19 recovery\nplan that builds back a more inclusive, stronger and more resilient UK economy that\naligns with the UK's wider social, environmental and climate goals. There is no\nmention here of economic growth. More and more people with vision are realising\nthat growing an economy is at odds with tackling climate change. What we can\nhave instead is a strong, vibrant, inclusive and sustainable economy and that\nshould be the vision that underpins the devolution deal. We have an opportunity\nhere in West Yorkshire to be leaders in this new green recovery world.\nIn view of this, the metrics used for making the 5 year\nGateway Assessments on which ongoing funding may depend cannot be based on\neconomic growth, but on other measurements of a vibrant economy. In the new\nCOVID 19 world economic growth may be a thing of the past anyway. In particular\ndecisions must not be made in order to meet the Gateway Assessments that will\nreduce the capacity of Leeds to meet the Climate Emergency commitments.\nLet’s have Real\nDevolution not Faux Devolution\nIn our view this is only partial devolution to, effectively,\nan elected dictatorship, and not a proper democratic body. The area covered,\nthe County of West Yorkshire, is a failed concept of the early 1970’s and does\nnot cover the economic footprint of the Leeds City Region. To have real devolution\nwe need an Assembly and First Minister with powers similar to those granted to\nWales, and Scotland, but based upon the region of Yorkshire. The proposal\nstates that this agreement is the first step in the process to further\ndevolution, therefore a Yorkshire Assembly should be seen as the assumed next\nstep, which should be included in this devolution agreement. Devolution for\nYorkshire has wide support, including in the Sheffield City Region where\nreferendums held in Barnsley and Doncaster, indicated an overwhelming\npreference for a One Yorkshire deal over the South Yorkshire deal.\nDevolution that\nacknowledges the Climate Crisis\nOn October 8 2018 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange issued a report, in which they stated that ‘Limiting global warming to\n1.5°C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all\naspects of society.’ Other parts of the report state that ‘With clear benefits\nto people and natural ecosystems, limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to\n2°C could go hand in hand with ensuring a more sustainable and equitable\nsociety’. We are already seeing the consequences of 1°C of global warming\nthrough more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice,\namong other changes. The report finds that limiting global warming to 1.5°C\nwould require “rapid and far-reaching” transitions in land, energy, industry,\nbuildings, transport, and cities.’ It is already widely acknowledged that the\nUK’s zero carbon target of 2050 will not achieve the limiting of global warming\nrequired, which is why councils around the UK have committed to achieve zero\ncarbon much sooner.\nSo it is within the context of the Climate Emergency that\nWest Yorkshire now has the opportunity, through devolution, to set truly\nambitious plans to lead this country in a green economic recovery from the\nCOVID pandemic, a recovery that will achieve the challenging but necessary zero\ncarbon targets that have been set. This will require public support, and that\ncan only be achieved through the democratic processes and structures that are\noutlined in our response.",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2013_09_a-social-energy-target-for-european_html/content_140.html": "| An EU Social Energy Target - a lightbulb moment? |\nThe 2020 targets seek to improve energy efficiency by 20%, achieve 20% renewable energy as a percentage of total energy and reduce carbon emissions by 20%. Across the member states different policies have been established to achieve these targets. In the UK much of the funding to help us reach our share of the target comes from energy companies so we all effectively pay for it through our fuel bills. Policies in the UK such as the Energy Company Obligation and the Feed In Tariff are paid for through a levy on our fuel bills. though the vast majority of rises in energy bills are nothing to do with 'green taxes'. This still doesn't stop climate change deniers and the Daily Mail (as if they were different in some way!) attributing energy bill price hikes seemingly exclusively as a result of 'green taxes'. Nethertheless it is important to ensure those on the lowest incomes are the ones who benefit most from environmental taxes to ensure fairness is a fundamental consideration when seeking to address environmental concerns. This is where the concept of a Social Energy Target came from.\nSo what is an EU Social Energy Target? The EU is currently considering the 2030 successors to the 2020 renewables, carbon and energy efficiency targets. There is now an opportunity to develop a complementary target which not only seeks to reduce fuel poverty but also encourages this aim to work in harmony with environmental targets. If this can be achieved the assertion that environmental and social targets are incompatible can be not only challenged but also demonstrably disproved.\nWhat might a target look like and how might it operate? The UK did have a target of eradicating fuel poverty completely by 2016. With rises in fuel prices, cuts in income and frankly utterly inadequate policies to address the energy efficiency of homes this is simply not going to be achieved. There is a clear need to develop a realisable plan to ensure affordable warmth and an end to fuel poverty. This may result in policies that encourage the installation of solar panels, such as the feed in tariff being directed to those on lower incomes OR incentivise government to direct more of the £1.3 billion/year Energy Company Obligation funding to be directed to people in fuel poverty.\nThe other benefits of the Social Energy Target could be less cold related illnesses, more jobs in the energy efficiency sector. This has got to be worth pursuing and progressing. I'll keep you posted!\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2011_07_tale-of-two-community-gardens_html/content_190.html": "The community came together.\nThere was a disused, council owned play area near their homes.\nThey wanted to create a place to relax, to come together, to grow vegetables, fruit trees and herbs.\nYou may be thinking this is another blogpost about Highfields Community Orchard in Huddersfield but you would be wrong. At the weekend I went to the Association of Green Councillors Conference in Norwich and on the Friday night (before the beer and curry) we went to see a successful project to transform a forgotten patch of land to the rear of some houses into a community garden. Grapes Hill Community Garden was truly inspirational with a project where local people can collect herbs and fruit and disabled wheelchair users can grow their own vegetables in raised beds. We got a special pre-opening tour of the garden which will officially open in August.\nThe parallels with Highfields are significant. Both Council owned land, both former play areas, both are near the town centre, both have local people coming together in common cause to improve their local community. That is where the parallels end. In Norwich the Council has supported the project and funding has been found from external sources to bring the project to life. In Kirklees the Council still sees the future of this land as a lucrative development plot rather than a community resource. The Highfields Community Orchard folks have permission from Kirklees to be on the site for the next 6 months or so and this may be extended but a political steer has not been forthcoming.\nIronically, the local Councillors in Greenhead Ward are supporting the establishment of a village green on Clayton Fields a mile up the road. This is something I very much support not least because I used to go sledging down there as a kid when I lived on Imperial Road. The irony is that the council owns the Highfields land at Wentworth Street. With the smallest amount of political direction it could allow local people to have a community orchard in a built up area with all the social benefit that would come from that. This, unfortunately, is not forthcoming.\nSee also http://highfieldscommunityorchard.blogspot.com/\nReplyDelete",

All we have done is remove an obstacle for them by proposing the Parish Council covers the gap in funding for the Libraries running costs for gas, electricity , cleaning etc. for a to be agreed set period of time. This is a vital first step in enabling them to establish their own Business Plan which will be needed if the building is to be successfully transferred from Kirklees Council to the community of Shepley.\nCllr Armer asks where these funds will come from and really he already knows the answer . It will be an integral part of the Parish Councils budget and that is the proposal we will be making at our November Council meeting. Shepley people pay their Parish precept along with their Council Tax and the Library is a top concern for people in the village so it makes sense for the Parish Council to support it and give some benefit back. The Village Association that is working to save the Library is aware and has been fully informed of our proposals throughout.\nCllr Armer says that I said the Parish Council should fund current staffing levels at the public meeting in Shepley of £50,000 increasing the Parish Precept by £45, in fact there were lots of suggestions at the meeting, but Green Party Cllrs have never proposed that as an option. At the meeting we were all informed by the library management that the current annual running costs of the building, less current income, are in the region of £5000. Our above proposal would amount to an annual cost of £5000/year or less to the Parish Council which we believe is good value to keep the library building open. Cllr Armer knows this as he was also at the meeting, but yet is determined to play his political hand again.\nWe are very disappointed by the criticism of the Green Party efforts to help save Shepley Library by Councillor Armer and sadly note where there is an absence of any initiative from him and his Party then he resorts again to criticise and knowingly mislead local people. We trust that when our proposals come before the Parish Council he will do the right thing and support them in the interests of Shepley Village and the future of its Library.",

We heard of the founders producing leaflets on hand cranked gestener copiers before offset lithos and photocopiers. The Green Parties that now span the world all came from these initial few dedicated people. In Kirklees we are particularly honoured to have Clive Lord one of the founding members. He first stood for election as the 'People' candidate in one of the 1974 General Elections. Before it was the Green Party it was the Ecology Party and before that simply 'People'. Clive started being joined by others in Leeds around 1980 and had to wait till around till 1985 for the founding of the Green Party in Huddersfield to have other Kirklees based members to work with. Clive is an evangilist for the Citizens Income scheme as an alternative to the Welfare Benefits system. I'm not going to explain it here and anyway Clive has his own Blog here so read that.!\nThe word 'stalwart' is often used in the context of Clive and every opportunity he gets he is eulogising about the Citizens Income, sometimes at inappropriate times. I strongly suspects he knows this but then he is a man on a mission who is proposing a system which undoubtedly has its benefits. I have no doubt that in a few years time people will develop Clive's pathfinding work and recognise the contribution he has made when the dreadful so called ' Welfare Reformer' Iain Duncan Smith is justly reviled for pushing those on benefits further into misery and destitution.\n| Clive Lord today |\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Again!\nGordon Brown is (we are told) going to put us out of his misery tomorrow and call an election. We know it must be on the cards because he's running out of time anyway and he's really being practicing 'that smile'.\nWhat can we predict over the next few weeks. Lots of muscle flexing over who's toughest on dealing with the deficit is a sure thing but of course tough in a 'responsible' fashion. The truth is that a double dip recession is already in the pipeline. Hundreds of thousands of public sector jobs are certain to go within the next 2 years. This goes way beyond the efficiency savings we would all like to see in Councils and the Health Service. The loss of these incomes will impact on the spending power of many households and have a knock on effect on the economy as a whole. Have political parties not learnt anything about how you come out of recessions e.g Keynesian economics? the New Deal?\nIn their desire to appear 'tough' things could get very tough indeed. What we are experiencing now is the logical conclusion of policies started by the Conservatives in the 80s and embraced by New Labour. The lack of financial regulation got us into this mess and now we are going back to the regressive public finance constraints of the Eighties.\nInstead of the Labour's rather barmy idea of comparing David Cameron to a politically incorrect but popular figure (Gene Hunt - Ashes to Ashes) they would have been much better comparing him to a vacuous american getting into a De Lorean that flies!

I would challenge Government to ensure we are recognising loss and damage in our response to climate change. I would seek dialogue with representatives from the global south through my links with the international organisation ICLEI (Local Governments for Sustainability).\n- Protecting workers and communities through a just transition from a fossil fuel-dependent economy to a low-carbon, nature-rich, circular economy, including delivering over 42,000 new jobs.\nThe groundbreaking ‘One Million Green Jobs’ proposal by the Campaign against Climate Change showed us how addressing the climate crisis will deliver meaningful, worthwhile and rewarding jobs. There is a lot to do and the amount of retrofit work needed to buildings in West Yorkshire could easily generate 42,000 jobs. The opportunity is so much greater though, improving our public transport and active travel networks, enhancing biodiversity in communities, tree planting, establishing nature based solutions to heavy rainfall events. The role of the Mayor is to ensure investment is directed to deliver those jobs but also to provide the training and skills needed. There are things we are going to have to stop doing e.g. building new roads, widening roads, airport expansion so it is vital that we replace jobs from sectors that are incompatible with a stable climate with ones that are. There is more than enough to do.\n- Introducing policies and measures that ensure new development is net zero carbon and existing homes are brought up to high energy-standards and addressing fuel poverty.\nOne of the flagship policies in my bid for the West Yorkshire Mayoralty is the Green Building Fund where I will seek to ensure that all public sector procured or influenced projects are built to the Passivhaus Standard or equivalent. I will establish a fund that will support an uplift in expected capital costs by 5% to cover the expected additional costs of building to that standard. I have proposed such a policy on Kirklees Council for several years but have met opposition from the Labour administration who have exaggerated the capital cost uplift by wrongly referencing the costs of one off projects to seek to justify their opposition.\nI have a strong record on initiating projects to retrofit homes and initiated the UKs first free insulation scheme, the award winning, Kirklees Warm Zone in 2007. There are strong plans being developed by WYCA looking at the challenge of retrofitting existing buildings. What is lacking is a convincing offer to householders to invest in whole house solutions to reduce their emissions. I will ensure funds are available for a Green New Deal Demonstrator Project that will be used to show Government the value of HS2 levels of investment in large scale retrofit projects. It will demonstrate positive health outcomes of living in warm homes, alleviation of fuel poverty, putting more money back in the pockets of the community and out of the pockets of the big energy companies. I have a strong record in addressing fuel poverty in my previous career as an Energy Efficiency Advice Centre Manager and as a Trustee of the fuel poverty charity, National Energy Action for 6 years.\n- At\nleast doubling public transport use, cycling and walking within the next\n10 years, to cut emissions and ensure everyone can breathe clean air.\nSupporting active travel is something that I would want to\nsee a huge expansion of. The West Yorkshire Carbon Pathways report indicates\nthe need to expand cycling by 8000% but at present travel for cyclists is often\ndangerous so we need to invest more in dedicated and protected cycle lanes so\nwe can expand and democratise cycling. I would also want to support the\nexpansion of e-bikes and would seek financial mechanisms to make the purchase\nand rental of e-bikes more accessible to more people. I would also want to\nsupport projects like the Queensbury tunnel to give more and safer options for\ncyclists.\n- Powering the city region with clean, renewable energy, reaping the economic and job opportunities that this brings.\nWe have to start planning for clean energy production by reducing the demand for energy through efficiency measures. This has to be at the top of our plans as it gives us more choices, more cost effectively than a simple predict and provide approach.\nI would want to see the return of Solar PV and other renewable technologies as mass market options for the majority of householders during my first term as West Yorkshire Mayor. I would establish a revolving loan fund enabling householders to install renewable technology in their home by accessing a preferential loan based on a second charge on the value of a property. This would effectively mean no upfront costs to the household and the loan being paid back to the fund upon sale of the property. This is based on the Kirklees RE-Charge scheme I initiated in Kirklees which was the winner at the British Renewable Energy awards in 2008. With the Mayor being unable to reintroduce a feed in tarrif this is the next best option to kick start the household renewable sector. Beyond households I would seek to establish Mayoral Development Areas in conjunction with local Councils to build solar farms and wind farms. I would also seek a relaxation on the constraints on wind development in local planning.\n- Greening the city-region by increasing tree cover, protecting nature, and eliminating green-space deprivation.\nI am an enthusiast for promoting tree planting and have initiated a small scale tree planting project in my role as a Kirkburton Parish Councillor. The 1000 fruit tree project engaged communities across the Kirkburton Parish in planting fruit trees in their own community and was taken up by village associations and schools. There are great opportunities to integrate tree planting programmes with wider climate education and engagement with young people. Ensuring tree cover is included as an integral part of any urban regeneration schemes will be a stipulation and condition of Mayoral funding.\nI have a proven track record of promoting tree planting projects and in 2019 proposed a 150,000 tree planting project over Kirklees which unfortunately was not accepted by the Labour administration. I will ensure that any Mayoral Development Area that may be designated is not on redesignated greenbelt on greenfield land. The focus will be on the regeneration of brownfield land.\nI am shocked that WYCA funded schemes like the widening of the A629 at Edgerton in Huddersfeild is going to see 126 mature trees removed. Schemes such as this I would simply not support.\nI am keen that biodiversity gain is achieved for all developments we make and that the ecological crisis we face is addressed as well as the climate crisis by protecting habitats and creating new ones.\n- Becoming\na zero-waste city-region by 2030 without relying on landfill or\nincineration, to reduce pressures on nature from resource extraction and\npollution.\n- Calling on the local government pension scheme to divest from fossil fuels, to stop profiting from environmental harm.\nI have been calling on Labour Councillor representatives on the West Yorkshire Pension Fund Investment Panel to divest from fossil fuels for many years but have met resistance. I have worked with divestment campaigners and will continue to do so. Apart from the environmental reasons to divest there is also the very real possibility that they could become stranded assets lacking any significant value. So there are good financial reasons to divest from fossil fuels as well. As West Yorkshire Mayor I would give my wholehearted backing for the WYPF divesting fully from fossil fuel investments.\n- Opposing the unsustainable growth plans for Leeds Bradford Airport and joining with Metro Mayors across the country to ensure regional airports keep within carbon budgets.\nI watched hours of the Leeds City Council Planning Committee\nwhen sadly they decided to pass Leeds Bradford Airport Expansion Plans. I am\npleased that some Cllrs on the Leeds Planning Committee including my Green colleague\nCllr David Blackburn voted against expansion but sadly they were not in the\nmajority. I have raised the issue at Kirklees Council meetings trying in vain\nto get the Leadership of the council to come out against the proposals. As West Yorkshire Mayor I will not back any\nproposals that support Leeds Bradford Airport expansion and I am happy to try\nand make expansion of Regional Airports an issue on all Metro Mayors agendas\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

This amendment\nwill not resolve that but will provide more flexibility to address the many\ncalls on the Highways Service for traffic calming across Kirklees.\nProvision of Electric Vehicle fleet\nThe first\nKirklees Council Electric Vehicle was provided over 10 years ago as a result of\na Green Party Budget amendment. Electric vehicles since then have come on leaps\nand bounds and have low servicing costs, lower costs per mile and the range of\nelectric vehicles is well within the Councils operational requirements. The\nbenefit to the Council is not just lower running costs but also demonstrates\nthat we are playing our part in reducing vehicle emissions at a time when we\nhave growing concerns about air quality in Kirklees. As the carbon intensity of\nUK electricity begins to fall electric vehicles will play an important role in\nstoring renewable energy generated overnight.

This\nproposal seeks to provide more support and assistance to rough sleepers to help\nthem get back control of their lives.\nKirklees Recycling Initiative\nKirklees\nneeds as a matter of urgency to address our poor recycling rates.

While many Council\nmeetings have been suspended Kirklees Leaders from all party groups are coming\ntogether each week (virtually) with the Council’s Chief Executive on the Public\nHealth Emergency Advisory Group to work together on addressing the crisis.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper as Green Party Leader is represented on the group,\n“ It is inspiring to see political differences being put\naside for the common good and it would be good to see this sort of positive\nworking together continue beyond this\ncrisis. It’s vital that we know from local people how their day-\nto- day lives could be improved and\nproblems they may be having that we can\nhelp with and so I can feed this into these meetings.”\nCoronavirus Crisis –\nWhat help do you need?\n£50’000 for Community\nAction\nKirklees has provided £50k for each of the Council's 23 Wards to help\ncommunities deal with issues related to the current Coronavirus Crisis.\nKirklees Green Party Leader and Newsome Ward Councillor\nAndrew Cooper said,\n\"This funding provided by the Council at this most\ndifficult of time is very welcome. What Newsome Councillors want to do is get\npeople to give us their ideas. The sort of ideas we are looking for are things\nthat help morale in the community, provide support to vulnerable people and ensure that we come out of\nthe crisis with local businesses intact. The funding is not limitless but I'm\nkeen to harness the power of local people to help us through this public health\nemergency. I and my Newsome Ward colleagues have been impressed by the\nwillingness of people to help their neighbours in this most unprecedented of\ncircumstances. These are the people who can see needs that may not be being met\nand the things that may make life a little better. \"\n3 month rent holiday for\nKirklees Business Tenants\nKirklees Council has announced it will be giving a 3 month\nrent holiday to its commercial tenants.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper said,\n\" I proposed this 3 month rent holiday to ensure small\nIndependent businesses like retailers, pubs, cafes and restaurants survive this\ncrisis intact. We will need them to bring life back to our town centres and I\nam urging other councils around the country to follow Kirklees lead\".\n\"There is now a challenge to commercial landlords of\nHuddersfield town centre businesses. If councils can do what is right to\nprotect the longer-term interests of our local economy so should you.

We\nshare information we have picked up about local concerns and issues, see how we\ncan help with funding local projects and keep on top of local casework which\nhasn’t gone away during the Lockdown. We have had Council officers join us for\nmeetings when we have needed them and it has gone better than I expected.”\n“Please be our eyes\nand ears”\nGreen Councillors ask\nlocal people to survey their streets for issues.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper has asked local people to let him know of\nissues and concerns on their street during the crisis\n“It’s not as easy or justifiable for us to be out on the\nstreets as much as we would like so I’m appealing to local people to let us\nknow what issues need dealing with on their street. The sort of thing we are\nlooking for is potholes, blocked drains, street lights that aren’t working and\nlarge accumulations of litter and fly tipping. Giving us location information\ne.g. which house, street light number the issue is near is vital as well as\nphotos of the problem”.\nPlease send to any of your local Councillors.\nHelp exercising for\nolder & younger people in their own homes\nPilates Instructor Lynne Ellis of Almondbury recently\nextended her classes to include those who need a more gentle form of exercise\nby converting her sessions to be done on a chair. This was particularly popular\nwith older people wanting to keep active and healthy. These classes ran in\nCommunity Halls and were sponsored by Kirklees to help those with less mobility\nkeep in shape. The sessions had become\nreally popular bringing the community together, tackling loneliness and\nimproving health.\nThen the Coronavirus stopped all group activity!\nNewsome Green Councillor Andrew Cooper contacted Lynne and\nsuggested using ZOOM, a video conferencing app, to keep her Pilates sessions\ngoing virtually.\nCouncillor Cooper said,\n“I’m so pleased Lynne’s classes are going so well and that\nshe is able to help so many people stay active even when they are confined to\ntheir homes for much of the day.

The announcement has received widespread condemnation from over 200 businesses (1) who have asked the Chancellor to reverse the decision.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper, Green Party Energy Spokesperson, condemned the dropping of these higher energy efficiency standards:\n“This backwards step by the Government will hardwire higher fuel bills for people living in homes built today. For people on low incomes moving into new social housing this will mean they are more likely to suffer fuel poverty and be faced with the difficult choice of whether to eat or heat their homes.\n“The Chancellor is ignoring the reality of climate change by locking us into energy wasteful building standards for many years to come.\n“Nearly a decade of work has been carried out by building professionals preparing for the new Zero Carbon Homes standards. The Government has simply wasted the skill and expertise that has been established by industry in preparation for what was mistakenly believed to be a firm Government commitment.”\nThe Green Party is calling for a cross party campaign by local Councils to specify ‘Passivhaus’ standards on all new homes and buildings constructed on Council land or as a condition of sale on Council land sold for development.\nPassivhaus is an internationally recognised standard that typically means that an average household can have heating bills of less than £100/year due to the highly efficient thermal performance (2).\nCooper added:\n“This is the Local Authorities’ own land and there is no reason why Councils cannot decide to adopt more sustainable standards than the unambitious ones specified by the Government. As the Conservatives say they believe in Localism we would expect them to not stand in the way of locally determined targets be they specified in Local Plans or as we are calling for as policy on their own land”.\n1) http://www.ukgbc.org/press-centre/press-releases/over-200-businesses-urge-chancellor-reconsider-scrapping-zero-carbon\nhttp://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2418362/over-200-businesses-call-on-chancellor-to-save-zero-carbon-homes-standard?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=Twitterfeed&utm_content=BusinessGreen\n2) http://www.passivhaus.org.uk/standard.jsp?id=122\nhttp://www.homebuilding.co.uk/2010/11/18/passivhaus-what-is-it/\nYour blog is awesome and really helpful for readers.

It is one of the most godforsaken places in the whole of Huddersfield Town Centre. It is the the polar opposite to St Georges Square. Its not the sort of place you would pass through by choice. If you're walking across 'the Expanse' you're either going to Court, the Job Centre or to see your local Councillor, so odds on you could be feeling pretty miserable in the first place.\n|\n| Jakes Folly |\nThe complete and utter misery of the area was recognised in 2004 by local eccentric Jake Mangel -Wurzel who constructed his own 'Folly' contributing to the sheer awfulness of the area. I remember arguing at the time that it should remain until the Council did something to improve the area. So it is still there, a mocking monument to concrete desolation that is the Civic Expanse of Doom. What can we do with it? Well I'm sure the Council could throw loads of money at it and try and improve it but that is certainly not something I could advocate in these harsh times and anyway civic regeneration is what happens in London and isn't for the likes of us. One idea I had was to set up a game of 'Blockbusters' on the hexagon embedded squares which are bizarrely and frankly unattractively framed by concrete paving stones. This would be purely to highlight the sheer awfulness of the area and bring it to public attention.\nWhat could be done with the area to lift it? We need ideas that have a low civic expense for the Civic\nExpanse. A free market? some planters in the centre? a civic information board? places to sit? Come on people I'm doing all the thinking here? Ok that's off my chest I'll raise the subject again in 2024 when we can mark the 20th anniversary of 'Jakes Folly' or not!\n|\n| Blockbusters anybody? |\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Speaking at a fringe meeting at the Green Party's spring conference\nin Liverpool they expressed their determination to kick the far right out of\nthe North West and Yorkshire & Humber regions. These regions elected the\nBNP's only members of the European Parliament in 2009.\nAndrew\nCooper, lead candidate for Yorkshire and Humber region and a Kirklees\ncouncillor, said:\n“It’s\na stain on Yorkshire and Humber that we elected a BNP member to the European\nParliament in 2009 and we're determined to reverse that decision this time. But\nrather than focusing on a political party whose days are numbered, I'll be\ncampaigning on the issues that really matter to people - explaining how we\ncreate more jobs, how we can improve our local economy and how we use practical\nsolutions to tackle climate change.\n\"We\nwant to be proud of our MEPs so that we can say 'there's someone in Brussels\nfighting for what I believe in'.\"\nSpeaking\nabout UKIP, Andrew Cooper said \"UKIP don’t turn up to vote in the European\nParliament and they’re not involved in the business of the parliament, but\nthey’re very happy to take the money. Greens have an excellent attendance\nrecord which means we're at the table when crucial decisions are being\nmade.\"\nThe\nfringe meeting also welcomed Clara Palliard, PCS Culture Sector President and a\nmember of Merseyside TUC, who urged her fellow trade unionists to back the\nGreen Party in May. She highlighted the violence, intimidation and threats\nsuffered by many anti-racism campaigners in the region and called on trade\nunionists to back the Greens.\nClara\nPalliard said: \"The Green Party is clearly in a good position to beat the\nBNP in May. That's why trade unionists across the region are coming out in\nfavour of the Greens as a robust challenger to the threat of the far right. The\nbottom line is we’ve got one fascist too many and that's Griffin. We also have\nto be vigilant against the rise of UKIP who are simply fascists in disguise.\nUKIP and the mainstream parties would have us believe that austerity is the\nonly show in town, that the cuts are inevitable. The Green Party rejects that\nview and offers an alternative - jobs, decent working conditions, a fairer\ndistribution of wealth and a sensible strategy to tackle climate change and its\ndevastating consequences.\"\nPeter\nCranie, the Green lead for the North West region said: \"Sadly the BNP has\nnot gone away. They were out on the streets of Wythenshawe at the recent\nby-election. We came incredibly close to stopping them back in 2009 and we're\nhopeful that we will kick them out this May. If they lose their seats they'll\nlose their European funding and without that money they’ll be finished as a\npolitical force. Their ejection from the parliament will remove their\nlegitimacy and their right to participate in media debates.\"\nHe\nconcluded: \"As for UKIP, I intend to expose them for what they are. Their\nracism, lies, double standards and a shocking lack of policy should mean they\nhave no place in British politics. Our job is to engage with people about their\nproblems and their fears and show that xenophobic rhetoric from businessmen who\ncall for more cuts and less protection for working people is not the answer.\nThe Green Party is challenging austerity, standing up for working people and\nmaking the case for a positive alternative.\"\n-------------------------------------\nContact:\nCllr Andrew Cooper\nLead\nGreen Euro candidate, Yorkshire and the Humber\n01484\n667519 | 07721 348619\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

The gig was a benefit in aid of the hard pressed families of firemen ( they were all men then ) who had been on strike for weeks. I'd love to be able to say I was there but the truth is that I would have been half a mile up the road in Edgerton at the family home at Imperial Road being 13 and all. What I do remember about punk was that it was a part of growing up for me and others around me a few years later. I was in a band called the Criminal Minds in 1981. There was a lot of gratuitous swearing involved and we did a few gigs, a barn in Sowood, the Venn Street Arts Centre and once at our school spring to mind. All good fun and I still have a cassette of our 'music'. Punk is anti establishment and our song 'F***the Government' was.definitely on message.\nThere was a good punk scene in Huddersfield which carried on a good few years after the Pistols departed. I always remember Punk as not just anti establishment but also pro people and anti fascist. (There were exceptions such as the Neo Nazi band Screwdriver' who were offensive but they were the exception not the rule). This pro people aspect came across listening to Johnny Rotten speaking about the Huddersfield gig and their motivations for doing it. It wasn't a big prestigious gig but doing it was right for the band that was finding it difficult to get gigs due to a hysterical media and for the striking firefighters who were going through hard times. It was authentic and demonstrated the humanity of the Pistols in choosing to do this benefit gig.\nSomething I take from the punk years is a healthy disrespect for authority and institutions and a dislike of deference to people, titles and positions. Is this contradictory as I've been elected to Kirklees Council five times now? Maybe a little, but I still feel slightly uncomfortable when people address me as 'Councillor' and recognise that power and authority is something that should be used carefully and sparingly.",

It\nhas large Council estates, some streets with £300’000 pound houses, and some\nlarge asian communities.\nI’ve worked in Energy\nEfficiency and Renewables sector for 17 years. Project managed insulation and\nheating schemes. I have worked in the public sector and the private sector and\nused to work as lobbyist for the Renewable Energy Industry where I was ignored\nby some very important people.\nDuring many of my years as a\nCouncillor I have learnt how political power can make positive change happen.\nFor many years the Council lacked a majority, and to get budgets passed and\nleaders of the Council elected the largest party, whichever one it happened to\nbe at the time, needed the support of just a few Councillors from another\npolitical group to achieve that. The Green Group was more than happy to help\nand as a result Kirklees had the UK’s first universally free insulation scheme,\na renewable energy fund that installed solar panels on many council buildings,\na solar scheme for householders with no upfront costs and schools constructed\nto very high energy specifications. Kirklees now has a majority party in\ncontrol and is less innovative, risk averse, officer lead and managerial. My\nown politics aside it is a real shame and a waste of political power. For me\nthe whole point of my political journey has been to make change happen and that\nis why I am standing to be West Yorkshire’s first Mayor.\nSo enough about me what about\nthe policies I will champion as West Yorkshire Mayor.\nThe Green Bullding Fund that I\npropose aims to mainstream quality assured high energy standards in public\nsector building and social housing projects.\n4 years ago I chaired an All\nParty Group on Kirklees Council looking at the Passivhaus standard. A quality\nassured means of construction that produces buildings with low energy\ndemand, low carbon emissions and high\nenergy efficiency standards. These are airtight properties with mechanical heat\nrecovery ventilation.\nWe looked at costs and\ngathered evidence from the Passivhaus Trust, and leading pioneering councils\nlike Norwich City Council and Exeter City Council where they have mainstreamed\nPassivhaus on public sector projects. Once backed by a good supply of work and\na policy that gives the construction sector the confidence to invest in skills,\nconstruction costs are not that much higher than building to current building\nregulation standards. The Passivhaus Trust reckons additional building cost are\nsomewhere between 4-8% but that cost is soon recovered in saved energy costs. Some\nof the most powerful evidence we took was talking to people who lived in passivhaus\nproperties and also seeing passive houses being constructed.\nThis is where policy can make\na difference. So the conclusion of the All Party Passivhaus Group 4 years ago\nwas to recommend to the Kirkees Labour Cabinet that we specify the Passivhaus\nStandard or equivalent in all public funded projects or as a condition of sale\non the sale of council land for development.\nSadly the Kirklees Cabinet\nhas ignored the report and sadly when challenged uses evidence on costs derived\nfrom one off demonstration projects which by their nature can cost an\nadditional 30% or more.\nSo my proposal as West\nYorkshire Mayor is to establish a Green Building Fund to cover up to 5% on top\nof the usual capital cost of the development to ensure that all public sector\nprojects are constructed to the Passivhaus standard or an equivalent standard\nthat achieves the same outcomes. The fund would stay at 5% for the first 5\nyears and then the percentage would decrease gradually as skills and\nfamiliarity with the standard help construction costs come down. This would not\nonly cut emissions but put thousands of pounds back in the pockets of\nhouseholders in saved energy bills, with money generally going back into the\nlocal economy.\nWon’t the Government’s future\nhomes standard do the same job in reducing energy costs and carbon emissions?\nWell probably not . Research has shown that there is a substantial performance\ngap on supposedly green homes where they use far more energy than predicted.\nThe quality assured approach to Passivhaus Construction ensures it does pretty\nmuch what it says on the tin and energy demand remains very low with 70-90%\nreductions in fuel bills typically being reported.\nWe also want to tackle the\nneed to retrofit existing properties to reduce their emissions with some\nsubstantial demonstration programmes that will aim to influence the significant\ninvestment needed from national Government, who have so far avoided a long term\nstrategy to tackle the emissions of existing buildings. This is where the Mayor\ncan make a real difference by being a pathfinder and policy innovator leading\nthe way forward for national governments.\nThe education and skills\nresponsibility of the Mayor should be harnessed to ensure we have the\narchitects, suppliers and builders to deliver the Green Building Fund, renovation\nof existing houses and to ensure that we have the skills to address challenges\nwe know are coming such as the move from gas boilers to air sourced heat pumps\nwhich is a significant challenge in itself.\nI’m also a strong supporter\nof social rented housing, but they have been poorly served by successive\ngovernments of all political hues, with an ever diminishing council housing\nstock due to the wrong headed, right to buy policy. Social housing is a social\ngood, an alternative to ownership, more secure than private rental and ensures\nthere is an alternative to both. We need a strong and growing social housing\nsector to create not just the poverty housing of last resort but a viable\noption for people who can’t get on the housing ladder. With enough support and\nrising numbers of council housing it would be an essential check on rising house\nprices. The power I would seek from Government is the right for Councils in\nWest Yorkshire to suspend the right to buy to ensure the business plans for\ninvestment in new Council housing stacked up and there would no longer by a\nhole in the financial case for investment.\nThe role of West Yorkshire\nMayor should not just be a souped up Council Leader or a MP with a bigger constituency.\nIt has to be something different, It has got to be about generating real change,\nproviding direction for the region and providing the policies that we need to deliver\na sustainable future.",

What really made the scheme fly was the Green Party amendment to the 2007 Council Budget that made the scheme free for all applicants. This is what we should be doing with this scheme.”\n“With the cost of capital borrowing so low at present the Council can use its financial leverage to top up the Government proposal ensuring people don’t have to dip into their pockets during a time of recession and job losses. Really the Government should make the scheme free but in the absence of that Councils like Kirklees and across the Country could fill the gap and make the difference. Existing funding via Regional Sources such as the West Yorkshire Combined Authority could also play a big role in financing such a scheme ”\n“For householders the hundreds they will save oon their energy bills means more money in their pockets at a time of huge financial uncertainty. The impact on reducing our carbon emissions will also be significant,”\n“The involvement of local councils in the scheme will help with local promotion and also provide local accountability helping ensure quality of work”\n“ This level of funding could allow us to carry out insulation work on hard to treat cavity walls, provide external wall insulation, attic room and under floor insulation. It is a huge opportunity if done properly wih a focus on quality work.”\n“ Kirklees has the opportunity once again to be a national Leader in action on Climate Change and show through example what can be achieved with imagination and political commitment. If other Councils follow our lead we could make the scheme free for millions across the UK. “\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Admittedly Lib Dems are practically toxic to young voters (my 16 year old son does refer to Clegg as \"Cameron's Butt Monkey\") but that misses one important function of these debates which is to hold the guilty to account. As the guarantors/collaborators with the Conservative government Clegg needs not only to comment on the future (that he won't be a part of) but also answer to us all for propping up a Coalition Government that has cut taxes for millionaires while reducing the incomes of the very poorest who will never benefit from a reduction in income tax. He could also explain how with one of the lowest percentages of energy generated from Renewable sources in Europe he can still claim to be part of he \"greenest Government Ever\".\nI'm sure some enterprising person will set up an online petition to allow Nick to join Dave, Ed, Nigel and Natalie at the debates but I can't be bothered right now as I'm very busy and only catching the news in snatches.\n:)\nReplyDelete",

This was for officers who were unfamiliar with Greens and didn't understand what drove them. It is important that Greens are understood by the people who help us to make our political commitments a reality in the areas that we represent.\nI have been a Green Party Cabinet member myself from 2000 to 2006 and have worked with Greens in other Councils in positions of influence or formal power. So I took some soundings from a range of people in the Green Party and this is what I came up with.\nThe importance of\nthe climate emergency\nGreens have a sense\nof mission particularly with regard to the Climate Emergency, so this is\nunsurprisingly a strong focus. The first Council Climate Emergency was declared\nby Bristol City Council in a motion proposed by our now leader Cllr Carla\nDenyer.\nNo climate\njustice without social justice\nGreens are acutely\naware that climate justice and social justice must come hand in hand. Those\nthat are placed at the greatest risk by the climate emergency are the most\nvulnerable. Greens will be interested in and aim for restorative actions to\naddress both, such as prioritising insulation for low income households\nCompromise is not\na likely option\nThere is no trading\noff environmental priorities against economic ones. Telling Greens we are going\nto do these things that will create jobs, housing etc but will have a\nsignificantly harmful environmental impact will not go down well.\nA sense of\nurgency\nThe sense of urgency\nto address climate issues may well be more palpable than other parties as it has\nbeen top of the Greens agenda for decades.\nEconomic growth\nis not a driver for Green Cllrs\nIn the economy\nGrowth is not seen as the goal but sustainability recognising that the economy\nis dependent on the environment to function. Greens are more likely to driven\nby ideas such as thoughts espoused in Doughnut Economics that look at all the outputs\nGreen Councillors\n– Resource or challenge\nMany Greens are well\ninformed on climate matters, energy efficiency, renewable energy, biodiversity\netc and so can be regarded as an informed resource or a challenge to\nprofessionals. How this goes will very much be about how Green Cllrs and\nOfficers approach each other.\nCertainty\nAs things Greens\nhave been saying for decades are now recognised as mainstream this gives many\nGreens a sense of certainty in their views and opinions and sometimes that means\ncertainty about things that are not yet mainstream.\nNeed for evidence\nto back assertions\nGreens like anyone\ncan be wrong on green issues but if they are, then more effort might be required\nto demonstrate they are wrong and referencing sources is important as is the\nperceived legitimacy of those sources.\nNo whipping\nsystem\nGreens are of course\nmembers of a Party, but they don’t have a Party whipping system like other\nparties have. Of course, they would like all their members to vote the same way\nbut if one votes a different way and the reasons are understood it is not\nnecessarily the end of the world.\nThe past is the past\nGreens will feel no\nobligation to carry on with decisions made by previous administrations if they\nconflict with their values\nSpace to innovate\nSome officers may\nhave felt constrained and unable to try new radical projects. Greens may well\nbe the Councillors who will give officers the space to try new things where\nprevious administrations may have been too ‘small c’ conservative. They will\nwant to show their difference from what has gone before so innovation may be\nencouraged.\nNatural\nco-operators – no honestly!\nDespite their\ncertainty, sense of urgency and mission and rejection of conventional economics\nGreens can be natural co-operators and are not as traditionally partisan as\nother some other parties.",

I'm pretty sure that he didn't give local Labour Party members much more, if any, notice than the Huddersfield Examiner and the Council got. With only a few weeks to go before close of nominations this allows the Labour Party and the other Parties little time to find an additional candidate. In theory it should be straightforward for Labour to get another name for the ballot paper in Greenhead. There was a selection for the Greenhead seat with 2 candidates and one came out on top and the sitting Councillor was deselected. So the 'easy' answer would be to make both of them Labour Candidates for the Local Election in Greenhead Ward. That may yet happen but the fractious effect and outcome of the previous selection contest would have to be set on one side and that may just be too difficult. There is the other complication that the deselected Labour Candidate is now selected for the more problematic Ward of Almondbury. You can't help thinking how much less complicated things would have been for Labour if Mehboob had just stood down months ago before the selection contest. A lot of Labour angst may have been avoided. Still not my problem!\nAt last weeks Full Council meeting, the last before the Local Elections, tributes were given to those members who were standing down. At that time Mehboob's name was not on the list so no tributes! He still had a year left to run on his term of office and had already spent a year being a Kirklees Councillor when mainly being based in London. You get the distinct impression that Mehboob's departure was as much of a surprise to the current Labour Leader as it was to the rest of us.\nThere's a lot that has been said about Mehboob and his sometimes complex dealings and there's a lot more I and others could say. Recognising that both Teflon and Luck are finite materials has meant Mehboob has been able to choose the manner of his own departure, a luxury not many politicians have.\nHere's a dramatised version of Labour Leader David Sheard responding to Mehboob's hasty departure!\nHere's a dramatised version of Labour Leader David Sheard responding to Mehboob's hasty departure!",

One of the things that struck me again and again was how some of the things that make Bilbao special could be applied to Huddersfield.\nBilbao has had the major attraction of the Guggenheim Art Gallery for over 20 years. It is an absolutely amazing modern building that has been a big feature of the regeneration story of Bilbao. I won't feature pictures of the Guggenheim here but feel free to tap on the link to see it. I want to focus instead on some of the features in the streetscape that adds to the experience of people visiting the city.\nStreet art and sculpture is a big feature. There is\nusually something to look at to delight the eye. A statue, a large mural or an eye catching art installation. I've seen it as a feature in many European Countries. I remember a 30 foot tall Pinnochio on a roundabout in Sweden which was hard to miss. Street art makes a visit to a town or City Centre a cultural experience not just a shopping one. It gives a place character and though some installations may not to be everyones taste they can't be ignored. It wasn't just on the main streets but also in the back streets where you would see a mural bringing an otherwise boring wall to life.\nAnother thing I noticed was the number of play areas in the city centre, At a number of budget meetings at Kirklees we have proposed a play area outside Huddersfield Bus Station and it has always been turned down. One Councillor even suggested that we were proposing to make the whole of the Town Centre into a play area. We weren't but what a great idea! The point is that it makes a place family friendly. It is more than just a space where people go to shop it is a place where there is something for people of all ages to enjoy.\nDrinking fountains are everywhere but not just boring functional ones but ornate ones and ones like a lions head. People can be\nrefreshed for free. In this part of Spain you can definitely drink the water!\nThere are a lot of trees and greenery about the place adding to the quality of the place. Even the tram lines went across a lawned area (they do this in Manchester too).\nSo I hope some bold and risky ideas are coming out of the Huddersfield Town Centre Masterplanning process that are challenging and broaden the offer to people. One test may be to see if they are initially controversial enough to create opposition. Can you imagine proposing a 20 foot spider statue on New Street?

They beat us to it in proposing\nthe Kirklees Campaign Against Climate Change inspired motion on the ‘Tipping\nPoint’ – the point at which we go past the point of no return on Climate Change\nand the urgent need to act now. I couldn’t\nlet the moment pass without mentioning the Lib Dems actual record in Government\nas the Party actually in charge of the Department of Energy and Climate Change.\nWhen Chris Huhne was in the driving seat of DECC (and definitely no one else!) they\ndeclared they were going to be the ‘Greenest Government Ever’. The truth has\nbeen somewhat less than that. Massive cuts to the Energy Company Obligation\nBudget to placate the readers of ‘The Sun’, severe reductions in the Feed In tariffs for\nsolar energy, the UK heading for total failure in our obligations under the EU 2020\nRenewable Energy Directive and a disgraceful role in removing binding targets\nat the EU level on energy efficiency and renewable energy for the 2030 targets.\nIt would not be responsible of anyone who really knew the issues to leave the\nLib Dems to ‘get the onion out’ and talk about how deeply they felt about\nClimate Change without comment. So I did\ncomment and a fair bit of personal animosity came my way thereafter. I played the ball, the Lib Dems decided to\nplay the man. No problem for me.\nLib Dem Cllr David Ridgeway said that all I could do was ‘snipe,\nmither, moan and bicker’ talk ‘tripe’\nand make ‘crass comments’and claimed that I was saying that only the Green\nParty knew about these issues. In fact the concerns I raised were those raised\nby the energy efficiency and renewable energy industries. These are people who\nemploy skilled workers across a range of technologies who are laying off staff,\nscaling back work and sometimes going out of business altogether.the people who often suffer are those on low incomes who don't get a new boiler or the insulation they might have expected. My comments\nwere legitimate but a bit tough for a loyal Lib Dem to take I guess.\nSome of the real venom came from Lib Dem Cllr Andrew\nMarchington. A bit of a shame really I used to know him in the distant past in\nthe 80s in my old Young Liberal days. It is pretty obvious he has an issue with\nme in particular but then I am critical of the Party he represents. He definitely went off on\none about the Greens in general and even got onto talking about the Swiss Green\nParty which he obviously knows more about than me. He accused me of saying, “The Greens are the only ones who understand\nit” actually my information is based on\nthe science and the oft expressed views of the sustainable energy industries.\nHe even accused us of being more left wing than Labour - not a difficult task really. He did confess to being a bit wound up during\nthe debate. Ah well!\nIf you want to see it all its true horror I start speakingat 2.23.30. and the Lib Dems start losing it shortly after that. http://connect.kirklees.public-i.tv/site/player/pl_v7.php?a=152944&t=&m=flash&l=en_GB\nThe other thing worth noting is that the Conservatives abstained on the motion with no explanation why. This should have been acutely embarrasing to Conservative Leader Robert Light who understands the issues and has been the Deputy Lead at the Environment Agency. I guess the climate change denying /anti wind turbine wing in his Party held sway on this one. Poor Robert!\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

It should have been a difficult choice. Taking on an old building with all the costs and upkeep that came with it. But it was a choice we couldn't walk away from. A large building in the centre of Newsome with huge potential for events, conferences and a community cafe, something the village lacks. A place where people could hold celebrations and come together as a community. We couldn't ignore that vision and started making plans.<p></p><p>We established a Community Benefit Society as the body we would need to purchase and develop the centre. We commissioned local architects, One17, to help us realise our vision for the building and to assess the maintenance and improvments we will need to make to the building. We have raised funding to pay for the building and carry out some essential repairs. We have secured planning permission from Kirklees for change of use from a place of worship to a community centre with ancilliary cafe. That is the short version of the story. There have been some frustrations and bumps in the road along the way.</p><p></p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcI92WuXoZ0awFi7w5-yGv15K2zeKdjhOwH27Kwg-EWcY4xvY08kmQ1azFszRi-beofhnMvFBgpQO7-VPzLzvv5ljBcWZTe5ayg59q2nOEEcP4YVpaknYzuKWBVD9MXpLIBVu9KNa9PZqP6Z1CJ7EPFe7JW0YH3n4Uuo0F3qtpmC1F7FcrEh_HJ20md21M/s3000/newsome-centre-stacked.jpg\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"3000\" data-original-width=\"3000\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcI92WuXoZ0awFi7w5-yGv15K2zeKdjhOwH27Kwg-EWcY4xvY08kmQ1azFszRi-beofhnMvFBgpQO7-VPzLzvv5ljBcWZTe5ayg59q2nOEEcP4YVpaknYzuKWBVD9MXpLIBVu9KNa9PZqP6Z1CJ7EPFe7JW0YH3n4Uuo0F3qtpmC1F7FcrEh_HJ20md21M/s320/newsome-centre-stacked.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />We know that getting ownership of the building is only the beginning of the journey. The roof will need replacing. We have a variety of tarpaulins and buckets collecting rainwater from various points in the roof. The kitchen and toilet block are in a very poor state and we need a small extension and a refit to bring it up to modern standards. There's a lot more that we have planned including upgrading the heating and insulation, creating meeting rooms, removing the pews to give us a usable halls for dancing, exercise clases and events.<p></p><p>We have got local people together to discuss our vision for the building and to get their ideas and input. As local Councillors we have initiated saving the building for the community but now we will need the help of the community to ensure it has a sustainable long term future. There is a lot of work to do but it will be worth it.</p><p>If you can donate to our Crowdfunder it would be really appreciated</p><p><a href=\"https://www.spacehive.com/the-newsome-centre-phase-2/pledge\">Make a pledge to The Newsome Centre (Phase 2) Proposal on Spacehive</a></p><p>.</p>Andrew Cooperhttp://www.blogger.com/profile/16254689033137968918noreply@blogger.com0tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7196059482061221339.post-71742843334408634392023-12-01T10:14:00.005+00:002023-12-10T20:31:13.654+00:00Motion to Kirklees Council - Permanent Ceasefire in Gaza<p><span style=\"font-family: arial;

Local residents have been calling for action to reduce speeds for some time. The scheme did not meet Kirklees Council’s criteria for funding so we had to use our limited local budget to ensure the traffic calming went ahead. As the Westgate part of the schemes and some of Kaye Lane were in the neighbouring Almondbury Ward we pooled our local budget with the Almondbury Councillors budget to enable the scheme to get the go ahead. The important thing is that this will make a dangerous road safer.”</span></p><div><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><br /></span></div></span>Andrew Cooperhttp://www.blogger.com/profile/16254689033137968918noreply@blogger.com0tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7196059482061221339.post-57022499747312396322023-03-05T19:44:00.001+00:002023-03-05T19:44:18.996+00:00Newsome residents protest at Kirklees plans to build on green space<p></p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj46eAsfWaB3hzwTmCT9h8JEnjUqmCLiQjy_Qn4pfVlSti3HbGamI29HOtg7HNS_XGjvo0XgNUrp0WjFEcZGf-wGlpmNa4mtK9j9p-UzXeUUy4_ynpet7BBmZbIrzqo6jngS7Xydd-ua33o974Eapbtm4ZWUNtlyk7iIOL78amkm587-7oQhp7EQNtdSw/s4256/Mansion%20Gardens%20protest.JPG\" style=\"clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"2832\" data-original-width=\"4256\" height=\"319\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj46eAsfWaB3hzwTmCT9h8JEnjUqmCLiQjy_Qn4pfVlSti3HbGamI29HOtg7HNS_XGjvo0XgNUrp0WjFEcZGf-wGlpmNa4mtK9j9p-UzXeUUy4_ynpet7BBmZbIrzqo6jngS7Xydd-ua33o974Eapbtm4ZWUNtlyk7iIOL78amkm587-7oQhp7EQNtdSw/w480-h319/Mansion%20Gardens%20protest.JPG\" width=\"480\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Protest at Mansion Gardens</td></tr></tbody></table> <p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Newsome residents have gathered to protest against Kirklees proposals to build on 2 well loved green spaces.</span></p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-cb4805c0-7fff-0a1a-e509-6f8ba544b0ec\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Kirklees Council will soon be consulting on its plans to build 32 houses on land adjacent to Jackroyd Lane in Newsome and a further 40 houses at nearby Blue Bell Hill.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Local Newsome Green Party Councillors Sue Lee- Richards, Karen Allison and Andrew Cooper are backing local residents against the Labour led Council’s plans</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Councillor Sue Lee-Richards said,</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">“</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Both the land at Jackroyd Lane and at Blue Bell Hill are valued by the local community.

The importance of access to nearby green spaces for good mental health has become really clear to so many of us through the covid lockdown. Kirklees needs to protect green land not build on it. There are plenty of brownfield sites we should develop on if we really care about our local environments.”</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Councillor Karen Allison said,</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">“The access to both sites is very poor with narrow roads through built up residential areas towards the fields the Council wants to build on.

Newsome Mills due to arson and the Mill ponds due to the\nPlanning Inspectorate. So when it came to St Johns our view was ‘Not this time\nand not this building’<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 107%;\">We formed a\nCommunity Benefit Society, registered with the Financial Conduct Authority,\nwith the express aim of making the church building into a Community café and\nEvent space. So to be clear it is not the council taking over the building but\nthe community of Newsome itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 107%;\">We will\nrespect the buildings past and what it has meant to generations of local people\nwho have been christened, married and had funerals here, We recognise the\nhistory and heritage of the building and we are pleased that the Church of\nEngland will continue to have a relationship with us as a member of ‘The\nNewsome Centre’s’ board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 107%;\">Our vision,\ninformed by hundreds of conversations with local people is to have a warm\ncomfortable place where the community can come together, have a cuppa, have a\nchat, share the ups and downs of everyday life, maybe bend the ear of your\nlocal cllr. <o:p></o:p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 107%;\">We want\npeople to celebrate life events here so not weddings but wedding receptions,\nnot funerals but wakes certainly. We want this to be a centre for community\nevents and a small conference centre.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\"> </span>It\ncould well be a space for exercise classes. You have no idea how much I am\nlooking forward to attending my first Yoga or pilates class here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 107%;\">We will need\nyour help to realise this vision. Architects One17 have costed up the elements\nof the project and we have a plan. The first job is to purchase the building\nand the Church of England are being very reasonable but we still need to raise\nthe cash so <a href=\"https://www.spacehive.com/a-new-community-hub-for-newsome\">please support our crowdfunder</a> if you can and come and look at our\nplans in the Scout Hut after this service and ask us questions. We have set a\ntarget of 150 days from now to raise the funds needed. After that we will be\nlooking to raise the money needed for a new toilet and kitchen block and we\nhave a plan to raise those funds also. <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\"> </span>Then we hope to be up and running.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 107%;\">Today is the\nend of one chapter of this building’s life and an important one but we have\nhope, and we have a plan and we have the goodwill of the community, so there\nwill be a future/</span></p>Andrew Cooperhttp://www.blogger.com/profile/16254689033137968918noreply@blogger.com0tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7196059482061221339.post-16307489890105199382023-01-01T13:59:00.004+00:002023-01-13T17:13:37.620+00:00Greens in Power - What officers should know.<p></p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiPxm9vBgHK7nuSlBYov0r0yHMxUO_glJcc9Kv6W2uHI3yWwjN9dxIDwOqxS0zlTIooJjcf6BRqzNFydLrO7UtQ3FzDwtDFwVQiVPZbQPZZVmG8Y96pctIqxbSHp4l8Yg8YqU662IRzbT9ioMAVrxK26j9XDO4RLg-bLZ0ALlwkkqvXqmxi3Gxsvuuq6Q/s800/Mind.jpg\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"500\" data-original-width=\"800\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiPxm9vBgHK7nuSlBYov0r0yHMxUO_glJcc9Kv6W2uHI3yWwjN9dxIDwOqxS0zlTIooJjcf6BRqzNFydLrO7UtQ3FzDwtDFwVQiVPZbQPZZVmG8Y96pctIqxbSHp4l8Yg8YqU662IRzbT9ioMAVrxK26j9XDO4RLg-bLZ0ALlwkkqvXqmxi3Gxsvuuq6Q/s320/Mind.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div> Recently I was asked to explain what are the key characteristics and motivations for Greens in positions of power on local councils. This was for officers who were unfamiliar with Greens and didn't understand what drove them. It is important that Greens are understood by the people who help us to make our political commitments a reality in the areas that we represent. <p></p><p>I have been a Green Party Cabinet member myself from 2000 to 2006 and have worked with Greens in other Councils in positions of influence or formal power. So I took some soundings from a range of people in the Green Party and this is what I came up with.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk86665443;\"><b><o:p> </o:p></b></span><b>The importance of\nthe climate emergency</b></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk86665443;\"><o:p> </o:p></span>Greens have a sense\nof mission particularly with regard to the Climate Emergency, so this is\nunsurprisingly a strong focus. The first Council Climate Emergency was declared\nby Bristol City Council in a motion proposed by our now leader Cllr Carla\nDenyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk86665443;\"><o:p> </o:p></span><b>No climate\njustice without social justice</b></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk86665443;\"><o:p> </o:p></span>Greens are acutely\naware that climate justice and social justice must come hand in hand. Those\nthat are placed at the greatest risk by the climate emergency are the most\nvulnerable. Greens will be interested in and aim for restorative actions to\naddress both, such as prioritising insulation for low income households</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk86665443;\"><o:p> </o:p></span><b>Compromise is not\na likely option</b></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk86665443;\"><o:p> </o:p></span>There is no trading\noff environmental priorities against economic ones.

Of course, they would like all their members to vote the same way\nbut if one votes a different way and the reasons are understood it is not\nnecessarily the end of the world.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk86665443;\"><b><o:p> </o:p></b></span><b> The past is the past</b></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk86665443;\"><o:p> </o:p></span>Greens will feel no\nobligation to carry on with decisions made by previous administrations if they\nconflict with their values</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk86665443;\"><b><o:p> </o:p></b></span><b>Space to innovate</b></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk86665443;\"><o:p> </o:p></span>Some officers may\nhave felt constrained and unable to try new radical projects.

A core focus of this criticism is expected around the non-committal nature of this CCAP at this stage in the process. To combat this, we are striving to clearly communicate how the next steps in our action plan process will result in firm commitments, once we have developed and identified – through extensive resident and stakeholder engagement, a refined number of high-priority actions by place, which will be accompanied by a business case providing indicative costs and carbon figures. </span></p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">So in a strange way I am reassured by this report. Reassured because I have heard certain Cabinet Members saying how we are one of the best Councils in the country on addressing climate change.

We were told we could only go out for exercise for an hour each day. So, for those of us who hardly exercised at all it seemed like a great challenge. For me and Liz it was a walk one day followed by a run the next. Despite the obvious background horror of it all it was lovely getting out in the sunshine in the clear air exploring the countryside around where we lived. Then one day my foot went down a hole I limped a fair bit after that. When my leg got better, I couldn't run without pain and a long period of limping after I tried. Steroid injections didn't seem to make much difference, nor did physiotherapy so following an X-Ray I was sent into an MRI Scanner that's like a very noisy iron lung that gives detailed picture of your insides. When I got my results. it turned out I had arthritis in my right knee. I was offered a new knee. Now my parents in their 80s have 3 new knees so the principle wasn't unfamiliar to me, but I was only 57 and was it that bad really? I could walk for miles. Sometimes my knee hurt but it got better after a few days. In the end I wondered what the state of the NHS might be in a few years and decided to take the opportunity to get it done now when I could. There is so much uncertainty at the moment and with the Perma crisis that we are living in showing no sign of abating then it seemed foolhardy not to take the op.<p></p><p></p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjGsqitUBB0imQMj-jYObC952AoH1ZgtGvlzouxwCF8zAU_18FXv_OdTPRp7MF52SiB-n-ZZ4IXUaszzKFKy5Tzqs7eB1hR7qZDgC89ls38tPwmESr6WpEZKx7m5hZ9OtVpIzUWdFuLUKqwoBXZUaJ0MWS2CRzoJLD1t3Mx8Z0crAwR8lDiMRg3bg9YLQ\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img alt=\"\" data-original-height=\"866\" data-original-width=\"400\" height=\"228\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjGsqitUBB0imQMj-jYObC952AoH1ZgtGvlzouxwCF8zAU_18FXv_OdTPRp7MF52SiB-n-ZZ4IXUaszzKFKy5Tzqs7eB1hR7qZDgC89ls38tPwmESr6WpEZKx7m5hZ9OtVpIzUWdFuLUKqwoBXZUaJ0MWS2CRzoJLD1t3Mx8Z0crAwR8lDiMRg3bg9YLQ=w106-h228\" width=\"106\" /></a></div><br />The operation itself seemed to go well, was very professionally done. I was asked the same questions several times by different people in the same hospital. I was fine with this; they didn't want to make a mistake. and I didn't want them to make a mistake either! I came round was given a very nice cottage pie and the following morning was released with my cocktail of painkillers. So now I have my daily knee exercises and get a bit wiped out by the strong painkillers. I've avoided the bottle of morphine they gave me though I confess I wondered what it would be like taking it. <p></p><p>So, my hope is that I will end up with a less painful knee and that I will be able to start doing Park runs again.

Left Bank is successful conversion of a church into a community cafe, event space and music venue. We were really interested to see how it operated as we are hoping to do something similar in St John's Church in Newsome through the new Community Benefit Society, we have set up called 'The Newsome Centre'.<p></p><p>It has been in operation for 20 years so seeing what they do, learning from their successes and avoiding pitfalls was a good use of our time. </p><p>A big chunk of their income comes from weddings, not the ceremonies (as former churches can't be used for that purpose), but the receptions where families come together to celebrate marriages. These are some of the most important days of many people's lives so really important that these are done right and professionally. </p><p></p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiyNyLzFsYcV9oV0xe_DAby6urQ7hpN3uWv6H4CtdI1A7J_a6L6cb80OKgbNpww_0kZgq7GwkIRzvL9khZpagFqwwZbeVAQ-WVxPOH9QSYdWVBssNvqmi_DRRwCnzPTO1GTnDuOQIPSD3chX4MDfA9Cl-qCPXVbF_Xw-wI4O5_m9VJJ-3qFWVJZ6ResoA\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img alt=\"\" data-original-height=\"866\" data-original-width=\"399\" height=\"370\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiyNyLzFsYcV9oV0xe_DAby6urQ7hpN3uWv6H4CtdI1A7J_a6L6cb80OKgbNpww_0kZgq7GwkIRzvL9khZpagFqwwZbeVAQ-WVxPOH9QSYdWVBssNvqmi_DRRwCnzPTO1GTnDuOQIPSD3chX4MDfA9Cl-qCPXVbF_Xw-wI4O5_m9VJJ-3qFWVJZ6ResoA=w171-h370\" width=\"171\" /></a></div>Left Bank and its cafe are open 7 days a week and when we went it was full of young people, mainly students, using the Wi-Fi, having a coffee and doing coursework. Through the week a variety of different groups use the space such as Knit and Natter groups, life drawing classes, older persons art groups, pottery classes, break dancers. It is a vibrant hub for the community, and they have a rich programme of events including Beer Festivals, Arts Festivals, 70s nights, Christmas Parties and indoor 'car boot' sales.<p></p><p>There is a mix of seating from comfy settees, desk space and a few pews. There's a recognition of their heritage as a church with a pulpit, the old organ and a number of other features remaining in place. You can buy a house plant or two there, a birthday card and paintings from local artists. </p><p>The look of the place is quite funky with attractive lighting installations and bright colourful murals. You would be quite happy to spend a few relaxing hours hanging out there with a coffee and a nice piece of cake.</p><p>One key bit of advice we had was \"be generous\" to organisations with time and space. There should be space for income generating activity but also free space to organisations which have a lot to give to the community and add to the activity and vibrancy of the place.</p><p>A big thanks to Sue Jennings from Left Bank who gave us a real insight into the sort of things we need to be looking at in The Newsome Centre's Business Plan.</p>Andrew Cooperhttp://www.blogger.com/profile/16254689033137968918noreply@blogger.com0tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7196059482061221339.post-35822827960763813102022-11-06T20:16:00.004+00:002022-11-06T20:25:55.555+00:00A629 Edgerton Road widening axed not the trees!<p></p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiwNQQ78nhT7-S_qeVgTta22GYQoqyoaZFjmc6TzgY_EREY6TnXwv3QsVO8ESalJanta3JhBelMNTYMFRIX9U1SwGqyXm5DPHd83qt6zHN-iifAbNWQToQ2GIzYv8vJ8x_7sE7dDRawhYEwMWBX1LoTSXKpc_EOpUDSIwFcMN_4Xau6unJZWlG3hMWZ7w/s810/Blacker%20road%20trees.jpg\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"539\" data-original-width=\"810\" height=\"213\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiwNQQ78nhT7-S_qeVgTta22GYQoqyoaZFjmc6TzgY_EREY6TnXwv3QsVO8ESalJanta3JhBelMNTYMFRIX9U1SwGqyXm5DPHd83qt6zHN-iifAbNWQToQ2GIzYv8vJ8x_7sE7dDRawhYEwMWBX1LoTSXKpc_EOpUDSIwFcMN_4Xau6unJZWlG3hMWZ7w/s320/Blacker%20road%20trees.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div> I got the news last week that the Kirklees proposal to fell 88 trees near the Blacker Road junction to widen the road had been \"paused\". <p></p><p>\" Paused\" is defined as \"interrupting an action briefly\" but this pause is not brief. There is no funding from West Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority nor Kirklees for this part of the scheme and there is no plan to take it forward. So \"shelved\" or even \"cancelled\" seems much more accurate a description.</p><p>It has been a long campaign to save these trees along what is regarded as an iconic and beautiful tree lined route through Edgerton into Huddersfield. I am full of admiration for the determination of the campaigners. They lobbied Councillors in the rain outside Huddersfield Town Hall, put questions to the Labour Cabinet members in Full Council meetings and staged \"Banners at the Junction\" protests on numerous Saturday mornings. At times it seemed that success was unlikely but now it is clear that they have succeeded.</p><p>The success is not an admission of error by either WYCMA or Kirklees. The reason given is funding constraints and overprogramming. Basically, due to inflation and other factors they haven't got the budget they need to do everything they want to do. The campaigners' victory is down to them making so clear that this is such an unpopular scheme that it was top of the list to be cut. So unfortunately, no revelatory moment from the Labour Cabinet or the West Yorkshire Mayor.</p><p>The arguments against the widening and tree felling were very clear. The carbon emissions calculations were dubious, the impact on heritage ignored as was the effect on local biodiversity. These arguments were amplified by the Council's own Tree Officer, the Kirklees Climate Commission and the Woodland Trust. Their arguments against were never properly addressed by the Labour Cabinet member. <a href=\"https://clrandrewcooper.blogspot.com/2021/10/facts-and-nothing-but-facts-labours.html\"><b>Instead of addressing their arguments he decided to accuse me of making up my own facts</b></a> when all I was doing was repeating their facts.

The problem with this advice is that it all looks\na bit piecemeal when compared with the cost of living tsunami which is hurtling towards us all.\nThere are going to be people who can make adjustments to their heating systems\ntimers and thermostats that will save them hundreds of pounds but these will be\nthe people who can afford to keep their heating systems running.

This is a totally necessary and responsible activity for any large public organisation responsible for delivering vital local services. There is a danger however that this reinforces the risk averse culture that can exist in many councils with an emphasis on playing it safe and giving an undue weight to risk avoidance rather than taking opportunities.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">In June Sheffield City Council passed a resolution to establish a Corporate Opportunities Register to balance the attention given to risk and opportunity by senior officers and Councillors. The motion proposed by the Green Party group said,</span></p><p><i><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">\"that to act as a balance to the Corporate Risk Register, there\nshould be a Corporate Opportunities Register, detailing new funding\nopportunities, partnership opportunities and initiatives that will help\ndeliver the Council's objectives, such as supporting those affected\nby the cost of living crisis.\"</span></i></p><p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">So what might a Corporate Opportunities Register look like? First you need to identify what the opportunity is. Is it funding you can bid for from Government or other sources? Is it a partnership with another organisation that might help you drive efficiencies and deliver better services? Is it a new activity that can help the Council achieve it's aims or generate an income stream? All these opportunities would need to be broken down by directorates to ensure high level attention is given across the council .</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Not all opportunities we could take should be taken. Perhaps the likelihood of success is low or the effort expended simply not worth it, but demonstrating that as an organisation the Council is aware and tracking opportunities is important. It builds confidence and shows that officers and members are outward looking and keen to look beyond the councils own resources to achieve it's goals.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">The real gain from establishing a Corporate Opportunities Register is to show that the culture of the Council is one that is outward facing, ambitious for it's people, entrepreneurial and dynamic. Surely that is something we would like all our Councils to be?</span></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>Andrew Cooperhttp://www.blogger.com/profile/16254689033137968918noreply@blogger.com0tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7196059482061221339.post-81640498563497027412022-04-21T13:08:00.002+01:002022-04-21T13:08:12.113+01:00Kirklees Green Party Councillors 2022 Manifesto<p> <b><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Starting the retrofit revolution in Kirklees</span></span></b><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"> </span></p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: left;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgkRqV4CzEecBuBqLy3lrnp_Zvh7UUxVxCBq-lHxxWaWmLqWIe4NsCWQh9yfTVi2HKIUTxnwJiOQufh8ycX8LC7bVxH9itTKTBN-CWoyvj2N5alFTobWit1gOvtb1SPTlc6FoDj66QA25lPju1tPbO2e1mOyMh1_lIAfx-_I6yMD5aVuSwfRKhJKTM4OA=s960\" style=\"clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"720\" data-original-width=\"960\" height=\"336\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgkRqV4CzEecBuBqLy3lrnp_Zvh7UUxVxCBq-lHxxWaWmLqWIe4NsCWQh9yfTVi2HKIUTxnwJiOQufh8ycX8LC7bVxH9itTKTBN-CWoyvj2N5alFTobWit1gOvtb1SPTlc6FoDj66QA25lPju1tPbO2e1mOyMh1_lIAfx-_I6yMD5aVuSwfRKhJKTM4OA=w446-h336\" width=\"446\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Cllr Cooper visiting Energiesprong homes in Nottingham</b></td></tr></tbody></table><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">The Council has made a start on retrofitting its own housing stock.

We frequently hear from Labour Cabinet members about how we are ‘the best’ in this policy area. We aren’t. There are positive things happening on the climate agenda in Kirklees but we are not forerunners or innovators in addressing climate change. The lack of a climate action plan lead to the Council getting a 0% rating from Climate Emergency UK earlier this year. Joining the Global Covenant of Mayors would provide us with valuable insight and support form the international community of local and regional authorities addressing climate change. It works to provide value to participating councils by mobilizing the critical financing and technical assistance that members require to access investment. The Global Covenant of Mayors ensures that signatories are continuously supported in their efforts. Cities receive step-by-step guidance and have access to tools, materials, and a dedicated regional/national helpdesk.</span><p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><o:p> </o:p><a href=\"https://www.globalcovenantofmayors.org/\">https://www.globalcovenantofmayors.org/</a></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><o:p> </o:p><b><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\">Renewable energy installations in schools</span></b></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">The pupils of today are the citizens of the tomorrow.

In theory it's a Council with a minority Labour Administration but effectively has a majority due to the support of a former Labour Councillor who is now an Independent, frequent absences by some non Labour Councillors and an opposition with differing priorities.</span><p></p><p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Labour have been a shambles on Kirklees Council. The evidence is plentiful. The debacle over the Council <a href=\"https://clrandrewcooper.blogspot.com/2021/12/kirklees-reneges-on-rugby-league-museum.html\">breaking it's promise to host the National Rugby League Museum in The George Hotel,</a> the A629 road widening project which will see the felling of 126 trees on an iconic entrance way to Huddersfield, Labour Councillors backing the building of a modern hotel on Castle Hill, the site of an Iron Age hill fort and the Leader of the Council proclaiming he had encouraged the environmentally disastrous <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SaveOurSpen/status/1442433577795325952\">Amazon Warehouse development near Cleckheaton then denying later he had any view on the planning application</a>. Leadership on Kirklees Council has been sadly lacking and the Labour Group seem unable or unwilling to address the problem.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">On Climate Change, Labour in Kirklees are a pretty average Council but talk as if they are national leaders. They just aren't. Climate Emergency UK who independently assess councils responses to Climate Change gave Kirklees <a href=\"https://councilclimatescorecards.uk/#jump=kirklees-council\">a humiliating 0% due to their lack of a Climate Action Plan</a> to address the problem. This was confirmed this week when a <a href=\"https://www.kirklees.gov.uk/beta/climate-emergency/pdf/net-zero-carbon-assessment.pdf\">report by the University of Leeds</a> identified the lack of a Climate Action Plan. As the report is published on the Council's website and has the support of the Kirklees Climate Commission it is pretty clear it's accepted by Kirklees. The fact is that many other Councils have got Climate Action Plans and have done much more than Kirklees on Climate Change.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The Labour Administration of course wouldn't accept they are poor and would point to some of their activity which you will find on the Kirklees Website. One such example is the pilot project retrofitting 8 council properties on Abbey Road in Fartown. Labour Cabinet members trooped up there for a photocall with Labour Leader Keir Starmer. It looks like some good work has been carried out there but it is a one off pilot project with no plan to be replicated and no funds to do it again. In the <a href=\"https://clrandrewcooper.blogspot.com/2022/02/green-party-amendment-to-kirklees.html\">Green Group Budget Amendment</a> we proposed using the Energiesprong approach used by among others Nottingham City Council. With no funding coming from central Govt this offered a self funding and economically sustainable model. Labour rejected it. There are other examples <a href=\"https://clrandrewcooper.blogspot.com/2021/11/and-award-for-missed-opportunities-goes.html\">6 years on from the All Party Passivhaus report that recommended making the Passivhaus Standard the norm </a>for Kirklees new build housing projects, Labour are finally doing a 6 house pilot project. We have no idea really what will be learned from the pilot that can't be gleaned from just asking more forward thinking Councils like Exeter City Council that started on the Passivhaus approach 15 years ago. It is another example of timidity and tokenism when we need real leadership.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">So the possibility of a Labour Council with a majority doesn't exactly fill me with hope and joy just potential disappointment. Don't get me wrong there are plenty of good people in the Labour Party and I would much rather have a Labour Party that I could work with than what we have in Kirklees at present. So on May 5th vote Green, elect more Green Councillors and let's play our proper part in tackling climate change and the cost of living crisis.</span></p>Andrew Cooperhttp://www.blogger.com/profile/16254689033137968918noreply@blogger.com1tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7196059482061221339.post-75610558614441822182022-02-06T13:42:00.001+00:002022-02-06T17:02:23.232+00:00Green Party Amendment to the Kirklees Council Budget 2022/23<p> <b><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Starting the retrofit\nrevolution in Kirklees</span></span></b><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"> </span></p><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: left;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgkRqV4CzEecBuBqLy3lrnp_Zvh7UUxVxCBq-lHxxWaWmLqWIe4NsCWQh9yfTVi2HKIUTxnwJiOQufh8ycX8LC7bVxH9itTKTBN-CWoyvj2N5alFTobWit1gOvtb1SPTlc6FoDj66QA25lPju1tPbO2e1mOyMh1_lIAfx-_I6yMD5aVuSwfRKhJKTM4OA=s960\" style=\"clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"720\" data-original-width=\"960\" height=\"336\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgkRqV4CzEecBuBqLy3lrnp_Zvh7UUxVxCBq-lHxxWaWmLqWIe4NsCWQh9yfTVi2HKIUTxnwJiOQufh8ycX8LC7bVxH9itTKTBN-CWoyvj2N5alFTobWit1gOvtb1SPTlc6FoDj66QA25lPju1tPbO2e1mOyMh1_lIAfx-_I6yMD5aVuSwfRKhJKTM4OA=w446-h336\" width=\"446\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Cllr Cooper visiting Energiesprong homes in Nottingham</b></td></tr></tbody></table><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">The Council has made a start on\nretrofitting its own housing stock.

We\nfrequently hear from Labour Cabinet members about how we are ‘the best’ in this\npolicy area. We aren’t. There are positive things happening on the climate\nagenda in Kirklees but we are not forerunners or innovators in addressing\nclimate change. The lack of a climate action plan lead to the Council getting a\n0% rating from Climate Emergency UK earlier this year. Joining the Global Covenant\nof Mayors would provide us with valuable insight and support form the\ninternational community of local and regional authorities addressing climate\nchange. It works to provide value to participating councils by mobilizing the\ncritical financing and technical assistance that members require to access\ninvestment. The Global Covenant of Mayors ensures that signatories are\ncontinuously supported in their efforts. Cities receive step-by-step guidance\nand have access to tools, materials, and a dedicated regional/national\nhelpdesk.</span><p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><o:p> </o:p><a href=\"https://www.globalcovenantofmayors.org/\">https://www.globalcovenantofmayors.org/</a></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><o:p> </o:p><b><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\">Renewable energy installations\nin schools</span></b></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">The pupils of today are the citizens of the tomorrow.

It was the fact that the sport originated from a meeting in The George Hotel in 1895 that was the clincher. At the opening representatives from the Council and Rugby League Cares held a press conference. The Leader of the Council Shabir Pandor said,</p><p style=\"background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: Montserrat, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 18px;\"><i>\"This is absolutely fantastic news and we’re really excited to get started and bring Rugby League home\"</i></p><p style=\"background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: Montserrat, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 18px;\"><i>“It is so much more than a building to local people and to Rugby League fans across the world. This is where it all began for Rugby League and there is no better place to create a museum that celebrates and remembers the history of the game.”</i></p><p style=\"background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: Montserrat, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 18px;\">News broke last month that Kirklees was to renege on it's promise to have the Rugby League museum in the hotel. This has provoked much anger by Rugby League fans around the world as the Council had used The George Hotel to secure the Museum and also some external funding. The Council now says that the business case just doesn't stack up and so it would be now sited in the 'Cultural Heart' of the town that is being developed as part of the Huddersfield Blueprint. At Wednesday's Council meeting, in response to a question I asked on the proposals, West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin let slip that the Council was proposing to put the Museum in what is currently the Huddersfield Library and Art Gallery on the other side of town from 'The George'. As someone who is elected to represent the ward that includes the Town Centre finding out this way, by accident was to say the least annoying.</p><p style=\"background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: Montserrat, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 18px;\">When the Council said it was buying The George Hotel I was very supportive but at the time I asked to see what the Business Plan was going to look like and kept asking. More recently Conservative Councillors have also been asking about the Business Plans. Now we are told the numbers for including a Rugby League Museum in The George don't stack up, but still we haven't seen the papers that demonstrate this. As a local Councillor I'm just asked to trust the judgement of officers with no detail, no business case, no options to weigh up. It is all deeply disappointing and the big question is how did we end up in a position where the Council made such a firm and public commitment and a partnership with the Rugby League and then had to make such an embarrassing climbdown? As someone who is elected to represent the Council I would really like to know the answer to that question.</p><p style=\"background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: Montserrat, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 18px;\">A bit of nostalgia now.

This is where UN scientists get their chance to number crunch the pledges that countries have made to reduce their carbon emissions and see if they have any significant impact on helping achieve the Paris Climate goals. The short answer is a big NO.</p><p>The panel were pretty scathing. \" There's a leadership gap not an emissions gap\" was damning of the world's political leaders. One particular point they made was countries that were making Net Zero by 2050 statements with no convincing plan to achieve them. Australia being the most obvious example.</p><p>If (and it is a very big if) we believe all the countries statements produce the emissions then we are still heading to miss both the 1.5 and 2 degree C Paris Climate goals. The UNEP report says we need a 4 fold increase in ambition to reach 4 degrees temperature rise and a 7 fold increase to achieve 1.5 degrees. It is that stark. That is all if they keep to their promises. 7 of the G20 countries are currently 'off track' with their carbon savings so that is to say the least unhelpful.</p><p>What now? We have 3 days left. Apparently Boris is coming back to the COP summit. Given a large part of this process is about keeping commitments and trust why does that not fill me with confidence?</p><p>Here's Juice Media's from Australia's take</p><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1FqXTCvDLeo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>Andrew Cooperhttp://www.blogger.com/profile/16254689033137968918noreply@blogger.com0tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7196059482061221339.post-8393778481552178502021-11-07T18:55:00.000+00:002021-11-07T18:55:42.519+00:00UK Government finally implements COP24 - 3 years later<p></p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOThr6pPJdfnr91kLuc5x47uIB1LzH6ISjMbjJArlrKzXegZni0e9cfCeMhF1wKArH05-ZW9JZNAdpNRZEOTT1_kl4gYwHal9nk63is6hsYHaEcCOdak4PjuHIUWpQOnuIAFgLgzkCaJ0P/s774/Zero+Carbon+Strategy.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"774\" data-original-width=\"595\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOThr6pPJdfnr91kLuc5x47uIB1LzH6ISjMbjJArlrKzXegZni0e9cfCeMhF1wKArH05-ZW9JZNAdpNRZEOTT1_kl4gYwHal9nk63is6hsYHaEcCOdak4PjuHIUWpQOnuIAFgLgzkCaJ0P/s320/Zero+Carbon+Strategy.JPG\" width=\"246\" /></a></div>COP24 in Katowice, Poland was 3 years ago now and I'm now sitting in my son's flat in Glasgow as a delegate to COP26.

In the UK context this basically meant Governments would have to work more closely with Councils on action to address climate change. Then (in the UK at least) nothing happened. Councils still had no official role. the UK Government continued to make statements and policy about climate change with no significant involvement with Local and Regional Authorities. </span></p><p><span face=\"Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #222222;\">The Green Party made one of our goals in the run up to COP26 to push Government to set up a joint Central/Local Government Taskforce to put pressure on Government to act. </span><span face=\"Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #222222;\">Then at the end of last month the Government produced their Net Zero Strategy and in it there was a statement saying they would establish a,</span></p><p><i><span face=\"Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #222222;\">\"</span>Local Net\nZero Forum to ensure that there is direct input\nfrom local leaders. Chaired by BEIS, the Forum\nwill be cross departmental and bring together\nnational and local government senior officials\non a regular basis to discuss policy and\ndelivery options on net zero. The forum will\nbuild on our current engagement mechanisms\nthrough the representative bodies such as\nthe Local Government Association (LGA),\nAssociation for Public Service Excellence\n(APSE), Core Cities and the Association of\nDirectors of Environment, Economy, Planning\n& Transport (ADEPT)\".</i></p><p>So a Taskforce and a success of sorts! </p><p>I first raised the need for National and Local Governments to work more closely together in Paris at COP21 back in 2015 in a side event where I was representing the EU Committee of the Regions. So my own involvement in calling for something like this degree of cooperation is nearly 7 years old. All that really has happened, with the establishment of the Net Zero Forum is that a structure is now in place so we can have discussions, there is still a lot of actual work to do! Though the Forum will be chaired by BEIS the culture of the Forum should be that all participants come to the table as equals and that it is not dominated by national government. We need initiatives for policy change to be able to come forward from local government. After all it will be councils that will have to deliver a lot of the action needed to reduce emissions so why not allow the practitioners the chance to be the policy makers as well?</p><p>There is a lot to do. Changes to Building Regulations, a revised National Planning Policy Framework that takes into account climate change, addressing skills gaps and the need for a large scale domestic retrofit programme, all these need serious attention to get us on track towards a genuinely Zero Carbon Strategy for the UK. </p><p>Lets get to work!</p><p><br /></p>Andrew Cooperhttp://www.blogger.com/profile/16254689033137968918noreply@blogger.com0tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7196059482061221339.post-73764576740233108282021-11-06T10:58:00.001+00:002021-11-06T10:58:42.953+00:00And the award for missed opportunities goes to........

I'd been prompted to ask the question as Calderdale and Wakefield Councils had already indicated that they would back divestment so I wondered what Kirklees were doing. A Green Party motion by our Bradford Councillors on Divestment from the West Yorkshire Pension Fund had failed only days before but that was probably more about the fact that it didn't come from the Labour Party rather than the rights and wrongs of the issue.

The powers-that-be will blame it on the volunteers,” she said.\nMirfield, Denby Dale and Kirkburton Area Committee have agreed to provide the £24,000 needed to keep the two part-time librarians in Shepley in 2013/14.\nClr Derek Hardcastle came up with the idea.\n“This funding was not allocated to any projects and I proposed to allocate these unutilised funds to the libraries budget and to specifically earmark those funds to retain a fully staffed service at Shepley Library,” said the Kirkburton Green.\n“No changes to the library service are due to occur in 2012/13 so this funding would be allocated for the 2013/14 financial year.”\nClr Hardcastle hopes the extra year of funding will buy the library’s supporters some time.\n“This gives us two years to plan a secure funded future for the library when the funding outlook may be more optimistic,” he said.\n“Our proposal is at no additional cost to the council taxpayer and will give us the breathing space we need to produce a plan for a sustainable future for this vital and well used community facility.\n“Now this funding is secured, and the Kirklees cabinet has given their backing to the Green plan, the library will now be fully staffed till March 2014.\n“This does not mean that Shepley Library is saved yet, but it puts us in a stronger position to argue for its longer term retention.”\nKirklees Labour leader Clr Mehboob Khan said the cabinet would allow the extra year of funding.\n“The Greens have identified area committee funding under the control of ward councillors which wasn’t being used for any other purpose,” he said.\n“If this gives us all more time to agree a way forward for Shepley Library then I’m happy to recommend an additional year for a staffed service to the next appropriate full council meeting.\n“This would enable us to retain the service at its current level till March 2014.”\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

There is also the very real danger of fire risk to land and property\nparticularly during long periods of particularly dry weather.\nThis problem not only affects livestock farmers but also the\nthriving Equestrian population in our area as horses also are fed on fodder\nwhich can be contaminated with the lanterns.\nOrganisations such as the National Farmers Union and Yorkshire\nWildlife Trust are backing calls for a ban on these lanterns\nThe Green Party motion will be proposed by Cllr Robert\nBarraclough at the Kirklees Full Council meeting on Wednesday 29th July\nENDS\nGreen Party and Valley Independent Group Motion on Flying\nLanterns\nThat the Council recommends that the Cabinet considers the\npotential risks associated with sky lanterns (known as Chinese\nlanterns) including those relating to health & safety ; fire risk ,\nanimal welfare and impact on the environment including litter and referred to\nin the Trading standards Institute code of Practice for sky\nlanterns and if it accepts the potential threat and risks and\nsubject to proper consideration of the cost implications\n1.\nWhere legally possible to take steps to ban the use and release of sky lanterns\nfrom council owned land following the statutory test in section 120 (1)\n(b) LGA 1972 ; and encourage other landowners in Kirklees area to do\nlikewise on their property ;\n2.\nPlace appropriate signage at prime locations for launching sky lanterns e.g.\nCastle Hill and Public Parks\n3.\nConsider recommending that full Council adopt byelaws for pleasure\ngrounds, public walks and public open spaces under section 164 Public\nHealth Act 1875 and sections 12 , 15 of the Open Spaces Act 1906 which may\ncontain a specific provision to regulate the release of sky lanterns\n(subject to confirmation by the secretary of State for Communities and Local\nGovernment ) ;\n4.\nRequest Licensing committee to consider the scope to which Licensing\nlegislation may be used to mitigate the risk associated with sky lanterns;\n5.\nConsider the provision of advice to discourage organisers of events from using\nsky lanterns due to the potential harm they may cause;\n6.\nEncourage West Yorkshire Trading Standards /West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue\nService to work with manufacturers , distributors and retailers in West\nYorkshire to improve safety standards ;biodegradeability of sky lantern\nproducts and urge them to sign up to the Trading Standards\nInstitute Industry Code of Practice –sky lanterns",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2016_10_andrew-cooper-local-plan-speech_html/content_840.html": "So here we are again with a vote on the Kirklees Local Plan.\nLet’s remember how we\ngot to this point. The last time we had the then Local Development Framework in\nfront of us. That Plan was withdrawn through a vote of this Council due to\nconcerns expressed by the Planning Inspectorate. The reason that was given from\nthe Government Planning Inspector was that we had not fulfilled the ‘duty to\ncooperate’ with other Local Authorities but in reality the truth was that there\nwere simply not enough houses in the Plan to satisfy Government demands. The\nGreen Party voted not to withdraw the plan, to call the Government’s bluff to\nshow that we didn’t really have any say over how many houses needed to be built\nin our area. If we had kept the plan then the ball would have been in the\nGovernments court. It would have been up to them to overrule the wishes of our\ndemocratically elected Council just as they have done with the Fracking Planning\nApplication that was recently refused by Lancashire County Council. We are not\nthe masters of our own destiny. Government sets the rules of the game and we\nhave to follow.\nBetween 2008 and 2011 developers gave 3.3 million pounds to\nthe Conservative Party during that time they and later their Government was\nformulating what became the National Planning Policy Framework where we see the\nguiding principle behind all Government Policy – the presumption in favour of\ndevelopment. Did the construction industry give money to the Conservative Party\nbecause they are philanthropists and it was a toss up between the Tories and\nthe Save the Children Fund who they gave their brass to? Of course not they\nwanted something in return. Since the\nCoalition and now a Conservative Government has been in power we have seen a\nweakening of the planning powers of Local Authorities and a strengthening of\nthe hands of developers. It is because of Conservative Government rules that\ndevelopers are able without a Local Plan to apply to build anywhere in\nKirklees. So we are caught between a rock and a hard place. Produce a Local\nPlan with more houses than are needed to satisfy rapacious developers or have\nno plan and let those very same developers have a free hand to put planning\napplications in anywhere in Kirklees. So I say to the Conservatives this\nplanning shambles is of your own making, your fingerprints are all over it,\nyou’ve taken the money and you have been seen leaving the scene of the crime. So much as it would be convenient to blame the\nLabour Administration of this Council a Conservative Administration would be in\nthe exact same situation.\nSo what about the Plan itself. There are some real positives\nand of course negatives. On the positive side we are very pleased that the\nGreen Belt has been extended down from Castle Hill to the stretch of land\nbordered by New Laithe Hill and High Lane at Newsome. The people of Taylor Hill\nRoad can rest a little easier knowing the Council will not be pursuing the\nthreat of building housing on their back gardens. In Highfields the Community\nOrchard bordered by Wentworth Street and Mountjoy Road will be redesignated as\na Local Green Space protecting it for local kids and the Community to use as\nthey already are doing. We are disappointed that land at Jackroyd Lane ,\nNewsome has not been removed from the plan as it is part of a green corridor of\nland leading up to Castle Hill and is part of the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust\nStirley Farm Estate. We are however pleased that land at Newsome Mill, the\nformer Stile Common School site, Cambridge Road have been allocated for\ndevelopment. We hope that they will be high quality properties with Passivhaus\nenergy efficiency standards and will be available to people on lower incomes to\nrent or buy.\nWe have played a full part as a group negotiating the best we\ncould for the communities we serve and represent. We will continue to do so but\nlet us be under no illusion the negatives here are those created by the policy\ndirection given by this Government. No attempting to wriggle, to shift the\nblame will wash. This isn’t Labour’s Plan, it’s not really even Kirklees Plan,\nin reality it isn’t not even the Conservative Government’s Plan but is the Plan\nof their paymasters - the developers.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Later we met along with the British Transport Police and knocked some ideas backwards and forwards and a produced a draft code which I suggested was put to Cllr Khan as Leader of the Council but also because he has an interest in the issue of scrap at a national level in his role at the Local Government Association. Of course we'll need Kirklees Cabinet approval to get it adopted and quite rightly we're looking at getting the code adopted more widely in Yorkshire and I think through the Local Government Association we could get replication of the idea at a national level. I guess it will be character forming for me to sit at the sidelines and watch the idea take off and be adopted more widely.\nI spoke to a scrap dealer today, who says people leave scrap min his yard and he sells it on. No idea where it comes from, he says. National requirement for yards to record where the scrap has come from will be interesting to implement.\nReplyDeletePolice did have a blitz stopping vehicles on their way to the scrap yard which resulted in two successful arrests and prosecutions, so current legislation is effective if the police can find the time to implement them!",

There are deep divisions in our country rumbling on with Brexit. Racists now feel they have license to spout their nonsense more freely now they have 'got their country back'. In an already divided society people can now differentiate themselves further by identifying themselves as a Remainer or a Leaver. So the Government then goes and rubs the noses of half the country in it 'the losers' by minting a sodding coin. I felt pretty much the same way when the Government said there would be a national holiday on 'Brexit Day' so one half of the country can celebrate whatever it is they feel they have to celebrate while the rest of us cry into our pints at the chaos to come.\nMaybe it would be most fitting to have two 50 pence pieces. After all 2 x 50p makes a good old honest British pound. One could have Union Jacks on one side and the Queen on the reverse. The other coin could have the EU Flag on and Donald Tusk on the reverse. I'm of course joking but if the Government wants to make an overt dividing political statement with the coin of the realm favouring one side of the argument why not do it for the other side as well.\nHere's 'Anarchy in the UK' by the Sex Pistols. Sorry if anyone's offended. Well not really. Not today.\nYou have to laugh really. The world is about to fall into a burning lake of fire at 67,000 miles per hour due to species die-off, soil degredation, pollution, over-consumption and over-population, all manifesting itself in climate change and probable near-term human extinction, and here we are debating how a 50p coin looks and which club of nations we should be in.\nReplyDeleteIt's pathetic really.\nParadoxically you then portray the MSM version of anarchy via the Sex Pistols. Whereas the proper application of anarchism in its actual political form might be something that could save us. You know, no national borders (hence no national armies, hence no ability to declare war), no political hierarchy, no corporations, but local control of resources in a bottom-up democratic model where everyone has a say, and everyone has an equal share in the commons and in any wealth that those commons produces.\nThanks and yes I get your point on Anarchism. Referencing this at the end of this blogpost was really an emotional response to the state of the UK rather than a serious statement about the benefits of a society based on the principles of Anarchism.\nReplyDeleteI agree with you Andrew. And I think it does matter which club of nations we are in. See article in Opendemocracy https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/brexitinc/anthony-barnett/trump-or-brussels-brexit-and-art-of-no-deal\nReplyDeleteI see the 50p as a symbol to celebrate that we have joined a regressive rather than a progressive (albeit not enough) club.",

I have spoken to a lot of local people as individuals,\nresponded to emails and phone calls, attended community meetings and have put\ninformation about the Local Plan through many local letterboxes. I have got a\nvery clear picture of local feelings and concerns.\nOne of the main concerns has been the proposal by Farnley\nEstates to release of Greenbelt land to the Farnley Country Park. Farnley\nEstates have been actively promoting the concept and this has led to a wide\nranging and often heated debate. At this point and looking at the\ncorrespondence I have received I feel that there needs to to be much more\ndetail in the proposal before it can be assessed thoroughly.\nThe proposal requires the release of sensitive areas of\nGreen Belt for housing which I would not be able to support especially as in\nthe draft plan almost all of the proposed sites have been rejected.\nIn fact the strength of response brings into question\nwhether or not the Green Belt allocation for this proposal should appear in the\nplan at all. The wording in the Draft Local Plan could be\nreinterpreted over the course of the plan and this is a genuine concern. I will\nbe asking Officers to review this inclusion with a view to removal or\nsubstantially tighter drafting.\nSince the start of the consultation period I have\nconsistently recommended to concerned residents that the best course of action\nwas to support the rejected sites option, this is what many have done and a\ncourse of action that I still agree with.”",

LDCs were to give the ability for Local and Regional Authorities to set their own carbon reduction targets in conjunction with Nationally Determined Contributions which are the responsibility of national governments. This would establish a clearer role for sub-national bodies like Councils and Devolved Administrations in taking action to reduce carbon emissions and help towards achieving the Paris Climate goals. I had some excellent support from staff at the EU Committee of the Regions and Locally and Regionally Determined Contributions were backed by the LGMA, the body that represented Local Government globally.\nIn the end we didn't get LDC's adopted but we had moved the debate significantly and there was a statement in the final text on how to assess Nationally Determined Contributions that referred to \"preparing implementation plans to include domestic institutional arrangements, public participation and engagement with local communities”. In the UK context this basically meant Governments would have to work more closely with Councils on action to address climate change. Then (in the UK at least) nothing happened. Councils still had no official role. the UK Government continued to make statements and policy about climate change with no significant involvement with Local and Regional Authorities.\nThe Green Party made one of our goals in the run up to COP26 to push Government to set up a joint Central/Local Government Taskforce to put pressure on Government to act. Then at the end of last month the Government produced their Net Zero Strategy and in it there was a statement saying they would establish a,\n\"Local Net Zero Forum to ensure that there is direct input from local leaders. Chaired by BEIS, the Forum will be cross departmental and bring together national and local government senior officials on a regular basis to discuss policy and delivery options on net zero. The forum will build on our current engagement mechanisms through the representative bodies such as the Local Government Association (LGA), Association for Public Service Excellence (APSE), Core Cities and the Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning & Transport (ADEPT)\".\nSo a Taskforce and a success of sorts!\nI first raised the need for National and Local Governments to work more closely together in Paris at COP21 back in 2015 in a side event where I was representing the EU Committee of the Regions. So my own involvement in calling for something like this degree of cooperation is nearly 7 years old. All that really has happened, with the establishment of the Net Zero Forum is that a structure is now in place so we can have discussions, there is still a lot of actual work to do! Though the Forum will be chaired by BEIS the culture of the Forum should be that all participants come to the table as equals and that it is not dominated by national government. We need initiatives for policy change to be able to come forward from local government. After all it will be councils that will have to deliver a lot of the action needed to reduce emissions so why not allow the practitioners the chance to be the policy makers as well?\nThere is a lot to do. Changes to Building Regulations, a revised National Planning Policy Framework that takes into account climate change, addressing skills gaps and the need for a large scale domestic retrofit programme, all these need serious attention to get us on track towards a genuinely Zero Carbon Strategy for the UK.\nLets get to work!",

You were elected to serve the community.\nJohn C Burt\nNewsome\nNeglect at Newsome\nMR Burt (Mailbag, March 28) says that Green councillors have said, in relation to the condition of Newsome Mills, that the ‘owners can’t afford to do anything.’\nLike many things, there is a bit more to the story than that.\nThe owners, Royalle Estates, like many developers, are not proceeding with plans they did have because of the collapse of the housing market.\nI agree with Mr Burt that the mills are not in a good condition and I’ve turned out on a number of occasions when I’ve been told people have been up to no good round there and informed the police.\nI’ve met with Royalle Estates who have told me about the action they have taken to stop anyone getting back into the clock tower to carry out further damage and there is a value in them knowing that councillors and local residents are concerned about the building.\nI must say there are local people who have worked very hard to protect the mill and the fact that it is still standing at all is thanks to them.\nThis will hopefully give us the chance of seeing the mill restored at some point in the future as residential units.\nUnfortunately, that isn’t on the horizon at present. The danger of reinstating the clock at present is that if this is done before it is fully occupied then the clock could very well be damaged again.\nThe finance to repair the clock would probably be linked to the sale of residential units in any case. One thing I have done is to get a condition to restore the clock as part of the planning conditions for when the site is developed.\nMr Burt also refers to the area around the old mill ponds being a disgrace. I agree and contact is made periodically with the owners to tidy the land up.\nVery recently a blocked land drain on the site was uncovered and this has helped sort out poor drainage around houses further up towards Castle Hill.\nIf anything, this highlights the difficulties of using the land as a development site. I have said to the owners on several occasions that the lease should be returned to Kirklees Council at a low cost as the land is not suitable for building and would be better released to the community as a small park or returned to its former use as allotments.\nI’ve reported the ‘Welcome to Newsome Village ‘ sign to Kirklees Highways for repair.\nI’m happy to speak to Mr Burt or any other residents about local issues directly if they so wish.\nClr Andrew Cooper\nGreen Party, Newsome Ward\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Here's mine.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper – Annual Report - 2012-13\nAnother busy year in my role as a local Councillor. What has\ndominated Kirklees is the impact of the draconian and disproportionate cuts being\nimposed on us by central government. There are no easy answers to dealing with\nthese cuts without some serious impacts on local jobs and services.\nI was again a volunteer driver on the Green Party’s Boxing\nDay Bus Service now in its 21st year. Thanks to Mr Andy Storey who\nalso drove the minibus and Karen Allison who stewarded and helped put up the\ntimetables on bus stops and also helped deliver thousands of bus timetables to\nlocal residents.\nWe have had another big push on the local clean ups of grot\nspots and this year have removed 3 skiploads of rubbish all with voluntary\neffort. We are also involving community payback in clean ups of some areas\nwhich is a positive thing.\nI muck in and help with the community lead Growing Newsome\nevents. I’m really impressed with the commitment of volunteers who obviously\nget a real buzz out of working together growing their own food and making new\nfriends. The Potato Day and Seed Swaps were well attended with hundreds of\npeople getting involved.\nI have been a regular attender and contributor to Newsome\nWard Community Forum which continues to go from strength to strength with well\nattended, informative and happy meetings.\nCasework is the principal role for any busy Councillor and\nthough I am not able to solve every persons problem it is often the fact that\npeople have had their best shot at resolving an issue with their Councillors\nsupport which matters most to people.\nI continue to enjoy Planning Committee meetings and have\nplayed a full part in the meetings and attended the site visits to enable me to\nmake informed views on the decisions we take.\nIn Armitage Bridge we have been able to help community\nefforts to build a flood barrier with funding from the Area Committee. This was\nan initiative that came out of the community which I am really pleased we have\nbeen able to contribute to.\nIn Springwood the traffic calming finally went in which was\na relief after many years of trying to get this project off the ground.\nSorting out the parking issues on Dawson Road in Newsome was\nparticularly satisfying with new parking bays on what was a constricted\ncul-de-sac. This issue had been hanging around for years and we needed to get 3\npots of funding together to get it sorted out. Thanks to Julie Stewart-Turner for\nher help with that.\nI was re-elected in 2012 for the 4th time and I\nam grateful to the electorate of the Newsome Ward for their continuing support\nfor me and my colleagues. Elections are of course necessary and important for\nlocal democracy but can be unnerving when you have particularly well funded\nopponents. So when you’re talking to someone on the doorstep and they give you\na pat on the arm saying ‘You’ll be alright lad’ it’s very reassuring. Our\nshare of the vote went up in the election and given the nature of the campaign\nagainst us this was particularly satisfying.\nI am fortunate to be part of a good team in Newsome and\nKirkburton Wards and my thanks as always goes to my colleagues in the Green\nParty team.\nI continue to blog regularly on www.greeningkirklees.blogspot.com\nand tweet at @clrandrewcooper where I now have over 1200 followers\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2019_01_councillor-andrew-cooper-speech-to_html/content_808.html": "Firstly I welcome\nthis motion to 'Declare a Climate Emergency' and I thank Councillor Murgatroyd\nfor his initiative in bringing it forward. It follows on from a number of other\nmotions by Councils around the country the first one in the UK in Bristol\nintroduced by my Green Party colleagues there and this has been followed by a\nnumber of others including Stroud and most recently Bradford Council last\nnight. It is also now a global phenomenon and even Councils on the other side\nof the Planet in Australia are passing similar motions based on the call to\naction inspired by the IPCC report.\nSo what is it all about. We have limited time to act and national Governments are not acting\nnearly fast enough. I was at the UN Climate Talks in Katovice , Poland last\nmonth where on behalf of the EU Committee of the Regions we were calling for National\nGovernment’s to work in partnership with Local Authorities to address climate\nchange. So a quick question to members. How many emails , memos, calls for\nassistance with the Paris Climate goals have we in Local Government received\nfrom National Government since it was signed over 3 years ago? You know the\nanswer it is zero.\nWe are the\npeople with the closest links to communities, who can mobilise action quickly,\nwho have strong links with the wider public sector and business. If we are not\nproperly valued and involved in action to address climate change then we will\nfail.\nPassing this\nClimate Emergency motion is an important first step but it will meaningless if not\nfollowed up by meaningful action. I know recycling is an important issue and\ndoes have a relationship with climate change and it is somewhat bizarre that it\nis the only specific aspiration mentioned in this motion. There is a lot more\nwe could do.\nIn July this\nyear Government announced that we could set our own energy efficiency standards\nin our Local Plan and that crucially these could be higher than those set in\nNational Building regulations. On Monday I visited the Navarre Region of\nNorthern Spain where the Local Authority there is currently building 524\nPassivhaus accredited homes for social rent. It was inspiring stuff, the people\non the lowest incomes having good standard housing with negligible fuel bills.\nIt was good to see such strong leadership. It is not an isolated story and\naround Europe we now seeing tens of thousands of such homes being built. In the\nUK we have leading authorities like Norwich and Exeter doing some successful groundbreaking\nwork on Passivhaus developments. In Kirklees it has been a bit slow. The\nPassivhaus Report produced by the All Party Policy Task force probably reported\nabout 2 years ago and has never been responded to. Now I know some positive\nwork on standards is being pursued but we like a strong statement of what our\npolicy is in this area to guide officer and show we are a leader in this area.\nSimilarly\nwith the use of electric vehicles we are well behind a number of other Local\nAuthorities. We now have 3. I am told via the Examiner that we have another 17\nplanned. Leeds City Council has 200 electric vehicles. We need to do more.\nWe have been\nat our best as once the Leading Authority on Green policies when we have been\nour boldest. When we were the first Council in the country to provide householders\nwith a universally free insulation scheme. We won the prestigious Ashden Award\nrecognising our pioneering work in energy efficiency\nWhen we\nfinally decided to pursue a solar programme on Council homes ( 5 years too late\nin my opinion) we won the Solar installer of the year award. No we shouldn’t\nchase baubles for the sake of it but recognise that fortune favours the bold.\nWe need to\nignore the naysayers, those who urge caution based on outdated or just wrong knowledge,\nand ignore those who will never take a risk until they have all the information\nthey feel they need. Why should we take this approach? Because it is a climate\nemergency and should be treated as such. We don’t have the time to come up with\nperfect plans, we should be guided by what has worked well for others and take\ninformed risks when we need to. If we heed the advice of dinosaurs we will go\nthe way of the dinosaurs.\nAction on climate\nchange is a great opportunity for this council. New skills, activities that can\nbring communities together. Not simply saving carbon and energy but money as\nwell. Let’s pass this motion and act decisively not just for Kirklees, or to do\njust what others have done but to provide the direction and leadership on climate\naction that is lacking in this country.\nSupport this motion\nGreat speech Andrew thank you for sharing. Very interesting to hear about good practice elsewhere.\nReplyDeleteExcellent speech, Andrew. Now to work towards implementing it locally. Debby Plummer\nReplyDelete",

As if by design, this week a private householder in Netherton submitted a Planning Application to build a 'Passivhaus' dwelling. The Planning Committee on Thursday deciding on the application included both myself and Councillor D Firth. Planning Officers presented the application and the Chair then asked if there were any questions from Councillors. My question was \"Is it made of mud?\" The officer looked confused and said \"No\" I then expressed my own confusion as Cllr Firth had carried out \"research\" saying they were made of mud. I heard Cllr Firth shout something or other and the meeting carried on. You have to get your entertainment where you can these days. The application was passed.

There are no bridges\nstriding majestically across the Colne Valley as in the Lib Dem Amendment. There is no ‘make believe’\nbuilding where Huddersfield Library will move into as in the Conservative Amendment.\nWhat all the amendments cannot do is fix the impact that\nGovernment cuts will have on Adult Social care. We can seek to limit the impact\nof cuts. What we need from Central Government is funding for free adult social\ncare as a right in the UK. It should be a human right and the mark of a\ncivilized society in the 5th or 6th richest country in\nthe world.\nWhat our amendment does is recognise the cards we have been\ndealt with by the Lib Dem/ Conservative Coalition Government and seeks to find\nto find positive actions that we can take using the power we have.\nWe have spoken to the Administration about our proposals\nbecause if we didn’t then these amendments that we have submitted would be\nnothing more than posturing. Posturing amendments put forward with no\nexpectation of implementation. The Lib Dem and Conservative Amendments are put\nforward by parties that cower away from responsibility. These are Parties that,\nI guess want votes but don’t want to do anything with power if they are given\nit.\nGreens and Valley Independents have already put real time and\neffort into protecting our Libraries. Not though a fantasy fix. Not an attempt to hoodwink voters like the Tories\nwith a non-existent magic bullet but concrete proposals built on time and\neffort and I have tremendous respect for my colleagues who have worked so hard\nand with real commitment working towards a more secure future for our local\nlibraries.\nWe are proposing a workable alternative to food banks. So\nfood banks will be there for immediate and emergency cases but for ongoing\nsupport low income householders will be able to get food at a third the retail\nprice for a 6 month period to help them get back on their feet. Not only that\nbut they will receive a package of advice and support to help them improve\ntheir lives. This is not fantasy. This is reality. Myself and Councillor Julie\nStewart-Turner went with Cabinet Members to ‘Community Shop’ in Goldthorpe near\nBarnsley. They take surplus food that would otherwise go to landfill and use it\nto help feed households who have some very difficult choices to make on a\nlimited budget. The fact that they will be paying for it even at a discounted\nrate gives people back their dignity. It is not charity. To the Council this is\na one off cost not an ongoing one but the benefits are numerous.\nBuilding Services provide gas servicing and boiler\nreplacements to tens of thousands of Council properties. There is nothing in\nlaw that would stop them operating in the private sector. So if you or I or any\ncitizen of Kirklees wanted our boiler fixing or servicing why should we go to a\ncompany that is associated with one of the Big 6 Energy Suppliers for instance\nwhen Kirklees Council could provide that service for the same cost or better\nand use that money to support local services such as Adult Social Care. This need not be at the expense of local\nSMEs. It could well be that Kirklees Building Services works in partnership\nwith local companies to deliver services. We believe the indicated income\nfigures are probably unduly conservative and no one wants to be unduly conservative.\nThe Coalition Government has caved in to the big housebuilders\nand as a result homes built will not be ‘Zero carbon homes’ as they are\ndescribed but still cost over£1000/year to run in energy costs. Question is how\ndo we deal with that lack of ambition from the ‘Greenest Government Ever’. We\ncan set our own standards for homes built on Kirklees land that we own or as a\ncondition of sale on land we sell. That is why the we propose using the\ninternationally recognised ‘passivhaus’ standard for homes on Kirklees land\nSuch homes would have energy bills of less than £100/ year. This would only\nmean that there was less money going to energy utilities but it would also mean\nmore money going into the local economy.\nWe think there is merit in reviewing our electoral\narrangements at Kirklees. We have General Elections every 5 years, Parish\nCouncil Elections every 4 years yet Kirklees Elections 3 out of 4 years. Other\nprincipal councils elect every 4 years such as London boroughs. This Council is\nin a constant state of warfare due to the practically constant electoral cycle\noperating. That isn’t good for the governance of this Council. It needs\nreviewing. My own view is that we should aim for an election in 2018 when all\nseats are up for elections and seek to bring forward the Parish Council\nelections so we begin working on a common cycle of local elections. There is a\nfinancial saving identified here but the benefits to the Council, its\ngovernance and the people we serve goes far beyond that.\nThere are acres of Kirklees owned disused and derelict land\nand also roofspace on Kirklees owned buildings. This is a resource which can\ngenerate not only energy from solar panels we propose a partnership with both\ncompanies and communities sharing the benefits of this funding with the Council.\nThe revenue raised will help support local services.\nMoving Kirklees mileage rates to HMRC rates was something I\nwas lead to believe happened years ago and I was shocked when it hadn’t. So I\nam pleased to be able to move this amendment today.\nSo this is our amendment. We would like to do more. When we\nproposed an ‘All Party Shared Administration’ for Kirklees Cllr Palfreeman\nquoted the Fantasy author of Game of Thrones, George R R Martin. The quote he\nused was ‘Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it.’ The Fantasy here is not mine it is yours.\nClosing and relocating Huddersfield Library – somewhere? Fantasy. Another\nfamous quote from George R R Martin is ‘Winter is coming’ meaning hard times\nahead. Hard times are coming for Kirklees and for many local councils and the\npeople that we serve. The hard truth is\nfor the Tories is that if you don’t want the responsibility in these times then\ndon’t ask for the votes.\nWednesday, 11 February 2015\nPRESS RELEASE -Green Party Councillor appointed to EU Committee of theRegions\nKirklees Green Party Councillor Andrew Cooper has been appointed to the EU Committee of the Regions as one of the UKs 24 representatives selected from Councils and devolved governments across the UK.

The political nature of our walk meant that he couldn't offer us a Civic Reception, wear his chains of office or offer us the Freedom of Knaresborough but he could walk with us and welcome us to his Town. From what I have heard of Freedom's of the Borough this honour usually gives you the right to let your flock of sheep go through the Town Centre unimpeded or you can march your battalion through with bayonets fixed. We definitely weren't sheep neither did we own any and there was probably more than enough pacifists in our group to ensure that we would never have need of bayonets. There was a particular pleasure however of shaking the hand of a Green Party Mayor by the 'Welcome to Knaresborough' sign.\nAfter a tasty lunch in Knaresborough at a great cafe called Henshaws staffed by people with learning difficulties we headed off towards Harrogate. I got a garbled, difficult to hear, phone call from someone called Brian who said he'd come from Darlington to join our walk. We caught up with him, a white haired pensioner and it appeared he wanted to come along for the whole thing and join our Core Group. OK this required a bit of logistics regarding where to sleep. It got sorted by Ann in the support vehicle. Thanks Ann!\nHarrogate Centre was where I wanted to stop but we still had about five miles to go to the end of our walk. I was very conscious that every mile we didn't do one day would be added on to the following day. So the Core Group started making our way out of Harrogate leaving our friends from Harrogate Green Party behind on a constantly rising path by a very long busy road which seemed to be unending. Surely it was shorter than this when me and Ann recce'd this back in January in the car? I wondered why the path was there anyway much as I'm in favour of facilities for pedestrians. Who used it? Who would want to use it? I was glad it was there but I reckoned we were the most pedestrian traffic it had seen all day. Mercifully we got off this main road to a still rising country road heading towards a National Trust car park rendezvous out in the countryside. Eventually we got there with a great view of Fylingdales 'Golf Balls' across the Moors. It was beautiful, the sun was low in the sky but it was still light. This was to be the beginning of a cross country section across footpaths and little used country roads but most of that was for tomorrow.\nWe decided to finish by going across a short section of woodland that took us to another road and another car park rendezvous. I had the map and I lead the way! It didn't look too far on the map. The\npath we started walking on became muddy, then boggy, then it was clear that it was getting darker, then I started doubting I was leading us on the right path. I was quietly 'crapping it'. The small hut we passed in the forest had the look in the fading light of the sort of place your average axe murderer might hang out in. I ploughed on walking along something which only vaguely resembled a path. Then I heard cars, a road, was that a gate? Thank f*ck! I was relieved and my attempts to style it out with the rest of the Core Group when we reached the Car Park of course didn't wash.\npath we started walking on became muddy, then boggy, then it was clear that it was getting darker, then I started doubting I was leading us on the right path.

I was relieved and my attempts to style it out with the rest of the Core Group when we reached the Car Park of course didn't wash.\nWe were picked up by Harrogate Green Party folks and taken back to a bar for another evening bash in town. I got my bag out of Ann's car and found that you entered the bar by walking up some stairs. It hurt! We got beer and pizza and I said a few words. We all looked pretty knackered. There were blisters on feet, some of were hobbling a bit having stiffened up. Compeed had been applied to feet. We weren't yet half way and I was worried. I knew tomorrow was another tough day. Then the pro fracking Conservative Leader of Harrogate Borough Council arrived bought me a beer and gave me a bed for the night. He is my brother after all.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

After I'd worked out/ been told it probably wasn't too smart an idea to do the whole thing on my own in January, I began to seek out a core group of walkers. An email went out to Yorkshire and Humber Green Party members entitled ' No Fracking Way - Call for Walkers'. It did seem to get circulated outside the Party and we had 2 people apply who weren't Green Party members. We had Carolyn Popple who worked in a bookies in Scarborough. I'd asked for a head and shoulders picture and some personal information and Carolyn's came back with reflective sunglasses. You can't really understand a person from just a photo but this did make it a bit more difficult. Another non member was Nigel Corser from Lincolnshire, ex Army, Leave voter but anti fracking. He was from North Lincolnshire. Again the photo he sent was a bit enigmatic and not quite what I was expecting.\nWithin the Green Party I sounded out a few people to see if they were up for the challenge.\n|\n| Carolyn Popple |\nTom Franklin from York was the Yorkshire and The Humber Green Party's Treasurer. I'd had a few drinks (too many) with Tom following a leafleting session in Scarborough. We'd had an entertaining time and I reckoned the walk may involve some time in the odd Pub or two so pleased when Tom agreed to join the team. He also took on the role of doing the navigation for our route and plotted the route in detail into a GPS. His calculations came back with some significant revisions if we were to get to Preston New Road in the early afternoon on Sunday. The first day was going to be the longest. From Kirby Misperton we were to walk not a leisurely 20 miles to Easingwold but a more punishing 29 miles to Brafferton. Worryingly for me Tom, a keen cyclist, told me about his practice walks which seemed more frequent and further than mine.\n|\n| Tom Franklin |\nColin Noble from Leeds was positive about the walk when I asked him. He had been the Regional Chair of the Yorkshire and Humber Green Party when I stood as our Region's Lead Candidate in the 2014 European Elections. We got on well. He had a good sense of off beat humour, he seemed in pretty good nick and went skiing and cycled a lot.\nIn response to the email from the Green Party we had Louise Galvin from Huddersfield who I knew as one of our leaflet deliverers in the area I represent on Kirklees Council. Louise's Facebook feed was full of pictures of her on various runs and fell races looking terribly energetic. Her bandana proudly declared 'vegan runner'. If I had to get a suitably descriptive bandana it would have to say 'omnivorous slob'.\n|\n| Louise Galvin |\nGeorge (Georgina) Perry was from Leeds Green Party and worked in the health sector. For a while I'd got her mixed up with the George (Georgina) from Lancashire who had helped us work out the route. I'm easily confused.\nSo we had a magnificent 7 walkers plus Ann Forsaith in the support vehicle. I christened us 'The Fellowship of the Frack'. There were 8 of us, just like in 'The Lord of the Rings', we were being guided by a tall guy with a beard (Tom). I of course was the moody, good looking (self deluding) Aragorn. I would have to be careful about how far I should take the analogy because that would mean we would be equating our final destination in Lancashire with Mordor, the home of the army of Orcs and that\n|\n| Colin Noble |\nwasn't compatible with the message of interregional goodwill we\nwere seeking to seeking to send.\nThe day of the walk drew near. We were to assemble in Scarborough at a 'kick off' meeting in the towns Central Library on the Tuesday night. After a leisurely trip I met up with Louise in Scarborough she found a Vegan Friendly cafe on her Vegan eating app and we strolled towards it. I remember thinking it was a bit of a long walk to the cafe (it wasn't) and then thinking If you think thats a long walk Cooper what sodding chance will you have of completing this walk you fool!\" I can be a bit tough on\n|\n| Georgina Perry |\nmyself. Louise had a vegan friendly burger and chips. I had an\nanimal unfriendly burger and chips. We strolled towards the Library. I remember feeling stuffed and unenergetic \"No backing out now Cooper you idiot!\" I thought. The hall in the Library was beginning to fill up a bit for our 'send off' event with about 40 or so in the audience and a panel I was on with representatives from the Green Party, Frack Free Scarborough, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats and me for the Core Team of Walkers. All good earnest stuff from all the speakers about why Fracking was such a bad thing from different perspectives. I stood up to talk about the walk itself and it occurred to me that I didn't know who Carolyn Popple was or Georgina Perry. I knew Nigel Corser was meeting us the next day at Kirby Misperton Protection Camp where he was camping. In a moment of inspiration I said \" Can\n|\n| Ann Forsaith |\nall the people in the Core Group of walkers stand up\". They did\nto applause! Ah! Carolyn Popple doesn't always wear reflective sunglasses. She must be George. Right got that! I then went on to explain that we were the 'Fellowship of the Frack' and that every Fellowship should have a 'precious'. I revealed an old battered Harrogate Toffee Tin which had been the repository for our tea bags back home before I liberated it. I explained how soil would be dug up from Kirby Misperton Protection Camp and carried all the way to Preston New Road where Lancashire and Yorkshire soil would be mixed together. Then the soil would be used to help plant a self seeded oak tree sapling that Ann Forsaith was bringing with her from Yorkshire. This was to be a symbolic act to demonstrate that an attack on land in Lancashire would be an attack on land in Yorkshire. Our soils were mixed, our fates entwined.\nThe meeting ended, we did some photos and went off to our respective beds for the night. We were to set off from Kirby Misperton at 7.00a.m. The next morning we would be on the road. Here we go.\n|\n| The Fellowship of the Frack assembles (minus Nigel Corser) |",

In reality Labour has pretty much had control anyway in any meaningful sense due to a politically divided opposition. Some times we have used our votes to influence Labour but generally the Cabinet System gives them a disproportional amount of power over the day to day running of the Council. This is of course compounded by the electoral system which means that Labour with 43% of the votes gets 100% of the power.\nSo what about the notable individual contests. We know Labour had higher ambitions than their achievements which of course is not a bad thing. Certain currently high ranking Labour Councillors had said they were going to win Newsome but of course that didn't happen. More surprising to me was Almondbury. You really got the impression from social media that Labour had thrown everything but the kitchen sink at Almondbury. Shadow Ministerial visits, lots of activists flooding the place, a personable candidate. I mean with a slogan like 'Peace for Almondbury' how can you not win? They didn't and I guess all credit to the Lib Dems for holding on. I remember bumping into a now former Lib Dem Councillor who expressed what I thought was undue confidence about Almondbury, clearly he was right. So my former Kirkburton Parish Council colleague Alison Munro is the new Councillor for Almondbury. She must have worked and walked her socks off, so much respect to her in what must have been a fairly tough contest.\nWe heard rumours about Crosland Moor and Netherton Ward and the challenge from Mike Forster of TUSC and 'Hands off HRI' but the challenge from him fell short and he came 3rd. A consistent, dedicated campaign from a Party willing to put 2 to 3 years of quality work into the ward could take it off Labour I would have thought, as things stand given their level of visibility in the ward. But a short term campaign is not the way these sort of things happen.\nA word or two about Kirkburton and Denby Dale. The Conservatives got re-elected to both with less than 50% of the vote. In Kirkburton Greens are the main challengers and in Denby Dale it is Labour. We had at one time sought an arrangement with Labour on this but culturally &/constitutionally this does not seem possible for Labour so no 'Progressive Alliance' here. Not entirely sure I like the idea anyway. Commiserations to our Kirkburton Candidate, Derek Hardcastle who was unsuccessful on this occasion.\nHolme Valley North Ward, where I live, proved to be an interesting contest. The Labour Candidate was definitely putting the effort in and was door knocking earlier in the year than is common among many. I was disappointed to get a letter from her with an endorsement from the Independent Councillor Edgar Holroyd Doveton who said he was supporting the 'person' not the 'label'. The only problem was that he didn't reveal that the person was his partner. When I pointed this out on Facebook. I got a bit of abuse from Labour folks who equated what I was saying with 'anti Corbyn smears' and the other bizarre comment was about a person 'not having to be defined by who their partner was'. Sure but not revealing the relationship and trying to appear objective when you simply couldn't be was obviously a mistake.\nLabour won, and the Lib Dems lost both Colne Valley and Golcar Wards, which is where Labour got their Council majority. It was very close in both and the Lib Dems will be kicking themselves over what they could have done. I guess these will continue to be hotly contested Wards.\nFrom a wider Green Party perspective I was pleased to see us achieve 8% of the vote in Greenhead and Holme Valley South Wards with no campaigning. This does make you wonder what would happen if we actually were able to put in a decent effort there. Worth thinking about.\nOf course in many of the wards in Kirklees the toughest part is getting selected usually by the Labour Party and there are unfortunately no real contests in those wards. Labour had a leaflet go out in North Kirklees wards which had an unfortunate reference to the 'Tories shitting on us' due to a bit of cut and paste from a website so I understand. Happy to agree generally with the sentiment but it just shows how unprofessional Labour can be and still get away with it.

As you can imagine I've been concerned about how leafy Tory Surrey might fare under a leafy Tory Government. I needn't have worried just a 0.3% decrease. Naturally I also was wondering what might happen to Dorset fortunately the Government saw sense and actually raised their funding by 0.25%. The good news just kept coming with Hampshire, West Sussex, Buckingham and Richmond Upon Thames all escaping the worst of the cuts.\nYou can imagine what would have happened if these Councils had received the same level of funding cut as Kirklees or Leeds or Bradford with all the job losses, cuts in services and closed libraries and facilities that these Councils are likely to face. Fortunately for us Northern types there is an answer for the jobless provided by David Shakespeare Conservative Leader of the Local Government Association. David suggests we could all come down south and pick fruit on their farms. This would have the added benefit of taking jobs away from Romanians. Smart eh! David is also the Leader of Buckinghamshire County Council with a very reasonable 0.6% cut so naturally he's fairly pleased and feeling generous enough to let us help out on their farms.\nSo are the Conservatives and their Lib Dem 'pets' out of touch? Well we are 'all in it together' but in the North we are up to our necks in it while in the south it barely reaches beyond the soles of their green wellies.\nThere seems to be a distinct disparity between levels of cuts imposed on Labour-held inner London Boroughs and Tory-held outer London ones too. Clearly I must be missing something though, because that would just be outrageously unfair . . .\nReplyDelete",

It was built on the BRE Innovation Park |\nIt started off so well with a lot of innovation and experimentation carried out by industry to see how they might achieve these standards. Kingspan went to considerable effort to build the UK's first net zero carbon home back in 2010. A number of developers worked with the Building Research Establishment to develop ways of reaching this new standard. A Zero Carbon Hub was established in 2008 with a wealth of professionals in the energy and building sector who together have put in thousands of hours of work . Their role was to \"take day-to-day operational responsibility for achieving the government’s target of delivering zero carbon homes in England from 2016\" They must be seriously asking themselves now whether Government has let them down and wasted a considerable amount of their valuable time.\nWhy? Is the question.Well it is to help hard pressed developers reduce costs & regulation so they will build more homes. The reaction from developers however does not appear to have been at all positive. They definitely sound like they have been seriously mucked about by Government. Roy Lambe of Wilmott Dixon was reported in the Architects Journal today saying the following,\n“Since the original zero-carbon announcement, Willmott Dixon has been supportive of setting a long-term trajectory, enabling industry to invest with confidence. This announcement seriously undermines industry confidence in government policy and will diminish future investment.”\nHere's Julie Hirigoyen, Chief Executive of the Green Building Council in todays Guardian\n“It is short-sighted, unnecessary, retrograde and damaging to the housebuilding industry, which has invested heavily in delivering energy-efficient homes. Britain needs more housing, but there is no justification for building homes with a permanent legacy of high energy bills.”\nThe whole Zero Carbon homes policy has had poor support from Government for years and the lack of a robust Building Control regime meant that there were serious doubts as to how these properties would perform anyway. This is the reason why the Green Party advocated the Passivhaus standard in our manifesto. It is an internationally recognised energy performance standard for buildings that is assessed using a quality assurance method. The real fundamental strength of the Passivhaus Standard is the fact that the UK Government has nothing whatsoever to do with it and long may that continue.\nThe idiocy of this latest announcement beggars belief. These houses are not like bread-buns, here today & gone tomorrow. They will be here for decades to come - wasting energy, putting occupiers into fuel poverty, denying our commitments to reduce carbon emissions. Just a little care and attention (and a lot of sticky tape!) creates a Passivhaus - no fancy extras - and this Government has just let slip away something which housebuilders were geared up to deliver but (now that they don't have to) probably won't. I am amazed at how daily I am able to be disappointed yet again, like you, by this Government's manifest failures.\nReplyDeleteI really wish that all members of this government would take time out to do permaculture studies. Then we might see the scales falling from their eyes. It's systems thinking that they need to learn. On a planetary and multi-disciplinary scale.\nReplyDelete",

I've simply got to do one to break my record of 78 blogposts last year!\nIts almost ironic that 2012 ends as much of it has been. Wet and raining with flood risk in many places across the country. It has been the year of floods (and the Olympics) and government has seemed 'all at sea' on how to respond. When many homes are becoming increasingly uninsurable it failed to come to an agreement with the Association of British Insurers to address the situation. As floods affected roads and infrastructure councils, which were already cash strapped , found themselves further out of pocket . In terms of flood prevention (or at least not making things any worse than they are at the moment) the government delayed the introduction of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems on new developments, seemingly as part of their 'roll over and tickle my tummy' approach when dealing with the Home Builders Federation.\nGreen Party wise 2012 has been a very successful year locally. We defended Newsome very successfully against a concerted Labour campaign aimed at unseating me which must have been funded way beyond the legally allowed expenses limit. In Kirkburton Robert Barraclough won our 2nd seat in that ward taking us up to 5 Greens on Kirklees. There were lots of individual acheivements and improvements made by Green Party Councillors in the communities we represent, which makes me pleased at the positive role we play in local politics. Personally the role the Green Party and Kirkburton Parish Council played in helping the Keep Shelley Pyramid campaign win their battle to save the middle school system I believe showed us at our best. The threat of a Parish Poll and Shelley Principal agreeing to abide by it was the endgame of a very successful community led campaign. It was great to get so many positive messages from people and one person saying that they 'no longer resent paying their Parish Precept'. The Parish Council has become a much more outward facing body linking strongly with schools and community organisations through the 1000 fruit tree project. I am also really pleased we have finally been able to transfer ownership of Shelley Village Hall from the Parish Council to Shelley Community Association. A frustrating process for all concerned but now sorted thankfully. In Newsome Ward a number of projects have come together through careful juggling of a range of funding pots, and thanks to Councillor Julie Stewart-Turner for her work on managing our limited local budgets. We saw Springwood traffic calming finally happen, the resurfacing of Templar Drive, new parking bays at Dawson Road, a new surface to the rear of Orchard Terrace. None of this was easy to acheive with the tighter budgets we are dealing with but dome nonetheless.\nWhat has troubled me during 2012 is the many personal recessions people are suffering and that life is being made more difficult for people on low incomes as a direct result of government policy. 2013 will be even worse for many low income households\nIts almost ironic that 2012 ends as much of it has been.

I am also really pleased we have finally been able to transfer ownership of Shelley Village Hall from the Parish Council to Shelley Community Association. A frustrating process for all concerned but now sorted thankfully. In Newsome Ward a number of projects have come together through careful juggling of a range of funding pots, and thanks to Councillor Julie Stewart-Turner for her work on managing our limited local budgets. We saw Springwood traffic calming finally happen, the resurfacing of Templar Drive, new parking bays at Dawson Road, a new surface to the rear of Orchard Terrace. None of this was easy to acheive with the tighter budgets we are dealing with but dome nonetheless.\nWhat has troubled me during 2012 is the many personal recessions people are suffering and that life is being made more difficult for people on low incomes as a direct result of government policy. 2013 will be even worse for many low income households\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

The move would have raised £260,000 for the austerity-hit local authority.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Many appear to have the memories of goldfish where Labour is concerned and of course we'll never know what the alternative universe would be like if Labour had won the General Election but I reckon it would have still been a slightly different but still the unpalatable cocktail of cuts that we are experiencing right now.\nSo now we head into May, the local elections and the Alternative Vote Referendum. This I think was the Lib Dems single biggest error during their coalition agreement negotiations. The inequities of the first past the post electoral system are well known. Governments can be chosen by a minority of the electors and most constituencies are 'safe seats' so it is only the votes in a minority of constituencies that decide the election. This is not a matter for a referendum it is about what's right. Either the Tories should have simply agreed to a system of proportional representation or there should have been no deal, this should have been a 'red line' for the Lib Dems. Instead we have a question on an inferior version of 'PR' on offer which is acually not even proportional. A binding agreement to support the introduction of the Single Transferable Vote was what the Lib Dems should have insisted on. Of course we need to back the improvement that AV offers in the referendum but it's association with the increasingly unpopular Lib Dems might ironcallly work against it in the ballot. The word 'fair' has been so contaminated and misused by this government that valuing 'fair' votes and been seen to be rewarding the Lib Dems by supporting AV might not sit well with many people. I mean how do we feel about putting the duplicitous Nick Clegg in a position of power after the next General Election? Though electors may have the memory of goldfish where Labour are concerned I don't believe they are going to forget the broken Lib Dem pledges for a long, long time.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Would the Cabinet Member agree that this “allowable solutions” money could be used to further enhance the homes building policy Kirklees Liberal Democrats will propose later today? For example, it could help to pay for the installation of energy efficiency measures on the new homes, such as solar hot water panels.”\nI was rather surprised the Lib Dems are wanting to talk about the Coalition's so called Zero Carbon Homes policy as it is widely regarded as a big disappointment by those concerned with reducing the carbon emissions of new homes. With the backtracking and the amendments to the policy a 'Zero Carbon Home' is one that emits carbon at 32kgC02/m2 as opposed to the 47kgCO2/m2 that a house built to 2006 Building Regulations emitted. You would be forgiven for thinking 'zero emissions' meant well 'zero emissions' but that is Government 'Newspeak' for you. It is really a measure of the success of the Home Builders Federation in getting the Government to lower standards and therefore their costs.\n\"allowable solutions\" simply means opting out of high efficiency solutions for buildings by paying a sum of money to other carbon saving initiatives. Funding was, at one point, going to be destined for use by Local Authorities. This would have made a lot of sense, as it could have been targeted at those people in fuel poverty or on community renewables initiatives but now developers decide how they want to\nuse it and there is a lot of uncertainty over where it will end up and what it will be used for.\nIn Planning Resource magazine it stated,\nHousebuilders will decide\nhow to meet carbon mitigation requirements under the zero carbon homes policy\nrather than local authorities, the government has confirmed.\nColin\nMorrison who is a director and head of sustainability at a building\nconsultancy Turley, said:\n\"Based on\nour experience of allowable solutions projects and policies within emerging\nlocal plans, this will come as a disappointment to local authorities as it\ncould have represented a significant source of funding for local carbon\nreduction projects.\nSo unfortunately the\n‘greenest government ever’, with a Department of Energy and Climate Change led\nby a Lib Dem Minister, has failed to come up with the green goods yet again.\nHowever\nin the absence of effective policies coming out of the UK Govt, Kirklees Council can,\nwithin the Local Plan, set its own standards for buildings erected on land the Council owns and they can be better\nthan those established by central government. Housing\nbuilt to a Passivhaus standard has very high insulation performance, low heating\ndemand , controlled ventilation and very low fuel bills. A Passivhaus social housing\ndevelopment built in Oldham by Keepmoat has homes that are costing tenants no more than £20a year in fuel bills and the builders were trained by the Green Building\nCompany which is based in Huddersfield.\nSo I so will certainly be pushing hard for Passivhaus standards on Council land as part of the new Kirklees Local Plan. In the absence of good policy from central government we at least can do our best at the local level and show them the error of their ways.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

This is a totally necessary and responsible activity for any large public organisation responsible for delivering vital local services. There is a danger however that this reinforces the risk averse culture that can exist in many councils with an emphasis on playing it safe and giving an undue weight to risk avoidance rather than taking opportunities.\nIn June Sheffield City Council passed a resolution to establish a Corporate Opportunities Register to balance the attention given to risk and opportunity by senior officers and Councillors. The motion proposed by the Green Party group said,\n\"that to act as a balance to the Corporate Risk Register, there should be a Corporate Opportunities Register, detailing new funding opportunities, partnership opportunities and initiatives that will help deliver the Council's objectives, such as supporting those affected by the cost of living crisis.\"\nSo what might a Corporate Opportunities Register look like? First you need to identify what the opportunity is. Is it funding you can bid for from Government or other sources? Is it a partnership with another organisation that might help you drive efficiencies and deliver better services? Is it a new activity that can help the Council achieve it's aims or generate an income stream? All these opportunities would need to be broken down by directorates to ensure high level attention is given across the council .\nNot all opportunities we could take should be taken. Perhaps the likelihood of success is low or the effort expended simply not worth it, but demonstrating that as an organisation the Council is aware and tracking opportunities is important. It builds confidence and shows that officers and members are outward looking and keen to look beyond the councils own resources to achieve it's goals.\nThe real gain from establishing a Corporate Opportunities Register is to show that the culture of the Council is one that is outward facing, ambitious for it's people, entrepreneurial and dynamic. Surely that is something we would like all our Councils to be?\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Well it's these pink posters on streets around the Golcar Ward where coincidentally a Council By Election is to be held on November 21st.\nThe posters say in big bold words 'Stop Labour's Gridlock'. If you look at some really small writing at the top you'll see a line indicating it is part of the Lib Dem election campaign. So though it looks pink it is in fact yellow! It also looks like it is part of some sort of community campaign (which it is not) and there is no indication of what party it represents. It is clearly deceptive, cynical and wholly negative.It is clearly the start of some contrived campaign that the Lib Dems will run during the election to drum up support.\nYou can imagine when the Lib Dems were dreaming up this idea that they thought it was a really clever thing to do by pretending to run a non partisan community campaign against the party they regard as their principal opponent. The problem for them is that people aren't stupid and they can spot when they are being manipulated. It will backfire on them.\nI'm no fan of the Labour Party, but if I am going to criticise them I will do it openly on literature bearing the name of the Party I represent. If the Lib Dems are going to be so deceptive in their election campaigns why should we trust them if they are elected? Actually we know they can't be trusted in Government with pledge after pledge being broken such as backtracking on no rise in Student Tuition Fees, opposing nuclear energy and privatisation of the NHS.\nIf they behave so cynically in their election campaigns the they deserve to be treated cynically by the electorate.\nThese posters are so high up that it's impossible to see that these are done by the Lib Dems (but we'd guessed) I would question however if the posters in fact conform to the \"imprint\" required by law (see Electoral Commission website)\nReplyDeleteI agree with almost everything that you say above, Andrew - apart from being a Labour Party member. In fact most people have been confused by the Lib-Dem tactic. I guess that very few have read the Lib-Dem newsletter which has the same title as the pink poster above.\nReplyDeleteI also liked what you said in the Examiner about the LDF, although there was no other option available to the Council except to withdraw it.\nThanks Jeremy. On the LDF our Group did like the idea of forcing the issue with the Planning Inspectorate and making its withdrawal their undemocratic decision.

We were able to do this by demonstrating that the Clean Energy Cashback/Feed In Tarrif will pay for the capital borrowing costs of the investment. That is however only part of the picture. What hasn't been taken into account, to my knowledge, is the value of the solar elecricity used in the buildings. So let's do some sums\nAssume - £5million buys 1000kWp of solar panels (actually that is a conservative figure)\nAssume a 1000kWp produced 800000 kWh at 12p/kWh(don't know what KMC pay for electricity but it will be in this ballpark) Therefore we may have £96000 that we weren't accounting for.\nThat £96000 will finance the borrowing of around £1million in Capital to help fund essential Council projects. Of course the Council may decide to simply take the revenue saving to save jobs or support services. The key point is that if solar is self funding and generates the Council vital revenue why are we just planning to restrict this project to £5million? Why not £50million (£1million revenue OR £10million capital) or a £100million(£2million revenue OR £20million capital). Imagine what that could do to help turnaround the Council's financial woes.\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

When the first Green Cllr Nick Harvey was elected he wasn't given an office so he worked in the Members Lounge with its telly and comfy chairs. He reckoned he found out more there than being in an office anyway. Not only was there a Members Lounge but also a Members Library with a dedicated Librarian to help Councillors with research. Sadly this was very under utilised and the function and the member of staff went back into Huddersfield Library. The Members Lounge also disappeared and quite rightly became a large meeting room instead.\nWhen I was elected in 1999 the Green Party Group of 3 finally got an office. It was possibly the smallest room in the building if you don't count ones containing a toilet. We later got allocated a space on the top floor on the same corridor as the Press Team lead then by David Bagley. They have been out of the building a few years now and there rooms were replaced by the Tory Group who we have shared the floor with us to this day. One of the great things about our office space was the balcony. I say 'balcony' it is more access to a flat roof space through a window. For a couple of years I quietly grew vegetables on it and took pleasure in carrying bags of compost through Reception looking as shifty as possible. I'm sure they thought I was growing cannabis on the roof. It was great to sit out there in the summer between meetings. Other Kirklees officers will soon move into Crown Court Buildings, in the short term at least, but it will eventually be sold off if a suitable buyer can be found.\nSo not just a new building but a new era for Kirklees Council.

All we have done is remove an obstacle for them by proposing the Parish Council covers the gap in funding for the Libraries running costs for gas, electricity , cleaning etc. for a to be agreed set period of time. This is a vital first step in enabling them to establish their own Business Plan which will be needed if the building is to be successfully transferred from Kirklees Council to the community of Shepley.\nCllr Armer asks where these funds will come from and really he already knows the answer . It will be an integral part of the Parish Councils budget and that is the proposal we will be making at our November Council meeting. Shepley people pay their Parish precept along with their Council Tax and the Library is a top concern for people in the village so it makes sense for the Parish Council to support it and give some benefit back. The Village Association that is working to save the Library is aware and has been fully informed of our proposals throughout.\nCllr Armer says that I said the Parish Council should fund current staffing levels at the public meeting in Shepley of £50,000 increasing the Parish Precept by £45, in fact there were lots of suggestions at the meeting, but Green Party Cllrs have never proposed that as an option. At the meeting we were all informed by the library management that the current annual running costs of the building, less current income, are in the region of £5000. Our above proposal would amount to an annual cost of £5000/year or less to the Parish Council which we believe is good value to keep the library building open. Cllr Armer knows this as he was also at the meeting, but yet is determined to play his political hand again.\nWe are very disappointed by the criticism of the Green Party efforts to help save Shepley Library by Councillor Armer and sadly note where there is an absence of any initiative from him and his Party then he resorts again to criticise and knowingly mislead local people. We trust that when our proposals come before the Parish Council he will do the right thing and support them in the interests of Shepley Village and the future of its Library.\nI think it is a good idea that the Parish council help keep things like the library open. i have see the children use the library in Kirkburton and to see them reading books rather than playing digital gaming units, is a breath of fresh air.\nReplyDeleteI think Cllr Armer once again misunderstands the feeling of the public, the same \\way The government is doing as well. i would not mind paying more on my council tax if it was spent in the right place.\nAs a Green Parish Councillor i don't always agree with Green Policies as\\a rule, and i have backed Cllr Almer in the past when his suggestions make sense. on this occasion i back all the Green Councillors on this subject i also believe the independence and Lib Dems Cllrs also agree in princeable to save the library's\nThis i believe is motivated by what is good for us all , rather than a political stance where one side is trying to gain points against others. .",

To the perplexed masses the egghead programmers explain that they have provided the answer but not how it is achieved, that would require asking another question. So it is with the referendum. We have an answer but not the how we achieve it. In effect we've only had half the question answered hence the rationale for a second referendum.\nIt has become apparent following the result that neither the Leave nor Remain campaigns had any plan for implementing Brexit. Without this Brexit plan people did not appreciate the implications of their vote. So though Brexit may have been agreed in principle, by 52%, the 'in practice' has not been agreed. In effect the UK has only being asked half the Brexit question. The second question (once we appreciate what the Brexit deal actually is) could be,\n\"The principle of leaving the EU was agreed on 23/6/16. Do you believe it should be implemented?\"\nYES. NO\nSo yes there should be a 2nd Referendum but with a different question. If the answer is YES then we press ahead with Brexit. If the answer is NO then the outcome of the original 23/6/16 is set aside and we remain members of the EU\nWith economic chaos breaking out all around us, hate crime rising and people's jobs under threat now it is difficult to take the advice in friendly letters on the cover of The Hichhikers Guide to the Galaxy - \"Don't Panic\" Let's not panic but we desperately need Political Leadership right now.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

I wandered into the local petrol station and the woman next to me in the checkout turned to me and said 'I bet you're laughing at all this aren't you?' She was pointing at the Green Party badge on my lapel. I was a bit flummoxed. 'Well no not really' I said. I didn't get chance to talk about how fragile our whole western civilisation is and how our reliance on fossil fuels makes us less resilient to price rises and the threat of its withdrawal or rationing becomes a matter of immediate concern. Renewable energies, electric cars and public transport all come into their own at times when fossil fuels are under threat. During the last fuel crisis a number of years ago people were running out of fuel and public transport use rose with a number of people using it for the first time. The immediate crisis ended and people went back to their old routines. It reminded me of the old story of putting the frog in the boiling water where it immediately jumps out or slowly raising the temperature of the water to boiling point so the frog doesn't realise whats happening till its too late. Stick with me on this one! We have a 'boiling crisis' which we have been thrown into and people have reacted by running to the forecourts to fill up their vehicles but the real crisis is happening all the time with ever rising fuel prices eating away at peoples disposable income. Ultimately price rises will be related more and more to geology and the increasing expense of finding oil reserves will continue to work its way through to the prices on petrol pumps. This is the everyday crisis, the ever rising temperature.\nMonday, 26 March 2012\nGreen Leader Caroline Lucas MP visits Huddersfield\nCaroline Lucas MP visited Huddersfield today to see some of the projects local Green Party Councillors on Kirklees and on Kirkburton Parish are involved in and supporting.

No changes to the library service are due to occur in 2012/13 so this funding would be allocated for the 2013/14 financial year. This would give us 2 years to plan a secure funded future for the library when the funding outlook may be more optimistic. Our proposal would be at no additional cost to the Council Tax payer and would give us the breathing space we need to produce a plan for a sustainable future for this vital community facility. All Shepley Library needs now is the support of my 2 Kirkburton Ward Councillors (colleagues from the Conservative Party) to agree this proposal at Wednesday’s Joint Area Committee Meeting, and then we can put this proposal forward to the Council.”\nFurthermore Green Party Councillors on Kirkburton Parish Council are calling for a dialogue with Kirklees Council to secure existing library services across the Kirkburton Parish. The Parish area has Kirklees Libraries in Shepley, Kirkburton, Kirkheaton and Lepton plus mobile library services covering other villages.\n“ We do not want our Library facilities to be picked off one by one. We want a secure future for libraries which are some of Kirklees Councils only contact point in many communities”. said Councillor Robert Barraclough who is a Kirkburton Parish Councillor.\n“ If we lose those services we will lose them forever so this is a crucial time to ensure buildings, services and staff are retained.

While public services are slashed and benefits for the vulnerable are cut we now have the 'we're all in it together' government considering making the rich, richer. Quite unbelievable. At what point does a Liberal Democrat with an ounce of decency say, 'Enough is Enough' and quits the Party/Government. What is the point of a Party which has claims to be progressive being part of a government which allows this sort of blatant injustice which further divides society. If the goverment were trying to create the conditions for more social unrest this is exactly the sort of policy you would promote. Utterly bonkers.\nThe 50p rate applies to those earning £150,000 or more. Green Party policy would lower the threshold to earners over £100,000/year.\nThe 50p rate applies to those earning £150,000 or more.

This morning myself, Parish Cllrs Richard Burton, Robert Barraclough and Alison Munro joined residents from the Stocksmoor Village Association to plant the firs trees. It was a beautiful morning, spirits were high and there was a good turnout to tidy the area of brambles and dig the holes ready for the first plantings. We had a good mixture of cherry, apple and plum trees with pear to go in early next week. We've found a good supplier for the initial trees so we are hopeful we should be able to complete the project well under budget. It is a win, win project that ticks many boxes. Growing local food, helping bee populations and wildlife generally, involving local people, helping local businesses all of these are helped by this project. It is a 4 year project to boldly plant fruit trees all across the Kirkburton Parish to leave a lasting and valued benefit to local people. Engaging community groups is a must with schemes such as this to make sure they are planted in the right places and that the community has stake in the project over time. There was talk of jam and wine making using the produce when the trees mature and start fruiting. All really good stuff and exactly the sort of thing the Parish Council should be doing.\nWe're producing a google map of the scheme to map progress as we go along and here's a link\n| Local residents get stuck in planting |\n| Yours truly wih members of the Stocksmoor Village Association |\nDrains News update!\nFor all of you who have been wondering the new drain cover is now in place on the land at Hart Street in Newsome.

By opposing the Local Development Framework on Tuesday we will be calling the Conservatives bluff as the supposed protectors of our green spaces. It would be ironical indeed if the Conservatives got away with styling themselves as the “Green Saviours” of Kirklees. The Coalition Government's National Planning Policy Framework and the Conservative Chancellor George Osborne’s desire to use the planning system as an engine of economic growth is what is behind the threat to all our green spaces. The Green Party has a responsibility not to let the Kirklees Conservatives off the hook and have a free ride on Tuesday. We will be calling on them not just to vote against the Kirklees LDF but to condemn their own government for their assault on green spaces just as organisations like the National Trust and the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England have done already. As such we will be voting against the LDF prposals on Tuesday. What ever figure for the number of houses is finally agreed on Tuesday the Conservatives should be challenged to give a cast iron guarantee that their Government will not try to increase the number of houses agreed for Kirklees by regarding locally determined decisions as 'unsound'.\"\nSaturday, 3 March 2012\nSpudtacular!\n| Seed potatoes very nearly a sell out except for........ |\n| ............Kestrel seed potatoes - slug and customer resistant |\nThe Seed Swap and Potato Day at Newsome Scout Hut was a tremendous success for the Growing Newsome gang. Nearly a thousand seed potatoes were sold for the bargain price of 10p each. There were around a dozen varieties covering the first early, second early and maincrop categories. The event started at 10.00am and by 1.00pm they we were down to around one variety of second earlies which didn't seem to sell for some strange reason. They were 'slug resistant' which I think people took to mean 'even the slugs won't eat these!' There were seeds to swap, homemade cakes, jams and chutneys to purchase, cut price fleece to protect plants from frost and I was outside helping flog our bargain £5 fruit trees as part of the Newsome Thousand Fruit Tree project. We shifted about 40 fruit trees and we were had more exotic fruits this year, including greengage, quince, plums, pears as well as eating and cooking apples. It was certainly buzzing in the morning and a good number of folks stayed on for lunch of baked potato and beans which sold out. The Stirley Farm crew were also busy that day planting around 15 fruit trees in their new orchard. All in all a cracking day\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",

Huge cuts by central government have limited Kirklees ability to properly fund services people expect of their local council. The additional £14million cut Kirklees received last year when government failed to honour the level of funding we secured from the Council Tax freeze grant was particularly difficult for Kirklees.\nUnderstanding why Kirklees is proposing such cuts is not the same as agreeing with them however. I don't believe our local Council should be in the business of making poor people poorer. Kirklees Council should operate according to a set of values and principles rather than simply being an organisation which manages an ever dwindling amount of resources. We need to find other ways to make the books balance. Always easier said than done but if regard this as acceptable it opens the door to further cuts for this same group of people in future years. The genie would be well and truly out of the bottle. So I am opposing this proposal and I would be disappointed if a Council that is led by the Labour Party somehow found this acceptable.\nThe Consultation on the proposal runs till October 15th I urge as many people as possible to respond on the link attached https://www.snapsurveys.com/wh/s.asp?k=150289138626\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Local people have an almost spiritual connection to it. When we come home from our holidays the sight of Castle Hill on the horizon tells us that we are near home. When we bring visitors to see the town it is one of the places we take them. Its history goes back to the Iron Age and anyone suggesting 'improvements' should tread with caution\"\n\" It has not taken long for me to work out that suggestions that we might have a cable car going up Castle Hill is a non starter. It is not a theme park or a visitor attraction like Disneyland it is a place that people go to to look at the town they live in and the hills that surround us. I also oppose any suggestion that we should put a hotel on top of Castle Hill. I like many had a great deal of affection for the old Castle Hill Hotel and raised the alarm when the owners started to demolish it in contravention of their Planning Application. Sadly we can't recreate what they destroyed.\"\n\"What we do need on Castle Hill is a retractable bollard at the bottom of the road to shut it off to traffic at night and particularly around October/November when it becomes a magnet for setting off fireworks. It causes huge disturbance for local people and needs a significant clear up operation in the following days, usually by local volunteers. Kirklees Council has simply not enforced the Public Space Protection Order that banned fireworks been set off from the hill. Last year the whole side of the hill, that was tinder dry, went up in flames as a result. The Labour run Kirklees Council needs to get a grip and when it declares a Public Space Protection Order actually enforce it.\"\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

So they pay someone to tell them if they have built to a high standard. or not. We also have the issue of the 'performance gap' where the expected energy efficiency standards of new build homes rarely match what is expected under building regulations. The Grenfell Enquiry has uncovered all sorts of weaknesses in the building sector not least of which the developers responsible for poor construction simply winding themselves up leaving no one legally liable for their actions. We are not well served.\nKirklees, like all local councils, has limited powers to tackle these issues. We can ask for higher energy efficiency standards but developers have the right to challenge this request to government on financial viability grounds. However dubious and questionable their case is they are likely to come out on top.\nI was pleased when I was asked by the Labour Administration to provide input into the new 'Climate Change: Guidance Note for Planning Applications (June 2021)' a document which provides local guidance to developers and also a questionnaire to complete. One suggestion I made, which was, accepted was to put a sentence in explaining that the Kirklees Planning guidance was in accordance with the direction of travel indicated by Government,\n\"The UK Government has announced that it will be seeking to cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035 so this guidance is in accordance with the direction of travel indicated at a national level\".\nIf the Government is true to its word (yes I know!) then we should expect developers to have to achieve higher energy efficiency standards in their developments. No harm pointing this out to them.\nAnother proposal I made was about ensuring that if Solar PV and solar Thermal systems are installed that people could see when they are generating heat or electricity so they could make best use of the energy generated by installing,\n\"a visual display showing when hot water and electricity is being produced should be provided in a convenient part of the house, such as the kitchen, to encourage householders to make use of the free energy in the home when it is available.\"\nA key part of the proposals was for all developers to be required to complete a climate change statement in the original document it asked the question,\n\"What measures have been/will be taken to reduce the energy demand associated with your proposed development?\"\nmy addition were the words,\n\"beyond the minimum required in Building Regulations\"\nI could have imagined developers simply cutting and pasting from Part L of the Building Regulations as relates to energy efficiency saying,\n\"We have complied with Part L of the Building Regulations\"\nIf they have done the bare minimum I wanted them to say so. I wanted them to say that they don't care about climate change or conversely that they do and that they have gone above and beyond our the rather meagre Government requirements on Building Regulations.\nRecognition and praise are motivators, but failing that, so is shame, for taking no heed of our obligations to the environment.

For electricity we pretty much can see the path. New nuclear is there certainly but so is carbon capture and storage and we should expect some movement on that agenda shortly.\nWhat about heat? The Renewable Heat Incentive is an innovative policy supporting small and community scale biomass, heat pumps and a bit of solar thermal for hot water but there's no will to scale it up as a mass market solution for the millions rather than just the greenies and first movers. Community/District heating is also a solution which is difficult to make stack up on any scale. Government has given up on energy efficiency as a solution to the heat problem so what's left? We could have electric central heating for homes but for it to be carbon free we would need a massive scaling up of our renewable energy generation and that is certainly not anywhere on this Governments agenda. So you are left with the gas going through the pipes and being burnt in our boilers. If it has to be gas you have to change the gas. Biogas created and captured from rotting biological matter e.g. Sewage sludge, decomposing vegetable matter etc could be injected into the gas network and this would be renewable as opposed to fossil gas. The process is called anaerobic digestion but again not much sign of serious investment in this technology in the UK. So methane, fossil or renewable sourced is not a solution. What are we left with? Burning a different gas such as hydrogen in boilers. This is being seriously considered and I know of discussions with government looking at how this scenario might work and the technical problems that would have to be overcome to make it a reality. The problem is that as a mass market solution it is probably 20 years plus away from realisation or 'too late' as you could put it. Plan B doesn't work!\nI don't believe that under any scenarios the government might consider that they can resolve the heat problem. So it's back to Plan A! Existing housing mass regrofit would need to be covered through a 'Green New Deal' approach or Peoples QE funded but the problem of the Energy Companies remains. How do you take away their fear, their loss of revenue and give them hope of a future? They need a new source of revenue, they need to diversify into companies that have a socially and environmentally beneficial purpose. The natural partners for energy companies a re social housing providers Councils and Registered Social Landlords/Housing Associations. They have been badly hit by Government through cuts in Housing Revenue Account funding and a proposed extension of the 'Right to Buy'. This has meant that plans to build new social rented housing have been either cancelled or scaled back significantly. A new source of funding from Energy Companies could come in the form of a 'Social Housing Obligation' where a levy on bills could be used to fund investment in new Council and Housing Association developments. These would be built to 'passivhaus' standards and would have limited need for heating. The difference between the Social Housing Obligation and Energy Company Obligation would be that's for the former they would have a 'share of the action' and an agreed proportion of the revenue. Over time you would expect Energy Companies to have a diminishing amount of revenue from selling energy and a rising amount from rents. Ultimately they may well become, or merge with, Social Housing providers. To make the business model work it would be necessary for Government (and Labour) to abandon their ideological support for the 'Right to Buy'. We can tackle climate change and create a better society but not with the government or the policies we have.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2011_09_green-deal-challenge-from-kirklees-warm_html/content_584.html": "| How compelling an offer will Green Deal be? |\nKirklees Warm Zone is something I know a lot about. I proposed the amendment that made this insulation scheme free to private householders back in February 2007. It has since gone on to win awards, be regularly referred to by ministers and has been held up as a beacon of best practice. A strong team of people worked on it and it is backed by years of experience of project managing energy efficiency programmes by the Council. DECC regularly updates statistics for local authority insulation levels and Kirklees remains at the top of that list with the highest proportion of housing stock insulated out of all local authorities in the country. The properties that didn’t receive insulation either already had it installed, were hard to treat with conventional insulation or there were access difficulties.\nThere’s plenty of impressive statistics in the Kirklees Warm Zone final report from the 3 and ½ years that the programme ran for:\n• 51,155 properties received insulation (either cavity wall , loft insulation or both measures)\n• 16,111 households received Benefits advice\n• £1.6 million new benefits entitlement levered in (estimate)\n• 111,174 households received free low energy light bulbs\n• 602 households received central heating funded by local or regional schemes\n• 2033 households were referred to Warm Front for central heating\n• 106 jobs created directly for the schemes\n• 200-250 jobs created indirectly\n• 5.5 points increase in SAP\n• 1,375 households taken out of fuel poverty\n• £3.9 million fuel expenditure saving per year\n• 23,000 tonnes CO2/yr savings average\nThere’s plenty to comment on here. The issue I mention most often in Council meetings is the economic regeneration benefits of Kirklees Warm Zone. For an investment of little over £10 million by Kirklees (and a similar amount by Scottish Power from CERT funding) around £4 million goes back into the local economy each year from savings on household fuel bills. Every time that the cost of fuel goes up, so also does the value of the energy savings. With the recent rises in gas prices the ‘payback’ on Kirklees Warm Zone has shrunk considerably.\nKirklees Warm Zone was certainly influential to an extent, though not as much as many of us wished. The Scottish Government’s Home Insulation Scheme was introduced as a response to the Scottish Green Party MSP’s unsuccessful attempt in 2009 to get the Kirklees Scheme replicated in the whole of Scotland. Energy Efficiency programmes run by the Greater London Assembly and also a number of small scale area based schemes have been strongly influenced by the Kirklees model. Interestingly very few have followed the ‘free insulation for all’ approach we pioneered. There are a number of reasons for this lack of replication of good practice not least of which is the severe constraints on public sector funding that has put paid to many worthy projects as Councils concentrate on cost cutting and trying to deliver basic services. Another important factor is the long policy hiatus as we await the Green Deal to begin. There’s not a lot of point beginning a 3 or 4 year programme to insulate all the housing in your area if the funding mechanism that supports it, in this case CERT, will be abolished in 2012 and the Energy Company Obligation that replaces it will not significantly help replicate Kirklees style insulation schemes.\nOne of the key challenges Kirklees Warm Zone offers to Green Deal is to match or exceed the rate at which carbon is saved. The scheme was limited to just over 3 years as part of a systematic, door by door, street by street, area based approach, with the aim of been able to say “job done” for basic insulation measures in the district by 2010. By the end we were able to show how quickly we could save carbon with a concerted, time limited, programme with a compelling offer. If Government policy truly recognises the urgency of addressing climate change then it is the speed of carbon saving that is important. Green Deal needs to rapidly ramp up into being a big saver of carbon, not a half hearted option for householders to consider, for only the committed to embrace and one which many will discount and ignore.\nGreen Deal is of course a much bigger proposition in terms of measures that will be on offer. It is not just cavity wall and loft insulation but solid wall insulation, internal dry lining, better heating controls , efficient boilers and microgeneration too. So in many ways the potential for Green Deal to exceed any other energy efficiency scheme to date is huge. Green Deal does not however lend itself easily to area based approaches. There could be many providers in an area all trying to sell pretty much the same product. Consumer protection and confidence in the Green Deal offer is going to be crucial if the scheme is going to get off the starting blocks without a hiccup and also for its long term reputation as a trusted energy efficiency provider.\nLike many others, I want Green Deal to succeed and the lesson from Kirklees Warm Zone is that the offer to the householder has to be compelling. In this case the loan arrangements have got to be unequivocally a ‘no brainer’ for the householder. The ‘golden rule’ by which savings in fuel bills meet or exceed loan repayments needs to be guaranteed. The costs of the work carried out under Green Deal needs to match or be cheaper than could be obtained independently from a contractor. The interest rates offered for loans under Green Deal should be attractive and better than could be obtained on the High Street.\nThe role of the Local Authority is key to the Green Deal’s success. Local Authorities are generally trusted bodies, they are permanent institutions, where people can go when they need support with concerns and issues. Local Authorities have access to householders through a range of media including letters, websites and an array of publications. Local Authorities now need to realise their power in assisting the delivery of Green Deal and conveying that effectively to the potential providers. The resultant partnerships should be good for Councils, the providers, the Green Deal itself and most importantly the householders benefiting from it.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

We need to value the people who work on the ground to make our Target to Win Strategy a reality. We also need to celebrate good practice and electoral success much more in the Party to build a culture of contesting elections professionally and to' demonstrate that we can win to a wider proportion of the electorate. Andrew has organised successful election campaigns in Kirklees for over 20 years. As a Target to Win Pioneer he will be a strong and informed advocate for those needing support for their election campaigns.\nGiving a voice to the Regions\nSome good progress has been made through the appointment of Regional Campaigns Coordinators to help build the capacity and capability of the Green Party at the local and Regional level. The Party needs a perspective in the Leadership Team that can speak with experience and authority from outside London and the South East. As a Councillor From Yorkshire with 17 years experience as a Local Cllr, Andrew is ideally placed to fulfil that role.\nInvolving members\nAn active political party needs to be able to respond quickly to changing events. We should also ensure we involve our Party bodies and members in strategic decisions as much as possible. The Green Party needs to avoid situations where our position on key issues are made by pronouncement. One very practical issue Andrew would pursue if elected as Deputy Leader is to initiate a consultation with local parties on 'Progressive Alliances' asking for views and opinions to feedback to relevant Party bodies so your views are taken into account.\nWidening our reach.\nThe Green Party's support is often perceived as being white and middle class. There are some good examples around the UK where that stereotype is challenged due to dedicated work by local Parties but we need to do more. Andrew is already working closely with groups like Muslim Engagement and Development MEND to challenge Islamaphobia and the Governments ill conceived 'Prevent Strategy'. As someone who has been elected to an ethnically diverse area of Huddersfield Andrew has strong links to community organisations representing BME communities at the local and national level. We also need to show how we are relevant to the many communities who are suffering most from our deteriorating services. We need to demonstrate that Green policies provide workable solutions addressing the need for secure affordable housing, worthwhile rewarding employment and ensuring the people with the greatest needs have good support and good services.\nThe benefits of a Councillor as our Deputy Leader\nThe Leadership of the Green Party is likely to have a strong Parliamentary focus. As Deputy Leader and an experienced Local Councillor Andrew would provide knowledge of the impact of Government policy on the ground. Andrew will provide practical input based on the real life experience of implementing policy at the local level. Elected politicians bring an additional degree of credibility to our Leadership Team whether they are an MP or a Councillor.\nWorking with others to address Climate Change\nDeveloping workable plans and policies to address climate change should be a top priority for the Green Party. As Deputy Leader Andrew would forge stronger relations with NGOs and businesses that share our objectives to build our credibility and provide a robust challenge to Government and other Parliamentary parties on practical action to achieve the Paris Climate targets and beyond. Andrew has worked for over 20 years in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sector and has strong connections with key organisations.\n'Progressive Alliances'\nThe idea of a Progressive Alliances is on the Green Party's agenda as a Strategy being considered in the run up to the next General Election, whether that is in 2020 or possibly much sooner. To be successful a Progressive Alliance will need to have a popular programme that can draw support across a large proportion of the population. It will need to have more broadly based policies than being simply about achieving Electoral Reform. If it is to have wide appeal we will need to demonstrate that Green policies can provide jobs, tackle climate change address poverty and provide secure and affordable homes. Acheiving policies which reflect Green Party values will need to be a key part of any deal. Andrew is a skilled and experienced negotiator who has delivered Green policies on the ground on a Council that has been hung for 17 years.",

What is needed at this point more than ever is demonstrable honesty by politicians. So when I was passed the latest Lib Dem leaflet from Almondbury I had hoped for better but was to be disappointed. Imagine my astonishment when I read that the Green Party have called for lower insulation standards in council housing than the private housing improved under Warm Zone and that we wish to put concrete insulating render on historic buildings. Lib Dem Leader Kath Pinnock is quoted as saying \"only the Greens could think it sensible to destroy our stone heritage buildings at a huge cost to the tax payer\". None of this is true, of course. At Full Council as I was leaving the chamber I asked Cllr Pinnock why she had said these things but she refused to talk to me about it and parted swiftly saying \"You shouldn't take credit for Warm Zone!\". All became clear at this point. The Lib Dems had indeed proposed the Kirklees Warm Zone but not with free insulation. There are any number of Warm Zones up and down the country but without the Green Party amendment making it free it would have less than a third the take up of the current scheme, up to 40'000 homes might never have been insulated under a Lib Dem Warm Zone. The credit, locally and nationally the Greens have received for the free insulation scheme has clearly got up their nose. They usually put a misleading statement in their leaflet like \"The Lib Dems introduced Kirklees Warm Zone that provides free insulation for all households\". I usually let this pass but this latest leaflet is beyond the pale.\nAt a meeting on Thursday evening she asked me to tell he if there were any grant schemes to provide solar panels for church buildings. I told her about a suitable grant scheme but not before pointing out the irony of her asking for my advice.\nCllr Kath Pinnock isn't beyond stretching the truth to the limit as this link to the blog on the Yougen website illustrates ;\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

I had a Solar thermal system installed by Hebden Bridge company EcoHeat in April 2010. Any renewable heat technology installed after July 2009 with a valid Microgeneration Certification Scheme certificate would qualify for a legacy payment. So after more than 4 years I'd finally get the promised RHI payments but not without going through so e unnecessary hoops. First I'd have to get a Green Deal Advice Report at the cost of £120. This was supposedly to ensure I had insulation measures installed, but then I had an Energy Performance Certificate carried out only a couple of months ago to enable me to have cavity wall insulation installed. This just seemed to be an expensive exercise to allow DECC Minister Greg Barker to go on the television and claim people are 'taking action' as a result of Green Deal advice when I took action 4 years ago. Anyway I got the report done as otherwise I wouldn't have been able to claim the RHI.\nSo I get to the point where I'm completing the online RHI claim and it asks me if I have had any\nGrant support for my installation as this will be deducted. I remembered I'd had a £400 grant under the Low Carbon Buildings Programme so declared that and pressed 'submit'. A few days later I get an email from OFGEM who were administering the scheme saying they wouldn't process my RHI claim without proof of my Low Carbon Buildings Programme grant. This was particularly annoying as I hadn't got proof, I'd volunteered the information, all solar thermal grants under he LCBP were £400 and anyway shouldn't they have a database of people who had LCBP grants anyway as they are acting on behalf of government.

It is a green patch of land with a small tarmac area. Ideal as a community space and as a community orchard. To try to make this a reality local people have presented a petition to the Council, spoken at Full Council meetings and asked me to negotiate with the Council on their behalf. We've all reached a brick wall. The bottom line is that the Council could make a packet by selling at as a building plot and a community orchard doesn't really cut it in the making cash for the council stakes.\nWhat is in play here is two different approaches to value. Community value versus capital value. On the community value side all we have is bringing people together in a common project, a new low cost facility for the area, local grown healthy food in an urban environment and a valued improved green space near the centre of Huddersfield. On the capital value side they have money. Now let us not put down the value of money. After all it could be used to support community cohesion projects, local food projects, local community facilities. The irony is of course obvious. To make the irony of the situation even starker locals have decided to plant apple trees there anyway and develop the land as a community recreation and growing space at no cost to the council.\nIt is of course easier to take away land for building which never had a use or a purpose. Once that land has a positive community use it changes everything.\nOver to you Kirklees.\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

The right plan for Kirklees brings together all elements of the system to maximise the health and wellbeing of local residents and provide timely access to treatment, when needed, as locally as possible.\n- That the plan will focus on prevention, helping people to manage their own health, supporting primary care and general practice to improve local access, changing the way in which hospital staff deliver care by embracing technology and working in the community and making sure that the full range of responses, from Community First Responders to major trauma care, are available when people experience a medical emergency.\n- Call upon local healthcare organisations and national government to support the development and implementation of such a plan, along with appropriate levels of funding to deliver this Plan.”\nThe Council believes it also important to recognise a number\nof significant factors:\nThis Council is very appreciative of the work of the wide\nrange of local healthcare staff and organisations who serve our local\npopulation by directly providing care and treatment or undertaking the many\nrelated support roles. These are based in a much wider range of organisations\nthan just the local hospital trusts and span local community pharmacies and\ngeneral practice through to Yorkshire Ambulance Service.\nThis Council also appreciates the work of the members of the\nJoint Overview and Scrutiny Committees who are involved in reviewing changes to\nlocal hospital services and understands the need for them to step back from\nthis debate in order to maintain their independence.\nThis Council recognises that the NHS both locally and\nnationally faces real challenges including rising demand, workforce shortages\nand financial constraints. The same challenges apply to this Council and\nare seen in a number of services including, in the context of this debate,\nadult social care.\nThis Council realises that change is needed to meet these\nchallenges and does not object to change, when the change is the right\nchange. The changes that are proposed for hospital services in\nHuddersfield and Dewsbury are the wrong changes. They are wrong because\nthey are isolated plans for individual NHS organisations, not plans for the\nplace of Kirklees and its people or plans that take account of health provision\nin adjacent areas. This Council cannot support the wrong changes.\nNationally, the NHS itself has recognised that the time has\ncome to plan for a place, not plan for individual organisations and NHS\norganisations are directed to do this.\nThe right plan for Kirklees\nwill be about change across the whole system not just about change in\nindividual organisations. The right plan for Kirklees will be focused on\ndoing the right things for local people, not on what is right for individual\norganisations. There is no such plan for Kirklees at present and this\nCouncil believes that one is required.\nAs far as the CCG is concerned , theirs is the right plan and they are GPs with power, so it must be right\nReplyDeleteThat is absolutely right that there should a proper plan in place for smooth working of the Kirklees.

In my role as\na member of West Yorkshire Combined Authority’s Green Economy Panel I have\nalready challenged the Carbon Impacts Assessment tool being developed to\nmeasure the emissions resulting from WYCAs investment decisions. I have asked\nthat the Assessment tool is comprehensive in measuring emissions. It must\nmeasure not just the impacts of the scheme itself but also emissions\nfacilitated by the investment. A good example would be investment in public\ntransport links to Leeds Bradford Airport. I would regard that as a highly\nquestionable investment by WYCA. We have also got to be wary of the use of dubious\ncarbon offsetting such as tree planting\nto mitigate carbon impacts. We don’t have enough land to robustly mitigate the\nimpacts of all negative carbon expanding projects. If schemes come before the Combined Authority\nthat clearly have a negative impact on the Carbon Budget I will simply oppose\nit.\n- Ensuring\nthose impacted most by climate breakdown and nature loss are heard and\ncentre-stage in decision-making.\nThis is a local, regional and a global issue. Climate\nbreakdown and nature loss affects people now in our own localities as\ndevelopment projects are favoured on redesignated greenbelt and greenfield\nsites. Tree loss is blighting many communities and diminishing their quality of\nlife. More areas are becoming subject to flooding due to climate change and the\npractice of building on flood plains. I would set up a process where\ncommunities could alert the West Yorkshire Mayor when their localities were\nthreatened by climate breakdown and nature loss so they could influence\ndecisions and investments to protect and enhance their environments.\nWe also need a global perspective on loss and damage and a\nmeaningful dialogue with the global south is important. I would challenge\nGovernment to ensure we are recognising loss and damage in our response to climate\nchange. I would seek dialogue with\nrepresentatives from the global south through my links with the international\norganisation ICLEI (Local Governments for Sustainability).\n- Protecting\nworkers and communities through a just transition from a fossil fuel-dependent\neconomy to a low-carbon, nature-rich, circular economy, including\ndelivering over 42,000 new jobs.\nThe groundbreaking ‘One Million Green Jobs’ proposal by the\nCampaign against Climate Change showed us how addressing the climate crisis\nwill deliver meaningful, worthwhile and rewarding jobs. There is a lot to do\nand the amount of retrofit work needed to buildings in West Yorkshire could easily\ngenerate 42,000 jobs. The opportunity is so much greater though, improving our\npublic transport and active travel networks, enhancing biodiversity in\ncommunities, tree planting, establishing nature based solutions to heavy\nrainfall events. The role of the Mayor is to ensure investment is directed to\ndeliver those jobs but also to provide the training and skills needed. There\nare things we are going to have to stop doing e.g. building new roads, widening\nroads, airport expansion so it is vital that we replace jobs from sectors that\nare incompatible with a stable climate with ones that are. There is more than\nenough to do.\n- Introducing\npolicies and measures that ensure new development is net zero carbon and\nexisting homes are brought up to high energy-standards and addressing fuel\npoverty.\nOne of the flagship policies in my bid for the West\nYorkshire Mayoralty is the Green Building Fund where I will seek to ensure that\nall public sector procured or influenced projects are built to the Passivhaus\nStandard or equivalent. I will establish a fund that will support an uplift in\nexpected capital costs by 5% to cover the expected additional costs of building\nto that standard. I have proposed such a policy on Kirklees Council for several\nyears but have met opposition from the Labour administration who have\nexaggerated the capital cost uplift by wrongly referencing the costs of one off\nprojects to seek to justify their opposition.\nI have a strong record on initiating projects to retrofit\nhomes and initiated the UKs first free insulation scheme, the award winning,\nKirklees Warm Zone in 2007. There are strong plans being developed by WYCA\nlooking at the challenge of retrofitting existing buildings. What is lacking is\na convincing offer to householders to invest in whole house solutions to reduce\ntheir emissions. I will ensure funds are available for a Green New Deal\nDemonstrator Project that will be used to show Government the value of HS2\nlevels of investment in large scale retrofit projects. It will demonstrate positive\nhealth outcomes of living in warm homes, alleviation of fuel poverty, putting\nmore money back in the pockets of the community and out of the pockets of the\nbig energy companies. I have a strong record in addressing fuel poverty in my\nprevious career as an Energy Efficiency Advice Centre Manager and as a Trustee\nof the fuel poverty charity, National Energy Action for 6 years.\n- At\nleast doubling public transport use, cycling and walking within the next\n10 years, to cut emissions and ensure everyone can breathe clean air.\nGetting people out of cars and into/onto cleaner forms of\ntransport needs a compelling offer that is cheaper and more convenient than the\ncar. The best example I have seen is in Tallinn the capital city of Estonia\nwhere public transport is free to everyone. Ideally that is what I would want\nto see in West Yorkshire but ensuring we at least have the same powers over\npublic transport that the Mayor of London has would be a great start. That\nwould require a specific ask of government and extending the powers of the West\nYorkshire Mayor. That is what I will seek. In the meantime, I would seek to\ninvest more in public transport and much less in building new roads and\nwidening roads.\nSupporting active travel is something that I would want to\nsee a huge expansion of. The West Yorkshire Carbon Pathways report indicates\nthe need to expand cycling by 8000% but at present travel for cyclists is often\ndangerous so we need to invest more in dedicated and protected cycle lanes so\nwe can expand and democratise cycling. I would also want to support the\nexpansion of e-bikes and would seek financial mechanisms to make the purchase\nand rental of e-bikes more accessible to more people. I would also want to\nsupport projects like the Queensbury tunnel to give more and safer options for\ncyclists.\nUltimately most of us are pedestrians and provision for them\nis often lacking. I would ensure that pedestrians were considered in all\nappropriate investment decisions. I was responsible for removing all signs in\nthe ward I represent with just the words ‘Public Footpath’ on them and had them\nreplaced with Public Footpath signs that say where they are going to and the\ndistance. I am enthusiastic about the Slow Ways initiative and would like West\nYorkshire to a national leader in this.\n- Powering\nthe city region with clean, renewable energy, reaping the economic and job\nopportunities that this brings.\nWe have to start planning for clean energy production by\nreducing the demand for energy through efficiency measures. This has to be at\nthe top of our plans as it gives us more choices, more cost effectively than a\nsimple predict and provide approach.\nI would want to see the return of Solar PV and other\nrenewable technologies as mass market options for the majority of householders\nduring my first term as West Yorkshire Mayor. I would establish a revolving\nloan fund enabling householders to install renewable technology in their home\nby accessing a preferential loan based on a second charge on the value of a\nproperty. This would effectively mean no upfront costs to the household and the\nloan being paid back to the fund upon sale of the property. This is based on\nthe Kirklees RE-Charge scheme I initiated in Kirklees which was the winner at\nthe British Renewable Energy awards in 2008. With the Mayor being unable to\nreintroduce a feed in tarrif this is the next best option to kick start the\nhousehold renewable sector. Beyond households I would seek to establish Mayoral\nDevelopment Areas in conjunction with local Councils to build solar farms and\nwind farms. I would also seek a relaxation on the constraints on wind\ndevelopment in local planning.\n- Greening\nthe city-region by increasing tree cover, protecting nature, and\neliminating green-space deprivation.\nI am an enthusiast for promoting tree planting and have\ninitiated a small scale tree planting project in my role as a Kirkburton Parish\nCouncillor. The 1000 fruit tree project engaged communities across the\nKirkburton Parish in planting fruit trees in their own community and was taken\nup by village associations and schools. There are great opportunities to\nintegrate tree planting programmes with wider climate education and engagement\nwith young people. Ensuring tree cover is included as an integral part of any\nurban regeneration schemes will be a stipulation and condition of Mayoral\nfunding.\nI have a proven track record of promoting tree planting\nprojects and in 2019 proposed a 150,000 tree planting project over Kirklees\nwhich unfortunately was not accepted by the Labour administration. I will\nensure that any Mayoral Development Area that may be designated is not on\nredesignated greenbelt on greenfield land. The focus will be on the\nregeneration of brownfield land.\nI am shocked that WYCA funded schemes like the widening of\nthe A629 at Edgerton in Huddersfeild is going to see 126 mature trees removed.\nSchemes such as this I would simply not support.\nI am keen that biodiversity gain is achieved for all\ndevelopments we make and that the ecological crisis we face is addressed as\nwell as the climate crisis by protecting habitats and creating new ones.\n- Becoming\na zero-waste city-region by 2030 without relying on landfill or\nincineration, to reduce pressures on nature from resource extraction and\npollution.\nIncineration is demonstrably a disincentive to a circular\neconomy and recycling. Council waste contracts are beyond the powers of the\nMayor though we can insist in any contractual arrangements we make that proper\nconsideration is given to waste minimisation, recycling and reuse of materials.\nI would seek out the very best Local Authorities on recycling and waste\nmanagement, such as Stroud District and convene a workshop of all West\nYorkshire Councils to promote best practice.\nI would ensure that the very likely conflict between\nrecycling and incineration of recyclables is highlighted and that Combined\nAuthority funds do not support the incineration of recyclables.\n- Calling\non the local government pension scheme to divest from fossil fuels, to\nstop profiting from environmental harm.\nI have been calling on Labour Councillor representatives on\nthe West Yorkshire Pension Fund Investment Panel to divest from fossil fuels\nfor many years but have met resistance. I have worked with divestment\ncampaigners and will continue to do so. Apart from the environmental reasons to\ndivest there is also the very real possibility that they could become stranded\nassets lacking any significant value. So there are good financial reasons to\ndivest from fossil fuels as well. As West Yorkshire Mayor I would give my\nwholehearted backing for the WYPF divesting fully from fossil fuel investments.\n- Opposing\nthe unsustainable growth plans for Leeds Bradford Airport and joining with\nMetro Mayors across the country to ensure regional airports keep within\ncarbon budgets.\nI watched hours of the Leeds City Council Planning Committee\nwhen sadly they decided to pass Leeds Bradford Airport Expansion Plans. I am\npleased that some Cllrs on the Leeds Planning Committee including my Green colleague\nCllr David Blackburn voted against expansion but sadly they were not in the\nmajority. I have raised the issue at Kirklees Council meetings trying in vain\nto get the Leadership of the council to come out against the proposals. As West Yorkshire Mayor I will not back any\nproposals that support Leeds Bradford Airport expansion and I am happy to try\nand make expansion of Regional Airports an issue on all Metro Mayors agendas",

In the end it went to the Town and Valley Committee at our request and was passed by all Cllrs there. I wasn't at all sure how this would go and I do wonder whether we'll have something in Labour leaflets in Newsome taking credit for this one. They do have form in this regard. Here's our press release\nCouncil steps in to help with dangerous wall\nA dangerous wall in Primrose Hill is to be repaired thanks to action by Kirklees Council.\nA high retaining wall holding back tonnes of earth on Malvern Road, Primrose Hill is badly bowed and could fall onto the pavement and road with potentially fatal results. Due to lease conditions with Kirklees the wall is the responsibility of Primrose Hill Bowling Club. Quotations for repairing the wall and making it secure ranged from £20,000 to £40,000 for a complete rebuild which was beyond the resources of the club.\nNewsome Green Party Councillor Julie Stewart-Turner took up the issue with Kirklees on behalf of the Bowling Club,\n“This is not a small project and the club simply didn’t have the funding to resource it. The club’s future as a community facility was threatened by the unexpected responsibility of repairing the wall.”\nJulie asked for the issue to be taken up by Huddersfield Town and Valley Committee.\n“It has been a real struggle to get this issue agreed with Council officers, trying to get them to appreciate the financial realities of a small community organisation like Primrose Hill Bowling Club having to find such a huge sum but I am pleased that Councillors on the Huddersfield Committee have backed us on this one”\n“Ultimately lives could be at risk here and we can’t be arguing about where responsibility lies when the consequences of not taking action could be fatal.”\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2015_06_eu-committee-of-regions-sedec-report_html/content_67.html": "What stood out for me on the agenda was the draft opinion on minimum wages across the EU. It had been raised as a issue by a Labour member and it was a fine enough paper in its own terms. One of the problems I had with the paper was that it didn't really look at low wages in the context of wider inequality and a widening gap between the rich and the poor. This is what I said,\n\"I am fully behind the sentiments of the draft opinion but I wonder whether the quickest way to help people on the lowest incomes is by introducing a maximum wage rather than just a minimum wage. Imagine how fast minimum wages would rise if the Chief Executive of a Company or Council could only be paid no more than 10 times the salary of the lowest paid worker. Addressing low pay is tackling one symptom of a culture based on inequality. If we are to have a holistic approach to poverty and inequality we need to address greed with as much vigour as we tackle need.\"\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

One of the key issues is making sure your wood is well seasoned which means as low a moisture content as possible. Ideally chopped and split logs should be left for up to 2 years.

A very tangible and visible example of that support would be to allow the Council's Town Halls, Libraries, offices and other public buildings to display posters and banners in support of the campaign to protect local health services. The Council could also allow its vehicles such as vans and even bin waggons to be used to display appropriate posters. We need to demonstrate that it is the whole community and the institutions that represent it that oppose these proposals. I will raise this idea with other Party leaders and the Chief Executive of the Council.\"\nNo, that would be unconstitutional and undemocratic - sets a dangerous precedent and some tax payers might disagree spending their taxes that way.\nReplyDeleteMight also compromise future legal issues with the NHS about the\nmoves.\nAlso, it could forcing officers to undertake work of a political nature which might compromise their contracts with the Council.\nAnd it could also put in serious jeopardy future working relationships between NHS and council staff to the detriment of residents.\nCan you tell me where this suggestion is in conflict with the Kirklees Constitution? I don't believe this is undemocratic as the views expressed in the posters would represent the settled and unanimous view of the council in a democratic vote. Who said anything about spending Council money on this? I think this proposal would not force employees to undertake work of a political nature. It is allowing them to display posters consistent with the views of the democratically elected representatives of the Council. This course of action is not one I would normally advocate but this is not a normal situation and as such I believe we need to powerfully express the views of democratically elected institutions such as the local Council.\nReplyDeleteThe Council's constitution, specifically the Officer' Code of Conduct places demands on officers that would prevent them taking sides in what is obviously a political issue. That all political parties agree about the issues makes no difference. It is undemocratic because officers would, like it or not, be forced to indicate a preference in the argument. In other words, what you're advocating, is forcing officers to comply with what you believe is the majority view. That's wrong and very naive of you. You've also ignored my other points about future relationships with the NHS. Imagine having to undertake sensitive and life-changing work between the two organisations in the future after officers had been compelled to contradict the views of the NHS during the consultation. It is also against an officer's contract above a certain grade to take part in political activities. You and others have made this issue political.\nReplyDelete",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2015_08_a-west-yorkshireleeds-city-region-mayor_html/content_768.html": "| A Mayor |\nThe principal argument against Elected Mayors is that it puts too much power in the hands of one person and that they will inevitably become remote and unaccountable. Rather than just accepting this, the Conservative Government are now pursuing the idea of an Elected Mayor with power across, not just one Council area but across a number of Councils. This would be on a similar basis to the deal that they have made recntly with Greater Manchester. The sweetner/bribe is that the regions will have greater access/control over money, currently controlled by the Government, that is spent in their regions. So we are not necessarily talking new money but perhaps a greater say over how funds are spent that were destined for the region anyway. In some ways this would be a good thing. It would stop Government misappropriating funds like they did in 2013, when nearly £200million of EU funding, allocated to Yorkshire, was sent to Scotland instead. I guess this was part of the strategy to keep Scotland as part of the United Kingdom. The problem is that instead of an illegitimate Government elected by 37% of the electorate deciding the fate of that money there will be a single person, a Mayor, somehow representing millions of people, deciding how it is spent. We have not necessarily made any progress here!\nIn West Yorkshire and the wider Leeds City Region there seems to be an almost resigned air amongst the Council Leaderships and a feeling that we must bow to the inevitable. So the West Yorkshire Combined Authority has produced a number of 'Asks' to central Government including\n- the ability raise funding through a 10 year infrastructire precept to improve public transport\n- power to levy and retain business rates,\n- devolved budgets and responsibility for major roads including motorways\n- Control of a new £500 million Housing and Regeneration Investment Fund\n- Powers to incentivise developers to bring forward strategic sites and prevent land banking; and to bring empty listed building back into use\n- Responsibility for local energy generation and efficiency\n- Responsibility for managing European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) in the same way as London.\nThese are just some examples of the 'asks' and they are generally positive ones. The problem is that having responsibility for these new budgets will also mean having responsibility for any cuts handed down by central government. It also requires a degree of trust and a belief that Government won't disproportionately cut devolved budgets particularly in areas where the Conservatives have little electoral support.\nWhat has been dismally lacking from the 'asks' from the West Yorkshire Combined Authority is anything about improving governance and accountability for the Elected Mayor, that Government want to foist on us. In London the Mayor is accountable to the Greater London Assembly which has a role in scrutinising the Mayor's decisions. With a 2/3rds majority the Assembly can amend the Mayors strategies and budgets. The Assembly is elected by the Additional Member System so the number of seats are roughly proportional to the votes cast. If we are being pushed into a less democratic Mayoral model then we need to ensure that we have a new representative body to make sure the Mayor is more accountable. It should also be elected by a system of proportional representation. If West Yorkshire Leaders are opposed to creating a new West Yorkshire Assembly or Leeds City Region Assembly then, at the very least, we need to ensure our own local Councils have an effective scrutinising and vetoing role over any Elected Mayor's budgets or plans. This should not be the preserve of Council Leaders alone or a small group of 'the great and the good'. All elected Councillors should have a role in debating and amending any potential Mayor's plans. Preferably at the same time and in the same place each year.\nReviewing our own Councils electoral arrangements is long overdue, and this should be considered at the same time that we look at establishing any new potential Mayoral arrangements. With West Yorkshire Councils having elections 3 years out of every 4, we are in a state of almost constant electoral warfare. This is not good for governance and detracts from time Councillors can give to Council work and community focussed activity. Like York, London Boroughs and many other Councils we should have 'all out' elections in West Yorkshire on a 4 year cycle and ensure that these elections do not clash with General Elections. This will help ensure that we retain a focus on local issues and concerns. In May, when we had General, Local and Parish Elections all on the same day the General Election naturally dominated political discourse. We also have the opportunity to elect Local Councillors through a system of proportional representation. If it is good enough for Scottish Councils then why not English ones as well?\nAs with all negotiations you have to be prepared to walk away and to recognise when what is on offer from the Government is simply not worth it. We do have to overcome the Conservatives desire to centralise power with a Mayoral model but we also have to democratise our own local electoral arrangements and drag them into the 21st Century.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Shamefully the UK has only got to reach 15% of total energy from renewable sources by 2020 compared with 20% across the EU. Feeble UK govt energy policies have meant for a long time that the government which promoted itself as 'the greenest government ever' were heading for failure from day one.\"\n\"The flawed argument the government has used against a mandatory EU target is that it would push up energy prices. This position lacks credibility. If you significantly invest in energy efficiency and large scale insulation measures you will achieve permanent cuts in demand, making it easier to achieve your percentage renewable energy target. This will help people reduce their energy bills and avoid fuel poverty at the same time. It is not simply just a matter of building more wind and solar farms to accommodate demand. Investment in energy efficiency gives us more choices in our energy mix and the Coalition has singularly failed to grasp this. They lack the vision, the policies and the commitment to take control of the important issues affecting the UKs Energy needs. You really have to ask yourself what the point is of the supposedly 'green' Lib Dems if this is the best we can expect from this Government\"\nENDS\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

No Labour or Conservative representatives were available but the 'Greenest Government Ever' was represented by Liberal Democrat Cllr Ann Denham and we had the treat of a UKIP representative in the form of Godfrey Bloom MEP. He's a fully paid up climate change denier and believes its all part of a conspiracy to make lots of money. I of course got stuck into him and defended his right to believe manmade climate chamge didn't exist, I also said I would defend his right to believe in Pixies if he so wished. All good fun but it was the students who really impressed me. After Godfrey told them not to accept anything they were told at face value they took him at his word and relentlessly challenged him on the rather dodgy 'evidence' he presented. Godfrey's the chap who has referred to Greenpeace as terrorists and defended the action of the French when they blew up the Rainbow Warrior killing one of the crew. He also has some rather 'traditional' some may say old fashioned views about the role of women. He had a young familiar in the audience who blamed Greenpeace for the deaths of thousands from malaria in Africa due to their opposition to the widespread use of DDT. You could spot him he was the only one in a suit. The Greenhead Students rounded on him too.\nGodfrey represents a constituency of opinion, not one of knowledge, not of logic, just opinion. There is a foaming mouth tendency among certain folk which is reflected by groups like the Taxpayers Alliance, the Daily Mail and of course UKIP. They recognise cost but not value, they would rather be wrong than be seen as 'politically correct' and they don't just deny climate change but change and reality in general. The problem is with people like Godfrey being simple folk is they give simplistic explanations of the world around them, that linked with his cut price Boris Johnson characteristics means that he can be a hit with a not too discriminating audience. This definitely wasn't the case at Greenhead College however.\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nI recognize this analysis, as he was on a panel with me in March. Not so much chance to be torn to pieces there. He enjoys the limelight! What really shocked me was that before the show, when the panellists and some students were chatting informally, he was talking about binge drinking as if it were the most natural thing in the world, something he still does. Shocking example. And the first thing he said was that he had just changed after going hunting.\nReplyDelete",

The Neighbourhood Development Plans, which we are seeking to link this too, would need a local vote to be approved so that would be another democratic element. Having said that. My issue with the localism agenda is probably the same as yours in that funds seem to being diverted from Councils and made available in a fairly unfair and unstructured ways to communities. In our proposal we hope to redress the balance and provide more support to communities where need may be great but where they may need more help to access funding. Govt commitment to localism doesn't bear a lot of examination.

But don't you always come back to the problem of lack of democratic accountability? So while the CIC might manage to continue to provide public services that would otherwise have been lost, you've still in a sense accepted and worked within the anti-democratic Localism agenda.

The problem is for many that this 'good news' is not relevant to them. Many of the people who have suffered the most are those for whom a £100 tax cut is utterly meaningless.

The justification for cutting peoples benefits was supposedly not at all ideological or a 'war on the poor' but because 'we're all in it together'. If that situation has changed and the Lib Dems can offer goodies shouldn't it be the poorest who benefit first?\nOf course the right wing media would say its 'our taxes' that pay for these benefits but that ignores the fact that many people have worked and contributed taxes thoughout their lives and that many cannot find work because of their disability or because the work simply isn't there.\nWith thousands of public sector workers around the country about to become unemployed because of government cuts it seems crazy that the Lib Dems are floating the idea of tax reductions.

A lot of thanks are due to Jacqui Sullivan for all her hard work on behalf of the Bowling Club, to Diane Sims for taking the photos & helping publicise the event, to Janet Siddall for making so many banners and of course to everyone else who helped and turned up today.

At a meeting organised by be European Green Party 5 of us came together for the first time. There are about 12 Greens in the CoR but are spread across a number of groups. 18 Greens are needed across 7 countries to enable us to form our own group so we are not quite there yet and in any case perhaps our strength lies in having influence in a number of different groups.\nMr Juncker, the President of the European Commission came to talk to us about his 300+ Billion Euro Investment Plan. He outlined some details of his plan and complained about a lack of an invite to the UK Govt for a visit so I was all lined up to ask a question but he left early before I had chance to put it. So exclusively for you here is the question I would have asked.\nQuantative easing is likely to be a significant part of the funding for the Juncker Plan. If this funding is simply thrown at financial institutions it will either be wasted or unfocused or both. Using that funding to support Green Bonds could ensure it is linked to achieving EU Carbon & Energy targets and linking with the energy security aims of the Energy Union. I would like Mr Junckers view of this suggestion.\nI would also like to take the opportunity to invite you to the UK in the absence of an invitation from the UK Govt to look at the work of Kirklees Council is doing to address fuel poverty and reduce carbon emissions often in spite of the policies of the UK Government rather than because of them.\nSo unfortunately we will never know whether Mr Juncker would have accepted my invitation to Kirklees after apparently being snubbed by the UK Govt. The question I asked is consistent with what Greens in the European Parliament have been asking for.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

There are no bridges\nstriding majestically across the Colne Valley as in the Lib Dem Amendment. There is no ‘make believe’\nbuilding where Huddersfield Library will move into as in the Conservative Amendment.\nWhat all the amendments cannot do is fix the impact that\nGovernment cuts will have on Adult Social care. We can seek to limit the impact\nof cuts. What we need from Central Government is funding for free adult social\ncare as a right in the UK. It should be a human right and the mark of a\ncivilized society in the 5th or 6th richest country in\nthe world.\nWhat our amendment does is recognise the cards we have been\ndealt with by the Lib Dem/ Conservative Coalition Government and seeks to find\nto find positive actions that we can take using the power we have.\nWe have spoken to the Administration about our proposals\nbecause if we didn’t then these amendments that we have submitted would be\nnothing more than posturing. Posturing amendments put forward with no\nexpectation of implementation. The Lib Dem and Conservative Amendments are put\nforward by parties that cower away from responsibility. These are Parties that,\nI guess want votes but don’t want to do anything with power if they are given\nit.\nGreens and Valley Independents have already put real time and\neffort into protecting our Libraries. Not though a fantasy fix. Not an attempt to hoodwink voters like the Tories\nwith a non-existent magic bullet but concrete proposals built on time and\neffort and I have tremendous respect for my colleagues who have worked so hard\nand with real commitment working towards a more secure future for our local\nlibraries.\nWe are proposing a workable alternative to food banks. So\nfood banks will be there for immediate and emergency cases but for ongoing\nsupport low income householders will be able to get food at a third the retail\nprice for a 6 month period to help them get back on their feet. Not only that\nbut they will receive a package of advice and support to help them improve\ntheir lives. This is not fantasy. This is reality. Myself and Councillor Julie\nStewart-Turner went with Cabinet Members to ‘Community Shop’ in Goldthorpe near\nBarnsley. They take surplus food that would otherwise go to landfill and use it\nto help feed households who have some very difficult choices to make on a\nlimited budget. The fact that they will be paying for it even at a discounted\nrate gives people back their dignity. It is not charity. To the Council this is\na one off cost not an ongoing one but the benefits are numerous.\nBuilding Services provide gas servicing and boiler\nreplacements to tens of thousands of Council properties. There is nothing in\nlaw that would stop them operating in the private sector. So if you or I or any\ncitizen of Kirklees wanted our boiler fixing or servicing why should we go to a\ncompany that is associated with one of the Big 6 Energy Suppliers for instance\nwhen Kirklees Council could provide that service for the same cost or better\nand use that money to support local services such as Adult Social Care. This need not be at the expense of local\nSMEs. It could well be that Kirklees Building Services works in partnership\nwith local companies to deliver services. We believe the indicated income\nfigures are probably unduly conservative and no one wants to be unduly conservative.\nThe Coalition Government has caved in to the big housebuilders\nand as a result homes built will not be ‘Zero carbon homes’ as they are\ndescribed but still cost over£1000/year to run in energy costs. Question is how\ndo we deal with that lack of ambition from the ‘Greenest Government Ever’. We\ncan set our own standards for homes built on Kirklees land that we own or as a\ncondition of sale on land we sell. That is why the we propose using the\ninternationally recognised ‘passivhaus’ standard for homes on Kirklees land\nSuch homes would have energy bills of less than £100/ year. This would only\nmean that there was less money going to energy utilities but it would also mean\nmore money going into the local economy.\nWe think there is merit in reviewing our electoral\narrangements at Kirklees. We have General Elections every 5 years, Parish\nCouncil Elections every 4 years yet Kirklees Elections 3 out of 4 years. Other\nprincipal councils elect every 4 years such as London boroughs. This Council is\nin a constant state of warfare due to the practically constant electoral cycle\noperating. That isn’t good for the governance of this Council. It needs\nreviewing. My own view is that we should aim for an election in 2018 when all\nseats are up for elections and seek to bring forward the Parish Council\nelections so we begin working on a common cycle of local elections. There is a\nfinancial saving identified here but the benefits to the Council, its\ngovernance and the people we serve goes far beyond that.\nThere are acres of Kirklees owned disused and derelict land\nand also roofspace on Kirklees owned buildings. This is a resource which can\ngenerate not only energy from solar panels we propose a partnership with both\ncompanies and communities sharing the benefits of this funding with the Council.\nThe revenue raised will help support local services.\nMoving Kirklees mileage rates to HMRC rates was something I\nwas lead to believe happened years ago and I was shocked when it hadn’t. So I\nam pleased to be able to move this amendment today.\nSo this is our amendment. We would like to do more. When we\nproposed an ‘All Party Shared Administration’ for Kirklees Cllr Palfreeman\nquoted the Fantasy author of Game of Thrones, George R R Martin. The quote he\nused was ‘Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it.’ The Fantasy here is not mine it is yours.\nClosing and relocating Huddersfield Library – somewhere? Fantasy. Another\nfamous quote from George R R Martin is ‘Winter is coming’ meaning hard times\nahead. Hard times are coming for Kirklees and for many local councils and the\npeople that we serve. The hard truth is\nfor the Tories is that if you don’t want the responsibility in these times then\ndon’t ask for the votes.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

As part of this declaration the LGA established a Climate Emergency Task and Finish group to examine the issues and make recommendations. I am one of five Councillors from around the UK on this group.\nHere's some thoughts in advance about some of the the recommendations we could make\n- establish a National Climate Taskforce including Ministry of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Ministry of Communities, Housing & Local Government and the Local Government Association representatives to drive action on climate change at the local level, addressing barriers to action and making good practice examples the mainstream\n- Councils to produce Climate Action Plans on how they can cut emissions quickly and what actions they could take with greater support from central Government.\n- Councils to lead local Climate Action Partnerships to drive deeper action on carbon emission reductions. This would draw in support from business, the wider public sector, the voluntary sector and the wider community\n- Government to give a clear steer to local Councils that they are expected to insist on higher energy efficiency standards in new buildings up to (and preferably) the Passivhaus Standard. This to be followed as swiftly as possible by strengthening of the energy efficiency standards in Building Regulations.\n- Reregulate and strengthen the Building Control function to ensure strict adherence to energy efficiency standards.\n- Councils to produce a plan (with a timetable) for a complete electrification of their vehicle fleets and to work with other large fleet operators on similar plans.\n- Revive the Home Energy Conservation Act powers of Local Government and ask for new plans to be established within a year for costed plans to improve the energy efficiency of homes in line with the emissions savings we need to achieve the Paris Climate goals within a ten year timeframe.\nLooks good. Glad you are on this group. What about those councils which have plans to expand their local airports, jointly declare a moratorium on those plans.\nReplyDeleteThose need to be robustly challenged. This is an emergency Councils can't conveniently ignore promoting one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases on the planet.\nReplyDelete",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2015_09_councillor-andrew-cooper-speech-on_html/content_743.html": "Let’s be clear. Conservative\nGovernment pressure to foist a Mayor on Leeds City Region are undemocratic.\nReferenda across the region have rejected the elected Mayor concept. Local\npeople recognised that it put too much power in the hands of one individual. In\n2001, in Kirklees, local people voted 73% to 27% against an elected Mayor. This\nwas much more decisive than the recent Scottish referendum and that was supposed\nto settle that matter for a generation.\nSo why would a Conservative\nGovernment, elected with 37% of the vote wielding 100% of the power that has\njust stuffed the unelected House of Lords with Tory lackeys, behave in such an\nundemocratic fashion? Difficult to fathom I know. The truth is that this is\nnothing to do with democracy and everything to do with centralised control.\nSo having rejected elected Mayors\non each of our Councils the Government want us to have one over even wider\nareas stretching across many Councils representing millions of people. The\nincentive for doing this is to have control over funds which are normally\nmanaged by Whitehall. Make no mistake this is not new money this is just about\nshifting control from a remote Government in London to a remote individual, an\nelected mayor covering the whole of West Yorkshire and beyond. Even despite\nthis there are some attractions to having more control. In 2013 the\nConservative /Lib Dem Government reallocated Euromoney that was destined for\nYorkshire to Scotland so one of the ‘Asks’ from Leeds City Region Leaders is to\nhave control of European funding.\nOn the subject of ‘our asks’ to\nGovernment. How many people here have actually seen them, know what they are?\nYou certainly haven’t voted or had any say on them whatsoever. So just as the\nelected Mayor proposals are undemocratic so are our negotiations on whether or\nnot we should have one.\nIn case you didn’t know here are\nsome of the headline asks:-\n- · the ability raise funding through a 10 year infrastructure precept to improve public transport\n- · power to levy and retain business rates, devolved budgets and responsibility for major roads including motorways\n- · Control of a new £500 million Housing and Regeneration Investment Fund\n- · Powers to incentivise developers to bring forward strategic sites and prevent land banking; and to bring empty listed building back into use\n- · Responsibility for local energy generation and efficiency\n- · Responsibility for managing European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) in the same way as London.\nSo say we get an elected Mayor what\ndemocratic checks and balances will there be on such a powerful position. Well\nI believe what is good enough for London should be good enough for Yorkshire.\nThey have the Greater London Assembly elected by proportional representation\nthat can voted down the Elected Mayors plans and budget by a 2/3rds majority. We\nare being pushed into a less democratic Mayoral model so we need to ensure that\nwe have a new representative body to make sure that an Elected Mayor is more\naccountable.\nIf we don’t get these ‘asks’, (that we have no say about) , will we have\nthe opportunity to vote down any elected mayor proposals in Council? I believe\nwe should have that opportunity. As with all negotiations you have to be prepared\nto walk away and to recognise when what is on offer from the Government is\nsimply not worth it. We do have to overcome the Conservatives desire to\ncentralise power with a Mayoral model but we also have to democratise our own\nlocal electoral arrangements and drag them into the 21st Century.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

As we have a ‘hung Council’ and the greatest finanacila crisis Kirklees has ever faced we all need to work together. Sitting in comfortable opposition when Councillors were elected to take responsibility should not be an option. You could argue that voting for Councillors who then shy away from the opportunity of taking power on the Council is simply a wasted vote. That is why I have outlined some of the key priorities our group would pursue in an All Party Shared Administration. If other parties lay out their priorities then we have the basis for dialogue”\nGreen Party and Valley Independent Group Priorities for a Shared All Party Administration of Kirklees Council\n- Prioritising support to the most vulnerable. Adults and childrens services is the greatest part of the budget and where we need to focus effort not just to ensure funding but to demonstrate effective budget management.\n- Ensuring local control over a proportion of limited resources. We know that there are going to be less resources available so ensuring that these are allocated according to local priorities will be key. Politicians demonstrably working with representative community organisations is key. We need to argue strongly to government that we need a fair settlement for Councils like Kirklees not one that just favours the leafier Councils in the Home Counties.\n- Protect local green space from development but where development does occur encourage the highest construction standards and prioritise developments to new householders particularly those on limited incomes\n- Establishing effective partnerships with the private sector as appropriate to help the council realise income from its property portfolio\n- Use our links with community and voluntary sector organisations to draw in funds and resources that the Council cannot access to help protect local services. Kirklees needs to establish strong and real partnerships with Community Organisations. This will needa reprioritisation of limited budgets and dedicated staff to ensure real change happens.\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",

The Greens strong local record and the work of Cllr Julie Stewart-Turner were key factors in this sucessful vote. In other surrounding wards, with a similar demographic, Labour won hands down, even taking Almondbury off the Lib Dems. The Lib Dems and prior to them the Liberal Party had held Almondbury since the early 1980s so Cllr Judith Hughes , a refugee from Greenhead Ward in Labour's selection wars, was the surprise victor. Labour fought a reasonable campaign in Newsome and fancied their chances. There were annoying and misleading graphs on their leaflets which indicated they were on target to win the election. In reality these graphs probably encouraged Green voters to come out to defend our seat at least as much as it encouraged Labour voters to support their candidate. The Tories put out a leaflet which was just aimed at spreading lies about the Green Party and at discrediting us in the eyes of local people - (Go on sue me!). The only possible purpose was to weaken our support to help the Labour Candidate it certainly didn't build any credibility for their candidate. UKIP got one of their worst results in Kirklees in Newsome going from 3rd to 4th with their candidate Ian French having put a lot of personal effort into the campaign. It is as true for UKIP as it was for the BNP to say that where there is a strong Green Party Candidate far right parties find it much more difficult to get a foothold. Where a positive alternative to the Westminister Parties already exists it is much more problematic for them to try to get a look in. I could say a lot more but that would be giving the game away and I don't want to do that!\nKirkburton was disappointing, but we knew it was always going to be a struggle. A good effort was put in by Derek Hardcastle and his team. There was a strong 2573 Green votes which is the highest number of Green voters we have ever acheived in the ward since we started targeting Kirkburton 15 years ago. The Conservatives had little really positive in policy terms to offer locally other than their national brand. We had a strong record of substantial acheivements that we detailed in our leaflets. For the Parish Elections the Tories trawled their membership from across Huddersfield to find candidates most of whom had no connection to the Kirkburton Parish. Despite this many of them got elected on the back of the Tories General Election vote. Whether this is good for local democracy is doubtful. The Kirkburton Tories literature was as dubious as ever and we made efforts to combat that.\nIf local government, local issues and concerns are not to be overshadowed by the blanket media coverage of the General Election we really need to have the elections held seperately. Kirklees Greens have proposed to have Local Elections moved to a 4 yearly cycle of 'all out' elections instead of the constant warfare of having the Council re-elected by thirds 3 years out of every 4.\n| Another election campaign another pair of walking boots destroyed |\nI say you survived for the next elections.\nReplyDeleteSo what we need to do is all get together and become a more bonded group.\nDo things together so we are all seen. And making sure people understand the green party.\nWe are not all Wind turbine crazy activists. As a group we need to show green is good, and good is better for Kirklees and parishes. Local people doing work to sustain our areas we live in. And make sure we also involve younger groups.\nI didn't know I belonged to the Green Party until I did the Vote for policies website. I came out as 75% green. Then on Politics compass my dot was right on top of the green one. If I'm honest, I didn't know that the greens had policies on anything aside from the environment, so it came as a surprise to read the policies on education, immigration and defence. However, now I have read them, I feel that I can run along quite nicely with the greens (as long as they can accept that I like my hybrid 4x4 and I'm not vegan).\nReplyDelete\"Equally there were people who vote once every five years at a General Election who found they were also inexplicably handed ballot papers asking for their local choices. For many they simply repeated their national preference on their local ballot papers.\"\nReplyDeleteTranslation: If you vote Labour or Tory you are thick!\nWasn't the local election on the same day as the general in 2010 aswell? Hardly \"inexplicable\".\nHello Anonymous. No need to be sensitive! Yes the same issue arose in 2010 as well. Not for a second am I saying that people are 'thick'. It is simply the case that people who are less concerned in local issues are voting in local elections. As such it is more likely that they will vote along national lines rather than be keyed into the local political scene. I wish you weren't anonymous it means I've got to guess!\nReplyDelete",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2021_10_west-yorkshire-pension-fund-and_html/content_28.html": "There was some welcome news from Labour Cabinet Member Paul Davis when I asked a question regarding fossil fuel divestment from West Yorkshire Pension Funds. I'd been prompted to ask the question as Calderdale and Wakefield Councils had already indicated that they would back divestment so I wondered what Kirklees were doing. A Green Party motion by our Bradford Councillors on Divestment from the West Yorkshire Pension Fund had failed only days before but that was probably more about the fact that it didn't come from the Labour Party rather than the rights and wrongs of the issue. So that just leaves Leeds to give an indication of where it stands. During the Mayoral Election campaign Labour's Tracy Brabin gave an equivocal response to divestment saying she supported it but that had to be balanced with\nTracy seems to be pushing on divestment now as a possible 'Win' coming up to COP26 but the Mayor has no direct influence over the Pension Fund but certainly has influence through Labour Councillors who sit on the Investment Panel.\nThe really irritating thing is that a Green Party motion calling for divestment from the fund was passed in 2015 by Kirklees Council. It said,\n\"Kirklees will ask our representatives on the West Yorkshire Pension Fund - Investment Advisory Panel to call on all Pension Trustees to exercise their fiduciary duty and to call for a review of WYPF fossil fuel investments in the light of climate risk posed by fossil fuel equities\".\nOver the next week or so we will see if there is any movement on this at all and WYPF does divest from fossil fuels. If it did however that could not be the end of the story because the fund also invests in AMP Capital, the Australian company that owns Leeds Bradford Airport. It has an investment with them worth £1.3 million. Leeds Bradford Airport expansion plans would if realised result in a huge increase in emissions completely demolishing any chance of West Yorkshire achieving it's zero carbon economy by 2038 target. The problem for Labour is that West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin has at best been equivocal in her stance on Leeds Bradford Airport and avoided discussing it during the Mayoral campaign. I witnessed this first hand when she refused to answer a yes/no question on Airport expansion during the recording of the BBC's Mayoral debate. It was never aired unfortunately.\nIn the Mayor's West Yorkshire Climate Action Plan there's a lot of good stuff including the statement,\n\"We will use influence as a significant investor to start the process of developing options for West Yorkshire Pension Fund divestment from fossil fuel companies and other environmentally damaging activities\".\nThe Plan then goes on to call for annual progress reports from WYPF. Given that Airport Expansion in an environmentally damaging activity will they include AMP Capital in their Annual Report? They should do.\nSo now Labour have discovered after many years a renewed interest in divestment will they extend their divestment enthusiasm to AMP Capital? Well perhaps we shouldn't expect too much on that one.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

I saw the community rally round really quickly as St Johns Church\nand Newsome Scout Hut opened their doors to residents. They got the tea and\ncoffee going and breakfast for those people who were temporarily moved from\ntheir homes. Newsome Village Store donated food for evacuated residents and the\nFire Service and Police were caring and professional helping some particularly\nvulnerable residents who lived nearby. Kirklees Emergency Planning and Building\nControl were on the scene early on dealing with their responsibilities for the\ncommunity and the building itself. The local response to the immediate crisis\nhas shown the community and local services at their very best.\nThe question is what happens next. The structure of the\nMills itself is severely compromised and as I write this it is expected that\nthe Mill Building may have to be demolished. Hopefully the iconic clock tower will remain. There have\nbeen 2 controversial Planning matters associated with the site. The private\nowners of Newsome Mills itself have been reluctant to develop on the site due\nto the costs of converting the mill which is/was a listed building. The private\nowners of the land at Hart Street near the Mills have sought to develop the\nsite on a number of occasions. The fact that the land is part of the historic\nsetting of Newsome Mills has been one of a number of reasons that local people have opposed development there. With\nthe suspected arson of the Newsome Mills site we will have to see what happens\nnext.\nFor now we need to take stock and let the investigation into\nthe blaze be carried out by the appropriate services. This has been a truly\nawful year for the people of Newsome with the Hunters Waste site going up in\nflames, the vandalism and burning of Newsome Community Bowling Club's buildings\nand now Newsome Mills itself going up in flames. If, as I expect, Newsome Mills\nturns out to be arson then all these fires will be the result of the actions of\npeople who have no regard for the local community or the people who live there.\nLet’s hope for a better 2017.",

More people in the public sector are losing their jobs, benefits are being cut for many including support for people with disabilities and while prices rise, wages for a lot of employees are frozen. As a local Councillor I can’t change government policy but I have a responsibility to help those people who are affected. Through the casework I do on behalf of local people I can see the increased difficulties people are facing but I also know about further changes to Housing and Council Tax Benefit that are in the pipeline that are going to make things even tougher. As a local councillor I see my role as making myself available to help and be an advocate for, often vulnerable people, or people who don’t understand the bureaucracy to get the support they need.\nOn a brighter note I have been able to help local people with traffic calming schemes. After many years the scheme at Hangingstone Road/Robin Hood Hill in Berry Brow has finally happened and all credit to the local people who led the campaign. Next on the list is Springwood which at the time of writing this was about to have traffic calming measures installed. I’ve never been frightened of promoting road safety schemes.\nI have assisted Newsome South Methodist Church source funding for the solar panels on their roof. As a Green Party Councillor I have got an enthusiasm for saving energy and generating it from renewable sources. One of the most important things I felt about the Church project was that it helped improve their finances for the next 25 years for a building that is a vital community resource and not only a place of worship.\nI am an active supporter of ‘Growing Newsome’ project which is a really inspiring project. Local people are getting together to grow locally produced food and help each others to grow food as well. It is lead by local people so my role is just ‘mucking in’ at events. At the Seed Swap I was helping with the discounted fruit trees where another 40 went out to local people. I ‘live the dream’ as well and spend hours at weekends digging my own allotment at Primrose Hill. There is a community allotment at Ashenhurst and if you want to get into growing food but don’t fancy taking on a whole allotment yourself then get in touch with the ‘Growing Newsome’ gang on their website at http://growingnewsome.wordpress.com/ Strongly linked to ‘Growing Newsome’ is the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust’s Stirley Farm project which is helping keep the green fields around Newsome productive. The community orchard, vegetable growing plots and now our own beef shorthorn cattle is a real success story and it is just the beginning. Our role as Green Party Councillors was to keep pushing for it to get off the ground when Kirklees seemed to be taking forever to agree to sign the site over.\nMy style as a Councillor is to collaborate and work with others to tackle problems. It is always the best way to get a result and if on occasions you can’t resolve a problem then at least people understand the obstacles we’ve been unable to overcome. One thing I was pleased to help with last year was with sourcing funds for the Young at Heart group which is a monthly singalong and get together for Newsome pensioners.\nThe biggest issue to face us is the Local Development Framework, a Council policy which allocates land for possible development. What is driving what we regard as unnecessary development is the Conservative/Lib Dem government’s policy of trying to boost the building industry. They have relaxed the requirement to build on brownfield land, relaxed planning controls and as a result have received severe criticism from organisations such as the National Trust and Campaign for the Preservation of Rural England. The Green Party opposed development on greenbelt and green field sites at the Extraordinary Council meeting in March but we were outvoted by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. This is not the end of the process yet and no greenbelt land in Newsome Ward has been allocated for development. What is of concern though is other greenfield land in our area which though not greenbelt is still highly valued. The land adjacent to New Laithe Hill and Jackroyd Lane’s future is still uncertain and we remain committed to protecting that and other Greenfield land from development. If the Labour Party do make an appearance during this election it would be worth asking them if their Leader Cllr Mehboob Khan could give an assurance that this land will not be developed.\nOne of the best things about been a Green Party Councillor is that you are free to speak your mind without having to worry about a Party Whip telling you how you can and cannot vote. It means when we speak in the Council Chamber we can speak strongly and freely about the issues that concern you. No other Party on the Council can make that claim. This also means that I can represent you and your views more effectively on the Council. I’m grateful for the support of Cllr Julie Stewart-Turner and Cllr Graham Simpson.\nI regularly write a blog which is a sort of diary of local and Kirklees issues on the Internet. If you want to read more about what I am up to on the Council it is at www.greeningkirklees.blogspot.com.\nI will try and see as many people as I can between now and the election. If you want to meet and talk through your concerns about Kirklees or local issues please give me a ring on 07721 348619 and I’ll nip round at a time convenient for you.\nPlease vote for me on Thursday 5th May and I will continue to work hard for the area.\nYours sincerely\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2018_05_kirklees-elections-2018-newsome_html/content_178.html": "I enjoyed the Newsome Campaign. There was lots of exercise delivering leaflets, we spoke to thousands of people and we had a great Candidate in our sitting Councillor Karen Allison who was defending her seat for the first time after a packed 4 year term. From an Agents point of view Karen was a dream candidate. Very active in the local community, well known and a definite 'mucker in' with lots of community activity. We had a great team of people helping us. There was the 'formal' canvassing and delivery teams but a much wider team of people from right across the communities in Newsome Ward who help us informally. There were lots of opportunities to visit cafe's and pubs following canvassing/leafleting which was pleasant and helped offset any potential benefits of hours of exercise. So my thanks to Newsome Nosh, Scar Cafe, Cafe 8, Global Diversity, The Star at Lockwood, The Grove at Springwood and Bar Maroc (Huddersfield's Premier Moroccan Theme Pub) in the Town Centre. If you've not been to any of these places please do. We liked them.They are all generally locally owned and managed and so all the better for that.\n| Polling Day Fitbit report |\nAnother tactic Labour used was to put out a last minute 'attack' leaflet the day before the election entitled 'Greens waste your money'. This leaflet referred to a project to carry out wildflower planting on Whitehead Lane and said the money would be better spent on services for vulnerable/poor children. It also commented on the fact that children in poverty in the Newsome Ward were having to be supported by voluntary organisations to pay for meals outside school term times. Our Candidate Karen was very aware of this having spent many hours helping out with the Worth Unlimited project in Lowerhouses which we guess they were referring to. This valuable work has been succesfully supported by a range of sponsors such as the Town Foundation and philanthropic local companies. You could argue that it shouldn't have to be, but it is. The wildflower project itself was much more than Labour described in their leaflet. There are links to a project helping people with mental health difficulties. The money itself could not be spent on services as it was 'one off' funding. There was also an ongoing benefit as the land itself, on a roadside verge would no longer have to be on a grass cutting programme and so would reduce ongoing revenue costs for the Council. The point of putting out an inaccurate knocking leaflet the day before the election is that it cannot easily be responded to. They knew what they were doing.\n| Some of the Newsome Green Campaign Team |\nA particular annoyance this time was the\n'trolling' of myself and Karen by a particularly obnoxious Labour Canvasser on Twitter. His general theme was that we were rubbish Councillors because there was lots of flytipping in the Newsome Ward and yes there is and yes we report it and we get involved with and organise large scale community clean ups to try to deal with it. He could equally have gone across the ward boundary into Crosland Moor and taken pictures of flytipping there and come to the conclusion that the Councillors there were rubbish as well. The only problem would be that they would be Labour Councillors and that wouldn't fit his rather twisted narrative. We were also supposedly 'in it for ourselves' and they were 'doing the Greens job for them' (I have screen grabs) I've got to say that if I was motivated by money I wouldn't have joined the Green Party and I wouldn't be involved in local politics. This guy doesn't know me, has never spoken to me and all he has his own beliefs and prejudices to 'inform' him.\nWe got reports from several people about their encounters with Labour Canvassers on the doorstep who were 'bad mouthing' us on a regular basis. All the potholes were the Greens fault as we were spending money on wild flowers not the roads (see earlier point) they also seemed pretty nonplussed on local issues on the doorstep themselves when asked about them. The problem they had was that many people had quite a positive experience with us and yes there are always going to be some people who are not our 'fans' as in any Ward in Kirklees but people across the communities of Newsome Ward generally thought we are doing a good job. Hence the result I guess.\nWe weren't short of social media opportunities to comment on the Labour Campaign in Newsome but generally resisted the temptation. A Labour Councillor's tweet about their Candidate litter picking in Rawthorpe - no comment from us. Even when the ink fell from Labour Candidate's posters in the rain did we say 'Labour Campaign fades' or 'Running for office' no we didn't.\nThere was quite a roll call of Labour Councillors (at least 7) who got involved to a greater or lesser degree in the Labour Campaign in Newsome including Councillor Mus Khan (Dalton) who seems to have been the 'brains' behind their operation, and of course Barry Sheerman MP and his team. Now they are perfectly at liberty to do so in a democracy like ours and yes we were flattered by the attention but if I was in the Labour Party I would have thought twice about putting my name to a campaign like this.\nOf course some of the characters involved in the Labour Newsome Campaign are big fans/disciples of Jeremy Corbyn and given some of his predecessors you can understand why. With any Messiah though you can't pick and choose which 'Commandments' you do and don't follow. One of his earliest lessons to the faithful was to \"treat people with respect\" and to \"Cut out the personal abuse, cut out the cyber-bullying and especially the misogynistic abuse online and let's get on with bringing real values back into politics\". I've been around in the political world for some time and I am more than happy to take on these sort of people but I don't see why my colleagues like Councillor Karen Allison should have to. So some of our team were not particularly looking forward to encountering these Labour activists at the count. I decided not to engage with them at all which seemed the most sensible thing to do (and not like me at all!)\nNow I'm not daft enough to think that the actions of these particular Labour members represent the Labour Party as a whole. There are Councillors and activists in the Labour Party who I respect and who would not behave as poorly as these people did. I like to think that the Labour Candidate has just been poorly advised about what is an acceptable way to behave by certain individuals and that perhaps she might have learned from the experience. The decisions made in Labour's Newsome campaign were made by individuals and the campaign they ran reflects their own 'values'. Principally that 'If you're not with us you're against us' or more specifically if you're not in the Labour Party you must be wrong or have suspect motivations.\nDespite all this I did enjoy the campaign. We did a lot of things differently and better than we have done before, we built on our already strong links in the community and we were better organised and we involved more people. So onward, and finally here's the sense of satisfaction you get when you decide to block a social media troll.\nVery responsible post. Understanding the Labour campaigns difficulty in attacking a highly effective Cllr and being forgiving of their mistakes and misinformation is very generous of you.\nReplyDelete(Is it really you Andrew?)\nBut the Labour poster boards fading away in the rain is something that l would have liked to see in a leaflet.\nJust so many captions, that could have been used.\nLabour hopes fading by the day\nIf Labour can’t get a poster ‘right’ what can you trust them with\netc\nYes it is me. I think I was just recognising where the real blame for the misdemeanors of the Labour campaign lay. I remember when we had a poster issue in Kirkburton and our posters were flapping due to poor adhesive. The Tory leaflet said 'Green Campaign comes unstuck' It still hurts, well not really. People saw what happened to their posters and we'd probably have come across as unpleasant if we had revelled in their misfortune. I do confess to having a few laughs about it over a beer or two however. After the trolling and the nonsense about electric vehicles I did think Karma must be doing its work.\nDelete",

Kirklees isn't in it! |\nKirklees doesn't do so badly when you look at the solar PV top ten coming in at a respectable 9th with 1 megawatt of installed microgeneration capacity. Much of this will be due to the award winning RE-Charge scheme a Green Party initiative that is now completed and ' A Shade Greener' has done some installs in Kirklees as well. There was a time when we could claim to be producing 5% of the UKs solar PV capacity but not anymore. We can now only claim to have 0.933% of the UK's microgeneration resource.\nSo what are future prospects like for Kirklees in the microgeneration league? There are plans for putting solar PV on a thousand council houses and a lot on Council buildings so this looks good doesn't it? Maybe but procurement rules, as interpreted by Kirklees, seem to be slowing things up and of course other authorities have plans as well - we're not operating in a vacuum. Now RE-Charge is over the Council has no strategy or plans to promote the take up of microgeneration in the private sector at present, but is looking to link in with the Green Deal which is over a year off . There remains uncertainty as to whether or not it will be a compelling offer anyway (see previous posts). Of course if the government imposes its cap on the feed in tariff all plans to increase take up of microgeneration could come to naught.\nFree Solar panelsare a great idea for people who can't afford the initial out lay to own their own solar panels.\nReplyDeleteThey are indeed.

Just got back from Cambridge Folk Festival and it was their 50th Anniversary bash. Its probably around the 10th time or more our family have been there. It is the usual mix of good company, food, music and beer that make it a relaxing 4 days. It's not as big as Glastonbury but still thousands of people go and research has shown that it is better for the local economy than Mr Eavis's Glastonbury making a cool £1.7million for the local economy each year for the Cambrige economy. So any lessons for Kirklees Council here on holding events to raise cash for the Council? Of course any Council can selflesssly support events for the community which may well come at a cost to the Council but have a wider benefit to the Local Economy. How much Councils could and should support such events when budgets for vital services are threatened by the Coalition Government cuts agenda is a reasonable question. In the 2013/14 Cambridge City Council budget book it quotes a net income from the Folk Festival of £237,000 from the paying punters like myself so a useful sum. To reduce the cost of the Festival the Council are looking at transferring the organisation of the Festival to a charity which they reckon will save the Council around £1 million over 5 years. Obviously there are real concerns about the transfer of jobs and pay and conditions issues for employees but the attraction for the Council in ensuring jobs remain, council budgets are healthier and the festival continues are very real.\nHuddersfield does have a Festival coming up called Huddlefest in Greenhead Park on Saturday 20th September. This is not a Council event but is using council facilities, lets hope it is a success.

Inspiral Carpets and Aswad are playing and here's a link http://huddlefest.co.uk/\nAnd here's 'The Melodic' a band I came across in one of the lesser stages at Cambridge in 'The Den'.

It is a good opportunity to meet up with other Green Party Councillors from around the country. Each one of them has their own story of how they got elected, often against the odds, and how they are imaginatively using the opportunity of being elected to make a difference. My chief responsibility as Chair of the Association of Green Councillors was organising the AGC Conference Curry. I now know that Liverpool Cllr John Coyne has no judgement regarding curry strength and that the vindaloo he recommended I eat was not in fact much milder than the average vindaloo as he suggested. Cllr Maya De Souza of Camden gave us all an explanation of where curry names were derived which was generally not in fact from the Indian Sub Continent. Councillor Tom Harris from Stafford Borough Council found he shared a fluency in German with Cllr Sarah Jennings of Liverpool. Most of my German language knowledge was unfortunately derived from ‘ Commando’ comic. So it mainly consists of ‘Donner und Blitzen’, ‘Achtung’ and ‘Englischen Schweinhunt’ though I have used ‘Eine Grosse Bier bitte’ on more than one occasion. The interest in the German language was sparked by me mentioning the new movie ‘Iron Sky’, recently launched in Berlin, which tells of Nazis who escaped to the far side of the moon in 1945 having discovered anti gravity and 70 odd years later come back to invade us. I wondered where Kirklees BNP had gone?\nIt was also good to meet up with Cllr Alan Weeks of Hampshire and his Lorella who are actively revitalising Hampshire Greens showing them the ‘ways of the force’ in fighting elections. We had a happy evening with Cllr Tom Harris drinking beer from an organic brewery based in Liverpool. Local production for local needs at its best.\nI made a number of interventions on the Conference floor. I supported the Young Greens in their quest for a seat on the Green Party National Executive and they achieved the necessary 2/3rds majority to change the constitution. I supported the Green Councillors from Brighton who had just got through their first budget but only after the Conservatives joined with Labour to reduce spending by bringing savings forward from year 2 of their budget. Much of the Conference focussed on the Coalition cuts , their impact and what we could do to minimise the damage they are doing to individuals and communities.\nAnyway here's the trailer for 'Iron Sky'\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

This follows the stark message from the Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change that we have only 11 years to bring our greenhouse gas\nemissions down to levels that will keep the global temperature rise to a\nsurvivable 1.5%. This clear warning requires action from every level of\ngovernment including the West Yorkshire Combined Authority (WYCA).\nWYCA is responsible for significant investment in\nactivities that promote economic activity, including the Leeds City Region\nLocal Growth Deal. WYCA has a strong focus on ‘Inclusive Growth’, but will the\neconomic activity we generate be both economically and environmentally\nsustainable? Can we demonstrate that all the activity that WYCA generates will\nreduce emissions? Can we demonstrate by how much? Can WYCA demonstrate how it\nwill use its leadership role to reduce emissions amongst its partners in the\nregion?\nCurrently there appears to be no rigorous assessment of\nthe impact on greenhouse gas emissions of the decisions of the Investment\nCommittee. In our opinion, given the significant funding of transport and road\nschemes by the Investment Committee, a full climate impact assessment should be\nproduced for such projects before decisions are made to proceed with them or\nnot.\nWe are, of course, aware of the valuable work being\ncarried out by the Leeds City Region Green Economy Panel; but we need to look\nat all the activity being generated by WYCA in totality to ensure it has a\npositive impact on climate emissions and one that is consistent with the COP21\nParis Climate Goals.\nYours sincerely\nCllr Andrew Cooper – Kirklees Council\nCllr Karen Allison – Kirklees Council\nCllr Sue Lee-Richards – Kirklees Council\nCllr Ann Forsaith - Leeds City Council\nCllr Anne Blackburn – Leeds City Council\nCllr David Blackburn – Leeds City Council\nCllr Kevin Warnes – Bradford City Council\nCllr Martin Love – Bradford City Council\nCllr Andy D’Agorne – York City Council\nCllr Denise Craghill – York City Council\nCllr David Taylor – York City Council\nCllr Rosie Baker – York City Council\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

I have been elected and re-elected 6 times. During that time I\nhave gained a wealth of experience as a Cabinet Member, Scrutiny Panel Chair\nand as a Leader of the Green Party Group. We have held balance of power and so\nhave managed to implement a number of Green Party policies including the UK’s\nfirst universally free insulation scheme and what is effectively a ban on\nFracking in our Local Plan.\nI have lead on the Green Party response to the West\nYorkshire Combined Authority Devolution Consultation writing, collating and\nintegrating responses from members. The response highlighted the lack of focus\non climate change, the lack of accountability of the proposed Elected Mayor and\nthe threat to local democracy posed by the Mayoral Combined Authority.

In line with the landmark Campaign against Climate\nChange report. These jobs will be in renewable energy, sustainable construction,\nretrofit of buildings, establishing new public transport and active travel\nnetworks and through promoting rich natural environments in and around our\ncommunities.\nGreen Homes\nI will campaign hard to have the ‘right to buy’ Council\nHousing suspended in West Yorkshire to protect valuable social housing and to\nhelp the business case for investment in more Council housing. This will also\nact as a check on house prices at the lower end on the market.\nI will establish a Green Building Fund that all Local\nAuthorities in West Yorkshire can access to support the development of homes\nand other buildings to the Passivhaus standard. This will reduce carbon\nemissions, energy bills and fuel poverty.\nI will establish a new retrofit fund to improve the energy\nperformance of existing homes, targeting those on the lowest incomes and\nseeking to draw in matched funding from energy companies and central government.\nTackling Climate\nChange\nOne of my first jobs in office would be to boost the\nambition of our plan to deliver a Zero Carbon Economy. This would aim to bring\nthe target date for a Zero Carbon Economy forward from 2038 to 2030 in line\nwith the recommendations of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nI will cease all new road building projects and any project\nthat supports the expansion of Leeds/Bradford Airport.\nI will work with green industries on a plan to boost our\nrenewable energy generation capacity across all appropriate technologies and\nseeking to support community owned and managed renewable energy projects.\nA Green Team for West\nYorkshire\nIf elected as Green Party nominee for West Yorkshire Mayor I\nwill invite the second placed Candidate to be the named Deputy mayoral\ncandidate.

It feels like responsibility for the RAF in 1940 has been handed over to Hermann Goering\nEnergy efficiency and renewable energy companies are shutting down and going into administration all over the country. Mark Group, established in the 70s has gone into adminstration and Climate Energy as well. My previous employer till January this year, Tadea, has folded. KNW, the company that installed my 'Technitherm' insulation has closed down. Southern Solar, that was lead by solar entrepreneur Howard Johns has gone under. This is by no means an incomplete list and is the tip of the iceberg as companies hanging on by their fingertips, make redundancies and scale back operations. These weren't fly by night companies. They had won awards for innovative projects, improved the energy performance of hundreds of thousands of homes and reduced fuel poverty. Behind all these company closures are individual human stories of people who have dedicated a good portion of their lives to combatting climate change. Under the Coalition Government times were very difficult for the sustainable energy industry with feeble leadership from the Lib Dems in DECC. Now, with the outright hostility to the renewables and energy efficiency sector, the Lib Dem collaborators make a virtue out of their poor leadership on Climate Change in the Coalition Cabinet.\nSo next month the Paris Climate talks seeking a global deal on emissions will be in full flow. Someone, from the shameful UK Government will attend. Will it be 'hug a husky' \"Greenest Government Ever\" Dave Cameron? He might show his face but should face tough questions given the decimation of the sustainable energy sector so may decide to stay away. What about the Chancellor George Osbourne, the architect of the destruction of green industry. It would be surprising if George turned up. It would be like Goering booking his own ticket to Nuremberg. He's never even pretended to show an interest in addressing climate change and if he isn't a climate change denier his actions would easily brand him as one. We are most likely to get the once Aristocracy Advisor on 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' and now DECC Minister, Amber Rudd. She demonstrates by merely occupying the role of a DECC Minister how unimportant the Government view the issue of climate change.\nThe UK Governments pig-headed pursuit of programmes and policies that put our planet and people in peril are profoundly perplexing.(My entry for alliteration sentence of the year!). They are dangerous and irresponsible. What do we do? When a Government is elected on a dodgy mandate of 37% of electors, via an archaic electoral system, they are on very uncertain ground, particularly when ideologically driven policies fly in the face of reason. The Conservatives are certainly at fault but acceptance of their legitimacy is a large part of the problem. Labour's continuing opposition to electoral reform is effectively an acceptance of the system that is a large part of the problem. Another 'one last push' approach by Labour to their own version of an illegitimate Government does not provide the change we need. What is needed is the type of mobilisation we had for the 'Battle of Britain' to address Climate Change and the same to update our broken Democracy. It is needed urgently. It is needed now.\nThe Tories only got their 'mandate' from fewer than 25% of electors; they got 37% of those electors who voted.\nReplyDelete",

They gave them 9 years to complete the build instead of 3 which means if building regulations impose higher energy efficiency standards in the next few years they'll still be covered by the 2011 laws. In any case Tesco backtracked on earlier commitments to build a high environmental spec store. The plan was approved with no signed commitment on social housing or using local apprenticeships or ensuring the existing Tesco site doesn't remain in use. Traffic will increase almost seven fold at the end of the Leeds Road Air Quality Management Area. The Retail Capacity Study which was conducted as part of the application indicated a 1.8% drop in trade in Huddersfield as a result of the Tesco development. It doesn't sound much but nor is it necessarily believable. The Tesco store being built has capacity for a large mezzanine which could expand it to be one of its largest stores in the country.\nSome of the comments by the Councillors on the committee were disappointing. There was the Councillor who remarked at all the shabby empty buildings around the area and how Tesco would improve this. All the properties have been bought up by Tesco so of course they are empty and shabby. Then of course there were the 'you can't stop progress' comments as if this represents any measure of progress for the town. The store isn't needed, we have plenty of supermarkets, it will destroy jobs as well as create them and have a detrimental impact on our local environment. I'm trying to work out whether it was the Kirklees Budget meeting or the Kirklees Planning meeting that I found must disturbing this week. One thing you could definitely sense at the meeting was the total lack of enthusiasm for the application from Kirklees Council officers and the row of Tesco officials almost rubbing their hands in glee as the Planning Committee rolled over for them to have their collective tummies tickled (with the honorable exception of Clr Christine Iredale). There was a bit of gentle growling about 'conditions' and such like but Tesco know they won't get bitten.\nHere's the relevant article in The Examiner\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Well if they did they were right in many instances. The obsession with European Union membership, climate change denial, despite no real scientific backing, moral outrage at gay marriage and a belief that all wind turbines are the spawn of Satan are all characteristics of the 'swivel eyed'. Some of these characters seem to be in a permanent state of anger about the wrong things. They are usually so opposed to what they regard as 'political correctness' that they make a virtue of being politically wrong on most issues. Throw into this mix the rise of UKIP (where being swivel eyed is a condition of membership) and you have a potent mix of rabid Tory activists, posh Tory grandees born to rule and a Party which welcomes the deluded with open arms. They can go to UKIP Conferences and presumably be as offensive as they like without anyone raising an eyebrow so long as they're a bit discreet about it. Quite a few of their new Councillors have recently failed the discretion test and are now being taken to task in the media.\nThere's probably about 3 or 4 potential Tory Councillors in Kirklees who I could see jumping on the UKIP bandwagon on the basis of their 'swivel eyed ness'. In many ways these defectors would probably save the local Tory leadership a lot of hassle. More significant for the Tories would be the defection of people who feel overlooked by the grandees, who see others, who they regard as having less ability being promoted over them - a couple of characters in the Lords who have somehow achieved ministerial rank immediately spring to mind. Even more damaging still would be the loss of the saner grassroots Tories who may just feel that Central Office has just lost the plot.\nWhat I find most bewildering about the 'swivel eyed' is the perception that the Tory led government has somehow been held back by the Liberal Democrats. A mouse hanging onto the tail of a charging bull would have more effect at slowing down this right wing government than any number of Liberal Democrat MPs. Now hopefully their own internecine warfare will slow them up, but more likely they'll accelerate to prove how truly mad they are to satisfy certain sections of their rank and file.\nThis is not the end of this Tory story.

When national governments struggle\nto deliver, cities and regions take the lead.\n· Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement, we\nhave seen a rising status for local and regional governments. This was evident\nlast year in Bonn with the launch of the Talanoa Dialogue and the Bonn Fiji\ncommitment of Local and Regional leaders' from around the world. It's\nnow time this form of multilevel governance is acknowledged and the role of LRAs\nformalised in global climate governance.\n· Nationally Determined Contributions fall short\nin reaching Paris Agreement goals, of limiting global temperature increases to\nwell below 2 degrees, let alone 1,5 degrees. In\norder to bridge the emissions gap, we need a system of locally and regionally\ndetermined contributions (LDCs) that would complement \"Nationally\nDetermined Contributions.\n·\nA wealth of action to mitigate climate change\nhappens at the local level and we know that action that is not measured is not\nacknowledged nor encouraged or valued. Yet, these local actions can be the most\nimportant actions of all. Making the difference between success and failure. That's\nwhy we call for the transparency framework to include, in national inventory reports\na dedicated section on mitigation actions undertaken at subnational levels of\ngovernment as a way to help track the progress towards achieving NDCs.\n· The Talanoa dialogue is of great importance for\nlocal and regional authorities as it allows them to make their ambitions,\npositions and intentions heard. It is also of vital importance to the UNFCCC\nand national Governments as the feedback we provide from the coalface of action\non climate change will help them shape future policy initiatives. A dialogue\nis not a monologue. We need genuine 2 way communications. Yes we need to be\nheard but we also need to be responded to as well. We\nneed to integrate the outcomes of the Talanoa Dialogue into the COP negotiating\ntext. And it must also continue beyond COP24.\nMembers,\nCooperation\nand inclusivity are part of the solution to address climate challenges. It is\nessential that the EU and its Member States engage directly with democratically\nelected regions and other non-party stakeholders, civil society and the private\nsector. And it\nis crucial that we speak with a strong single voice at COP24. As elected members at the closest level to the\ncitizens we are ready to partner with you and contribute to make the world a\nbetter place.\nAs a UK member of the Committee of the Regions\nI am clear that Brexit or (I still hope) no Brexit we should continue to work\ntogether to achieve the carbon reductions we need and to be frank this may help\nthe UK Government to not slip further behind in our actions. If the UK is in a\nLeague of its own it will have no meaningful way of comparing its progress.

Along the way we will be highlighting the dangers of Fracking to local communities and the global environment. We will also be talking about the alternatives to Fracking such as energy efficiency programmes for existing and new homes, renewable energy for communities and also at scale.\nIt is a tough walk but we're hoping to meet lots of people along the way raise the profile of community campaigns against Fracking and the importance of electing politicians who will consistently oppose Fracking in Yorkshire, Lancashire and everywhere beyond.\nSymbolically we'll be carrying some soil from near the fracking site in Kirby Misperton to Preston New Rd. As soil from Yorkshire is deposited at the fracking site in Lancashire we'll emphasise that the assault on the environment at one site is an assault on us all and that the aims of the protectors in Lancashire are shared by Yorkshire Anti Fracking activists and thousands of campaigners across the world.\nThere will be daily video diaries of our march (in March) across the North of England and evening meetings at each point along the way. It is undoubtedly a challenge and one I approach with a certain amount of trepidation as a 52 year old man who could do with losing a bit more than a pound or two! I've always felt that if things are hard to achieve they will have more meaning if you actually achieve them and so it is with this particular challenge.

Growing Newsome!\nGrowing Newsome is very literally a grassroots organisation, or maybe more appropriately a root vegetable organisation because they aim to grow quite a lot of them this year. They are an offshoot of Newsome Ward Community Forum and over the last year they have done stacks of useful stuff including seed swapping, establishing community allotments on Occupation Road and at the Ashenhurst Allotment site, providing timely advice about planting and mutual support. Yesterday was taking on the bramble patch that time forgot in a back garden. The deal was that we help a householder bring her garden under control and use the land for growing vegetables for the community. When I arrived there were about 20 or so students from Leeds being informed about the work of Growing Newsome by Diane Sims, one of the Growing Newsome Gurus. Pretty soon some of them were helping local volunteers and getting stuck in with secateurs(spell check that one some time). Soon we were uncovering Mayan ruins and lost japaneses soldiers, actually the odd tennis ball and a kids croquet set. There is more to come on the local food front with our first tranche of the 1000 fruit tree project about to come to fruition (the puns are flowing well today!).\nSo what are the big lessons so far from this for the Council. The Council talks a lot about the need for community cohesion and rightly so, even if 'community cohesion' is not a very engaging phrase. Growing Newsome is a real catalyst for greater community cohesion. It empowers people, brings them together on positive local projects, improves the local environment, provides food for the wider community, reduces carbon emissions, reduces food miles, combats the impact of peak oil, reduces reliance on supermarkets and makes you feel really darn good and positive! Lets face it having gone through the Council's latest budget process I need a bit of positive. Lessons for Green Party Councillors? Well I think I can say we have succeeded in putting sustainable energy high up on the Council agenda, local food and supporting community projects like Growing Newsome is already our new focus. The local food agenda will literally grow and grow (puntastic!)\nFor more details of 'Growing Newsome' check out their website at:-\nhttp://growingnewsome.wordpress.com/\nSaturday, 20 February 2010\nKirklees Budget Amendments - Good, Bad and Bogus\nSo all can now be revealed.

We will go the budget meeting next Wednesday with a Labour budget based on the financial constraints forced on us by this Government following their mismanangement of the economy. There are 3 amendments, the Conservatives, the Green Party's and the the Lib Dems. We have gained some things out of the budget process. In our amendment we have the extension of the free insulation scheme Kirklees Warm Zone for another 3 years. I tried to get them to rebrand it 'Green Zone' to avoid confusion with the Governments 'Warm Zone' scheme but also to annoy the Lib Dems (see previous posts!). Of course they weren't having it but the issue of confusion between the 2 schemes is genuine and will have to be addressed at some point soon. Not least because 'Warm Zone' is a brand that we have to pay for. There are also opportunities to bring new measures to the scheme free draughtproofing for vulnerable households, electricity saving measures such as Real Time Displays and Powerdown and deliver them on an area by area basis.\nOther things we acheived were in the 'side agreement'.\nWe have a commitment to continue to support the core funding costs of 'Build' the body which provides training in skills for the building trade for brickies, plumbers and decorators until these are picked up thorugh supportive contracts such as Building Schools for the Future further down the line. This is exactly the sort of project we should be supporting at these times.\nWe also have a commitment to develop support for projects promoting local food producers in the area. This has been a strong theme for Julie Stewart-Turner our first Green Party Mayor during her year in civic office.\nThere is a commitment to come up with proposals for a free bus link from Huddersfield Town to the Galpharm Stadium possibly electrically powered. This would provide a link to all the sports and leisure facilities in the area and reduce the need for car travel at a venue which isn't directly served by Public Transport and where the car parks are often full at peak times.\nOur big hope is that we will be able to establish a free solar panel scheme for private householders with the capital costs for the Council being met by the new Clean Energy Cashback being introduced this April. We are due a report in June on whether or not it is a goer. The Lib Dems don't like the idea of this scheme and didn't believe it was much worth pursuing. No doubt if we make it work it will be appearing in a Lib Dem leaflet as one of their initiatives. Bitter? Moi? You bet I am!\nWe have already established the principal of self funding capital for solar projects with the £5million agreed for solar panels for council buildings last year. Providing free solar panels at no net cost to the Council for private householders is more difficult but I don't think impossible.\nSo what of the Lib Dems Budget amendment? Well surprise surprise we have £2 million to upgrade the insulation of Council Tenants. But I hear you say 'Didn't they claim they had already acheived this in that scurrilous leaflet they posted in Almondbury in December?' (see December post 'Dem Fibs from the Lib Dems') Well yes they did. So they lied, it's what they do. More energy stuff from them £300k for Solar PV for community buildings, some additional monies linked to the boiler scrappage scheme and an energy advice project for the elderly. All good but there is nothing else! If you didn't know better you would think they were desperately trying to win back lost ground on the energy agenda. No matter, if that's the case then the Green Party has acheived more in this budget than simply getting our own initiatives passed we've pushed the other parties on or agenda and got gains for local people.\nThe Conservatives submitted an amendment it means their Council Tax is a 1% increase instead of a 2% increase. To do that they have further decimated jobs, services and cancelled anti recession measures, but they have the cynical 'We're cheaper' headline for their leaflets.\nI'm definitely getting grumpier as I get older.\nLabels:\nConservatives,\nEnergy,\nInsulation,\nKirklees,\nLib Dems,\nLocal Food,\nrenewables,\nsolar\nMonday, 15 February 2010\nKirklees Budget thoughts\nThis is the 10th Kirklees Budget where I have written, with my colleagues, the Green Party budget amendment. Of course this budget is the first one under the gloomy laden background of public spending constraints with job losses inevitable and sure to grow in the next year. The Conservatives are apparently going to have a 'pretend budget amendment'. They are going to undoubtedly play the lower Council Tax card. Irresponsible? Yes! Will it result in reduced services and job losses? Almost certainly. Would they do it if they actually ran the Council? I honestly don't know. Is it designed to get lots of lovely votes by conning people into believing they are fiscally responsible? You bet your ass it is!\nSo what real room for manouvere is there really in the budget? With inflation , increased costs and so many ringfenced services a standstill budget is effectively a cut which most people don't appreciate. So how far can it go up (and down) At the top end not much. Try going above 2.5% and save some jobs and services and government will cap you. Try a standstill budget or even a cut and you're cutting services or increasing costs to pass onto somtimes vulnerable households.\nSo what can you do with budget amendment? Find things to support that don't cost a lot but have a big impact or pick your supporting funding sources imaginatively? This year is harder than any I have seen but in the Green Amendment we will have helped save some jobs, help people into employment, reduced energy costs and of course improve the environment. Not as ambitious as I would like but there you go.\nSunday, 14 February 2010\nUniversity debate kicks off campaign\nFriday, (shortly before the Red Bull kicked in) I was at the University of Huddersfield Students Union for a Question Time session where also on the panel we had Barry Sheerman MP, Jason McCartney the Conservative Candidate for the Colne Valley and dropping in towards the end James Blanchard from the Liberal Democrats. The NUS National President was there doing a very competent job of articulating the concerns of students over their finances, tuition fees and future prospects. The disappointment was the low turnout (hopefully not indicative of the election itself!)\nIt was an early indication of what is to come during the election campaign but it would appear that the international financial crisis has little to do with governments according to Barry Sheerman and that we are coming out of recession according to the very late James Blanchard. I beg to differ.\nIt was an early indication of what is to come during the election campaign but it would appear that the international financial crisis has little to do with governments according to Barry Sheerman and that we are coming out of recession according to the very late James Blanchard. I beg to differ.\nFriday, 12 February 2010\nAnd the Award goes to........\nThe 2nd Yorkshire and Humber Microgeneration Awards were held last night and I am I confess feeling a little delicate at the moment and contemplating drinking my first ever can of 'Red Bull' to see if it really does give you a boost!\nIt was a good night (obviously!) but particularly for Kirklees. The RE-Charge scheme, a Green Party Initiative, won the Best Policy Category for enabling householders to install renewable energy with no upfront costs. Hillside Primary School in Newsome won the Best School Category for producing 55% of its own energy from onsite renewable sources. Green Councillors have been closely involved with the struggle to get the school built to the high standards the teachers, staff and community wanted. Paul Hudson was presenting the evening and it looks like he may well be doing the official opening of Hillside School later in the year.\nThe event itself at the Royal York Hotel gave a real boost of confidence to the Microgeneration Sector in the region with 170 people there. Noticeably absent were the Regional Development Agency Yorkshire Forward who still 'don't get' microgeneration or its potential to create worthwhile jobs, reduce carbon and fuel costs and to change society. I really believe having talked to council tenants who have had solar panels that microgeneration can fundamentally change the way people regard themselves. No longer are they simply passive consumers of energy but they are generators and producers of their own heat and power. If we create the conditions for hundreds of thousands of householders to use renewable energy in their home then we will truly be creating an 'Energy Generating Democracy'.\nThis Red Bull stuff works!\nMonday, 1 February 2010\nCarry on Cabinet!\nAs it looked like an interesting Cabinet meeting I decided to go along. The decision to provide Council land for Yorkshire Housing to build 35 houses in the Newsome Ward came up. The standard of build for these properties was Code for Sustainable Homes Level 3. A high standard but the minimum for new social housing developments and would not necessarily incorporate renewable energy such as solar photovoltaic panels. I had suggested when consulted as the local councillor that we might be able to have solar panels installed on the properties at no net cost by using the new Clean Energy Cashback to finance the capital costs. Officers chose to ignore this advice and it wasn't included in the report. Another good reason to attend the meeting.\nCoincidentally today was the day that tariff rates were announced by the government and it looks increasingly likely that my suggestion would be possible. But it didn't stop there Councillor Shabir Pandor the Cabinet Member responsible for Housing was very, and repeatedly, insistent that it wouldn't be legal for a 'commercial' body like a Housing Association to take advantage of the tariff. Fortunately the Council Leader Cllr Mehboob Khan decided to take my advice and check it out and involve me in the decision for which I am most grateful. I've now sent them both the relevant section of the Government policy document that shows that Registered Social Landlords can indeed use the new 'feed in tariff'.\nLast year the Green Party persuaded the Council to identify £5 million in the Councils Capital Plan for solar photovoltaic panels on the basis that the capital borrowing would be paid by the revenue costs of the panels. This looks like it will now happen and even more council buildings will have solar, our energy costs and carbon emissions will also be reduced. Exciting times indeed!\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",

Since then some services have been resumed in some areas, including Newsome in recent years on Boxing Day”\n“I really enjoy doing the bus service each year and it is now very much part of my holiday routine. At this time of year there can be limited public transport services, trains from Berry Brow are often cancelled and taxi journeys can be expensive so people who use the minibus we operate really do value it. We put timetables on bus stops and in local shops so people are aware of our schedule. The service is free to use but donations towards fuel costs are always welcome.

This creates havoc for people trying to park and ambulances that need access to the homes. The grassed areas outside the properties just get churned up and driven over so they don't really add anything positive to the area. The problem has been going on for years and has been a tough problem to crack. Newsome Councillors have used a combination of Kirklees Neighbourhood Housing Environment funds and Area committee pots spread over two years to finally resolve this issue. Its been a hard job getting the money together for this and all credit to my colleague Councillor Julie Stewart-Turner who keeps on top of our locally held or controlled budgets. We are having to be very creative at the moment to get things to happen in a time when public money is tight but it is good to see improvements like these going in.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

They obviously recognised my cultured demeanor, sporty physique and failed to notice my lack of air miles. The work covered has been very varied covering everything from the Olympics, to Library Policy to facilities for disabled tourists in our towns and cities. I have participated in all meetings of the Board and will only miss the last one for this cycle due to being on the interview panel for our new Chief Executive as our last one has been moved to Doncaster. I attended and chaired a Seminar session at the LGA’s Culture Tourism and Sport Conference in Newcastle earlier this year and was very impressed with their new library facilities (and not just the impressive solar water heating facility and display. Though it must be said I did ask more questions about it than about the books or the PCs or anything else at all really!).\nIt has been hugely valuable to come from a smaller Political Party and to have an input into policy formulation at a national level. The delivery of most government policy happens at the local level so the role of the LGA is vital to ensure national government gets an informed ‘reality check’ on policy implementation. As an example Government has proposed reducing administration cost for the National Lottery which on the face of it does appear to be a good idea. However the unintended consequence of this may be to reduce the likelihood of lottery outlets in rural locations (such as is being threatened at Grange Moor) and thereby further reducing the viability of local shops. This was a point I made during the Board meetings which will be fed into LGAs communications with national government.\nThe Tourism Working Group which I have attended had an item on the agenda regarding ‘Open Britain’ a new guide available on the web for the disabled traveller with information on where to stay, how to get there and what to do when you get there. With about 11 million disabled people in the UK this could be a very valuable resource. Promotional stickers will be available for establishments that are easily accessible for wheelchair users and people with a range of disabilities. It occured to me that certain campaign groups might establish a ‘Closed Britain’ sticker for particularly inaccessible venues!\nThere has been discussion about the loss of analogue radio for established stations by 2015. There was general agreement that the move to digital was a good idea but concern over the higher energy use associated with the new digital boxes and the impact of millions of analogue radios being effectively useless and being presented to Councils for recycling. It is estimated that there will be around 100 million such radio sets. Shropshire District Council has called on the government to review the decision to use the 2015 date and to address the financial hardship of poorer households who will have to replace their radio sets and the impact of dealing with the disposal of millions of radio sets.\nDCMS has conducted a ‘Libraries Modernisation Review’ which LGA has input to. This focussed on Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council where DCMS conducted an inquiry into their proposals to cut 11 or 12 of their current libraries to see if it is consistent with their statutory duty to provide a comprehensive and efficient library service. I did not get the impression that they will be intervening much into any Councils proposals to close libraries. Much of the justification for closures is about the move to mixed use buildings not simply libraries and the increasing use of the internet to access information and entertainment. This does not bode well in the current climate and if Councils decide to go down the line of significant cuts in the Library service to achieve savings then there appears to be very little central government will do in terms of intervention.\nSo to prove I have some cultural leanings and for your entertainment here's Buffy Saint Marie who is 70, a native american and first woman to breastfeed on Sesame Street singing about environmental destruction. It doesn't get any more 'right on' than this. It was a toss up between this and Holiday in Cambodia by the Dead Kennedys.\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nnice to know you, and glad to find such a good artical!.................................................................\nReplyDelete",

Huddersfield Town Centre is built on a slope. From St Patricks Catholic Centre down Westgate to the Beast Market you are walking down hill. If you go shopping at theKingsgate Centre and are getting the bus home then its a long way uphill especially if you have mobility problems or are getting on a bit. For these people the Free Town Bus Service is a godsend. Ultimately this is down to Government spending cuts and cutting the budget deficit. Of course politics is about choices so lowering the upper tax threshold to incomes over £100k? No. A Robin Hood Tax on financial transactions? No. Tougher action on banks and bankers bonuses? No. Cutting bus services? Yes!\nThen of course there are the environmental implications of a diminished public transport sector but then this is \"the Greenest Government ever\".\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2010/content_318.html": "Seeing a Lib Dem motion to Kirklees congratulating the Coalition Govt on it's commitment to tackling climate change was somewhat annoying having seen cut after cut in energy programmes and broken promises associated with the new feed in tariff. So the Green Party Amendment listed many of these and annoyed the Lib Dems because of the length of the amendment but then there were a lot of cuts and broken promises. They also claimed the amendment was inaccurate but never really identified exactly what was inaccurate about it. There was an inaccuracy in the amendment. It said that funding for the Green Investment Bank had been scaled down from £6Billion to £2 Billion. Following the Spending Review yesterday this figure went down to £1Billion. Our apologies!\nThe focus of the Lib Dem motion was the new right for Councils to sell renewable electricity they generate back to the grid and this is indeed welcome but there are a few 'howevers'. One particular 'however' is the fact that a promise to extend the Feed In Tariff to early adopters of renewable technologies such as pioneers like Kirklees has now been dropped by the Coalition government. This means that thousands of pounds worth of funds that could have come to Kirklees now will not. The Lib Dems called for a Green Energy Action Plan to take advantage of the Feed In Tariffs. At no point in the debate did they mention the programmes already being planned such as the £650k worth of PV for Council Buildings or the £12 million for Council buildings, probably because they've had nothing to do with it. You can imagine however that a few months down the line a Lib Dem leaflet will appear somehow linking themselves with these developments. They do have some form in this regard. They poured scorn on the Green Party amendments for a free area based solar photovoltaic programme across Kirklees saying it was 'unaffordable' and a 'fantasy'. They are clearly not following developments in the capital financing of PV projects across the country where all the capital costs and more of the projects are being met by the feed in tariff. Indeed businesses are being set up seemingly weekly offering free PV. A Council led scheme could offer value for money and spread the benefit to households beyond those which are dead on due south with large roofs.\nAnyway for your delectation here is the Lib Dem Motion and the Green Amendment. For the record the Green amendment was defeated by the Cons and Lib Dems but was supported by many Labour Cllrs. The Lib Dem motion was passed.\nLib Dem motion\nCoalition Government's Commitment to Tackling Climate Change\nThis Council congratulates the Coalition Government for their positive commitment to tackling climate change.\nCouncil welcomes the decision by the Climate Change Secretary Chris Huhne to allow local councils to sell renewable energy to the grid, overturning a ban on this activity by the previous Government.\nCouncil recognises that we have a vital role to play in the switch to a new low carbon economy. This decision will allow us to take full advantage of the feed-in tariff and deliver long term benefits to support services delivered by this council.\nThe availability of feed in tariffs will provide this council with an opportunity to generate a significant income and reduce our energy bills via increased micro generation.\nThis Council therefore calls upon the Cabinet to urgently develop a “Green Energy Action Plan” to maximise the benefits and identify potential savings that can be delivered via the use of feed-in tariffs.\nGreen Party Amendment\nDelete all after ‘This Council’ insert\n‘questions the Coalition Government’s commitment to tackling climate change based on:-\n• the breaking of a promise by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats prior to the election to include early adopters of solar panels such as Kirklees in the Feed In Tariff\n• the abolition of the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Spatial Strategy which would have provided strong policies to encourage microgeneration in new buildings.\n• the breaking of a commitment by the Liberal Democrats not to support new nuclear power stations the cost of which will now be borne by the public.\n• the end of a commitment by the previous government to insulate all lofts and cavity walls where technically possible to 2020.\n• the abolition of the Sustainable Development Commission which actually saved the Government money.\n• Cuts of £12.6m from The Carbon Trust's grant for low carbon technology and business support funding from DECC\n• Cuts of £4.7m by cancelling final rounds of Bio-Energy Capital Grants Scheme and Bio-Energy Infrastructure Scheme\n• Cuts of £3m by reducing the scope of the Offshore Wind Capital Grants Scheme\n• Cuts of £3m from closing the Low Carbon Buildings Programme early\n• £2.9m cuts by reducing the scope of the government's Low Carbon Technology Programme\n• £1m cut to funding for development of deep geothermal energy generation\n• £700,000 cut by the closing of renewable technology trials early\n• The damage caused to the solar thermal, biomass and heat pump industry by the long period of speculation over the future of the Renewable Heat Incentive\n• The damage caused to the solar PV and small wind industry by long speculation over the future of the Feed In Tariff\n• The reported reduction in the Feed In Tariff by 10%\n• The halving in funding for Carbon Capture and Storage Projects\n• The reduction in funding from the proposed £6Billion to £2 Billion for the Green Investment Bank\n• The proposed abolition of the Warm Front scheme for Low Income households\n• The 10% increase in funding for nuclear decommissioning\n• The cancelling of the Severn Barrage which could have provided 5% of the UK's electricity needs\nThis Council has the following concerns about the Coalition Government’s ‘Green Deal’\n• An over emphasis on supermarkets as the deliverer of the Green Deal when clearly Council schemes such as the free insulation provided by Kirklees Council demonstrably deliver high numbers of measures while schemes lead by supermarkets have performed poorly.\n• The reported omission of microgeneration from the Green Deal finance package\n• A loan mechanism will not be the most cost effective way of funding low cost measures such as loft and cavity wall insulation.\nThis Council calls on the Coalition Government to ensure the Green Deal\n• makes Councils a key partner and/or deliverer of the programme.\n• enables area based approaches for the delivery of insulation and microgeneration measures\n• has a cost effective way of delivering low cost measures such as insulation measures\nThis Council calls on the Cabinet to\n• develop a free area based solar photovoltaic programme to be made available to all households where technically possible and where there is no impact on Council budgets.\n• Add carbon reduction as a 5th Council Priority\n• Develop a comprehensive action plan to reduce carbon which based including energy conservation, energy efficiency, behavioral change and green energy.",

The Conservatives were fully aware of the feed in tariff before the election and Greg Barker was very much signed up to it. I know I was involved in the campaign to get the FIT in place.

New Leaders perhaps, new people on Cabinets and or Committees and also the role of the Civic (as opposed to elected) Mayors. Now most Greens I know never went into politics thinking of wearing the chains of office, the bling, the robes, the ceremony, the function after function hectic schedule for a whole year but most people regard it as a valuable and unique experience giving an insight into the vast amount of work carried out by volunteers in the community. Then of course there is the fundraising for the Mayors Charity.\nOur very own Cllr Julie Stewart-Turner was an enthusiastic and memorable first Green Mayor of Kirklees. Where Julie and others trail blazed we now have a clutch of Green Party people taking up the Civic role this year. This reflects the growing presence and longevity of Greens in Local Government. Headlining most, and virally on social media, is Sheffield's Cllr Magid Magid, a young muslim from Somalia who came here as a refugee and most importantly is a really nice guy. It's been a turbulent and punishing few years for Sheffield Greens but this month they have notched up 1 hold with Alison Teal and 2 new Green Councillors making a new high of 6 Greens on Sheffield City Council. I've already had a request\n| Magid with Sheffield Green Cllrs |\nAlso in Yorkshire we have our own long standing Councillor Dilys Cluer who is Deputy Mayor of Scarborough who I've worked closely with recently in Scarborough election campaigns. I doubt she thought much about civic office in her years of campaigning but next year she will no doubt step up to the top job.\nIn the rest of the country, outside 'Gods Own' , there are quite a number of others. Cllr Cleo Lake will be the Lord Mayor of Bristol. Cllr Susan Murray will be the Mayor of Lewes. Cllr Alex Phillips Deputy Mayor of Brighton City Council. Cllr Martin Schmeirer in Norwich. Elfreide Brambly-Crawshaw, Mayor of Beccles, In Oxford Cllr Craig Simmons is taking on the role of High Sheriff. Ron Gaffney will be Mayor of Knowsley and Cllr Linda Baxter of Stowmarket.\nOne light hearted theory I heard today for why we have this conjunction of Green Mayors was that the other parties are trying to tie up all our Councillors in ceremonial duties to keep us off the streets. That's not going to happen. If anything they'll be out and about seeing even more people. Good luck to them all. Enjoy your years and enjoy the adventure.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

The story of Highfields Community Orchard goes back about 7 years when Kirklees threatened to sell a valued green space next to Wentworth Street and Mountjoy Road. The land was on the border of Newsome and Greenhead Wards which provided a particular party political dimension with myself and the then Council Leader taking different views on this issue.\nHighfields Community Orchard was confirmed as having Local Green Space status at Wednesdays meeting. The land was subject to an ongoing disagreement between the local community and the Council over whether, the former school play area should have been allocated as building land or remain a place that the community could use for events, childrens play and for growing local food.\nIt's a long story full of politics and personalities. All credit to the local people who campaigned to save the land. Events over the last few years has brought neighbours together, sharing food and good times. the big problem for the Friends of Highfields Community Orchard is no longer Kirklees but the Apple Thief who has stripped the trees bare for a number of years now.\nSo the land should be safe for at least 15 years which is the life of the Local Plan. How high will the trees be by then?\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

He quotes proudly from the Government Website 'Councils must ensure that they are not imposing any unnecessary burdens in the way of development'.\nTheses so called planning 'reforms' were announced recently as part of the budget statement. There is to be a presumption in favour of development, quotas for bulding on previously developed 'brownfield' land are to be abolished placing more pressure on greenfield and greenbelt sites. Councils are to be encouraged to auction off land in their ownership. I find it unbelievable that the Lib Dems and their Conservative masters regard this as good news. Are these the same Lib Dems and Conservatives who are saying how keen they are to protect the greenbelt in their rather misleading leaflets?\nThe Campaign for the Protection of Rural England said of the Coalition Government planning statement,\n\"The planning measures present a potentially devastating threat to the countryside and are unlikely to boost long-term economic growth. To suggest, as successive Governments have done, that planning is a key impediment to growth is just wrong. The planning system exists to prevent unsustainable, unwanted and environmentally damaging development\".\nCouncillor Woodhead and the Lib Dems/Conservatives cannot have their cake and eat it. They cannot claim to be in favour of protecting our local environment and be part of a government intent on selling it off for development.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper\nGreen Party - Newsome Ward\nLink to CPRE Website for referennce - http://www.cpre.org.uk/news/view/736\nThe land auction element is something particularly dreamt up by the Lib Dems' think tank. I was at a meeting in Dewsbury tonight on the Kirklees LDF and asked the Tory MP, who had waxed long about protecting greenbelt, about these changes - he blustered about \"sustainable development\" being desirable but not on greenbelt (possibly a tad of \"creativity\" there) and then suggested the council should work on the basis of \"imagining the Localism Bill is already enacted\" - strange that a barrister might encourage people to imagine laws that, as yet, don't exist.\nReplyDeleteI've had good reports of your contributions at last nights meeting in Dewsbury. I was at Brockholes Village Trust's meeting last night and the Local Lib Dem David Woodhead had written to the Trust reassuring them that land that was to be built on in Brockholes was 'not greenbelt' as if that was the only measure of land that was valued and that Provisional Open Land was 'fair game'. These guys are really out of touch.\nReplyDeleteI think it is a bit much to describe Tony Woodhead's letter as praise for \"the total hash the goverment seem to be making of planning policy at the moment\". The vast majority of his letter is simply quoting from a DCLG document. Pointing out what is the Government's policy does not automatically equate to endorsing it.\nReplyDeleteCmon Adam. He wasn't quoting govt planning policy for nothing, for the hell of it, just for fun or as something to do between sticking leaflets, with dodgy graphs on through doors. He's clearly in favour of govt policy on planning. I'm not.\nReplyDelete",

Of course this budget is the first one under the gloomy laden background of public spending constraints with job losses inevitable and sure to grow in the next year. The Conservatives are apparently going to have a 'pretend budget amendment'. They are going to undoubtedly play the lower Council Tax card. Irresponsible? Yes! Will it result in reduced services and job losses? Almost certainly. Would they do it if they actually ran the Council? I honestly don't know. Is it designed to get lots of lovely votes by conning people into believing they are fiscally responsible? You bet your ass it is!\nSo what real room for manouvere is there really in the budget? With inflation , increased costs and so many ringfenced services a standstill budget is effectively a cut which most people don't appreciate. So how far can it go up (and down) At the top end not much. Try going above 2.5% and save some jobs and services and government will cap you. Try a standstill budget or even a cut and you're cutting services or increasing costs to pass onto somtimes vulnerable households.\nSo what can you do with budget amendment? Find things to support that don't cost a lot but have a big impact or pick your supporting funding sources imaginatively? This year is harder than any I have seen but in the Green Amendment we will have helped save some jobs, help people into employment, reduced energy costs and of course improve the environment. Not as ambitious as I would like but there you go.\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

The Green Party entered the election period with a robust record of tackling local issues of concern to the various communities that make up the Newsome Ward. So we had a good story to tell on the doorstep about the value of voting for the Green Party. In our literature we were able to say substantial things about local concerns from an informed and involved perspective.\nWe were fortunate to have a committed team of activists who canvassed and leafletted throughout the campaign and put in many hours of work. We had planned the campaign months in advance and knew what we were going to do. There were only small variations to what we usually do and in retrospect there are things we could have done that might have upped our chances\nThe Labour Candidate was certainly enthusiastic. We soon got reports from people about their encounters with him on the doorstep \" Vote for me I'm going to win\" and \" the Greens are going to lose this time\" seemed to be his principal messages. The first Labour leaflet had pictures of the Labour Candidate with all sorts of local folks we knew. Nadeem with people at a coffee morning and Nadeem with people outside his family's shop holding 'Hands off HRI' posters. Quite a number of them were rather nonplussed and some needlessly apologetic to us when they found themselves appearing in his election literature as his assumed supporters. We could have made something of this in the election campaign but decided that the local grapevine would be effective enough without us pushing it. It was.\nEvery now and again I'd knock at a door with a Labour poster in the window and say \"I respect the fact you're voting Labour but is there anything we should be doing that we aren't doing?\" It transpired that the Labour Candidates persistence might have got a poster in the window but that didn't necessarily mean they were voting for him. He got out a lot and saw a lot of people but what he said when he got there didn't help him much with most folks.\nHe also knocked at the doors of our supporters and started telling them that \"Andrew Cooper has given up in this election because he's going to lose\". I found this particularly annoying and when I tackled him in the street about it he said, \"You have given up! I can see the frustration in your eyes\". What I said to him after that isn't worth repeating!\nThen there was the graph on his leaflet that showed him in the lead entitled 'Polling Report'. It transpires this was derived from Labour's own canvassing. As most of their canvassing was done by Nadeem, who seemed to start out believing he'd won, perhaps their canvass returns may have been seem through rose tinted spectacles\nSo we come to the count and obviously we're interested to see the outcome given the Labour Candidates boundless confidence. Election protocol/rules/law prevent me from divulging too much about the count but it would appear that we did very well in most parts of the Newsome Ward. The majority was 606 with a 52% share of the vote was about the same as last time I stood in 2012 and nearly twice as big a majority than we got last year (though it was a General Election year). As the last votes were counted I was going to go to Nadeem and say \"I can see the frustration in your eyes\" but just decided to shake hands and call it a night.\n| Labour's graph |\n| The actual result |\nThere are words to describe polling based on a canvasser's own figures - a ***** of *** ****** (technically speaking).\nReplyDelete",

It is a green patch of land with a small tarmac area. Ideal as a community space and as a community orchard. To try to make this a reality local people have presented a petition to the Council, spoken at Full Council meetings and asked me to negotiate with the Council on their behalf. We've all reached a brick wall. The bottom line is that the Council could make a packet by selling at as a building plot and a community orchard doesn't really cut it in the making cash for the council stakes.\nWhat is in play here is two different approaches to value. Community value versus capital value. On the community value side all we have is bringing people together in a common project, a new low cost facility for the area, local grown healthy food in an urban environment and a valued improved green space near the centre of Huddersfield. On the capital value side they have money. Now let us not put down the value of money. After all it could be used to support community cohesion projects, local food projects, local community facilities. The irony is of course obvious. To make the irony of the situation even starker locals have decided to plant apple trees there anyway and develop the land as a community recreation and growing space at no cost to the council.\nIt is of course easier to take away land for building which never had a use or a purpose. Once that land has a positive community use it changes everything.\nOver to you Kirklees.\nTuesday, 23 March 2010\nMayors Local Food Awards\nOne of Cllr Julie Stewart-Turner's innovations in her year as Kirklees Council's first ever Green Party Mayor has been to promote local food for communities, schools and businesses. It has been a real success with the Annual Mayor Making dinner using all local produce including Yorkshire Wine this year.\nOne important event initiated by Julie was an event where local food producers were teemed up with local buyers to help faciliate deals that make the green principles of local production for local needs very real. This was a hugely successful event and well worth doing again.\nhttp://www2.kirklees.gov.uk/news/onlinenews/newsdesk/fullstory.aspx?id=1662\nThe Awards were another element and a way of recognising acheivement of local food producers. It was a great event and pleasing to see Berry Brow Infants and Newsome High School both getting Awards. They were both in our patch and no, neither me nor Julie were Judges! But for me, and I think a lot of people, there it was great to see 'Growing Newsome' getting the recognition they deserved for all the food growing community projects by winning the Community Award. Diane Sims didn't hold back when she collected the award, with the rest of the gang, and her genuine enthusiasm and commitment to the project clearly showed why they had won.\nFortunately several people and companies won awards who were not associated with the Newsome Ward and well deserved they were too.\nWill the Awards continue? I think they will and not just because Julie says so, but because the local food agenda is really going to grow and has huge potential to bring people and communities together. That is something we can't really get enough of right now.\nI better plant my spuds!\nSunday, 21 March 2010\n\"Webcasting? - steady now!\"\nSometime shortly after the dawn of time as primordial life was making its way onto the shores of the virgin Earth I suggested, and it was agreed, that the Council webcast council meetings. OK slight exaggeration but it was over a year ago. A request came from backbench councillors to move more quickly on webcasting but a meeting of Party Leaders (with one dissenter - guess who?) decided they wanted to proceed more slowly for some reasons best known to themselves.\nA test of the already installed equipment has already been done and I've seen it already and everything appears to all ready to go! So what's our next move? Well on Wednesday at our next Full Council meeting we are going to have, wait for it, a test of the equipment (not live)to see how it works. By the time we finally get this going other councils will be producing live holographic projections of their meetings beamed to their expatriate residents on our colonies on Mars!\nThursday, 18 March 2010\nCarry on Planning!\nThe people of Huddersfield have strong views on Castle Hill and quite rightly so; it is a site of great historical significance, as well as being very much part of Huddersfield’s heritage. People who don't want a public house/hotel there have strong arguments, which I also happen to share. I do, however, accept there are also many people who would like to see a hostelry of some sort built there and have perfectly valid reasons for holding that view. The common factor though, is that people really care about Castle Hill and what happens to the site.\nWith this in mind I was therefore absolutely astounded by the turn of events at today’s planning meeting, when the subject of Castle Hill came up. The two Liberal Democrat Councillors from the Almondbury Ward had to leave the Planning Committee; this is even more outrageous as one of them is Chair of this Committee. They had no option but to leave because they had prejudiced their position by stating prior to the meeting, in one of their election leaflets what their views were on developing the site. They had effectively ruled themselves out of having a vote on a subject which is so vitally important to many people, because they wanted to simply and irresponsibly posture in one of their leaflets. What exactly is the point of voting for Councillors who through their own irresponsible publicity remove their own right to vote.\nThe Almondbury Liberal Democrats irresponsibility on this matter is truly staggering especially as they are supposed to be experienced councillors.\nSaturday, 13 March 2010\nI join the 'Energy Generating Democracy'!\nSo at last our solar is installed! We have 1.3kWp of PV and a large solar thermal system feeding into a thermal store which will also be able to have heat input from a wood burning back boiler, the gas boiler and if we really need it an immersion heater. I really want to put the switch to the immersion heater in one of those glass fronted boxes saying, 'smash glass in emergency'.\nIn financial terms it will cost us a couple of grand with £10k of the costs covered by Kirklees Council's RE-Charge scheme and £2.5k by the now defunct Low Carbon Buildings Programme PV grant. Very roughly we will get a minimum of £400/year from the Clean Energy Cashback for 25 years another £400/year from the Renewable Heat Incentive and a minimum of £200/year fuel savings. So I estimate a very conservative financial benefit of £1000/year. I am sure George Monbiot would be foaming at the mouth if he was reading this now.\nWe get a couple of displays showing how much energy is being produced from each set of panels. It is quite a liberating feeling. I know one of my principal energy suppliers is 93 million miles away but I feel a much greater affinity with it than the earthbound energy companies. I guess it is because the sun never sends me any bills and 0p/kWh is by far my favorite tarrif! I do wonder if anyone has actually done any research into the psychological impact of having solar panels? It has to be positive. Being a producer of energy as well as a consumer. A feeling of control over your own energy, less dependence on big energy suppliers and the inevitable rise in fuel bills. Yup I'm feeling pretty positive.\nWednesday, 3 March 2010\nMonbiot rejects 'Energy Generating Democracy'\nGeorge Monbiot in The Guardian describes Solar Photovoltaic panels as ‘comically inefficient’\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/mar/01/solar-panel-feed-in-tariff\nThis is an uncharacteristically simplistic and wrong view of the technology from him. An average 2kWp PV system will produce around 1600 kWh of electricity per year which is around a half or a third of a households annual electricity use. In the south of England this could increase to 2000kWh/year. Hardly insignificant and not a cause for amusement.\nCosts of solar panels are directly related to the current small size of the market. The aim of the feed in tariff/clean energy cashback policy is to develop a mass market for solar panels which will reduce the unit cost and therefore the cost of saving carbon. New technologies such as thin film solar PV which use a fraction the amount of silicon should also help reduce the capital cost significantly as will higher volumes.\nGeorge refers to Solar PV contributing only 0.4% to Germany’s electricity supply but this rather misses the application of the technology at the micro level. At the domestic and small scale level microgeneration technologies such as PV are not feeding into the grid but are being used within the buildings they serve and displacing the need for grid generated dirty electricity. So the impact for the householder installing may be a reduction in 30 to 50% of their electricity use. PV on this scale should be regarded as demand reduction technology as opposed to a mass generation option.\nAnother point he makes is that it is a technology option is only one that the rich will be able to take advantage of. However this is simply not the case. In Kirklees we now have hundreds of council tenants, many of who are pensioners on low incomes taking advantage of solar PV. Because the Clean Energy Cashback can be ‘assigned’ to the installer or social landlord who is installing the solar panels, the capital costs for installation could be met in their entirety by the revenue gained. The tenant/householder will still get the benefit of the electricity generated in their own home. With many people on low incomes being retired, or unable to work due to illness, their peak demand will more reflect the peak generation times of the solar panels during the day. So it is arguably a technology best applied to low/fixed income households. Having said that, with more affluent households working from home these days it is increasingly likely that people with solar panels will make use of the electricity generated on site rather than exporting it to the grid.\nWhat George Monbiot completely fails to realise is the wider potential of microgeneration to change the way people regard themselves. They are no longer simply consumers of energy they can be generators and producers of their own heat and power. While that is literally ‘empowering’ it also means that householders have more of incentive to reduce their own consumption, to be more efficient in their use of energy, because now there is a ‘balance sheet’ of incoming and outgoing energy. If they are sufficiently responsible in their energy consumption they might even come out ‘in profit’ on their fuel bills. We have needed some real tangible incentives for saving energy in the home for a long time beyond the usual exhortations. Microgeneration provides that incentive.\nWe have the possibility of an ‘energy generating democracy’ in the UK with benefits to society and the environment inmeasurably greater than the narrow ‘property owning democracy’ that drove policy in the eighties. I find it bizarre to say this to someone with such well established green credentials but George Monbiot really should see the bigger picture here!\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",

Whilst in London, 70s politicians were having 'beer and sandwiches' in Machynlleth the CAT pioneers with 'beards and sandals' were taking the first steps in establishing sustainable new ways of living in a modern world. My latest journey to CAT earlier this month was as a visiting lecturer on one of their Architecture courses talking about 'The politics of sustainable energy' drawing on my experience at the local and national level getting projects off the ground in an ever changing policy landscape.\nFor all its isolation CAT is not isolationist. It actively seeks novices to learn the technicalities and practicalities of integrating sustainable technologies in our communities. To help acheive this CAT have recently opened a purpose built educational facility, the Welsh Instititute for Sustainable Education (WISE), with lecture theatres seminar rooms and accomodation for visiting students. It is of course built to the highest environmental standards but this is further enhanced by its location which was particularly stunning with the addition of the snow that fell during my stay there. On the evening following my talk there was environmental question time for the students with myself and CATs Paul Allen and Kim Bryan where we asked a range of questions looking at some of the issues we'll be facing getting the green message across over the next 40 years. I left CAT in the snow impressed by their ongoing role as a biomassed fuelled crucible of ideas and passion rooted in the 1970s but still way ahead of their time.\nAnd here from the 1970s is Al Stewart's 'Year of the Cat'.

One particular criticism made me ponder,\n\"The peer team identified a lack of risk appetite in the Council, which could constrain the Council's pace and ambition. A bolder approach to risk and opportunity is required throughout the organisation and existing governance processes should be strengthened to support this. Taking calculated risks will help the Council to move forward with the delivery of its long term ambitions\".\nThis resonated strongly with me and my view of the Council at present. When senior figures in the Council are asked how we are responding to this criticism, the generally well received Huddersfield Blueprint is referred to as proof that the Council has vision, ambition and is willing to take risks. It's a reasonable response but it stands out as an example of ambition and risk taking in a what is otherwise a fairly small 'c' conservative Council.\nOn Friday I was chairing the Kirklees Corporate Scrutiny Panel and a reference came up to the Council's Corporate Risk Register. This is a list of threats to Kirklees, its priorities, its reputation. It assesses how serious the risks are and what action is being taken to address and reduce those risks. The aim is to demonstrate the Council is thinking about all the bad things that could happen and how to mitigate them through a Risk Management Plan. It occurred to me in the meeting that we don't take the same approach to opportunities and that perhaps we should. How do we provide the space and structure for risk takers in the Council so they can thrive? Those people in the the council who have a buccaneering spirit that challenges the risk averse natures of so many local authorities. So perhaps to help those people we need a Corporate Opportunities Register and an Opportunities Management Plan that helps build a buccaneering culture that just doesn't recognise and address risk but also embraces it\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

The evidence was poured over for 2 days and\nNorth Yorkshire County Council were well prepared. They set up 2 enclosed areas\noutside County Hall in Northallerton both were considerately provided with\nPortaloos. One area was set aside for the Protestors and another area was set\naside for the Fracking supporters. Now I’m pretty sure that no one used the\nPortaloos on the Fracking supporters side due to the simple fact that there was\nno one there to make use of these facilities. What did happen in Northallerton\nto the shame of the County Council was the decision to allow Fracking near the\nvillage of Kirby Misperton. The decision was met with disbelief. Of course given\nthe same evidence as a Councillor with years of planning experience I would\nhave voted against.\nOn my own Council, Kirklees, I am proposing an addition to our Local Plan documents so when 3rd Energy or Cuadrilla put an application in our area, to extract shale gas they will have to demonstrate that their application will not result in a net addition to CO2 emissions. Now I don’t think that’s possible but at a time when we have the 14th or 15th highest global temperatures ever, I believe they should have to prove it as a part of any planning application.\nNow a word for my Labour opposite number Lisa Nandy MP the Labour Opposition Energy and Climate Change Secretary (Is she still? I don’t know) Her response to the Kirby Misperton decision was this,\n“ We need robust rules to offer communities reassurance that\nthe environmental risks will be properly managed.”\nLabour doesn’t get it. Even if you trusted the companies\nreassurances, even if you regulated it\nto somehow or other make it safe, you still cannot manage the environmental\nrisks of extracting and burning more fossil fuels when we need to keep those fuels\nin the ground. Our local and global\nenvironments simply cannot afford to let fracking happen. It must not happen.\nThe alternatives to fracking are available now. Energy efficiency, insulation are the way we should be ensuring our energy security, by making homes warmer and reducing energy demand, but Government has cut funding massively for these measures while keeping energy demand high and reducing costs for those poor hard pressed energy companies.\nSo we have the wrong energy priorities from Government, a\nfundamental misunderstanding of the problem with fracking from the opposition.\nSo it comes down to us. We are the people and we are the ones who are going to\nhave to stand tall, to speak truth to power. Simply being right is not enough.\nWe must challenge robustly every application, every proposal, exercise our\nright to peaceful civil disobedience and protest, refuse to pay fines. Make a\nnuisance of ourselves.\n2016 has been a bloody awful year so far. Friends let us come\ntogether, let us be united and let’s tell them NO Fracking Way!\nENDS",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2015_05_2015-general-election-looking-back_html/content_217.html": "What went wrong in the 2015 General Election? Well pretty much everything.\nA Tory Government pursuing a right wing agenda, full of 'near as makes no difference' climate change deniers elected on 37% of the vote with 100% of the power over our lives. They were elected on the basis of fear. Fear of Labour, fear of the SNP, fear of immigants, fear of economic collapse.\nA Labour Party that believes that it failed because it wasn't right wing enough! Labour are falling in line with the Tory welfare and big business orientated agenda. Their Leadership candidates are now falling over themselves to be even more right wing as if that was the answer to all their /our problems. This is tragic to watch, even for a non- Labour supporter like me. People who genuinely believe in social justice are being dragged along by a leadership so delusional that you can see 5 years hence that they will fail to win on the basis that they are 'Tory Lite' as opposed to the truly offensive genuine article.\nWhat went wrong in 2015? Ultimately it was the lack of any Party being able to articulate a genuinely inspiring vision of a positive future that enough people would buy into. Negativity ruled. Fear ruled. Without a compelling vision, without a robust distinctive agenda, a stumble off a platform, fear of the SNP or a bacon sandwich eaten awkwardly could and did make all the difference. Hell yes! The trivial can be ignored, set aside, even laughed at, if the vision is good and people can be offered a secure and better future.\nThere are silver linings. The Lib Dems were all but decimated and deservedly so. I did wonder for a while whether anyone would really buy into the 'we were a steadying influence on the evil Tories' garbage. Any objective commentator can see this was a more a right wing Government than even Margaret Thatcher in her heyday. The Lib Dems utterly wasted the opportunity they had. No reform of the House of Lords, no Proportional Representation, an abysmal and shameful record on addressing Climate Change and propping up the most appalling attacks on social welfare policies that the country has ever seen. If anything they had 8 too many MPs elected. UKIP went backwards and are left with 1 MP who seems pretty disaffected from the much more unpleasant Farage leadership of the Party. Come 2017, and the result one way or the other of the referendum, that might be the end of UKIP who knows. I would even hazard a guess that UKIP's association with a NO vote in the referendum may work against them.In the same way that the Lib Dems association with the YES vote in the AV refendum had a negative effect on that result.\nSo we come to the Green Party. There is a good tale to tell and some honest reflections we should make.\nThe good tale is that we had more Candidates than ever before, we got a larger vote than ever before, we retained Caroline Lucas as our MP for Brighton and we had more coverage in General Election than we are used to and we nearly won Bristol West. We definitely moved forward and a lot of people in the Party deserve credit for that. The Green Party does need to look at where we go from here. The great thing is that we don't have to agonise with ourselves and ask why couldn't we be just more like the Tories because they won after all. We can look at our future on the basis that we have made sme progress. We have had faltering steps and got tripped up as we moved forward but nethertheless we have moved forward.Our membership has grown and continues to grow.\nIf we were just looking at the General Election then we are planning on a 5 year horizon but we have several rounds of Local Elections up till then. The Green Party needs to play to our strengths and address our challenges. Our strength is the strong message we have for idealistic young people who are more ready than ever for a principled alternative to the status quo. We were right to emphasise our commitment to social justice as it was all but abandoned by others. Criticism that we abandoned environmental issues was overplayed. Objective environmental pressure groups scored our manifesto very highly and Natalie Bennett was one of the few leaders to highlight Climate Change when she got the opportunity. Were there ways we could have highlighted our groundbreaking policies to address climate change more strongly? Very probably and by linking with our natural allies in the green energy sector, almost certainly.\nWe do need to take the opportunity to re-evaluate the Green Party message. We need to ensure that social justice is at the heart of our message and well grounded and consistent with our strong emphasis on sustainability. Green policies need to be firmly rooted in our core values if they are to be meaningful. We are not Old Labour and we are certainly not New Labour and never will be. The social justice and stability offered by the Green Party has to be one that is consistent with our environmental and economic aims and articulated in a way that everyone in the Green Party can buy into.\nWe have to continue to demonstrate that we have the practical policies and know how to put cutting edge policies forward in spite of this Government and seek to implement them through Local Councils, regional bodies and devolved governments We need to form alliances with others inside and outside political bodies to show that we do not just speak for ourselves but for a broader consensus of people seeking solutions to climate change , social injustice and a range of policy issues.\nThere's a lot of work to do. Lets get on with it.\nA Tory Government pursuing a right wing agenda, full of 'near as makes no difference' climate change deniers elected on 37% of the vote with 100% of the power over our lives. They were elected on the basis of fear. Fear of Labour, fear of the SNP, fear of immigants, fear of economic collapse.\nA Labour Party that believes that it failed because it wasn't right wing enough! Labour are falling in line with the Tory welfare and big business orientated agenda. Their Leadership candidates are now falling over themselves to be even more right wing as if that was the answer to all their /our problems. This is tragic to watch, even for a non- Labour supporter like me. People who genuinely believe in social justice are being dragged along by a leadership so delusional that you can see 5 years hence that they will fail to win on the basis that they are 'Tory Lite' as opposed to the truly offensive genuine article.\nWhat went wrong in 2015? Ultimately it was the lack of any Party being able to articulate a genuinely inspiring vision of a positive future that enough people would buy into. Negativity ruled. Fear ruled. Without a compelling vision, without a robust distinctive agenda, a stumble off a platform, fear of the SNP or a bacon sandwich eaten awkwardly could and did make all the difference. Hell yes! The trivial can be ignored, set aside, even laughed at, if the vision is good and people can be offered a secure and better future.\nThere are silver linings. The Lib Dems were all but decimated and deservedly so. I did wonder for a while whether anyone would really buy into the 'we were a steadying influence on the evil Tories' garbage. Any objective commentator can see this was a more a right wing Government than even Margaret Thatcher in her heyday. The Lib Dems utterly wasted the opportunity they had. No reform of the House of Lords, no Proportional Representation, an abysmal and shameful record on addressing Climate Change and propping up the most appalling attacks on social welfare policies that the country has ever seen. If anything they had 8 too many MPs elected. UKIP went backwards and are left with 1 MP who seems pretty disaffected from the much more unpleasant Farage leadership of the Party. Come 2017, and the result one way or the other of the referendum, that might be the end of UKIP who knows. I would even hazard a guess that UKIP's association with a NO vote in the referendum may work against them.In the same way that the Lib Dems association with the YES vote in the AV refendum had a negative effect on that result.\nSo we come to the Green Party. There is a good tale to tell and some honest reflections we should make.\nThe good tale is that we had more Candidates than ever before, we got a larger vote than ever before, we retained Caroline Lucas as our MP for Brighton and we had more coverage in General Election than we are used to and we nearly won Bristol West. We definitely moved forward and a lot of people in the Party deserve credit for that. The Green Party does need to look at where we go from here. The great thing is that we don't have to agonise with ourselves and ask why couldn't we be just more like the Tories because they won after all.

The Budget has been reduced £300 million last year to £110 million this year and £100million in 2012/13. Of course it is bad enough that people on low incomes will have less opportunity to get their homes properly heated and insulated but the government have put some of their own special touches in that will make matters even worse.\nBenefit Entitlement Checks, which were part of the old scheme, have been cut. These helped people who were unaware of the benefits they could claim or perhaps were too proud to claim. This not only helped improve their incomes ( on average by £1850 in 2009/10) but also meant they could become eligible for a Warm Front installation that they previously didn’t qualify for (over 11,000 in 2009/10). It made the scheme a more holistic approach to tackling fuel poverty as it addressed both income and energy efficiency. The Government clearly are wanting to not only restrict the funding on warmfront but also on people who can legitimately claim benefits they are entitled to. Something the Government have done which I won’t argue with is cancelling the voucher scheme for reductions off the cost of central heating to pensioners. This never had any real validity wasn’t based on income and was never properly policied to ensure heating companies weren’t simply profiteering off it, but this is a small consolation compared to the decimation of a valued scheme like Warm Front\nOn occasions the costs of central heating jobs under Warm Front may not be covered by the grant maximum and so customers are asked to contribute towards the costs. So people in the direst circumstances could be asked to find £300, £500 or more. Sometimes this money can be found from a variety of pots, some local authority monies, though this is becoming limited, Royal British Legion or charities. What the government have done now is to limit the customer contributions ‘offer’ to 30 days meaning that many people may not be able to get the money together in time to arrange to pay for an installation and they will lose out.\nWhen the Warm Front scheme first started a few years ago now there were significant issues with quality of workmanship which I and others took up with DEFRA. Many householders suffered with substandard, dangerous and illegal gas installations. As a result a strong inspection regime was brought into place which helped raised standards. This was vital when many customers are vulnerable and may be reluctant to speak up for themselves. All gas jobs were inspected now only 10% will be inspected.\nLow Carbon technologies have been dropped from the scheme offer, though to be fair this was a bit of a shambles in the old Warm Front scheme with very little drive to make this a real offer\nThe big change is with the eligibility critera. Less people will now be eligible for Warm Front and there will be virtually no promotion of the scheme. This is supposed to demonstrate better targeting of the scheme. Only houses with an energy efficiency SAP rating of under 55 are supposed to be helped by the scheme which may sound reasonable but there will be no proper measurement of this it will be based on assumptions based on some basic questions. For all these reasons I‘ll stick my neck out and say they have restricted the Warm Front scheme so much that I believe it will underspend in 2011/12.\nBenefit Entitlement Checks, which were part of the old scheme, have been cut.

He says that we,\n' had no alternative budget and said the Council should spend at the previous levels. The Greens would bankrupt the Council just as Lambeth and Liverpool did in the 80's'.\nLeaving aside the fact that these were Labour Councils that he is criticising, the Green Party did actually go through the whole budget process and felt that to support the cuts as the other Parties had done was something that we could not do as a matter of principle. We never said the Council should spend itself into debt. We disagreed with the rules of the budget game laid down by central government and we saw no reason to put our hands up for a budget that we fundamentally disagreed with. Ultimately government should take more from the rich and the banks and give it to those in the direst need. 'We are all in this together' is not an acceptable statement for a millionaire to make to a pensioner on a low income needing personal care. If you don't buy into the Coalitions programme for cutting the deficit you cannot support this by proxy by voting through cuts at the local government level.\nSaturday, 7 May 2011\nThe politics of posterboards\n| Nailed! |\nThere are of course rules that Kirklees make which are often ignored by certain parties such as don't put them on lamp posts with other signs attached which they could obscure if they slip. Another is that they should not be nailed into trees or telegraph poles. All these rules were ignored by the Conservatives in the Kirkburton Campaign. Another irritating thing was that we were given permission to put up our boards on land around Farnley Tyas by the landowner and so were the Conservatives. One morning our boards had disappeared and were replaced with Conservatives ones. Now I'm not implying anything, well maybe I am.\nThere are benefits to getting your posterboards up first but the downside is that the opposition can come by afterwards and turn your boards sideways while they're putting there's above yours. We've always prided ourselves on getting ours down early and usually Derek Hardcastle is getting them down in Kirkburton the next morning. One year we were a bit slow at getting them down and found some of ours pushed higher up the lamp posts presumably by the oppostion while taking there's down. Nice!\nFour more years!\n| Yes indeedy! |\nWe also had a good showing in the Kirkburton Parish elections with 12 Greens being elected onto a Parish of 25 (Parish Results). The really satisfying thing is that we now have at least one Green Party Parish Councillor in every Parish Ward in the Kirkburton Ward which bodes well for the future. It was a shame that we didn't get the rest of our 6 Parish Candidates elected but hopefully better luck next time. The important thing now is to turn that result into more successful local action at the community and Kirklees level.\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",

A good time was had by all and I got a couple of days walking in adding another 22 miles to my tally on the\nPembrokeshire Coastal Path. It was a 'green' holiday too with\nthe cottage we rented being heated with a wood burning stove and hot water provided by solar thermal panels (very reminiscent of home really). We also got some time under canvas at the Cambridge Folk Festival where my wood gasification stove saw some action. One of the great things about the Folk Festival is that they insist on wooden cutlery rather than plastic at the takeaways. So collecting these and burning them in my stove helps cook our bacon sandwiches in the morning. Okay I know it should be a free range organic egg and mushroom sandwich on homemade wholemeal bread but then no ones perfect! One of the real advantages is you don't need to buy propane or butane canisters just the occasional AA battery for the fan. It also saw action at the AGC Conference where I camped in Norwich. Anyhow heres a vid demonstrating how wood gas stoves work followed by a vid by the band Katzenjammer from Norway who played at Cambridge this year.\nHo Ho ! Nah! I drunk Brown Ale at Cambridge shortly before taking my whippet to run at the local dog track.It must be inbred in me from the long line of South Yorkshire coal miners I come from.\nReplyDelete",

This would be as a minimum cover\nKirklees but could be developed at scale with our neighbours. This will ensure this\nwill ensure that we can work with the Homes and Communities Agency and\nRegistered Social Landlords, developers and institutional investors who can\nlever in additional resources as well as keeping the income generated from new\ndevelopment within Kirklees to help to support local services.\nThe company would deliver new housing on council land that\nhas been identified for development in their Local Plans.\nThere are a number of reasons why this may be attractive to\nKirklees.\n- At a time of diminishing balances Central Government is encouraging Councils to develop new housing to fund local services through the New Homes Bonus and new Council Tax revenue income. If the Council is in partnership with third parties developer profit from new development would be shared amongst the partners involved and could be used to help fund Council Services.\n- There are occasions when the Council has granted Planning Permission on land but frustratingly developers with which the Council has no relationship have dragged their feet, sometimes for years, leaving areas blighted. The Council would have more control over development if it was itself part of the development vehicle.\n- There is the opportunity to use the newly merged KNH and Building Services as a vehicle for Housing Development utilising existing skills in electrical and gas services\n- The standard of new build housing in the private sector is variable and some Councillors have had cause to tackle substandard housing with developers. If the Council can put pressure on the market – control of building will be more effective. Cutting corners and reducing the quality of build to reduce costs will be avoided.\n- The opportunity to promote higher energy efficiency standards, such as Passivhaus development could be pursued by such a company. The embedded Quality Assurance in Passivhaus developments will ensure a quality build as well as very high energy efficiency standards. Householders benefiting from very low energy bills will have more money in their pockets to spend locally helping them to pay rents and mortgages more easily.\n- With a substantial portfolio of work over a number of years partnerships with educational institutions could provide a rich source of local employment for apprentices working in a range of building jobs.\nNo income has been put against this budget amendment as it\nis too early to say how substantial the potential income could be to the\nCouncil. However, any revenue income generated above that required for the core\npurposes of the Housing Development Company would be utilised to support valued\nservices in town and village centres that provide contact and services to\npeople in our communities. This amendment does however show that there are\nalternatives to simply managing decline at a time when central government is\nstarving the Council of funds.\nIf this amendment is passed the expectation would be that\nthe Council establishes a Project Team to quickly establish the Local Housing\nDevelopment Company before the 2018/19 Budget so projected incomes can be\nfactored in to the Councils hard pressed finances.\nExcellent. Ours is up and running at the encouragement of the Lincolnshire Independents. Called Lafford Homes. Just getting off the blocks. What do you think of the flat-pack homes? They claim to be extremely energy efficient. The ones I have been inside have been good and residents like them. I am not certain of the longevity compared to brick or the carbon footprint to build.\nReplyDeleteIts certainly the way forward and gives the opportunity to reduce costs. Some of the more progressive bigger builders are developing systems and factories to manufacture homes offsite\nReplyDelete",

Floods Minister Richard Benyon (pictured) came along to tell us he hadn't resolved the issue of making insurance affordable for homes in flood risk areas and that the introduction of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems for new build houses would be delayed supposedly due to lobbying from the building industry over costs.\nHe went on to bemoan the fact that the private sector were not pulling their weight in providing funds for partnership funding for flood defence projects. I suggested that in lieu of their zero tax bill that Starbucks be approached to significantly contribute. This went down pretty well with the audience which included plenty of Tory Cllrs. He promised to take this idea to Cabinet but to be fair I think he thought I was joking. I wasn't.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2011_09_watering-down-suds_html/content_943.html": "I did wonder whether or not it was coincidence that the Annual Meeting of the Inland Flood Risk Management Group meeting was help on the top floor of the Local Government Association’s HQ in Smiths Square, London. Did they know something the rest of us didn’t or were they just being overly cautious?\n| Flooding in Armitage Bridge 2008 |\nThis was the first meeting of the group I had been to as their incoming Chair. The outgoing Chair for the last 4 years Cllr Mike Haines was leading proceedings and my role was very much to meet people and pick up the key issues and debate on current matters regarding flood risk. We started off with an interesting presentation on SUDS or Sustainable Drainage Systems to you and me. The basic issue is that due to climate change we are getting much more sustained heavy rain events. This coupled with the growth of impermeable concrete and tarmac surfaces (and less green fields for water to drain into) means that flooding events are becoming much more common. Events such as the Armitage Bridge flood is just one example among a growing number of flash floods that have affected communities. So flooding is not just about rising sea levels it is also about the capacity of our current drainage systems to cope with increasingly heavy rainfall. SUDS are techniques and methods of reducing run off of rainwater into conventional drainage systems. This could mean use of permeable paving or reed beds to aid slow release of rainwater into drains. This clearly is an issue for Planning Committees to consider and the draft National Planning Policy Framework also has things to say about SUDS. So I suppose you might expect SUDS would be used in all developments if we want to reduce flooding risk. Unfortunately it is not quite that simple. The message from DEFRA in the meeting was quite clear and it could be summed up as follows, “To promote growth regulation should not add cost”. So if SUDS are likely to make a development morecostly and so unviable then the developer could simply argue that they don’t want to do it and proceed with a conventional drainage solution. The question I asked was, “The National Planning Policy Framework has a ‘presumption in favour of sustainable development’. If the developer says it is unaffordable to put in a Sustainable Drainage System it is by definition ‘unsustainable’ does this make it fundamentally out of step with the principles of the NPPF?” Well the question got a few knowing laughs from those present as we all basically knew that arguments for economic growth are paramount in the NPPF and ‘sustainability’ is so ill defined as to be meaningless anyway. The truth is that SUDS can in many cases be cheaper to install and maintain than conventional drainage systems but my principle concern is that standards and principles of development and regulation itself can be set aside in the name of economic growth. As a Green it is a principle for me that we don’t compromise our environment as ultimately this does not make economic sense. In actuality how much of an issue will this be? I guess the proof of the pudding is in the eating so we’ll have to wait and see but my concerns were certainly shared by many of the local authority officers at the meeting one of whom without a trace of irony said SUDS appears to be being ‘watered down’. A local SUDS Advisory Board will decide what is viable/affordable but I guess the question is what happens if there is a dispute with the developer? Is there an appeal process?\nLord Chris Smith, former Labour Cabinet Minister and current Chairman of the Environment Agency, spoke about the separation of responsibility for surface water flooding and watercourses from them to Local Authorities. They have also been holding capacity building workshops for Local Authorities to help them with their new responsibilities and around 96% of Local Authorities have been involved in these which is pretty impressive. The key concern for the Environment Agency like many bodies is reduced funding and reduced capacity. It has a stretching target of giving 145,000 houses better flood defences yet has fewer officers on the ground and will be commenting only on high risk planning applications. The concern is that applications which might have been improved or benefitted from their input will now slip through the net.\nAll in all this was a useful primer for me to get a background in the key issues and test out some opinions on people who are much better informed than I am. I’m looking forward to learning much more about flood risk over the next year.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Well it's these pink posters on streets around the Golcar Ward where coincidentally a Council By Election is to be held on November 21st.\nThe posters say in big bold words 'Stop Labour's Gridlock'. If you look at some really small writing at the top you'll see a line indicating it is part of the Lib Dem election campaign. So though it looks pink it is in fact yellow! It also looks like it is part of some sort of community campaign (which it is not) and there is no indication of what party it represents. It is clearly deceptive, cynical and wholly negative.It is clearly the start of some contrived campaign that the Lib Dems will run during the election to drum up support.\nYou can imagine when the Lib Dems were dreaming up this idea that they thought it was a really clever thing to do by pretending to run a non partisan community campaign against the party they regard as their principal opponent. The problem for them is that people aren't stupid and they can spot when they are being manipulated. It will backfire on them.\nI'm no fan of the Labour Party, but if I am going to criticise them I will do it openly on literature bearing the name of the Party I represent. If the Lib Dems are going to be so deceptive in their election campaigns why should we trust them if they are elected? Actually we know they can't be trusted in Government with pledge after pledge being broken such as backtracking on no rise in Student Tuition Fees, opposing nuclear energy and privatisation of the NHS.\nIf they behave so cynically in their election campaigns the they deserve to be treated cynically by the electorate.",

I say 'the outside world' because a lot of the time you are inside. COP24 very much has the feel of an International Space Station (with gravity!). You don't see much of the outside world. You could be anywhere, in any part of the world. You're also very conscious that people from every part of the world are there as well. The experience for most attendees is probably equivalent to a Festival of Climate Action. In the various meeting rooms, every possible aspect of climate change, climate mitigation and climate adaptation is\n|\n| Miguel Canete - EU Climate Change Commissioner |\ndiscussed in depth. Now and again there will be a star turn. Top of the bill yesterday was former US Vice President Al Gore giving a bravura presentation on the 'State of the Climate' with ongoing criticism of the shortsightedness of governments and businesses.\nMy mission at COP24 was very clear to me. To focus on the issue I had conceived and promoted for the last 2 years, 'Regionally and Locally Determined Contributions' - RLDC's. It's hard to make a subject with this title sound engaging. What exactly does it mean? The short explanation is that just as we have carbon emission savings identified for nations, Nationally Determined Contributions - NDCs, we also should have savings identified for Councils and other political bodies at the Local and Regional level - RLDCs. To engage the power of the local could\n|\n| With CoR Vice President Markula at the EU Commission Briefing |\nhelp bridge the gap between the emissions we need to save and those identified in the NDCs. So if it works the difference between achieving and failing to achieve the COP21 Paris Climate Goals.\nSo I've been away from home for 10 days and frankly want to get back. At COP24 I've made a number presentations and press interviews as well as participating in briefings on progress of the talks. The key one for me was with EU Climate Change Commissioner Miguel Canete where I asked for strong support for RLDCs but also the ongoing involvement of Local and Regional Authorities in developing policies and strategies to address climate change. It's not going to be as easy an ask as you might think. COP stands for 'Conference of the Parties' and the Parties are Governments. Giving LRA's their own contributions is regarded by some as ignoring the agreed structure of global action on climate change.\n|\n| Presenting on RLDCs in the EU Pavillion |\nSo even if it makes perfect sense to seek to resolve climate change in this way it may be politically difficult to deliver.\nWhat we do know is that there has been a growing pressure for action at the local and regional level to have greater recognition fro LRAs. Todays's statement from 'Non State Actors' through the Talanoa Dialogue Call for Action has piled on the pressure for greater emphasis on action by LRAs on mitigation and adaptation. Here's just some of the positive statements they made yesterday that were endorsed by the Presidents of COP23 and COP24 that indicate a greater role for LRAs\n\"Actors in all countries,\nincluding Parties and non-Party stakeholders at the national, regional and\n|\n| Al Gore doing his impressive 'State of the Climate' talk |\ncommunity levels are already\ntaking action. Pre-2020 action is vital for putting the world on a path towards achieving the long-term\ngoals of the Paris Agreement. But it is not only governments that must act. Non-Party stakeholders can\nand should join in pre-2020 action and complement action by states. \"\n\"Multilateralism and cooperation will enable us to address problems together, find solutions, and\nbuild consensus for the common good.

They were right in this instance.<br /><br />You'll know that the law requires the organisers of a moving protest to give written notice to the police. I don't know what the notice period is in North Yorkshire, but around 6 days notice is the norm. Yes, it's bureaucratic and frustrating but it's the law. <br /><br />A little slow march would come under the heading of a moving protest. Officers had organised numbers to police a static protest, not a march. <br /><br />Without giving written notice, the slow marchers commit public order offences and their \"peaceful protest\" is unlawful (so no longer 'peaceful'). The police commander on the spot is not in a position to help protesters break the law by saying: \"Oh alright then. You're such nice people and its only a little slow march, so I'll say 'yes', but don't tell anyone that I made an exception of you!\".<br /><br />When celebrities and public figures make guest appearances at demos, protesters are tempted to put on a show, like a slow march, for their and social media's benefit. When the police say No to facilitating an impromptu demo or anything other than a static demonstration, they get criticised for not playing ball. They are called uncaring, heavy handed and brutal even. A balanced view might take into account that (a) they had to say NO, and (b) that local people and other Tax-payers might prefer to have officers back in their communities rather than facilitating protesters' youtube videos and facebook selfies. <br /><br />When the police become the target of resentment and frustration, rather than the ministers of state that granted the fracking licence, then I fear that activists, supporters and well-wishers are in danger of taking their eye off the ball. <br /><br /> Crisphttps://www.blogger.com/profile/00313584175286828248noreply@blogger.comtag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7196059482061221339.post-61697452353644295582017-10-21T13:30:05.283+01:002017-10-21T13:30:05.283+01:00We know the police don't care.

It was pretty unpleasant stuff that Mr Woolas put out about his Lib Dem opponent but there really is heavy irony here. Having been in politics a good number of years I've seen some dodgy leaflets from Labour in Newsome but the dodgiest I have seen from all over the place has to be the Lib Dems. The incredibly spurious graphs they produce indicating how high their support is supposedly is one example. When challenged about these tactics I usually get a sort of half embarrassed smile and the words 'well that's politics' as if that were some excuse for having no standards on the paper you stick through electors doors. There was the nonsense they put out accusing the Green Party of calling for lower insulation standards for Council tenants. Scandalous an undefensible but Lib Dem tactics through and through.\nOf course we have the Lib Dems in government who's election priorities bear little relation to those of the coalition e.g. Trident, nuclear power, tuition fees etc etc. Are we going to be able to take the whole Lib Dem Parliamentary Party to court for lying in their literature? No of course we can't because if they actually had won the election they would of course delivered on their promises - yeah right. The problem they have right now is that it is difficult to spot the Liberal morsels in the Coalition amidst the devastation that is being wrought in their name. Anyway for entertainment value here's Captain Ska with 'Liar Liar'. How come Ska comes into its own when there are Tory Governments (sorry Tory/Lib Dem Govts)?\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2016_07_decc-decked_html/content_565.html": "There is a perverse logic to the abolition of the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Since 2010 when David Cameron famously declared, in the DECC building, that his would be the 'Greenest Government Ever' there has been a constant reduction in financial support for measures to address climate change. We have had catastrophic reductions in Feed In Tariff rates for renewable technologies and for energy efficiency through cuts to the Energy Company Obligation. The Zero Carbon Homes standard due to be introduced this year for new homes was dropped by George Osborne. Planning rules for onshore wind turbines have been made so restrictive that they are as good as a ban. One of the few drivers that remained for investment in renewables was the UK being a signatory to the EU Renewable Energy Directive which required us to produce 15% of our total energy from renewable sources by 2020. Even though many of our EU partners had higher targets that they were exceeding the UK was shamefully set to fail to reach our 15% renewables target. Then Brexit happened and the threat of the UK being fined by the EU for failing to achieve a target we had voluntarily signed up to began to diminish. With a lack of commitment to energy efficiency and renewables in the UK Govt it is becoming increasingly difficult to see how we will be able to achieve our carbon reduction commitments made in Paris last December. With the significance of DECC being diminished as a direct result of Government policy the abolition of the department is consistent with the Conservatives ambivalence to action to address carbon emissions. To all intents and purposes the Conservatives are Climate Change Deniers in all but name.\nWe know that Government will say that addressing climate change has been 'mainstreamed' into an important Government Department but it has in fact being sidelined with no Cabinet minister acting as 'champion' following a decline in financial and policy support over the last 6 years. The irony is that one of the Ministers who managed that decline, Amber Rudd has been promoted to Home Secretary which as we know is only a short step to Number 10. Who would have thought the 'Aristocracy Advisor' on the film 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' could have come so far.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

The NUS National President was there doing a very competent job of articulating the concerns of students over their finances, tuition fees and future prospects. The disappointment was the low turnout (hopefully not indicative of the election itself!)\nIt was an early indication of what is to come during the election campaign but it would appear that the international financial crisis has little to do with governments according to Barry Sheerman and that we are coming out of recession according to the very late James Blanchard.

The membership of the panels has been determined by the 5 West Yorkshire Council Leaders (all Labour) and should be roughly proportional according to the political makeup of the Council. As such there are 8 Labour members 3 Tory and 1 Liberal Democrat. Each member of the panel will receive an allowance of £11,716. That is a total of over £140k. So how much has been provided by central government per Councillor to pay allowances for these posts? Well it is around £920/ member /year. So out of highly stretched council or police budgets Councillors are paying themselves the best part of an additional £130k/year. You could argue that central government should be making more money available for these posts if they are that important. The fact is that they have not and so really West Yorkshire Labour Council Leaders should be putting this case back to central government rather than simply paying, mainly Labour Councillors, an allowance which will simply be a drain on already depleted funds. Another good question is to ask is what has happened on other Police and Crime Panels across the country with regard to allowances? It seems that the decision to pay over 10 times the amount of funding provided by Government is one that very few other Councils are taking and nationally WestYorkshire are pretty much going it alone.\nFor Kirklees there will be one Labour and one Conservative nominee. This gives Labour another opportunity to reward the Conservatives for allowing the Labour Party to take the leadership of Kirklees Council at the Annual Meeting and it is interesting Kirklees was chosen by West Yorkshire Labour Leaders to be one of the places where the Conservatives were allocated a place. Patronage rules OK.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Apt in so many ways to this article. |\nI guess from this blogs point of view I should detail how this will affect Kirklees. Well, we have been installing solar panels on Council houses and council buildings all through the noughties mainly funded through the Renewable Energy Fund established by the Green Party. Chris Huhne Lib Dem DECC Minister's decision is therefore disappointing to say the least. It doesn't stop us moving forward with existing schemes but it can hardly be regarded as 'fair' - the touchstone word of this government.\nThe really irritating thing is that it would have cost very little. It could have beeen limited to microgeneration installations fitted under government supported programmes. This should have been a fairly manageable number. As the Feed In Tarrif is funded through utilities it would not have affected public sector budgets.. The impact on the populations fuel bills would have been hardly noticeable and it would have helped hundreds of households in Kirklees Council housing on the very lowest incomes have a few hundred more pounds in their pockets. It would have been a small step towards a fairer and greener society but sadly not to be.\nThe next key date is October 20th when the Spending Review reveals what the GGE 'Greenest Government Ever' is going to make of the proposed Renewable Heat Incentive. There are also concerns about how it will treat the existing Feed In Tariff. Lets see what happens. I promise to say something nice about the Coalition Government at the next opportunity.

I'm pretty sure that he didn't give local Labour Party members much more, if any, notice than the Huddersfield Examiner and the Council got. With only a few weeks to go before close of nominations this allows the Labour Party and the other Parties little time to find an additional candidate. In theory it should be straightforward for Labour to get another name for the ballot paper in Greenhead. There was a selection for the Greenhead seat with 2 candidates and one came out on top and the sitting Councillor was deselected. So the 'easy' answer would be to make both of them Labour Candidates for the Local Election in Greenhead Ward. That may yet happen but the fractious effect and outcome of the previous selection contest would have to be set on one side and that may just be too difficult. There is the other complication that the deselected Labour Candidate is now selected for the more problematic Ward of Almondbury. You can't help thinking how much less complicated things would have been for Labour if Mehboob had just stood down months ago before the selection contest. A lot of Labour angst may have been avoided. Still not my problem!\nAt last weeks Full Council meeting, the last before the Local Elections, tributes were given to those members who were standing down. At that time Mehboob's name was not on the list so no tributes! He still had a year left to run on his term of office and had already spent a year being a Kirklees Councillor when mainly being based in London. You get the distinct impression that Mehboob's departure was as much of a surprise to the current Labour Leader as it was to the rest of us.\nThere's a lot that has been said about Mehboob and his sometimes complex dealings and there's a lot more I and others could say. Recognising that both Teflon and Luck are finite materials has meant Mehboob has been able to choose the manner of his own departure, a luxury not many politicians have.\nHere's a dramatised version of Labour Leader David Sheard responding to Mehboob's hasty departure!\nHere's a dramatised version of Labour Leader David Sheard responding to Mehboob's hasty departure!\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Electric\nvehicles since then have come on leaps and bounds and have low servicing costs,\nlower costs per mile and the range of electric vehicles is well within the\nCouncils operational requirements. The benefit to the Council is not just lower\nrunning costs but also demonstrates that we are playing our part in reducing\nvehicle emissions at a time when we have growing concerns about air quality in\nKirklees. As the carbon intensity of UK electricity begins to fall electric\nvehicles will play an important role in storing renewable energy generated\novernight. This will help us play our part in reducing carbon emissions in line\nwith the COP21 Paris Climate Goals.\nPublic Rapid Charging\nof Electric Vehicles\nWith a growing number of people buying and using electric\nvehicles the Council needs to play its part in providing the infrastructure we\nneed to allow this cleaner more efficient form of transport to grow.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2018_08_last-of-sparkling-wine-starring-michael_html/content_249.html": "The 'Hothouse Earth' Report makes grim reading and questions whether we can 'safely park' global temperature rises at 2 degrees C and indicates that we may have set in train a series of carbon releasing events that will be difficult to stop and that we may end up with global temperatures around 4 to 5 degrees C higher than the pr- industrial era. This really is a nightmare scenario with a significant rise in sea levels, highly disrupted weather threatening food supplies and much more frequent extreme and violent weather events. It is a respected summation of current peer reviewed climate science and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nA number of things have concerned me over the last few weeks. One is the cheery assertion by Conservative Government Minister Michael Gove that Climate Change and higher temperatures in the UK is a great opportunity for British Farmers to produce good quality sparkling wine. Now of course there may be some truth in this but it indicates a lack of perception of the grim reality of climate change. You could argue that what he said was taken out of context and that really he really does 'get it'. I'd like to believe that but you see the vote on the 3rd runway at Heathrow, the permission to commence Fracking at Preston New Road and the 4 new gas turbines at Drax that are on the cards and you can only conclude they don't believe and don't care about climate change. Sadly that goes for a lot of Labour politicians as well.\nMichael Gove gave the impression when he was first elected that he had hugged plenty of huskies in the fashion of David Cameron when he was in his 'vote blue go green' phase. With his positive comments on neonicitinoids and their impact on the bee population I thought well this is a little bit different from before. Now it seems that this is yet another attempt to detoxify the Tory Party using 'green issues'. Actually it is difficult to work out which needs the most detoxification Gove or the Conservative Party. So yes maybe there will be a brief mini-sparkling Wine Age before the very worst impacts of Climate Change hit us but we desperately need to be acting NOW to reduce emissions for the sake of civilization and human sentience on this planet. Even if they had the time away from their headlong pursuit of Brexit I doubt it would make them act any more responsibly.\nThanks to Ros for the picture.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2010_05/content_17.html": "A blog by Green Party Councillor Andrew Cooper about Green Politics, action on Climate Change, Kirklees Council and our activity to improve the local and global environment (and also anything that I fancy talking about) Promoted and published by A Cooper, 76 Brockholes Lane, Holmfirth HD9 7EB\nMonday, 31 May 2010\nGreen Express? That will do nicely.\nNo history of Kirklees Green Party would be complete without a chapter on the Green Express. It was in 1989 that Huddersfield Green Party ran their first charter train up the Settle Carlisle Line which was under threat of closure at the time. Our train (a DMU for train fans) was all part of a campaign to keep the line open. Since then there have been countless charter trains going all over the country, Edinburgh, Brighton, Dundee, Carlisle, Bath.\nOf course the driving force for this was our first Green Party Councillor Nick Harvey now the proprietor of Green Express Railtours though the link with the Green Party is still strong with Clive Lord OLG (Oldest Living Green) organising the Green Party fundraising trips. Beer and Sandwiches are also important, not for negotiations with Trade Unions but as a source of revenue from our train trips.\nThere's a lot of olde world charm in taking a trip on old diesel locos while drinking hand pulled real ale. There's a whole team of people who make Green Express happen. Those who make the sandwiches, sell tea and coffee off the trolley or transport all the paraphenalia at the beginning and end of trips. I've done a bit of stewarding on the trains over the years and enjoy it once or twice a year (I did a lot in the early years). So why not go on one? The next is to Eton and Windsor on Thursday 10th June. You can go to Eton to see where our Prime Minister went to school! (or go down the road to the state run primary school and see where my better half went to school!)\nFull details of Green Express Charter Trains here\nhttp://www.greenexpressrailtours.co.uk/id11.html\n(Pictured Nicky and Adrian Cruden on the Green Express with Mark Mullany in the background.)\nFriday, 28 May 2010\nLeeds Greens do a Kirklees!\nThe Leeds Green Party Councillors Anne and David Blackburn (pictured) have done good in their agreement with the Labour Party (with a bit of input from Kirklees Green Party and Labour Councillors).\nLabour needed 2 Green Councillors to run the Council and the condition of a £30 million free insulation scheme was the price. 90'000+ homes to be insulated, anywhere between £8 and £13.5 million to be saved each year in saved fuel bills. It will be the UKs biggest domestic carbon saving scheme.\nOver to you Con Dem Coalition Government - top that. Actually they cut the Low Carbon Buildings Programme this week throwing the solar thermal, biomass and heat pump industries into turmoil. Not a very good start!\nThursday, 27 May 2010\nOver 800 attend Kirklees Council meeting\nWas Kirklees proposing to build a nuclear power plant in Fixby? Wind Turbines on top of Castle Hill?\nNo it was none of these things it was in fact Kirklees Councils first live webcast of a Kirklees Council meeting so the ‘attendance’ was virtual but they attended nonetheless. This was the fulfilment of the successful Green Party motion to have meetings webcast that was passed well over a year ago. With actual attendance usually around the less than 20 mark this was a real step forward in engagement with its citizens.\nSo what did the citizens of Kirklees make of all this? Well one friend texted me to say,\n“All u do is bicker! It’s ace. If you were kids you’d have got your arses slapped”\nSo there is entertainment value at least! But what the public got was the authentic council experience. The test will be if the public view this and recoil in horror at how they are governed or regard it as robust political debate. It will be worth checking out the Huddersfield Examiner Website Forum pages for comment. That is usually a good (if not necessarily representative) source for vented spleens. Ultimately if we see a backlash we might see a change in approach in the Council and a bit less nonsense (from the Tories usually)\nFor my part I did some, but not much commentary, via twitter. I wasn’t really in the mood to be honest. I pointed out a wee bit of hypocrisy where blindingly obvious but very soon lost the will to carry on.\nThursday, 20 May 2010\nHere comes the sun\nImagine a time not very far from now. You're sitting at home minding your own business and someone knocks on your door.\n\"Hello sorry to bother you I'm calling on behalf of Kirklees Council about providing free solar panels for your house.\"\n\"This is a privately owned house the council estates round the corner\"\n\"No this offer is for private householders\"\n\"So how much do I have to pay?\"\n\"Nothing they're free\"\n\"And exactly how much has our Council Tax got to go up to pay for this so called 'free' scheme by the Council?\"\n\"Your Council Tax is unaffected the costs of the panels will be paid for via the new Feed in tariff. All you have to do is sign this form to assign the tarrif to us and you get the panels on your roof\"\n\" Well if I'm going to get no financial benefit why should I do it? I'm not one of these lentil eating, treehugging green types who fit solar panels for the good of the planet you know.\"\n\"Actually on average usage you should be able to reduce your electricity bill by about 25-30% per year using the electricity generated by your solar panels so you could save anywhere between £100 and £200 each year for as long as the panels are installed.\"\n\"Ok you can fit them but don't make a mess and can I choose the colour?\"\nSo could this happen? We might not be that far off at all. The finances certainly stack up and this week the Green Party on Kirklees got agreement from the incoming Labour Administration to draw up plans to make this a reality. There are issues to be addressed to make this a reality but they are not unsurmountable. Hopefully within the year we will have another revolutionary nation leading scheme to tackle carbon emissions, reduce fuel costs and create jobs.\nSunday, 16 May 2010\nCon-Dems. Where's the fire?\nThe Con-Dem Coalition Government has a large section on the environment. Leaving aside for a second the fact that the targets they have adopted for reducing carbon emissions are inadequate it is certainly more ambitious than the Labour Govt's programme. As always implementation is the test. It will be interesting to see how the Cons try and get round the financing of nuclear without using public money. No doubt there will be some dodge somewhere that they have in mind. We'll see.\nThere was specific mention in the Con-Dem agreement for support for a \"full establishment for a feed-in tariff for electricity\". What this means we will see but if the Tories are true to their word this will mean that solar photovoltaic installations installed prior to the 15/7/10 will qualify for the feed in tariff. There are lots of ways that this could be interpreted to be more or less generous so the devil is as always in the detail.\nThe Environment section on Energy covers most of the main high level policy areas but oddly there is no mention of the proposed Renewable Heat Incentive due to come into being next April under Labour's timetable. In what has been a fairly lacklustre performance on the renewable energy agenda by Labour this was a real innovation a genuinely ground breaking proposal. It promised a huge growth in the biomass, heat pump and solar thermal industries with users of renewable heat being rewarded with a dedicated tariff.Of course it's omission does not mean they won't pursue this policy but it certainly worth a Parliamentary Question at the very least.\nThe other Labour Government target (which they had no plan to acheive) was to insulate every loft and cavity wall in domestic properties by 2015. It would be interesting to see if this policy is retained and how it will be implemented. The Kirklees programme is due to finish in about 6 weeks with over 50'000 properties insulated in the last three years. So we have acheived the Government target 5 years ahead of target! So another Parliamentary Question worth asking Mr Chris Huhne.\nIf only we had a Green Party MP. Ah we do!\nTuesday, 11 May 2010\nFreaky Friday\nThere were lots of things that were Freaky about last Friday. The most numerically obvious one was that in both Newsome and Kirkburton Wards the Green Party got exactly the same vote - 2447. In Newsome this was enough to win it in Kirkburton unfortunately it wasn't.\nApart from the numerical freakiness the actual results didn't bear a lot of relationship to natural justice or effort expended. In the Parliamentary elections the Conservative who didn't turn up to hustings and didn't appear to have done anything much during the campaign came second. I managed 4% just ahead of the BNP thank goodness. In the rest of Kirklees the BNP beat the Greens If anything was evident from the results it was that local factors just went out of the window with national TV coverage focussing on Leaders debates and tactical voting.\nThe bright spot for Greens was the election of Caroline Lucas as the UKs first Green Party MP. A real acheivement and hopefully with far reaching consequences.\nIn the local elections our truly excellent Candidate Michelle Atkinson polled a record number of votes for us in the Kirkburton Ward but the increased General Election turnout worked in the Tories favour and we missed out by over a thousand votes.\nWe all await for the outcome of the negotiations and Nick Clegg chooses whether he wants the death of thousand cuts (Conservatives) or the death of 500 cuts (Labour). Whichever way round it is the double dip recession is already in the pipeline and whatever his choice it won't do his Party or the rest of us much good either.\nSunday, 2 May 2010\nWhat about the Community?\nOne thing that has not seen much attention during the election campaign is 'the community' and what makes the places we live and work safe, secure, enjoyable and happy places to be in.\nUltimately the community is everyones immediate environment, it is what is most important to them. When the community is working well it gives people certainty, continuity and security. The Conservative and Lib Dems have bashed Labour over bankers, the economic crisis and selling british gold cheap but what the government have done to our communities has gone largely unmentioned. Think back ten years ago to the community that perhaps you live in. How many Post Offices, shops and pubs have closed. What has happened to the bus services that have served those communities? Are they as regular or frequent as they were? Do they still exist? Was there a local Housing Office or Library? Is it still there or under threat with public spending cuts?\nOf course the economy is important but it is the impact of government policy on the places we live that matters to people in the most immediate way, because it affects all of us in our everyday lives.\nWe have to turn this around and government and Kirklees policy should be directed more at supporting and protecting locally owned shops and businesses and public services in our comunities not big deals with big supermarkets that threaten those local businesses survival.\nUltimately the 'big idea' is not the big deal with a supermarket chain, such as the Kirklees deal with Tescos, but one which places the importance of locally owned and managed shops and services at the forefront. Thinking at the smallest level gives us the biggest gains as a society and as such the strength of our communities should be at the centre of government policy not an afterthought.\n(Picture - Green Valley Grocer - Slaithwaite)\nSaturday, 1 May 2010\nThe strange case of the Invisible Tory Candidate\nRumour has it that there is a Conservative Candidate standing for Parliament in Huddersfield. For 5 out of the 6 Hustings I and the other candidates attended she was conspicuous by our her absence. She only appeared at the Churches Together hustings following her non attendance was made an issue by the Huddersfield Examiner. She said she attended that one because it was a Church invite but that contradicts the email she sent to the NUT which said she wasn't going to attend any hustings.\nWhen Roy Hattersley didn't attend 'Have I got news for you' they substituted him for a tub of lard. But what would be most appropriate for a non present Conservative? Answers on a postcard please!\nMy blog postings have been limited of late due to election work but I intend to give a reflections on elections post shortly sometime next week.\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2012_03_greens-proposes-shepley-library-rescue_html/content_309.html": "| Shepley Parish Cllr Michelle Atkinson, Robert Barraclough and Cllr Derek Hardcastle at Shepley Library |\nShepley Library is one of a number of libraries threatened with closure or a reduced service under Kirklees Council’s review following cuts to council budgets, despite it being well used by the local community. Figures provided by Kirklees have indicated that the current Shepley Library staffed costs are around £24,000 a year. Coincidentally the funding for 2011/12 that is allocated to the Kirkburton area through the Area Committee is underspent by a similar amount.\nGreen Party Councillor Derek Hardcastle said,\n“ This funding is not allocated to any projects and I will propose at Area Committee on Wednesday 21st March, (which is the final Area Committee meeting in this financial year) to allocate these unutilised funds, to the libraries budget and to specifically earmarked those funds to retain a fully staffed service at Shepley Library. No changes to the library service are due to occur in 2012/13 so this funding would be allocated for the 2013/14 financial year. This would give us 2 years to plan a secure funded future for the library when the funding outlook may be more optimistic. Our proposal would be at no additional cost to the Council Tax payer and would give us the breathing space we need to produce a plan for a sustainable future for this vital community facility. All Shepley Library needs now is the support of my 2 Kirkburton Ward Councillors (colleagues from the Conservative Party) to agree this proposal at Wednesday’s Joint Area Committee Meeting, and then we can put this proposal forward to the Council.”\nFurthermore Green Party Councillors on Kirkburton Parish Council are calling for a dialogue with Kirklees Council to secure existing library services across the Kirkburton Parish. The Parish area has Kirklees Libraries in Shepley, Kirkburton, Kirkheaton and Lepton plus mobile library services covering other villages.\n“ We do not want our Library facilities to be picked off one by one. We want a secure future for libraries which are some of Kirklees Councils only contact point in many communities”. said Councillor Robert Barraclough who is a Kirkburton Parish Councillor.\n“ If we lose those services we will lose them forever so this is a crucial time to ensure buildings, services and staff are retained. We believe we have a very positive proposal here where Area Committee funding for Shepley Library and a Parish wide approach to address the wider issue is the best way forward.”\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2018_05_more-reflections-on-2018-kirklees_html/content_726.html": "The headline news was that Labour has taken control of Kirklees Council as well as Plymouth. In reality Labour has pretty much had control anyway in any meaningful sense due to a politically divided opposition. Some times we have used our votes to influence Labour but generally the Cabinet System gives them a disproportional amount of power over the day to day running of the Council. This is of course compounded by the electoral system which means that Labour with 43% of the votes gets 100% of the power.\nSo what about the notable individual contests. We know Labour had higher ambitions than their achievements which of course is not a bad thing. Certain currently high ranking Labour Councillors had said they were going to win Newsome but of course that didn't happen. More surprising to me was Almondbury. You really got the impression from social media that Labour had thrown everything but the kitchen sink at Almondbury. Shadow Ministerial visits, lots of activists flooding the place, a personable candidate. I mean with a slogan like 'Peace for Almondbury' how can you not win? They didn't and I guess all credit to the Lib Dems for holding on. I remember bumping into a now former Lib Dem Councillor who expressed what I thought was undue confidence about Almondbury, clearly he was right. So my former Kirkburton Parish Council colleague Alison Munro is the new Councillor for Almondbury. She must have worked and walked her socks off, so much respect to her in what must have been a fairly tough contest.\nWe heard rumours about Crosland Moor and Netherton Ward and the challenge from Mike Forster of TUSC and 'Hands off HRI' but the challenge from him fell short and he came 3rd. A consistent, dedicated campaign from a Party willing to put 2 to 3 years of quality work into the ward could take it off Labour I would have thought, as things stand given their level of visibility in the ward. But a short term campaign is not the way these sort of things happen.\nA word or two about Kirkburton and Denby Dale. The Conservatives got re-elected to both with less than 50% of the vote. In Kirkburton Greens are the main challengers and in Denby Dale it is Labour. We had at one time sought an arrangement with Labour on this but culturally &/constitutionally this does not seem possible for Labour so no 'Progressive Alliance' here. Not entirely sure I like the idea anyway. Commiserations to our Kirkburton Candidate, Derek Hardcastle who was unsuccessful on this occasion.\nHolme Valley North Ward, where I live, proved to be an interesting contest. The Labour Candidate was definitely putting the effort in and was door knocking earlier in the year than is common among many. I was disappointed to get a letter from her with an endorsement from the Independent Councillor Edgar Holroyd Doveton who said he was supporting the 'person' not the 'label'. The only problem was that he didn't reveal that the person was his partner. When I pointed this out on Facebook. I got a bit of abuse from Labour folks who equated what I was saying with 'anti Corbyn smears' and the other bizarre comment was about a person 'not having to be defined by who their partner was'. Sure but not revealing the relationship and trying to appear objective when you simply couldn't be was obviously a mistake.\nLabour won, and the Lib Dems lost both Colne Valley and Golcar Wards, which is where Labour got their Council majority. It was very close in both and the Lib Dems will be kicking themselves over what they could have done. I guess these will continue to be hotly contested Wards.\nFrom a wider Green Party perspective I was pleased to see us achieve 8% of the vote in Greenhead and Holme Valley South Wards with no campaigning. This does make you wonder what would happen if we actually were able to put in a decent effort there. Worth thinking about.\nOf course in many of the wards in Kirklees the toughest part is getting selected usually by the Labour Party and there are unfortunately no real contests in those wards. Labour had a leaflet go out in North Kirklees wards which had an unfortunate reference to the 'Tories shitting on us' due to a bit of cut and paste from a website so I understand. Happy to agree generally with the sentiment but it just shows how unprofessional Labour can be and still get away with it.

Modesty prevents me from pointing out that it was actually me who kicked off this campaign earlier this year. Now Barry Sheerman will apparently be joining us at the official launch of the signs tomorrow. It's like the free insulation scheme all over again, everyone wants a share of the glory and why not.\nThe important thing of course is that we will have boundary markers which will help give the town more of a distinct identity from Kirklees (which is in Calderdale). There is a wider question of ' What is our vision for Huddersfield?'. The growing danger is that once people head over the Huddersfield border they will hit a ring road lined with supermarkets with a town full of empty shops. Then we will need another sign on New Street saying 'You are now in the 'dead centre' of Huddersfield'\nThe attached photo is from when I kicked off the campaign for Huddersfield signs and is my personal entry for the ' Glum Councillors' blog http://glumcouncillors.tumblr.com/\nGreat to be giving a sense of identity back to Huddersfield.

One moment in time I captured on camera was the move from orange sodium streetlights to pearly white LED ones with 50% of the energy demand and 50% of the cost. A positive all ways round you would think except that some people liked the warm orange glow and others thought is gave a better light. This demonstrates the first law of change - \"You can't please all of the people all of the time\".\nOther changes are more symbolic but nonetheless filled with significance. The move from paper £5 notes to plastic ones was interesting in many ways. On the reverse side we lost social reformer and Quaker Elizabeth Fry and gained former Tory Prime Minister Winston Churchill whose very chequered political past has been largely forgotten due to the strong, inspiring and necessary leadership he provided in World War 2. It was, however, the material rather than the images on it that had the most impact on me. We had moved from paper, a renewable resource, to plastic a byproduct of the fossil fuel industry. The £5 note, as a symbol of our economy, showed that the Bank of England investing in a non renewable resource (even if it is longer lasting and can survive a washing machine) and as such is a symbol of the problem with how UK Government policies on energy are fundamentally flawed on climate change with support for renewables and energy efficiency dumped in favour of fracking and nuclear.\nCompared with the worldwide subsidy of fossil fuels, the changing of the material for a few billion worth of UK bank notes is small fry. It is estimated, by the International Monetary Fund, that worldwide fossil fuels are subsidised to the tune of $5.3Trillion each and every year. On Tuesday I was interviewed by Talk Radio who asked me to comment on the £100/year on UK domestic energy bills to support renewables and energy efficiency programmes. This is peanuts when compared to the huge tax breaks and other subsidies enjoyed by fossil fuel companies and generators and this will be something I will be pointing out at every opportunity when I attend the World Climate Summit on Climate Change, COP22 in Marrakech next month. The shift we need at Marrakech is to put the subsidy we give to climate destroying fossil fuels into sustainable sources of renewable energy and energy efficiency to limit demand for heat and power.\nIf we do invest $5.3 Trillion a year towards a sustainable future maybe then we could symbolically return to paper based money, sourced from recycled materials but who would we have on the back of the £5 note? Answers on a post consumer waste postcard please.\nThe new fivers can shrink in a washing machine so be aware. Only wash them on a low heat - although why anyone would risk a charge of money laundering is beyond me.\nReplyDelete",

Nearly a thousand seed potatoes were sold for the bargain price of 10p each. There were around a dozen varieties covering the first early, second early and maincrop categories. The event started at 10.00am and by 1.00pm they we were down to around one variety of second earlies which didn't seem to sell for some strange reason. They were 'slug resistant' which I think people took to mean 'even the slugs won't eat these!' There were seeds to swap, homemade cakes, jams and chutneys to purchase, cut price fleece to protect plants from frost and I was outside helping flog our bargain £5 fruit trees as part of the Newsome Thousand Fruit Tree project. We shifted about 40 fruit trees and we were had more exotic fruits this year, including greengage, quince, plums, pears as well as eating and cooking apples. It was certainly buzzing in the morning and a good number of folks stayed on for lunch of baked potato and beans which sold out.

This is positive but what is lacking is a financially sustainable model, which can deliver improvement to homes at scale to a zero-energy standard. Our proposal based on the Energiesprong (energy leap) model addresses this and provides a way of building the capacity and capability to deliver for owner occupiers and the wider housing sector.\nEnergiesprong work with local Councils on developing a programme to deliver warmer homes through a retrofit programme delivering a home which is net zero energy, meaning it generates the total amount of energy required for its heating, hot water and electrical appliances. It also provides superior indoor comfort. This is achieved using prefabricated facades, insulated rooftops with solar panels, smart heating, and ventilation and cooling installations. A refurbishment comes with a long-year performance warranty on both the indoor climate and the energy performance for up to 40 years. A complete home makeover can be completed in as little as a day!\nEnergiesprong are not a contractor themselves but work with councils to help procure contractors to deliver to the Energiesprong specification.\nCouncils such as Nottingham, Exeter and a number of London Boroughs are already working together on Energiesprong projects as part of the Retrofit Accelerator Homes Investment Partnership. They share best practice and expertise and have been successful in a number of funding bids to government drawing in millions to support the development of the Energiesprong model.\nHow much does it cost?\nThe cost for an initial 50 properties would be around £85,000/property. The expectation is that for future rounds of properties that this would reduce to around £55,000/property as economies of scale are realised.\nHow is it paid for?\nThere is some initial outlay for setting up the Energiesprong approach through the Housing Revenue Account but as the capital costs come down the expectation is that it would become self-financing through lower maintenance and servicing costs e.g., no gas safety checks, lower maintenance etc and through charging a comfort charge to the tenant. Energiesprong guarantee that the fuel bill that the tenants pay plus the comfort charge will be less than they were paying in energy costs for their home before refurbishment.\nhttps://www.energiesprong.uk/\nhttps://www.energiesprong.uk/newspage/innovation-partnership-why-a-new-approach-to-retrofit-procurement-is-key-to-net-zero\nhttps://www.ukgbc.org/news/nottingham-first-to-adopt-revolutionary-energiesprong-housing-approach/\nPassivhaus or equivalent as standard on all Council new build projects\n5 years after the all party Passivhaus group recommended that the Council build its new developments to the passivhaus standard Kirklees is now doing a pilot project on 12 houses. The lack of a policy on the standard for new build housing in Kirklees at a time when we ought to be leading by example is shameful. The purpose of the pilot has not been explained. What can be learnt by building in Kirklees that can’t be learnt from more progressive Councils in other parts of the country such as Exeter City Council? The lack of a policy is expensive as one-off projects like Kirklees passivhaus pilot come at a cost premium. Having a high energy efficiency standard means developers can invest in skills locally, build capacity and the capability to deliver to the passivhaus standard or equivalent. We should also be seeking funding from the West Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority to help pay for the 4% uplift in costs through gainshare or other regional funding sources.\nhttps://www.apse.org.uk/apse/index.cfm/news/articles/20181/passivhaus-exeter-city-council-leading-by-example/#\nSolar PV Panels on all Council new build projects as standard\nWith rising energy prices we need to find ways of reducing energy demand in the home. So, as well as ‘fabric first’ insulation measures we also should use renewables as much as possible on site.\nFunding could be sought from Combined Authority Gainshare funding but failing that HRA funds could be utilised to achieve this.\n|\n| Cllr Karen Allison |\nEngaging the community in climate action Tackling climate change has got to be made real to local people. Involving people in positive projects helps give people a sense of well being and not just thinking they are at the mercy of decisions by national governments and decisions at global climate summits.\nWe can help them feel empowered and involved in addressing the threat to all our futures. For the next 2 years through the Place partnerships, we wish to support a range of community lead projects to address climate change.\nThis could be improving the energy efficiency of public buildings, tree planting, projects to support biodiversity and nature-based flood prevention measures.\nLearning from others\nKirklees needs to approach its role in addressing climate change with humility. We frequently hear from Labour Cabinet members about how we are ‘the best’ in this policy area. We aren’t. There are positive things happening on the climate agenda in Kirklees but we are not forerunners or innovators in addressing climate change. The lack of a climate action plan lead to the Council getting a 0% rating from Climate Emergency UK earlier this year. Joining the Global Covenant of Mayors would provide us with valuable insight and support form the international community of local and regional authorities addressing climate change. It works to provide value to participating councils by mobilizing the critical financing and technical assistance that members require to access investment. The Global Covenant of Mayors ensures that signatories are continuously supported in their efforts. Cities receive step-by-step guidance and have access to tools, materials, and a dedicated regional/national helpdesk.\nhttps://www.globalcovenantofmayors.org/\nRenewable energy installations in schools\nThe pupils of today are the citizens of the tomorrow. Showing them that renewable energy helps power their school be it from wind, solar or other renewables is a positive for learning and gives a demonstration of hope for a better future.\nFor this scheme we will seek funding through a Community Municipal Investment/ Climate Bond issue. These have been successful in West Berkshire Council and the London Borough of Islington and provide a return to community investors.\nhttps://info.westberks.gov.uk/wbcmi\nhttps://www.abundanceinvestment.com/invest-now/municipal-investments\nMobilising the community to help tackle the cost of living crisis\nThe massive hike in energy bills caused in large part by our dependence on fossil fuels is something that Kirklees Council needs to mobilise itself to address, and a single budget amendment is not the way to do that. There are things we can do though and establishing a fuel poverty fund to help improve the energy efficiency of people living in cold homes in the owner occupied and private sector. We will seek initially to fund this through a charitable trust that the council will establish and seek contributions too through a variety of methods including an appeal through the Council Tax mailing.\nSimilar charitable trusts have been established in other parts of the country and have raised hundreds of thousands of pounds. It has initially been tried in rich Council areas in the south of England but it is worth trying here to bolster and support work being done on broader poverty issues by a range of third sector organisations.\n|\n| Cllr Sue Lee-Richards |\nSupporting active travel We lack a programme to support the development of a protected cycleway network in Kirklees. This proposal will kick start that programme and we would push for a reprioritisation of the West Yorkshire Transport Fund away from road building and road widening projects.\nSafer streets for all\nThose of us who have tried to get traffic calming to make people feel safer in their communities from speeding traffic have frequently been frustrated.\nGreen Councillors have prioritised ward budgets, public realm funding and any other funds we could use to get roads traffic calmed to make roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists. This has been in the face of limited budgets and against Kirklees Highways policy. We need sustained funding to support area wide traffic calming on residential roads so we are able to respond positively to community concerns, take a preventative approach to traffic speeds rather than one rationed on the basis of injury accidents.\nBetter adult social care\nPositive work was carried out a few years ago by the Administration helping establish Valley Care a community based care cooperative. Our proposal is to provide staff to support the development of Community Based Care Cooperatives in Kirklees. Members of the Care Cooperatives will have a stake in the organisation they work for and the emphasis is on care not the profit motive.\nWe will support the development of Care Cooperatives that will operate on the basis of reinvesting surpluses in improving and extending the services they offer to provide a wide range of care services.\nThese cooperatives will provide all staff with at least the living wage, a training programme which supports development and progression. This model of care provision will also play a role in raising standards in the wider care sector.\nhttps://www.valleycare.coop/\nUnder development – An Employers Workplace Parking Levy\nWe believe establishing a workplace parking levy to support public transport and active travel in Kirklees is worth investigating further. Employers with fewer than 10 parking spaces pay nothing at all. Employers offering more than 10 parking spaces pay a fee of £1.17 per day per parking space. There are exemptions for local emergency services, NHS frontline staff and blue badge holders.\nIn Nottingham, the Workplace Parking Levy on employers has raised more than £9 million each year, with the revenue used to fund tram infrastructure, a smart card scheme, electric buses and cycling facilities. Leicester are also looking at introducing a Workplace Parking Levy.\nKirklees Climate Commission\nWe are disappointed that there appears to be no dedicated budget line in the Administration’s budget for Kirklees Climate Commision (KCC). Given the importance the Administration have placed on setting up KCC and their position as vice chair we would have expected to see a dedicated budget that KCC would manage independently of the council to facilitate administration, sourcing third party research and working in the communities' interest.\nWe would hope that the council can rectify this outside the 2022-23 budget process so the KCC can establish independence in order to demonstrate a degree of self-determination that they can exercise in collaboration with other partners such as the Chamber of Commerce, University of Huddersfield and others.",

Of course I checked out the rail\nalternative to Dusseldorf and it added another couple of days onto the travel\narrangements and so I had to give it a miss.

This is of course just scratching the surface\nof the environmental impact of air travel and flights can quickly negate a lot\nof positive work done to reduce carbon emissions through conservation and use\nof renewable energy. This is why we have\ncharacters like Richard Branson trying to find ‘techno fixes’ such as bio fuels\nto power his planes.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2011_09/content_264.html": "I did wonder whether or not it was coincidence that the Annual Meeting of the Inland Flood Risk Management Group meeting was help on the top floor of the Local Government Association’s HQ in Smiths Square, London. Did they know something the rest of us didn’t or were they just being overly cautious?\n| Flooding in Armitage Bridge 2008 |\nThis was the first meeting of the group I had been to as their incoming Chair. The outgoing Chair for the last 4 years Cllr Mike Haines was leading proceedings and my role was very much to meet people and pick up the key issues and debate on current matters regarding flood risk. We started off with an interesting presentation on SUDS or Sustainable Drainage Systems to you and me. The basic issue is that due to climate change we are getting much more sustained heavy rain events. This coupled with the growth of impermeable concrete and tarmac surfaces (and less green fields for water to drain into) means that flooding events are becoming much more common. Events such as the Armitage Bridge flood is just one example among a growing number of flash floods that have affected communities. So flooding is not just about rising sea levels it is also about the capacity of our current drainage systems to cope with increasingly heavy rainfall. SUDS are techniques and methods of reducing run off of rainwater into conventional drainage systems. This could mean use of permeable paving or reed beds to aid slow release of rainwater into drains. This clearly is an issue for Planning Committees to consider and the draft National Planning Policy Framework also has things to say about SUDS. So I suppose you might expect SUDS would be used in all developments if we want to reduce flooding risk. Unfortunately it is not quite that simple. The message from DEFRA in the meeting was quite clear and it could be summed up as follows, “To promote growth regulation should not add cost”. So if SUDS are likely to make a development morecostly and so unviable then the developer could simply argue that they don’t want to do it and proceed with a conventional drainage solution. The question I asked was, “The National Planning Policy Framework has a ‘presumption in favour of sustainable development’. If the developer says it is unaffordable to put in a Sustainable Drainage System it is by definition ‘unsustainable’ does this make it fundamentally out of step with the principles of the NPPF?” Well the question got a few knowing laughs from those present as we all basically knew that arguments for economic growth are paramount in the NPPF and ‘sustainability’ is so ill defined as to be meaningless anyway. The truth is that SUDS can in many cases be cheaper to install and maintain than conventional drainage systems but my principle concern is that standards and principles of development and regulation itself can be set aside in the name of economic growth. As a Green it is a principle for me that we don’t compromise our environment as ultimately this does not make economic sense. In actuality how much of an issue will this be? I guess the proof of the pudding is in the eating so we’ll have to wait and see but my concerns were certainly shared by many of the local authority officers at the meeting one of whom without a trace of irony said SUDS appears to be being ‘watered down’. A local SUDS Advisory Board will decide what is viable/affordable but I guess the question is what happens if there is a dispute with the developer? Is there an appeal process?\nLord Chris Smith, former Labour Cabinet Minister and current Chairman of the Environment Agency, spoke about the separation of responsibility for surface water flooding and watercourses from them to Local Authorities. They have also been holding capacity building workshops for Local Authorities to help them with their new responsibilities and around 96% of Local Authorities have been involved in these which is pretty impressive. The key concern for the Environment Agency like many bodies is reduced funding and reduced capacity. It has a stretching target of giving 145,000 houses better flood defences yet has fewer officers on the ground and will be commenting only on high risk planning applications. The concern is that applications which might have been improved or benefitted from their input will now slip through the net.\nAll in all this was a useful primer for me to get a background in the key issues and test out some opinions on people who are much better informed than I am. I’m looking forward to learning much more about flood risk over the next year.",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2016_09/content_6.html": "| Huddersfield's Coat of Arms |\nKirklees Council will never be loved. It is an artificial construct of disparate communities and towns brought together under local government reorganisation in 1974. Kirklees has done some marvellous things and made some mistakes over the years but it we'll never achieve the semi mythical status of the Huddersfield Borough Council in the eyes of many older/voting resident. Comparisons aren't really fair as the pressures and responsibilities of the old Huddersfield Council doesn't compare with that of modern day Kirklees. You also have the misconception in North Kirklees that all the money goes to Huddersfield and in Huddersfield that all the money goes to North Kirklees. Around the margins some areas may get a bit more money based on whoever happens to be running the Council at the time but largely the increasingly meagre pot of money is distributed according to need. As funding for the services Kirklees provides is withdrawn by Central Government a greater proportion of that funding will have to be directed at those in the greatest need and so the Council will be largely funding adult social care and vulnerable children's services. Funding for things people care about in their communities such as libraries , museums, roads, street cleaning will all diminish hugely. It doesn't look like Kirklees Council will be loved any more any time soon! Nor will it be abolished. Requests to halve it quarter it and establish new councils have been rejected by Governments of all hues over the years. Love it, or more likely, loathe it, Kirklees isn't going anywhere fast!\nSo why and how a Huddersfield Town Council? We have a Town Council in Kirklees now. Meltham is a Town Council. We also have Parish Councils in Mirfield, Kirkburton, Holme Valley and Denby Dale. In Kirkburton through a Green Party initiative, supported by Independents and most Parties, we developed a successful plan to save Kirkburton Library (there was no other plan!) Without the Parish Council it is unlikely that the building would have remained open and would probably have ended up as a large private bungalow or a small supermarket. Similarly in Skelmanthorpe there has been another asset transfer of the Library to Denby Dale Parish Council.

After a jigsaw of fundraising and real commitment from the folks at Newsome South Methodist their solar panels are on. This is only part of the story. More insulation has gone into the roof and better controls. It is great to have yet another solar project in the Newsome Ward. Hart Street, Ing Lane Bungalows next!\nI am Counting on\nReplyDeleteEnergy From GOD Our Sun Free Energy. Very good our churches installing solar panels. For all that live near by and all that see this on our Churches. If your Local Government will not look to the Future go to a Church.\nThe Island of Maui in the Pacific Ocean is truly a Tropical Paradise like many of the Hawaii Islands that has used Solar and wind Energy for many years. Its Seascapes are as Beautiful as its Landscapes. Many like Hana’s by Kipahulu in Maui were the coffee maker runs on the Sun Solar Power. Her freshly picked Tropical fruit smoothies are the greatest. You make the electrical power on a bicycle for the blender to run. Banana, Mango, Papaya, Guava and of course My favorite Coconut and Pineapple are just some of what you can make.\nMany of us that live and visit Maui already have Solar and Wind Energy. Very soon many more will and some day most all will be cutting the line to the Power Utilities Grid. Stopping them from putting their hands in our pocket book.\nFree Energy from the Sun. WHY pay for it, to some one else? Your Local Utility Provider is NOT A valuable resource in Your Time Of Financial Need. Or the GOV they just want to TAX you more. LOOK TO SOLAR AND WIND ENERGY on the internet it has been the learning platform for our Schools and Universities for Years. In this case look to the House of GOD. It has always been the best place for the truth. The Church and the Bible.\nMany in the Island of Maui and other Islands have been off the Grid for years.\nThere are many Reasons Home Owners Should Consider Going Solar there has to be at least 100 Good Reasons. Soon Hawaii will Lead with showcasing Solar Energy To the World.\nGOD Bless for the good work all do to Help the Church Light the Way.\nNow if we can only get our World Leaders to Read the Bible More, and look to the real Paradise Heaven not Hell, and stay out of our Pocket books.\nThe Lord’s little Helper\nPaul Felix Schott",

That became obvious, with stark clarity at last night's Kirklees Full Council meeting.\nI had resubmitted a motion that the Green Group had submitted to the last Full Council. This motion called for West Yorkshire Combined Authority to withdraw £100 million of support for the expansion of Leeds Bradford Airport. This motion despite my best efforts had fallen off the end of the agenda at the last meeting. This time in an effort to get it debated I withdrew a long standing Green motion that was nearer the beginning of the agenda and asked the Council to allow us to have the Leeds Bradford Airport motion heard in its place. This was rejected by Labour. When we got to near the end of the Council meeting there was a call from Labour, under Council rules to have their motion on Universal Credit voted on without debate. Quickly I asked for the same for our motion on Leeds Bradford Airport. We backed Labour to ensure their motion was put before the Council but then Labour, (with one or two honorable exceptions) voted against our motion being put. They really didn't want to discuss or vote on the motion at all.\nAnticipating that this would happen, earlier in the meeting, I had submitted a question to the Deputy Leader of the Council, Councillor Peter McBride which said,\n\"Will you be calling for West Yorkshire Combined Authority to withdraw the £100 million of support it is providing for the expansion of Leeds Bradford Airport in light of the Climate Emergency that we and they have declared?\"\nHis simple, unadorned, one word answer was \"No\". I pushed him in my supplementary question for a more serious answer to my question, to which he answered saying that the funding was for some sort of Park and Ride scheme and he effectively said it was nothing to do with airport expansion. There was clearly an illogical disconnect in his mind between developing extra transport capacity to Leeds Bradford Airport and its expansion.\nCouncillor McBride was also in the hot seat that evening to talk about progress under his Cabinet Portfolio. He mentioned that the Council would be promoting high energy efficiency standards in new housing. I welcomed this but then highlighted the 'performance gap' issue where housing, built supposedly in accordance with current building regulations, were using twice as much energy in operation as expected. So much as he might believe he was promoting high efficiency buildings that might not actually be the case in practice. As in previous meetings I then suggested the Council adopt 'Passivhaus' standards for new buildings which have a quality assurance system which ensures that buildings actually perform as expected and use around 75% less energy than a building built to current Building Regulation standards. I and Councillor Marchington from the Lib Dems highlighted other Councils that had successfully applied Passivhaus standards in new housing\nincluding the Sterling Prize winning 100 house scheme in Norwich. Councillor McBride then repeated a number of misunderstandings and myths around Passivhaus costs and the supposed complexity of living in a Passivhaus. This pretty much indicated that this wasn't a route he was going to go down.\nWe had considered Passivhaus in detail in the Climate Emergency Working Group where a lot of these issues that Cllr McBride raised were dealt with through evidence provided by an Observer on the Working Group, Chris Herring from the Passivhaus Trust . Hopefully some positive recommendations on the subject will appear in the Final Report. We will see.\nWhat struck me is that even if the Final Report from the Climate Emergency Working Group is as radical and inspiring as I hope it is then it has the hurdle to overcome of the Labour Cabinet. After last nights performance I doubt the Council will do anything other than a very mediocre response to the very real Climate Emergency we face. Unfortunately mediocre doesn't cut it.\n.",

The Jackroyd Lane site is part of a green corridor that goes all the way up to Castle Hill and land at Blue Bell Hill and provides recreational space for people in the middle of a built up area between Newsome and Taylor Hill. The importance of access to nearby green spaces for good mental health has become really clear to so many of us through the covid lockdown. Kirklees needs to protect green land not build on it. There are plenty of brownfield sites we should develop on if we really care about our local environments.”\nCouncillor Karen Allison said,\n“The access to both sites is very poor with narrow roads through built up residential areas towards the fields the Council wants to build on. It would mean lots more traffic on what are currently quiet estates. It will also be a nightmare for residents during the construction phase.”\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper said,\n“We are not NIMBYs, and we want development in the Newsome Ward. We have been actively seeking to encourage new homes on the Newsome Mills, a brownfield site, where there is good access. This makes far more sense than Kirklees proposals to build on local green fields. They should drop these plans and respect the views of local people\"\n| Jackroyd Lane protest |\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Despite this I have still got a number of things to report back on in from the past year.\nI spoke out at the Kirklees Council Budget meeting this year against the cuts which were being imposed on us by central government. I and my Green Party colleagues are opposed to the reductions in budgets and services for elderly and disabled people. Green Councillors engaged fully with the budget process to understand in detail what the implicatoions of the cuts were and what, if any room for manoeuvre there was and in truth there was very little. What disappointed me was real cuts in provision being presented by the Labour Party as ‘improvements’. We should be straight with people about the impact of decisions we make even if they are unpopular.\nI was actively involved in the protest on the land between New Laithe Hill and High Lane earlier this year. It was great to see so many people turn out and the photograph of the crowd there has been used on a number of times in the Examiner highlighting our opposition. The land is used regularly by walkers,especially dog walkers & children as recreation area's If this land and the land adjacent to Jackroyd Lane and Newsome Road was developed Newsome would lose its individual identity and become an extension of the town centre.\nI also spoke out at the scrutiny enquiry into the future management of council housing in Kirklees. I thought that the proposals to include non housing services in the new contract needed more work to see if they would benefit tenants and also that there had not been enough information or consultation with tenants on how the new proposals would affect them. I am pleased that this matter was then referred back to Cabinet and it has now been agreed that the management contract will continue on the existing terms until more information has been provided to tenants and that tenants and there representatives will be fully consulted to see if they agree with any proposed changes before they are implemented.\nMy main activity this year as a Councillor has been to take up local issues and concerns. Here are just some examples\n• I asked Kirklees Highways to address an issue on Colne Street, Aspley by the carpet warehouse and the Flyboat Pub where the road surface was worn down to the cobbles in places and had numerous potholes.\n• I sought to get a supply of grit for the residents of Aspley some of whom are unsteady on their feet.\n• Another road issue I took up was potholes on Daisy Royd Newsome.\n• Drains on Cross Lane Primrose Hill were overflowing at the bottom end of the road and I asked Kirklees Highways to get these cleared.\n• I was contacted by local residents about Bankfield House in Taylor Hill. Planning permission was granted in 2008 and the site was secured, work started and construction materials were brought onto site. However nothing has happened for the last couple of years and residents are concerned that the site is not secure and boundary panels frequently fall over or are vandalised. I asked the Council to contact the owners to ensure the site was properly secured. This is an issue I’ll be keeping a close eye on\n• I have taken up a number of complaints regarding empty properties around the Newsome Ward. At a time when we are under pressure by the Council and central government to build more houses it makes no sense that we have so many standing empty\nThese are the ‘bread and butter’ issues of being a local Councillor which affect people’s everyday lives.\nI’ve played a key role in getting the thousands of leaflets out to you that we get printed and distributed using our own funds and legwork.

We weren’t willing to accept large reductions in care for vulnerable people, and so we took an opposing position (along with the verbal abuse from the 3 larger parties) We are confident we did the right thing.\nFebruary Kirklees successfully gained Fairtrade status, and many community groups, children’s centres and schools joined us in celebrating this achievement during Fairtrade fortnight. The Fairtrade Foundation was successful in gaining the world record for the longest length of bunting and it was all made from Fairtrade cotton. Many of the bunting triangles came from Kirklees. In February I was being re-elected as Chairperson of Newsome Ward Community Forum. The title of Chairperson gives the impression of leading on the work we do, and in some cases that is true, but in other cases, the team just tell me what to do now!\nFebruary included the ongoing debates over the budget and we continued to champion the needs of vulnerable people. We also had a visit from Caroline Lucas Green Party MP, and I hosted the public meeting where she addressed a large crowd, supported by our Andrew. The questions from the public were constructive and considered.\nIn March I went to a free conference provided by the Local Government Association about Localism. I know many people are anxious about the bits of information in the news and how it would affect local people. The conference didn’t help much, it focussed mainly on Social Enterprises and working with the voluntary sector; something I already do a lot of and is commonplace across Kirklees.\nApril I lead on arrangements for a street party in my neighbourhood for the Royal Wedding, and it was great to see so many people, from many different backgrounds, come out to celebrate just being British. April was also very busy with the build up to the local elections, but also very enjoyable, as I got to speak to many positive people.\nMay: What a great result in the Local Elections! I was delighted to have won so convincingly with over 50% of the vote. Thank you to all of you who believe in me – I won’t let you down.\nFollowing the elections I was reappointed as Lead Member for the Council’s Overview and Scrutiny Panel for Resources. It oversees very complex fast moving issues due to the need to restructure the Council due to big reductions in Council budgets. Trying to save £83m without impacting on front line services will be difficult to achieve, e.g. front line workers need to do their own admin / office work as back of house staff are reduced, so they can’t be out doing their main role as much as they used to.\nIn June I was appointed to the Board of Trustees for the One Community Foundation. It was established in May 2010, to generate financial support for local community activities. Our role is to build and manage a series of endowment funds, so that we can make a lasting contribution across Kirklees, by delivering grants to local groups and the wider community. You can help raise funds by doing your on-line Christmas shopping via http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/causes/onecommunity\nIn July, I made time to do a sponsored Dragon Boat Race for the Huddersfield Rotary, and I got to Captain their team. The majority of the money raised went to the two hospices, with a little of the profits going to their local charity funds. I also managed to do the Race for Life this year, I’d not been able to do it for a couple of years, and it was great to be a part of it again.\nThe Newsome Out To Play sub group of the community forum gained funding to develop local play opportunities for children of all ages, arrange training for volunteers, enable better co-ordination of activity, etc. One of the highlights of the year was the Play Day event on 3rd August; I was amazed by how many people joined in.\nAugust: Newsome High School had tremendous GCSE results, and is going from strength to strength. I’ve been a Governor at the school for several years and I’m so pleased with the continual improvements and achievements.\nSeptember: Members of CPRE (Campaign for the Protection of Rural England) arranged for us to talk to local residents at a public meeting in Hall Bower Chapel, which was very helpful. Andrew and I were able to share our views about the impending Localism Bill and the National Planning Policy Framework, and listen to concerns of local people.\nOctober: While I was Mayor of Kirklees, I chose to champion local farming and local food production, and this campaign had several lasting legacies. In October I was delighted to help present awards to several more schools who have achieved the Soil Association Food for Life Bronze Awards. We now have 24 local schools who have achieved this award and 25 more progressing towards it. The School Catering Service itself has achieved the Soil Association’s Bronze Food for Life Catering Mark for its healthy meals supplied to 184 schools across Kirklees. The March figures show that Kirklees Catering Service was the second largest local authority caterer in the country and the only one in the Yorkshire and Humber region to have achieved this award.\nNovember:\nThere is a Special Meeting of Council scheduled for 23rd November regarding the LDF, which hadn’t taken place at the time of writing this report. We will do all we can to influence the LDF policies; to protect our valuable open spaces, to ensure there is space for agriculture, and to ensure development is targeted at the real needs of our communities.\nDecember: We’ve arranged a Special Public meeting for 1st December to help raise awareness about Welfare Reform. Another huge challenge facing everyone is the cuts to benefits, there are 47 in total which are being introduced in stages until April 2013. One of the biggest changes will be the Housing Benefit changes which will be introduced in January. Council have produced an information booklet to try and help. Copies are available at Together Shop in Newsome, as well as Children’s Centres, Council Information Points and Job Centre Plus.\nThe Budget process starts again in December, meaning another series of briefings and debates on the best way to manage the huge reduction in funds provided by the Government. It’s a position no one would want to be in and some tough decisions will need to be made. I’m not looking forward to it, but I do take it very seriously and will be taking an active part in the process.\nThe ‘Kiddies Xmas Party’ takes place again on 10th December, all organised by volunteers of Newsome Ward Community Forum, and always a wonderful occasion; the start of the Christmas season for me. I’ll be doing the ‘Santa Dash’, organised by the Lions Club of Huddersfield, in Huddersfield the next day to help raise funds for the Mayor’s Charity Appeal – the ‘Forget Me Not Trust’; a very seasonal weekend.\nThroughout the year, casework for individuals seems to be getting more complex; I’ve helped people with things that are common concerns e.g. planning, highways, cleansing issues, but this year there seems to be an increasing number of more personal issues, e.g. home care, care for people with dementia, domestic violence, and anti-social behaviour.\nDespite this sad note to end on, I am looking forward to Christmas and wish you all warmth, health and happiness this Christmas and for the year ahead.\nCllr Julie Stewart-Turner\nThis has been a year full of new and difficult challenges; here’s some of those challenges along with some highlights.\nJanuary: Andrew and I started the year being very heavily involved in budget briefings and debates.

We have had one of the toughest budget settlements the Council has ever had to face with central government slashing £80 million from Kirklees Council services over the next 4 years with no reduction in the Council Tax we have to pay. We have had the Local Development Framework which threatens green fields and spaces (and not just greenbelt) right across the district. It is against this background that the Green Party team have been continuing to take up issues at the Kirklees and Parish level.\nIn February this year the Green Party leader and MP for Brighton Pavillion visited Huddersfield and we held a well attended public meeting the evening before Kirklees Councils budget decision. I must say she is a real asset to our Party and has impressed many people with her insights into the actions of the government and the impacts of the cuts on ordinary families up and down the country.\nIn the Council Budget meeting the Green Party stood alone in opposing Council cuts to services for elderly and vulnerable people. The majority of the cuts fell on those in the greatest need. The budget for care for older people was slashed from £52 million to £40 million. Daycare services were cut from £5.3million to £1.5million. We believed as a matter of principle that to cut services for those who are in the direst circumstances is morally wrong particularly when the bankers who got us into this economic crisis seem to be able to continue to reap the same rewards as before. You don’t have to be a ‘socialist’ to see that this is wrong. The Green Party made these points strongly in the Kirklees Budget meeting in February and received a lot of abuse from the other Parties on the Council for making that stand. We still believe it was right that we spoke for those in most need. As it turned out some of the proposed cuts to day care services were withdrawn following a legal challenge which has at least brought respite for some people. What really annoys me is when cuts are characterised as ‘improvements’ to services. If we have to make cuts the least the Council can do is be upfront with people about the impacts on heir everyday lives.\nThis year was the end of my first 4 years as one of your Councillors and so I was up re-election in May. What I really enjoyed was getting round to seeing so many people in the run up to the election. It is a huge ward that stretches from Farnley Tyas to Flockton so we had a big area to get round. As usual it was a nail biting election count and I was re-elected by 82 votes but then I‘ve lost by 5 in the past so I was very pleased. I still can’t get used to the misinformation and half truths from my local opponents that I get during local campaigns. There were some very misleading statements about my attendance at meetings and dodgy montages of a wind turbine at Grange Moor (which I actually opposed at Planning Committee). All I can really say to people is that if you see some criticism of us in our opponents please don’t take it at face value please ring me or one of my colleagues and we’ll give you a straight story. Having said all that I found my Conservative opponent Amanda Shaw to be a pleasant and capable candidate and I’m sure she wasn’t responsible for much of the material in her leaflets.\nThe other elections that were held this year were those for the Parish Council and I was really pleased that the Green Party got the most votes and Parish seats of all the parties and that every village in the Kirkburton Ward has a Green representative. We are the only party that can make that claim. Our candidates topped the poll in Kirkburton/Highburton, Shepley, Grange Moor and Farnley Tyas and Thurstonland. Thank you to everyone who voted for us.\nOf course the day to day role of a Councillor is taking up local issues. Here’s a small selection of the issues we’ve taken up this year:-\n• Getting Moor Top Avenue resurfaced at Thurstonland\n• Helping get funding for ‘The Hub’ at Kirkburton\n• Helping get a new bench for Stocksmoor (then getting Kirklees to turn it round to face the right way!)\n• Helping householders with planning advice for installing solar panels on their roofs\n• New street lighting for Grange Moor on Bedford Avenue\nThere are issues which continue to frustrate me such as the need to get the footpath at Paddock Road in Kirkburton resurfaced. I must confess that it has been difficult to get this issue resolved been one voice among three local Councillors who don’t share my view on this. The other issue I really want to see progressed is traffic calming in Stocksmoor. We successfully worked with local people in Farnley Tyas and Thurstonland on their schemes now we need to get some impetus behind resolving issues in Stocksmoor. My Parish Colleagues Robert Barraclough and Andrew Cooper are helping me and liaising with the village association.\nWind turbines continues to be a concern for some householders and I and my Green Party colleagues have taken a balance approaching where we have opposed those that are poorly sited and intrusive and supported those that aren’t. I have opposed new turbines at Shelley and Grange Moor but supported 2 small turbines on farmland at Thurstonland. Sadly there was a rather political letter produced at Kirklees expense distributed in Thurstonland by the 2 Conservative Councillors on the subject of the wind turbines and the Green Party response to this. I have no objection to people putting their opinions in a leaflet and letter but no funded by the Council Tax. We have always taken the trouble to speak to the Thurstonland Village Association about local concerns and we had in this instance and I think actually talking through some of the issues we managed to address a number of concerns people had which were associated with much larger turbines.\nMy year will end very much like the last one. I will be driving a minibus on Boxing Day from Flockton to Grange Moor through Lepton and on to town. We have been running this free service for local people for 4 years now and I really enjoy it.\nA Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all.\nYours sincerely\nCouncillor Derek Hardcastle\nDear Resident,\nThis year has been one of the most challenging in my time as one of your local Councillors.

He has lived and worked in the Kirkburton ward all his life and is a tenant farmer at Farnley Tyas. He became involved with the National Farmers Union (NFU) in 1994 becoming Local Branch chairman until 2003 holding office through both the BSE and Foot & Mouth crises. During this period he also represented the NFU on the Kirkburton Parish Council Environment Committee.\nRobert said of his nomination as Green Party candidate,\n“I will aim to make a real difference as a local Councillor for the Kirkburton Ward. It is an area I know well and have a genuine concern for, which goes beyond party politics. I already engage with local groups in the area and am always keen to see community involvement in the delivery of local projects. During my time as Chairman of the Parish Council I was able to meet and help a number of community organisations across the area so I feel well placed and up for the challenge of representing our area at the Kirklees level.”\nCouncillor Derek Hardcastle said,\n“People who know Robert know he can be trusted, is straightforward and hardworking . He is a real asset to our area and I would greatly value his support on Kirklees Council.”\nGreen Party Council Leader Councillor Andrew Cooper,\n“I’m really pleased Robert has been selected as our prospective candidate. His knowledge of rural and community issues is very strong and he brings a whole new set of skills to the Green Party Team.”\nTuesday, 6 December 2011\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper –Annual Report 2011 to Newsome Ward residents\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper –Annual Report 2011\nThis has been my twelfth year as one of your local Councillors and almost certainly one of the busiest I can remember. Much of the beginning of 2011 was dedicated to the Kirklees Council budget as we grappled with the £80 million of cuts imposed on Kirklees by the Coalition Government. I spent hours in budget meetings going over proposals to come up with a solution which did not result in huge cuts to adult social care. In the end I and my Green Party colleagues were not prepared to vote for the Kirklees budget as a matter of conscience and principle. We could not vote for a budget which saw care for older people reduced from £52 million to around £40 million over the next 4 years and Day Care Services to drop from £5.3 million to £1.5 million and all this at a time when the demand for these services is likely to rise. All this is happening at a time when the banks are seemingly unscathed, benefits are being cut and services are disappearing all around us.\nPlanning was also a major item for me in this Council year. I was the only Councillor, not on the Planning Committee to speak against the proposed Tesco development to be built on the site of the current Sports Centre. Bizarrely many of the Councillors on the Planning Committee had huge reservations but ended up voting for it. Could it have been anything to do with the ‘bung’ Kirklees were getting from Tesco to build a new Sports Centre at Springwood? Also last month I attended and spoke at the Public Enquiry into the Tesco Planning Decision along with Barry Sheerman MP who spoke in favour of the Planning Decision being overturned.\nAnother key big issue this year was changes to planning policy both at the national and local level. The Coalition Government has introduced a new National Planning Policy Framework which in a nutshell makes it easier for developers to build on greenfield sites. I have spoke out regarding this issue at a number of meetings including a well attended one at Hall Bower Chapel. I have also used links with the Local Government Association to get some direct input into the Conservative Minister responsible Eric Pickles MP. As things stand I don’t anticipate much change. At the Kirklees level we have the Local Development Framework which will contain the policies which guide where housing will and will not be developed working with Julie and Graham we are continuing to press hard on the Labour led Council not to allocate greenfield land for development we have particularly mentioned land adjacent to New Laithe Hill and Jackroyd Lane on a number of occasions. We’ll keep people updated with developments.\nI was particularly pleased this year to welcome Green Party leader Caroline Lucas MP to Huddersfield. She spoke at a meeting in February in the Hudawi Centre about her work as an MP and the impact of government cuts.\nThe Newsome Ward continues to be a national beacon for renewable energy and I was able to help Newsome South Methodist Church with sourcing funding to get solar panels installed on their roof. The Church did a lot of fund raising itself and the panels will help them save electricity costs and provide funds to keep this well used community building going.\nWhen I first started knocking on doors in Newsome in 1993 I took up the issue of traffic calming on Hangingstone Road Berry Brow. This year we finally got the funding sorted out. I asked the Highways Engineer leading the project how old he was in 1993 and he told me he was just 5! In the end the real success of this was local people getting together to put their case strongly to Kirklees with me as local councillor providing help and guidance.\nI continue to be a strong supporter of the Growing Newsome project and I share an allotment in Primrose Hill where I’ve grown food now for the last couple of years. I‘m especially pleased that the Stirley Farm project is up and running to support local food initiatives and it now has its own cattle in addition to its vegetable and fruit growing activities. It is important that the green land around the area is worked and useful to protect it from those would see it as ripe development land but it is also a great project in its own right and lots of local people are getting involved.\nOne issue which has affected a great number of people in the Ward has been Labour’s proposed £30 charge for permit parking. Many people in Aspley, Highfields and Springwood are on low or fixed incomes and even though many don’t have, or can’t afford, a car they are able to offer visitors, carers and relatives a car parking space. This proposed charge is effectively a £30 increase on the Council Tax for people who are generally on lower incomes. I have been very vocal on this issue in Council and have asked for an equalities impact assessment to be carried out on this decision.\nI was originally a sceptic but now have a ‘blog’ www.greeningkirklees.blogspot.com which is basically an online diary of my views and opinions on things affecting the Newsome Ward and Kirklees in general. Again I was sceptical about Twitter but now I am an avid user of it. If you want to ‘follow’ me I’m at @clrandrewcooper\nMy New Year will begin as it did last year driving Newsome’s New Years Day Bus Service. This is now in it’s 19th year and thanks to everyone who helps with and uses this service.\nI wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.\nAndrew Cooper\nThis has been my twelfth year as one of your local Councillors and almost certainly one of the busiest I can remember.

RJ Bray can be forgiven for taking some of the dubious misinformation from Government and in the papers about the cost of Feed In Tariffs at face value but maybe not on describing me as \"Clr Khan’s friendly Green \". More research required R J! If he'd stuck 'occasionally' in front that would be fine! Anyway here's R J followed by myself\nKIRKLEES Council leader Clr Mehboob Khan’s latest gripe is that money which he hoped to receive for a solar energy panel scheme which were to be fitted to 1,000 council properties has now been cancelled.\nClr Khan’s friendly Green Clr Andrew Cooper told the Examiner that it was a blow to the elderly and vulnerable people currently living in fuel poverty.\nSo does Clr Cooper’s statement mean that there are only 1,000 people in the Huddersfield area living in fuel poverty and all are currently living in council property? I think not.\nCome the cold months myself and her that shall be obeyed will be wearing more layers than an onion has skins due to the criminally high energy prices.\nClr Khan and Clr Cooper I feel would have more credibility if they represented the collective rather than a select few.\nWhy do they not campaign for cheaper energy for everyone or more winter fuel allowance for those in more need?\nInstead, they help create higher energy bills for people by having them fund through their meters the feed-in tariffs for those who have solar panels or wind turbines.\nIn this manner they also put more money into the energy companies’ pockets. In all fairness, is this right?\nAlternative energy will never drive our country forward. It will have the reverse effect and send our country back to the Stone Age.\nIndustry along with our homes cannot be sustained by wind, solar or wave power. It’s a little like a dripping tap into an empty reservoir at the height of summer.\nThe country needs a nuclear project and it needs it now if we are to get away from fossil fuels and be less dependent on gas from overseas. Let’s not forget the madcap carbon capture process that is to get underway at the cost of billions of pounds to the taxpayer along with industry itself.\nMaybe Clr Khan and Clr Cooper could ask for some money from that major worthless project called the European Union which drives these schemes.\nI agree that we must pollute our atmosphere less and giant steps have been taken – but let us remember that this cannot be at the cost of the extinction of mankind, otherwise what has it all been for?\nR J Bray\nShelley\nRead More http://www.examiner.co.uk/views-and-blogs/reader-letters/2011/12/03/examiner-letters-june-2011-86081-29886400/#ixzz1fgGUnGIB\nTo the Editor\nRJ Bray (Examiner 3/12) takes me to task for my dismay over the government cuts to the funding of the Feed In Tariff for solar panels and in particular the suspending of the Council scheme to install solar panels on the homes of 1000 Council Tenants. He says,\n“does Clr Cooper’s statement mean that there are only 1,000 people in the Huddersfield area living in fuel poverty and all are currently living in council property?”\nNo I don’t, but it would be a start to help those people by running such a scheme which could then be expanded later. There are also currently schemes available for private householders where the panels are installed for free and the householders get the benefit of the electricity in return for handing the Feed in Tariff to the installing company. A number of households around Huddersfield have done this already. If he wants details I’ll pass them onto him. Of course not everyone can benefit from this scheme due to the orientation or size of their roof but many can. So the existing policy framework for solar is one which many people can take advantage of but changes by the government threaten its viability for everyone.\nMr Bray says that Feed In Tariffs,\n“help create higher energy bills for people by having them fund through their meters the feed-in tariffs for those who have solar panels or wind turbines”\nThe actual impact of the Feed In Tariff policy on energy bills last year was 30p for the average household. This is less than a penny a week. The cost of a new nuclear power station, which Mr Bray is so keen on, can be a round £4.25 Billion and that doesn’t take into account the decommissioning costs and the costly handling of dangerous nuclear waste. This will have a much more significant impact on energy bills.\nHe asks of myself and Cllr Khan,\n“Why do they not campaign for cheaper energy for everyone”\nI don’t presume to speak for Cllr Khan but for my part I successfully proposed making insulation free for all householders in Kirklees, I was the trustee of a national fuel poverty charity for 8 years and have helped many householders reduce their fuel bills through advice on energy tariffs and by getting information out to householders on a number of ways to help reduce fuel bills. So I don’t believe I’m deficient in wanting to help people reduce their bills.\nMr Bray goes on to say,\n“Industry along with our homes cannot be sustained by wind, solar or wave power.”\nI agree to a point. In addition we are going to need greater levels of energy efficiency in buildings better controls and energy management, district heating systems, anaerobic digestion and a whole host of other actions to make the future of energy supply in the UK more secure. Althis l does rather beg a question why only Malta and Luxembourg in Europe have a worse proportion of their energy generated from renewable sources than the UK. What is technically possible on the continent seems somehow difficult here. The laws of physics are not different this side of the channel but some attitudes, prejudices and opinions among some certainly are.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper - Green Party\nSaturday, 3 December 2011\nFIT to drop! Solar PV - A question of priorities\nSomehow I can’t separate in my mind the cuts in Solar PV tariffs from other unrelated news items other than they are all outpourings of policy announcements from Government.\nThe basic mantra from Climate Change Minister Greg Barker is ‘Solar PV is expensive, the tariffs are unaffordable, capital costs are dropping so fast that the FIT is overgenerous that’s why we are cutting it. Its times not right yet for mass deployment, it’s a regressive tax on energy bills and adversely affects the fuel poor. Its like the poll tax and we all know how unpopular that was!’\n| A ground mounted PV install in Brockholes where I live. Will the flag be at half mast on the 12th of December when the FIT rate drops? |\nSomehow I can’t separate in my mind the cuts in Solar PV tariffs from other unrelated news items other than they are all outpourings of policy announcements from Government.\nThe basic mantra from Climate Change Minister Greg Barker is ‘Solar PV is expensive, the tariffs are unaffordable, capital costs are dropping so fast that the FIT is overgenerous that’s why we are cutting it. Its times not right yet for mass deployment, it’s a regressive tax on energy bills and adversely affects the fuel poor. Its like the poll tax and we all know how unpopular that was!’\nThis line doesn’t stand a lot of examination but it represents their expressed views and it would seem that DECC have pulled the drawbridge up on this one and are sticking their fingers in their ears to reasoned argument. So given it only cost a few million last year, the equivalent of 30p on the average energy bill what other things have the government been spending our money on? Well there’s the £600 million for Free Schools, a totally unnecessary support for a new school system usually parent led which will run parallel and in addition to local authority schools. There was the £250 million by Eric Pickles offered to councils to recommence weekly bin collections which actually nobody is much bothered about. Then there’s all the money for new infrastructure projects that has been announced this week. All this yet solar PV a technology that has been made available for the fuel rich and the fuel poor, that can be quickly deployed, that significantly reduces fuel cost and carbon emissions is regarded as too expensive (it isn’t). It simply doesn’t add up as an argument. You can’t really believe that they believe it. When we are talking about expanding nuclear generation this is couched in the terms of energy security and there’s no real reference to the impact on energy bills. The same arguments could be used for solar PV but they aren’t. So what is really going on? I’ll stick my neck out and say that it must be lobbying from the energy generators and suppliers. How would you feel if your monopoly over the provision of electricity was under threat from millions of people sticking solar panels on their roofs and then you have to pay them for the privilege. I’ve heard no mutterings, I have no proof but given the government’s position on FITs isn’t really credible this seems like a believable explanation. DECC Ministers may wag their fingers at the suppliers and generators but ultimately they’re going to need them to pursue their energy ambitions for new nuclear. May lord have mercy on us all!\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",

The land below Castle Hill at New Laithe Hill has been added to the Green Belt protecting the aspect of Huddersfield's most iconic feature, the back gardens of householders at Taylor Hill Road that the Council had allocated for development in a draft of the Local Plan were dropped and Highfields Community Orchard, a source of some disagreement between myself and the former Council Leader Mehboob Khan, was allocated Urban Greenspace status. We have also been keen to promote development where appropriate, at the Newsome Mill site for example. There are still areas where we disagree with development both in the ward we represent and in other parts of Kirklees and the housing numbers indicated in the plan far exceed what has ever been built in past years. Government has set the rules of the game and we have to provide housing on sites we wouldn't wish to develop. So I'm sure the Tories will refer to this as Labour's Local Plan but really its Labour's Local Plan using rules provided for it by the then Lib Dem/Conservative Government.\nThis is a plan that does not really address housing need. It will not provide the secure, social rented homes so many people need. When I hear people talk about the local plan as a way of addressing homelessness or giving people on low income a home, this plan falls short. Developers make money on 3 or 4 bedroom properties for owner occupation. Developers donate millions to the Conservative Party. This plan and every other plan around the country is for developers not for the people of Kirklees and its needs.\nIn this plan we are pleased that our amendment, that ensures that any fracking company would have to demonstrate how it has net zero impact on climate change has been adopted in the plan. Now I know Councillor Donald Firth will say that you can't do Fracking in Kirklees due to the extent of the Bowland shale but there are some places (in former coal mining areas) where unconventional gas extraction such as fracking and coal bed methane extraction are still possible so we still need a policy to protect ourselves from fracking and other forms of fossil fuel extraction. We should be proud this policy has national significance and sets a useful precedent for other Councils and is consistent with our Declaration of a Climate Emergency.\nSo what to do. I'm genuinely conflicted and because we don't operate a Party Whip I'm free to be conflicted. Nethertheless its a dilemma.\nWe need a Local Plan. If we don't have one then rapacious developers will have free rein to build where they will. There will be limited protection for all green spaces without a designation like green belt\nIn many ways this is not our choice the rules of the game were set in the National Planning Policy Framework. Thanks to the Coalition Government. Thanks former Lib Dem MP Andrew Stunnell in the a Minister in DCLG. As a result many areas which should not be developed on because they are valued green space are in this plan.\nWe don't have the ability or freedom to produce a plan that we want and the Conservatives and the Lib Dems would be in exactly the same position as the Labour Party is now if they were running the Council. It is important to be honest about that.\nSo what next. Once the Plan is adopted we have the opportunity to introduce Supplementary Planning Guidance to set our own energy efficiency standards in new build properties. It should be where feasible to Passivhaus standards not simply because it will reduce carbon emissions, or even because householders will have energy bills 75% less than a standard new build but because of the high standard of building delivered through a quality assurance process. Sadly we would not be the first Council to be pushing strongly on the Passivhaus standard. We need to catch up.\nSo we have reached the end of a 10 year + epoch with the Kirklees Local Plan. I get the feeling that we are reaching the end of a number of epochs. Brexit, the Local Plan, the end of another Municipal Year. We need to recognise that things are in flux and that opportunities to shape the future are in our hands if we choose to take those opportunities.\nLets be bold, lets be positive, lets ensure that homes are built to the very best energy efficiency standards in Kirklees over the next 15 years. Let's show the rest of the country how things could be.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Otherwise the view many people have of them following the tuition fees fiasco will be reinforced and politics as a whole will be further devalued in the minds of the general public.\nClr Andrew Cooper\nLeader, Green Party Kirklees Council\nWe protect green belt - Examiner - 27/4 /11\nI SEE that Clr Andrew Cooper is once again castigating the Lib Dems and Conservatives over green belt policies (Examiner Mailbag, Tuesday April 26).\nOne of the most effective ways of protecting the green belt is by sitting on Huddersfield Planning Committee or the Heavy Woollen Planning Sub-Committee where decisions about green belt and brownfield sites are made. Yet no Green Party councillor will sit on any planning committee.\nSo, when Clr Cooper talks about responsibilities, policies and green belt, he needs to look to his own party first, particularly here in Kirklees.\nPerhaps the electorate, whom he purports to represent, should start to ask questions as to why the Greens will not sit on any planning committees where decisions concerning green belt are made.\nClr Christine Smith\nChair of Planning and Highways Committee, Kirklees Council\nAnd my response...............\nCouncillor Christine Smith , Conservative , criticises the Green Party for not having a Councillor on Planning Committee. As she well knows despite not being a member of Planning Committee I have been a regular attender of it, referring applications for decision and representing views of constituents. I was the only Councillor who was not a member of Planning Committee to make representations regarding the Tesco’s Development and the proposed replacement Hotel on Castle Hill. The real scandal here is that the larger parties rarely send anyone to Planning Committee to represent the views of constituents. As Cllr Christine Smith also knows being a member of Planning Committee restricts the ability of its members to represent local people effectively as they are bound by planning protocols. Ironically you can be a much more effective at protecting your local green spaces by not being a member of the Planning Committee and she knows this as someone who has voted for development on Lindley Moor.\nI do notice however that in her criticism of me and the Green Party she does not contradict my view, and the Campaign for the Preservation of Rural England’s view, that the latest Coalition Planning Policy statement made during the budget is a significant threat to our green belt and greenfield sites. I would be really interested in her role as Chair of the Planning Committee how she responds to CPRE’s and my concerns.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper\nGreen Party Leader – Kirklees Council",

If this is possible it would be welcome but when Kirklees hasn't got its own house in order it is very difficult to ask anyone else to.improve their green credentials. The Council needs to 'walk the walk' on cutting back on plastic waste and needs to start providing tap water for events.

We could have polycarbonate plastic cups which are reusable and aren't a danger if dropped like glass. Reusable mugs and metal teaspoons could be used. Using milk from milk bottles which are still being used would be a positive move. Tap water could be provided in jugs or in reusable bottles like many organisations already do.

I'm hoping the next few weeks are going to be mine. In early December I will be in Katowice, Poland for a week as part of EU Committee of the Regions Delegation to the COP24 United Nations Climate Change talks. To get to this point has been a three year journey.\nMy first Climate Change Talks experience was COP21. In the delegates area they were negotiating the historic agreement to limit Greenhouse emissions to 2 degrees above global norms and hopefully 1.5 degrees. I was outside the delegate area in Paris speaking in a room somewhere to probably less than a dozen people. As part of my talk to the folks there I reflected on the fact that UK Local Authorities had received no communications from central Government about helping them reduce emissions to achieve the Paris Climate Goals. Sadly 3 years later this is still the case.This got me thinking, especially when it became clear that the carbon savings identified by national Governments, the 'Nationally Determined Contributions' were not going to be enough to limit emissions to the targets agreed at COP21 in Paris. So why not empower Regional and Local Authorities to play their part in achieving the Paris Climate goals? Why not encourage them to produce their own action plans to reduce emissions? So the concept of Locally Determined Contributions was born. This lead to it being referenced in 3 opinions (policy statements) of the EU Committee of the Regions and also 1 in the European Parliament.\nLast year at COP23 in Bonn an agreement to develop Locally Determined Contributions was agreed at the Global Local and Regional Leaders summit. This was not the same as the UNFCCC agreeing it but was without doubt a significant moment and gave LDCs a global stage.\nAt COP24 in Katovice, for me, it is an opportunity to make a real difference. It is the Climate Summit that agrees the Rulebook for achieving the Paris Climate Goals. How we will actually do it. I am part of the EU Delegation and so Brexit means it could be my last chance to influence global climate change agreements. So its a big deal. There are loads of positives. The European Parliament have referenced and backed Locally Determined Contributions in their position statement going into COP24. In addition the statement from 'Non State Actors' the global groups representing Local Government, Trade Unions, Agriculture and other organisations have also backed LDCs. I am receiving great support from talented and committed staff at the EU Committee of the Regions and from global bodies such as Climate Alliance and ICLEI. All things seem possible at the moment. My diary is filling up for the week and I feel hopeful.\nThe ambition/hope is that Locally Determined Contributions fill the gap in emissions savings that we need to make to prevent runaway climate change. That 'Think Global Act Local' becomes a tangible reality fostering an enthusiastic international movement focused on creating not just a stable environment but a sustainable better world.\nSo wish me well. I have a sense of mission and an understanding that this could be a key moment. Like the emissions contributions I mean to achieve I remain determined. My clock is ticking and I have to make the most of every moment in the next few weeks. Here we go!\nHere is 'Determined' by Andrison\nMy first Climate Change Talks experience was COP21.

So the concept of Locally Determined Contributions was born. This lead to it being referenced in 3 opinions (policy statements) of the EU Committee of the Regions and also 1 in the European Parliament.\nLast year at COP23 in Bonn an agreement to develop Locally Determined Contributions was agreed at the Global Local and Regional Leaders summit. This was not the same as the UNFCCC agreeing it but was without doubt a significant moment and gave LDCs a global stage.\nAt COP24 in Katovice, for me, it is an opportunity to make a real difference. It is the Climate Summit that agrees the Rulebook for achieving the Paris Climate Goals. How we will actually do it. I am part of the EU Delegation and so Brexit means it could be my last chance to influence global climate change agreements. So its a big deal. There are loads of positives. The European Parliament have referenced and backed Locally Determined Contributions in their position statement going into COP24. In addition the statement from 'Non State Actors' the global groups representing Local Government, Trade Unions, Agriculture and other organisations have also backed LDCs. I am receiving great support from talented and committed staff at the EU Committee of the Regions and from global bodies such as Climate Alliance and ICLEI. All things seem possible at the moment. My diary is filling up for the week and I feel hopeful.\nThe ambition/hope is that Locally Determined Contributions fill the gap in emissions savings that we need to make to prevent runaway climate change. That 'Think Global Act Local' becomes a tangible reality fostering an enthusiastic international movement focused on creating not just a stable environment but a sustainable better world.\nSo wish me well. I have a sense of mission and an understanding that this could be a key moment. Like the emissions contributions I mean to achieve I remain determined. My clock is ticking and I have to make the most of every moment in the next few weeks. Here we go!\nHere is 'Determined' by Andrison\nLDC's are great in theory . Their impact in practice is limited heavily by Westminster funding in the UK. Manchester has recently stated commitment to some wonderful policies most of which are undermined by abysmal levels of government funding and further by a dreadful lack of autonomy . Practically every meaningful attempt to 'green' my home city is beyond the remit of local people , councils and MP's . Transport , housing, education, health , social services , infrastructure , taxation , housing benefit levels - are all determined by an antagonistic Tory ideology. All of these factor into not only the plausibility of change on an administrative level but also on a very personal level vis a vis priorities : survival, shelter, food and income . The only Green councillors are in the leafy, wealthy part of my borough of Trafford . My guess is that those that have successfully attained a comfortable level of personal living have the time and inclination to think about global issues - the rest are either protecting their wealthy privilege or concerned about how to change a system that leaves them insecure and lacking any prospects . For many years I supported the LibDems ( only for the promise of PR ) so I'm aware of the stigma attached to a party that is neither hard left or hard right and how hard it is to stand apart from tribal , ingrained political views . In my opinion the Greens need to take a position that is opposed to neoliberal ideology ( which is vehemently against anything but growth and profit - end of story ) and place itself as firmly on the side of : people , planet , ecology, justice ; and against unfettered, unregulated corporate avarice however that may manifest . At present that is clearly NOT the perception or place that Greens hold in the UK - they are a comfy person's luxury , not a poor person's saviour; a country folk's dream and an urban irrelevance. A group in Trafford ( Breathe Clean Air Group) do sterling work ; many other small groups work on a similar fringe way and badly need the exposure that a political party could ( with will ) promote as frontline policies to the wider public & parliaments.\nReplyDeleteThe Greens'success in Altrincham has less to do with any \"comfy persons luxury\" and more to do with a well organised and committed group of people, working bloody hard in their community. Greens were also elected in the Labour strongholds of Prescot, Birkenhead and Burnley.\nDeleteThe Councillor who introduced the commitment to becoming zero carbon by 2030 was is from a ward that was almost lost to the Greens in May. That, in my opinion, is no coicidence.\nAndrew these LDCs and making plans for a Green transition is what I see as lacking in the Extinction Rebellion. We (in the Green Party Climate Change Campaign Groups) have been talking about how we can make such plans as a part of the Green Party's next campaign after Breathing Cities. I think that making them for particularly 3 sectors - transport, food and energy - makes a lot of sense. Most things connect or are somehow linked with these at a council level. Maybe logistics and provenance or procurement can be argued as a cross-cutting or another sector, but I would say it fits into transport and energy by proxy.\nReplyDeleteAll of these need planned for transitions, if we aim to reach the 2030 targets set by Green Party Policy (or even in some cases the 2025 targets set by XR) rather than the laggardly targets of 2050 set by the Tories - though I think they are beginning to waver and trend toward 2040.\nWhat can be useful is if we have beacon projects and councils (anywhere in the world, but EU, Northern EUrope or UK are better for our purposes of promotion) to showcase these, highlight what we have done as councilors and councils with a Green conscious and even more to provide contacts for others to follow.",

This was followed up by yet another gaffe by Tory Energy Minister Michael Fallon saying in a private meeting \"It's from Dorset all the way along through Hampshire... perhaps into a bit of Surrey and even my own County of Kent.... All these people writing leaders saying 'Why don't they get on with shale?' We are going to see whether they like the flaring at the end of the drive.\" The truth is that most regions in England, including Yorkshire and the Humber, are potential targets for the fracking industry.\nThere are of course going to be comparisons with wind energy and already toff Tory boy MP William Rees Mogg has made comments along the lines of preferring fracking to wind energy, that according to his uniformed view doesn't produce significant amounts of electricity. Untrue, but then the truth isn't what this is all about, because this is about money and interests. There are strong Tory links to the petrochemical industry hence the tax breaks for this polluting form of energy and the warm reception to the prospect of wide scale fracking operations by many of them. Less explicable is the support from the Lib Dems, Labour and UKIP for fracking but then all their energy policies are in a complete mess. All support the expansion of cost spiralling dangerous nuclear energy at a huge potential public subsidy of the scale that the renewables sector could only dream of. All ignore the long term financial and environmental costs of both fracking and nuclear.\n'Fracking' (and nuclear) are being pursued in the name of 'energy security' but real security will come from reducing our demand for all energy, no matter how it is produced. All the 3 large Westminster parties have no credible domestic energy conservation strategy relying instead on the public to take out Green Deal loans to improve their homes over 25 years at 7%+ interest rates. This is not surprisingly proving to be very unattractive to householders and DECC have now released £20million to encourage Councils to draw up plans to promote this failing scheme. As the product itself is no good no end of promotion is going to make this turkey fly. Contrast the underfunded ill conceived Green Deal with the use of £50billion of public money in HS2 which will end up being a private business rather than using it to improve the energy efficiency of the public's homes. Surely supporting the reduction in domestic energy demand is more important than simply accommodating it through provision of locally polluting and globally damaging fracking for gas but then what interest is there in the saving of energy when you're a Tory making money out of using it?\nwell said Andrew\nReplyDeleteand don't forget Kirklees already has a community energy co op, see www.valleywind.coop and support clean, safe, renewable energy in Kirklees.\nReplyDeleteYou can also change your energy supplier to such as Ecotricity or Good Energy to support renewables.\nand like me, also email your councillors to tell them what you think of fracking.\nHi Andrew .Just To Let you know that facebook group was begun on Sunday to voice concerns about fracking in Calderdale.Regards,Tony\nReplyDeleteYES! to a fracking free Europe!\nReplyDelete",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2011_10_press-release-people-urged-to-install_html/content_800.html": "| Andrew Cooper with the solar panels installed on Civic Centre 3 |\nGreen Party Councillor Andrew Cooper has urged Huddersfield householders to install solar panels as soon as they can. Following newspaper reports and mistakenly leaked documents it has become clear that the Government has plans to halve the Feed In Tariffs for solar photovoltaic panels.\nCurrently people can claim 43 pence for every kilowatt of electricity they generate off their roof but the government now plans to cut this to around 21p from the beginning of December.\nCouncillor Cooper who has solar panels himself said,\n“If people install solar panels now before the cut is due to take place in December then they will get the 43p rate for the next 25 years if they were to install them after that they would get less than half that.”\nI recommend that people get three quotes from local companies. You can save significant amounts of money by comparing the prices of installers. A list of installers in our area can be obtained from the Yorkshire and Humber Microgeneration Partnership website www.yhmp.org\nYou should make sure your contractors and the components they install are registered under the Microgeneration Certification Scheme. All companies on the www.yhmp.org website should be.\nIt is also worth checking the warranty period on the solar panels and the inverter which converts the DC electricity from the panels into the AC electricity that we use in our homes. You can get warranties of over 20 years for solar panels but it can vary more with inverters.\nIf you can’t afford the capital cost of solar panels then there are companies that will install them on your house for free. They claim the feed in tariff and you get the benefit of the electricity generated of the roof saving you around £150 - £250 per year depending on the number of panels you have and the current cost of electricity. One such company is A Shade Greener who are based in Tankersley www.ashadegreener.co.uk another is Home Sun www.homesun.com\nCommenting on these cuts Councillor Cooper said,\n“These cuts by the government are nonsensical. Over 25,000 people are employed in the solar industry and these cuts are a threat to them. The cost of the Feed In Tarrif is very small less than 50p/year on the average fuel bill and a fraction of the cost of government subsidies of nuclear power stations. As always it is those on the lowest incomes who will suffer the most. This cut will jeopardise free solar schemes for people unable to afford the upfront costs of solar panels and planned schemes for council tenants properties which are self funding under current Feed In Tariff arrangements but may not be following the proposed cut. The government’s claim to be the Greenest Government ever is looking increasingly hollow and lacking in substance.”\nIf you install a solar panel in your house, you are tapping into this massive source of free energy, and slashing your fuel bills. There are also great environmental benefits to solar energy, as it produces no pollution.\nReplyDelete",

Across West Yorkshire there are hundreds of thousands of these terraced properties which, though they have a cavity wall, have stone ties between the 2 walls to give it stability. Modern properties have metal ties and can be insulated relatively cheaply using mineral fibre wool. Stone tied properties can’t be insulated in this way due to the possibility of ‘cold bridging’ across the cavity wall creating cold spots and damaging condensation on the internal wall. Its at this point we come to the good news/bad news section of this blogpost.\nThe good news is that there is a material which can insulate these cavity walls called ‘Technitherm’. It is a polyurethane foam which is manufactured over the hill in Lancashire but don’t let that put you off. It has higher thermal performance properties than mineral fibre wool and as such is deemed to warm up the walls sufficiently to make the cold bridging issue insignificant according to the Building Research Establishment. It is of course more expensive than standard insulation but under some of the funding levels which were obtained under the Energy Company Obligation it was just about possible to fully fund the installation of insulation to these properties.\nNow for the bad news, due to the proposed changes to the Energy Company Obligation funding hard to treat properties will effectively be impossible. In many areas these homes are predominantly occupied by households on modest or low incomes. A huge opportunity to develop a new mass insulation programme has been lost to gain a minor temporary and short term reduction in energy bills in response to a campaign run by the energy companies themselves and the right wing media such as ‘The Sun’.\nThere are millions of homes that could benefit from hard to treat cavity wall insulation products and you have to wonder at the wisdom of spending somewhere between £50-80 Billion of public funds on HS2 when it could be used to improve the properties of people in fuel poverty putting money back in their pockets and not bolstering the profits of the Big Six\nA typical hard to treat property would be stone built and constructed around 1900 or before.

This is crazy because not many people would want it in their sitting room. It's like saying you can only have loft insulation if you have cavity wall insulation as well - but worse because it's a lot more disruptive! Anne Handley\nReplyDelete",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2012_01_flood-risk-management-group-meeting_html/content_599.html": "The attendees represented an array of Councillors for whom this area is a real passion and officers who grapple with flood related issues on a day to day basis including the National Flood Forum, the Environment Agency, DEFRA officials. So it was a very well informed gathering and an ideal place to get acquainted with the issues. I put the officers from DEFRA and the EA at their ease by telling them I was keen for us to have the meetings questions put to them and answered in a Select Committee fashion with lots of probing to get to the nub of concerns. They seemed suitably pleased by this and they defended the government as best they could.\nOne real bone of contention was the issue of how Insurance Companies approached flood risk. Insurance companies are approaching the insurance of properties for flood risk not on the basis of flood risk but on postcode. So you could have one property which could be at low/no risk of flooding and then further down the road a property at high risk. Both could be insurance blight areas. In fact this issue affects hundreds of properties in Runnymede which are completely unaffordable to insure for many householders and it would appear that their local MP isn’t desperately fighting their corner on this issue. Following flooding you would assume that Insurance companies would be keen to make areas ‘resilient’ to flooding in future by getting electrical sockets raised and having flood resistant flooring installed. You’d be wrong as Insurance Companies generally want things restoring to their previous state including low electrical sockets etc. Bonkers. I have suggested that there could be a 'green deal' type finance approach to paying for flood hardening measures for 'at risk' homes. A 'Wet Deal'?\nThe first actions I have asked for is a letter to the Association of British Insurers about the issue and a request for a meeting with the Minister along with other concerned Councillors and officials.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

A thick covering of snow does not make for a good flow of solar electricity. At lower temperatures photovoltaic panels generally operate more efficiently but as there is less available light during the winter months the benefit of the increased efficiency is negligible.\nAmong the usual letter writers in the Examiner last week was one Bernard McGuin ex Tory Candidate for Newsome. He focussed on my support for renewable energy and the financial subsidies for it. Amongst the ramblings and many inaccuracies (photovoltaics do not heat houses Bernard they create electricity) was the assertion that solar photovoltaic panels need a lot of maintenance. As there are no moving parts and it is a solid state product that's clearly not the case. Some of the first panels installed in Japan 40 years ago, on lighthouses, are still working. Panels do slowly lose efficiency (as all things do) over time but are warrantied for up to 25 years.\nClearly Mr McGuin is no expert but he does have opinions and that's important.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2012_10_using-eu-funding-for-ee-investment_html/content_100.html": "The EU budget, in the crosshairs of the government, needs to be greener, not leaner and meaner,\nIt is now widely acknowledged that there is enormous potential to reap environmental, social and economic dividends through improving the energy efficiency of Europe's 160 million buildings. And yet actual investments in energy efficiency measures remain very small in comparison to this potential.\nTo achieve the EU objective of a 20 percent improvement in energy efficiency by 2020 (from 1990 levels), the European Investment Bank estimates that EUR 85 billion per year is needed, with EUR 60 billion per year required for buildings alone. The forthcoming EU budget for 2014-20, currently being negotiated, has a vital role to play here for the UK and Europe's other more developed countries as well as the less developed countries.\nThe future budget, expected to total around one trillion euros over seven years, seeks among other things to realise Europe 2020 objectives – supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy in all sectors is paramount in the European commission's budget proposals to date. Backing this up, a figure of at least 20 percent of the total budget for climate change related activities has been put on the table by the commission. More specifically, a doubling of current allocations for energy efficiency and renewable energy to EUR 17 billion has also been proposed under the European Regional Development Fund.\nGiven the scale of the challenges we now face, these figures should be higher – some members of the European Parliament have recently been vocal in calling for this 20 percent 'climate mainstreaming' to be bumped up to 30 percent. Meanwhile, with some of the EU's larger member states, including the UK, pushing for real terms cuts in the future EU budget, there are growing fears that the budget's climate potential could be seriously impaired. Here's why this must not happen.\nKirklees Council in West Yorkshire, where I serve as a Green Party councillor, has been a leading local authority in the UK in addressing fuel poverty and improving the energy efficiency of people’s homes. An insulation programmethat we implemented between 2007 and 2011 offered free loft and cavity wall insulation to all households irrespective of income or tenure. Thousands of homes were insulated and Kirklees is recognised by the UK’s Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) as the council in the UK that has been most successful at insulating its housing stock.\nThe question now for Kirklees and hundreds of other councils up and down the UK is: where next?\nThe UK government's 'Green Deal' that has just been launched aims to improve insulation in 14 million of the UK's leaky homes. However, there is scepticsm from many quarters as to whether or not the Green Deal is fit for purpose. For one thing. the loans offered to improve the energy efficiency of people’s homes under the Green Deal are expected to be offering interest rates at around the seven percent mark, while in Germany similar loans are offered at one percent.\nDavid Kennedy, chief executive of the government's official advisors, the Committee on climate change, has warned of the Green Deal's finance model: “We think there is a significant risk in leaving it to the market, as that has never worked anywhere in the world and is unlikely to happen in the UK.”\nThe Green Deal's unique selling point is that the loans offered to home owners are supposed to be more than covered by the savings made as result of the measures installed. This is called 'the Golden Rule', but more expensive measures such as solid wall insulation will have to be highly subsidised by the utilities through the Energy Company Obligation.\nConsumer resistance to solid wall insulation is expected to be high mainly due to aesthetic reasons. The Golden Rule is not guaranteed, and changes in people’s circumstances or how they use the home could impact negatively (or positively) on savings made. Industry is expecting a slow start for the Green Deal and in traditional loft and cavity wall insulation sectors a downturn in orders and staff redundancies seems likely. Early attacks on the Green Deal from the UK press are underway and will probably accelerate as the scheme is launched.\nThe Green Deal is being introduced at a time when ‘feed in tariffs’ for solar PV and other renewable technologies are being massively cut, leading to a reduction in capacity in the micro-generation sector. It is against this backdrop that the UK's ability to achieve an array of EU environmental targets must be judged.\nWhen asked DECC officials are bullish about being able to hit the EU target for 16 percent of total energy from renewable sources by 2020. The evidence would indicate otherwise, particularly with regard to the renewable heat and transport sectors.\nThere are other avenues, though, to ensure positive action on energy efficiency in the UK materialises – this is likely to occur where local authorities and energy utilities disregard problematic policies such as the Green Deal and instead develop their own programmes. Local authorities have the 'reach' for this. They have access to community networks and to a great extent the trust of their communities as official bodies where people feel they have a recourse if they have concerns.\nEnergy utilities do have funding of GBP 1.3 Billion per year through the Energy Company Obligation, but if matched funding is required to make a scheme fly then local authorities, like many public bodies, are highly constrained both in terms of capital and revenue expenditure.\nThis is where EU funds could really make a difference, bridging the gap between local schemes that lack finance but that nonetheless have every likelihood of succeeding.\nSuch an opportunity has already been grasped in France, where social housing organisations have rapidly deployed 320 million euros of European Regional Development Fund money to improve energy efficiency in existing housing. This European finance triggered investments of 2.2 billion euros, created 15,000 local jobs and has resulted in financial savings of 98 euros per month per household thanks to a 40 percent average decrease in heating costs.\nThe best route for such EU funds at a time of limited budgets would be via a route where councils and energy utilities have to demonstrate the robust nature of their proposals in terms of delivery as the key to open EU funding. High quality, 'deep' renovation proposals are essential here – cosmetic fixes such as replacement windows should be a non-starter.\nAnd the UK could maximise leverage on EU funds to co-finance projects if the UK government sets the EU funding element to cover 75 percent of costs. This will ensure we get more back from the EU on projects that give us a better deal from Europe, and certainly a greener one.\nDesigning such programmes coud be developed in conjunction with the Local Government Association (LGA), the representative body for councils in England and Wales. The LGA is regularly engaging with DECC on government policy and is one of the most informed bodies in the country on the delivery of energy efficiency programmes.\nThese are difficult times for many sectors of industry, but through imaginative links between the EU and local government bodies in the UK, we can produce imaginative and effective programmes that deliver carbon and financial savings while generating jobs and, for many, much needed hope.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

They can talk the talk about saving energy but cannot walk the walk when it comes to handing it out.\nR J Bray\nShelley\nHere comes the sun\nMIKE Warren-Madden (I want a solar panel too, Mailbag, June 4) can certainly ‘Talk the talk.’\nIn fact, I doubt if there’s a donkey with a full set of legs within 10 miles of Brockholes.\nBut when it comes to ‘walking the walk,’ he clearly prefers to let others put the effort in. With that in mind, might I ask him a question about his latest letter?\nMike, you asked about who might get solar panels. Have you done anything to try to find out? Have you tried to contact Clr Andrew Cooper about it? Have you written, phoned, or left an email for him?\nMy guess is that you haven’t.\nR A Vant\nHolmfirth\nCost of ‘free’ energy\nMIKE Warren-Madden wrote regarding the Green Party’s proposalŠ to pursue a free solar panel installation scheme for householders in Kirklees.\nHe asks if it will just be for council house tenants and if council taxpayers will end up paying the bill. The answer to both these questions is No.\nThe scheme we are proposing will be paid for through the Clean Energy Cashback introduced in May this year. This is a tariff available to anyone who installs solar panels from their energy companies.\nSo, very roughly, if you were to install solar electricity panels at a cost between £8,000 to £10,000 on your home it would give you about £25,000 back over the 25 years that the tariff would be available for.\nOf course, a lot of people haven’t got access to that sort of money, particularly at the moment. The role of the council would be to install the panels for free but to take a proportion of the Clean Energy Cashback to pay for the full costs of the installation and any interest.\nHouseholds would still get the benefit of the electricity from the solar panels in their home, saving them between £150 and £200 a year.ŠThe solar panels wouldn’t replace your grid-supplied electricity but mean you will need less of it.\nThe proposal stacks up financially. The next issue we have to address is ensuring that the legal issues of signing over the Clean Energy Cashback are dealt with and then going through a tender process to get qualified installers.\nOnce this is done I envisage it would be delivered in much the same way as the free insulation scheme that the Green Party proposed. Assessors would go door-to-door to assess the suitability of the property for the solar panels and, if all is OK, then a few weeks later the panels would be installed.\nSo this scheme would save money, save energy, reduce carbon emissions, create skilled jobs and not cost the council taxpayer an additional penny.\nMike asks if we can install one at his house as soon as possible. Well, I’m not saying it’s going to be tomorrow but we’re on with it. If he, or anyone else, has any more questions, either contact me directly or through the Examiner letters column if that’s what you prefer.\nClr Andrew Cooper\nGreen Party Councillor, Newsome Ward\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Blahcelona! |\n| Sagrida Familia |\nOne of the things I wanted to get out of the trip was an understanding of was views on Catalonian Independence. It's just over a year ago since Catalonia\nvoted to cede from Spain and become an independent nation within the European Union. Supporters of Independence point to the overwhelming majority in support of independence and those opposing it say that it is not valid because people opposing independence didn't vote saying the Poll was not valid under Spanish law. What is beyond dispute is that the response of the Spanish Government was heavy handed at best and brutal at worst. Spanish Police blocked and beat people trying to vote and Catalonian Politicians have been imprisoned and are effectively political prisoners. Very worrying within the EU but then we do have the Frack Free Three in the UK. I spoke to as many Catalonians about it as I could and it seems support for independence is still strong. Catalonian flags still fly from balconies. Many Catalonians and their buildings are sporting a yellow ribbon (not unlike the SNP logo) showing their support for those political prisoners.\nThere was a time when I worried about Nationalist movements being Right Wing and possibly Xenophobic. I think that was to a certain extent true but has become less so in recent times. Certainly the SNP and Plaid Cymru are generally on the progressive side of the political spectrum. The politics seems less about Nationalism as such and more about Independence and Self Determination. \"Taking control\" if you will!\nSo now what else other than Freddie Mercury singing 'Barcelona'\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

When the first Green Cllr Nick Harvey was elected he wasn't given an office so he worked in the Members Lounge with its telly and comfy chairs. He reckoned he found out more there than being in an office anyway. Not only was there a Members Lounge but also a Members Library with a dedicated Librarian to help Councillors with research. Sadly this was very under utilised and the function and the member of staff went back into Huddersfield Library. The Members Lounge also disappeared and quite rightly became a large meeting room instead.\nWhen I was elected in 1999 the Green Party Group of 3 finally got an office. It was possibly the smallest room in the building if you don't count ones containing a toilet. We later got allocated a space on the top floor on the same corridor as the Press Team lead then by David Bagley. They have been out of the building a few years now and there rooms were replaced by the Tory Group who we have shared the floor with us to this day. One of the great things about our office space was the balcony. I say 'balcony' it is more access to a flat roof space through a window. For a couple of years I quietly grew vegetables on it and took pleasure in carrying bags of compost through Reception looking as shifty as possible. I'm sure they thought I was growing cannabis on the roof. It was great to sit out there in the summer between meetings. Other Kirklees officers will soon move into Crown Court Buildings, in the short term at least, but it will eventually be sold off if a suitable buyer can be found.\nSo not just a new building but a new era for Kirklees Council. Moving people around is one thing but shifting the culture of an organisation is quite another. I am hopeful and optimistic, but that has always been a failing of mine.\nSo not just a new building but a new era for Kirklees Council.

Hillside Primary School in Newsome won the Best School Category for producing 55% of its own energy from onsite renewable sources. Green Councillors have been closely involved with the struggle to get the school built to the high standards the teachers, staff and community wanted. Paul Hudson was presenting the evening and it looks like he may well be doing the official opening of Hillside School later in the year.\nThe event itself at the Royal York Hotel gave a real boost of confidence to the Microgeneration Sector in the region with 170 people there. Noticeably absent were the Regional Development Agency Yorkshire Forward who still 'don't get' microgeneration or its potential to create worthwhile jobs, reduce carbon and fuel costs and to change society. I really believe having talked to council tenants who have had solar panels that microgeneration can fundamentally change the way people regard themselves. No longer are they simply passive consumers of energy but they are generators and producers of their own heat and power. If we create the conditions for hundreds of thousands of householders to use renewable energy in their home then we will truly be creating an 'Energy Generating Democracy'.\nThis Red Bull stuff works!\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Some people may be surprised to know that the vast\nmajority of Labour Party MPs, including Huddersfield MP Barry Sheerman,\nfollowed the Conservative and Lib Dem MPs into the 'Aye' lobby to support these\nhuge cuts to services. We have no idea where these cuts will fall and neither do the MPs\nwho voted for them, but given what has already cut then services like Adult Social care must be under threat. What amazes me is that Labour MPs can simply\nfall in line with cuts that could adversely affect some of the most vulnerable\npeople. Only 18 MPs voted against including the Green Party MP Caroline Lucas\nand SNP and Plaid Cymru MPs\nThe Second vote was on whether or not Government should\nsupport a £100 Billion replacement to the Trident missile programme. The debate was called by\nGreen, SNP and Plaid Cymru MPs and was an ideal opportunity to agree to stop\nwasting public money on a useless expensive relic of the Cold War and instead\nuse that money to support local services and the NHS. Yet again the vast\nmajority of Labour MPs, including Barry Sheerman, voted against and the motion\nwas lost.\nWhat is Labour for any more? If Labour MPs can't stand up for public services\nor oppose nuclear weapons what makes them fundamentally any different from a\nLib Dem or even a Tory MP. Over the next few months we will see a lot of sound\nand fury from Labour saying how terrible the Coalition Parties are, but in\nreality they are little different.

Andrew has been re-elected 4 times in Newsome with significant majorities over the Labour Party.\nAndrew was born in Barnsley, brought up in Huddersfield and has worked for York, Calderdale and Kirklees Councils. For the last 8 years he has worked in the private sector developing energy saving schemes to help householders insulate their homes, improve their heating and install solar panels. He is married with 2 children and lives in Brockholes near Holmfirth.\nAndrew said,\n“It is a privilege to be standing as a prospective MP in the\ntown I grew up in. As a local Councillor I spend a lot of time trying to find\nways to improve the Town and to fight for a better deal for local people. The\ntime is right now for a credible MP for Huddersfield who is Independent of the\nalmost identical establishment Westminster parties. The real alternative is a\nparty like the Greens with a strong commitment to social justice and protection\nof our local and global environment not a right wing Mark 2 Conservative Party\nlike UKIP.\nThe Green Party is a very progressive party which has a strong emphasis on protecting those people in the greatest need. It is the lack of a real social conscience in politics and politicians these days which really concerns me and why I feel the Green Party is right place for people who are concerned about addressing poverty and social justice.”\nAndrew has a long track record of many achievements for the\npeople of Huddersfield which include:\n•\nProposing the UK’s first universally free insulation scheme, Kirklees Warm Zone\nthat saw tens of thousands of homes insulated across Huddersfield.\n•\nLeading the campaign to replace ‘Welcome to Kirklees’ with ‘Welcome to\nHuddersfield’ signs.\n•\nInitiating the 2000 house solar panel programme which will see Council Tenants\nin Kirklees benefit from solar electricity saving them up to 2 weeks rent worth\nof electricity savings.

With lower capital costs for solar and the Feed In Tariff for renewable electricity there has never been a better time to install solar on homes, public buildings and schools. At a time of financial pressure investing in solar panels is one way to significantly reduce ongoing revenue costs.\"\nCouncillor Julie Stewart Turner also backed the Schools bid,\n\"Spring Grove is in the Newsome Ward and if their bid is successful they would be he third school in our patch that will have solar panels. It is really good that the pupils themselves have been involved in developing the bid to Friends of the Earth. Young people are increasingly well informed about climate change and the different ways of combating it. Solar panels are an important way of reducing carbon emissions from buildings and reducing the demand for energy from more polluting sources.\"\nCouncillor Karen Allison urged local people to back the schools bid to Freinds of the Earth online,\n\"People can register their support for Spring Grove Schools Solar bid through a link on the Greening Kirklees website on the article on the schools bid here\nSunday, 4 January 2015\nBumper Year on Greens Christmas Bus Service\n| Inexpert gaffer tape work by Cllr Cooper on the Newsome Crossroads Bus Stop (Photo Newsome Grapevine) |\nOur 23rd year of operation was a good year for users of the Green Party Christmas Bus Service with over 70 people using the sevice from Flockton & Grange Moor to Huddersfield on Boxing Day and over 50 people using the Berry/Brow/Newsome Hudderssfield HRI service on New Years Day.

A householder on Ingleton Road in Newsome was finding her garden waterlogged and after investigation the Council found that it was the result of a blocked drain on the former allotment site on Hart Steet. The drains were completely silted over. The Kirklees workmen found a drain which had been completely blocked with earth and had to get a JCB to dig it out. There will now be a new drain cover put over it. The drains feed into the 2 mill ponds just beyond the Hart Street land. As it was completely filled with earth they are going to have to construct a new drain cover. I just wonder who filled it in in the first place and when and why they did it. Another reason, if any were needed, not to develop on this land which has important watercourses running through it which impact on other houses in the Newsome area. The excavated drain now has temporary fencing to prevent anyone falling into it.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2011_11_greens-join-with-holme-valley_html/content_274.html": "| Grimescar Valley - saved from development by all Parties |\nThe 16200 figure presented in the Green Party/Independent amendment has a strong\nevidence base supported by economic projections, past performance on housing completions, the impact of Coalition Government policies on the construction and housing sectors and the Communities and Local Government Paper, 'Estimating Housing Need' (2010).\nCurrent economic projections for growth show 1.5% this year and 2.5% next year according to the government's own Office for Budget Responsibility. Historically these figures have been highly optimistic. This projection compares to the an annual growth rates averaging 2.68% between 1992–2007 according to the IMF. The British Chambers of Commerce Economic Forecast in March this year said:\n“Further forceful cuts in the budget deficit, the unresolved problems in the banking sector, and the financial fragility in the household sector will delay a return to pre‐crisis growth rates. Over the next 4‐5 years, growth of UK GDP is likely to average just over 2% per annum, considerably less than the 3.0% average growth recorded in the 15‐year period 1993‐2007”\nCoalition Government cuts of 60% in the Homes and Communities Agency is going to significantly reduce the levels of social housing and shared ownership housing available. The viability of younger people being able to enter the housing market will be increasingly stifled due to the impact of tuition fees which will mean that when students leave college and start receiving the sort of salaries they would need to consider the purchase of a property they will start having to repay those fees.\nWhile we recognise that there is an increasing social need for more housing, the mere projection of house building figures in the absence of interventionist social and economic policies will not create the construction of needed housing units. Rather it will give greater licence to the speculative builder of executive properties on green field sites. Without changes in government policy which will support the development of social housing, an open supply‐side private housing market cannot solve this problem, but only create distortions of excessive building on green field sites whilst leaving the overall stock of needed housing low.\nSimply making land available in its own terms will not deliver new housing so the LDF’s own targets are not realisable due to the underlying economic conditions the UK is in and the lack of policies to stimulate an economic revival and develop social housing.\nPast performance on housing completions does not support the targets given in the LDF document. The average number of completions between 2000 and 2010 was 1248 per year and even this level is skewed due to particularly high years. Expectations of mainly 1500 completions per year across the plan are clearly unattainable.\nIf our figures were to be adopted this would require no housing development on land that is currently in the greenbelt. We wish to see development in Grimescar, Honley, Meltham and Brockholes taken out of the plan. Just as the Local Development Framework has proposed to remove greenbelt status from nominated areas we would add land below Castle Hill bordered by High Lane and New Laithe Hill which is directly adjacent to greenbelt land and part of the backdrop to the historic and iconic Victoria Tower on Castle Hill.\nLike the Government asserts we also believe in Localism and support the concept of Neighbourhood Development Plans where communities establish what land they would like to see developed in their area above and beyond those targets set in the LDF. Our fear is that the Government's belief in localism is only skin deep and that the Government through the Planning Inspectorate would favour developers rather than communities.\nWe believe that where previously undeveloped land is to be developed that this should be constructed to a higher environmental standard than those proposed in building regulations in terms of energy performance and sustainable urban drainage.\nWe recognise that there is value in the juxtaposition of new design and new technology with heritage assets such as modern glass atriums on church buildings and solar panels being utilised on older properties and we would expect the LDF to include policies that support that approach.\nOverall the Kirklees Local Plan should not only consider the urban settlements on a quantitative basis, but qualitatively take into account their unique features of these different communities taking into account their urban, rural and environmental factors . Hence more detailed and specific polices should be developed for the Huddersfield Hub, Dewsbury, North Kirklees and the valleys in the South of Kirklees.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

I’ve seen that Greens can work\nsuccessfully alongside business and innovators on practical and worthwhile\nventures that make the world a better place.\nHow did you feel when you were\nfirst elected as a Councillor in 2011?\nBemused! I’d worked alongside local Councils and been a\nParish Cllr for 5 years but it was a big step up and a steep learning curve at\nfirst on Kirklees. However I quickly got up to speed with how you make things\nwork on Kirklees and what is and what is not possible. I’m not afraid of hard\nwork and I enjoy a challenge so it has been and continues to be, a rewarding\nand enjoyable journey.\nWhat is your proudest acheivement in your time as a Kirklees Councillor?\nGetting the trust of local residents across a wide range of political\npersuasions and widely differing backgrounds. I know a lot of my personal\nsupport doesn’t come from people who traditionally vote Green but people who\nknow I will try my best and give a straight answer to a straight question.\nKirklees , like many\nCouncils, is in a difficult financial position what can you do to help?\nHaving been self-employed\nfor almost all my working life I know the value of a Pound and I am acutely\naware of the need to get best value whilst protecting essential services. I can\nwork constructively with Councillors from all political parties and council officers\nto try and limit the damage resulting from cuts and communicate these changes\nto residents in a politically unbiased way.\nWhat do you think\npeople want from the person they elect as their local Councillor?\nFirst and foremost people want their local Councillor to be\nhonest and approachable. They want someone who has an ability to get things\ndone but to be realistic about what can be achieved. People don’t want\npoliticians to make false promises and not to play party political games that\ninsult peoples intelligence.\nWhat difference does\na Green Party Councillor make?\nI don’t feel I am constrained by a national political agenda,\nnor am I asked to tow the party line. We have a small, but influential, group\nof Councillors who are committed to working locally to protect local services in\na time of government cuts. We try to think ‘outside the box’ and to innovatively\nsolve problems. The easy thing to do is just to oppose all cuts and not offer\nany real solutions but Greens are prepared to work across all political groups\nand engage with whoever is running the Council at the time. If you don’t take\nthis approach you can find yourself in a powerless position and just shouting\nfrom the sidelines.\nWhen you aren’t\nworking in the community or attending Council meetings how do you relax.\nI’ve still got my tractors and some equipment and it’s a\nreal pleasure to get out ploughing and driving for one of my fellow farmers\nduring the Summer months. I’ve always read a lot and in any spare time and\nlately taken to political autobiographies of ‘all political flavours’. I walk\nfor exercise and Maureen and I have a list of local Ward walks so we regularly\nwalk the villages in the Ward",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_search_label_Local%20Food/content_32.html": "So all can now be revealed. The time for amendments to the Kirklees Budget has passed. We will go the budget meeting next Wednesday with a Labour budget based on the financial constraints forced on us by this Government following their mismanangement of the economy. There are 3 amendments, the Conservatives, the Green Party's and the the Lib Dems. We have gained some things out of the budget process. In our amendment we have the extension of the free insulation scheme Kirklees Warm Zone for another 3 years. I tried to get them to rebrand it 'Green Zone' to avoid confusion with the Governments 'Warm Zone' scheme but also to annoy the Lib Dems (see previous posts!). Of course they weren't having it but the issue of confusion between the 2 schemes is genuine and will have to be addressed at some point soon. Not least because 'Warm Zone' is a brand that we have to pay for. There are also opportunities to bring new measures to the scheme free draughtproofing for vulnerable households, electricity saving measures such as Real Time Displays and Powerdown and deliver them on an area by area basis.\nOther things we acheived were in the 'side agreement'.\nWe have a commitment to continue to support the core funding costs of 'Build' the body which provides training in skills for the building trade for brickies, plumbers and decorators until these are picked up thorugh supportive contracts such as Building Schools for the Future further down the line. This is exactly the sort of project we should be supporting at these times.\nWe also have a commitment to develop support for projects promoting local food producers in the area. This has been a strong theme for Julie Stewart-Turner our first Green Party Mayor during her year in civic office.\nThere is a commitment to come up with proposals for a free bus link from Huddersfield Town to the Galpharm Stadium possibly electrically powered. This would provide a link to all the sports and leisure facilities in the area and reduce the need for car travel at a venue which isn't directly served by Public Transport and where the car parks are often full at peak times.\nOur big hope is that we will be able to establish a free solar panel scheme for private householders with the capital costs for the Council being met by the new Clean Energy Cashback being introduced this April. We are due a report in June on whether or not it is a goer. The Lib Dems don't like the idea of this scheme and didn't believe it was much worth pursuing. No doubt if we make it work it will be appearing in a Lib Dem leaflet as one of their initiatives. Bitter? Moi? You bet I am!\nWe have already established the principal of self funding capital for solar projects with the £5million agreed for solar panels for council buildings last year. Providing free solar panels at no net cost to the Council for private householders is more difficult but I don't think impossible.\nSo what of the Lib Dems Budget amendment? Well surprise surprise we have £2 million to upgrade the insulation of Council Tenants. But I hear you say 'Didn't they claim they had already acheived this in that scurrilous leaflet they posted in Almondbury in December?' (see December post 'Dem Fibs from the Lib Dems') Well yes they did. So they lied, it's what they do. More energy stuff from them £300k for Solar PV for community buildings, some additional monies linked to the boiler scrappage scheme and an energy advice project for the elderly. All good but there is nothing else! If you didn't know better you would think they were desperately trying to win back lost ground on the energy agenda. No matter, if that's the case then the Green Party has acheived more in this budget than simply getting our own initiatives passed we've pushed the other parties on or agenda and got gains for local people.\nThe Conservatives submitted an amendment it means their Council Tax is a 1% increase instead of a 2% increase. To do that they have further decimated jobs, services and cancelled anti recession measures, but they have the cynical 'We're cheaper' headline for their leaflets.\nI'm definitely getting grumpier as I get older.",

Our discussions today cover the Energy Union, the Paris COP21 talks & the importance of Ocean Energy lead by a Rapporteur from my own group Rhodri Glyn Thomas. This is high on our agenda because to us 'Think Global Act Local' is not simply a slogan , it reflects reality and Local Governments are in the front line when it comes to addressing and adapting to climate change.\nThe Paris COP21 talks will soon be upon us. For me I'm always pleased to see progress but the Intended National Determining Contributions from the Individual States falls well short of what is required to ensure global temperature increases remain below the critical 2 degrees Centigrade limit. We are in serious danger of coming to an agreement which risks all our futures. In the UK, in my local council, Kirklees, the 6th largest council in the UK we have had no contact from our own national Government regarding the carbon savings they submitted to the Paris COP21 talks. No request for ideas or even simply asking us what we are doing already to reduce emissions. The message is clear. For the UK at least there is a disconnect between those who make pronouncements on carbon savings and those of us in local Councils who to a large extent will have a role in delivering them.This is the UK experience and I wonder how common this experience is in other countries represented in this chamber.\nTrust is going to be key to delivering the carbon savings we have agreed, let alone the savings we really need. That brings me to the powerful but unelected, the influential but too often unaccountable. I am of course referring to corporate power, to big business, multinational corporations. We need to be able to trust that when they say they have reduced emissions that they really have. The VW emissions scandal has shown how reality can be obscured by greed. It remains however reality and affects not just our local environment but the health of our citizens particularly the frail, the very young and the elderly. There are the very real financial costs of chronic Ill health on local health services and lost work time. I'm sure the Commissioner would agree with me that when fines are levied on VW and other vehicle manufacturers that those funds should be used to repair the damage they have done by improving our air quality, investing in in local projects to reduce emissions from transport through investment in public transport, electric vehicle and cycle infrastructure. The polluter should pay but devolved administrations like our own should deliver.\nIn the Committee of the Regions we should be able to look beyond narrow national interests and those of corporate power and put the interests of the citizen and their well being first. I'm sure no one in this chamber would disagree with that! Addressing climate change is the ultimate in terms of addressing well being as it doesn't just apply to current generations but also all those to come.\nI finish with 3 asks for the Commissioner\n1. please approach all EU member states and ask them to consult all their local and devolved administrations on what we can do to help help increase the ambition of their Intended National Contributing Savings for COP21 in Paris.\n2. please work with us to ensure that any fines imposed on VW and other manufacturers are passed down to local and devolved administrations so we can repair the damage.\n3. please seriously address the trust issue with large corporations more widely.\nClimate Change is real. It cannot be hidden on a spreadsheet or disappear by falsifying an emissions test. If we cheat we only cheat ourselves but we cannot cheat nature.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2020_08_the-housing-and-planning-bill-we-should_html/content_704.html": "The Conservative Government’s proposals in the Business and Planning Bill have been justly criticised for being far too developer friendly to the detriment of the local environment, climate change, housing standards and local democracy. It panders to the interests of the big builders and not those of millions of people who need low cost, secure housing with low living costs.\nSo what would an alternative look like that addressed these issues and made things better rather than worse? Here’s some thoughts.\nA National Planning Policy Planning Framework that acknowledges the Climate Emergency\nA principal issue is that the National Planning Policy Framework NPPF which all Local Plans have to comply with gives a greater emphasis on development above environmental concerns. Since the NPPF came into law we have had Councils and Parliament declaring a climate emergency in response to the warning from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that we have to get our emissions under control by 2030. So the NPPF needs revising swiftly to reflect the urgency of the climate emergency and allow Local Councils to revise their Local Plans accordingly. One immediate effect might be to stop the allocation of land for development on flood plains and in absence of sufficiently robust energy efficiency standards the ability to set higher ones locally.\nBuilding Council Housing a new national priority and an end to the 'Right to Buy'\nAnother priority needs to be a renaissance in social housing and council housing in particular. Property ownership is neither a viable nor desirable option for millions. The diminishing stock of council houses has meant that it has become poverty housing for those in the direst of circumstances. We have to end the ‘Right to Buy’ for tenants of council homes. The implicit assumption of the policy is that owner occupation is somehow preferable to council housing. We need to recognise that social housing is a social good with low rent, security of tenure and upkeep the responsibility of the landlord. If supply of council housing were plentiful than it would be a check on rising house prices and a viable alternative for people looking for a home. To make investment in new council housing stack up the Right to Buy with the generous discounts on the value should cease immediately. This would bolster the business case for council housing by filling the hole in the revenue bucket, preventing the loss of housing stock and giving councils the confidence to build at scale.\nZero Carbon Homes now!\nIn the Business and Planning Bill the Conservatives announced that we would be building Zero Carbon homes in the UK by 2050. Utterly scandalous. We can build Zero Carbon housing now and we would have done if, the then Chancellor, George Osborne hadn’t cancelled the policy back in 2015.\nA reasonable timeframe would be 3 years to get the housing industry to be geared up to deliver low emission passivhaus standard housing. Passivhaus is a quality assured method of building to a standard that delivers very low energy demand buildings making homes more affordable and healthier to live in.\nProtect the green belt and end land banking\nCouncils are encouraged by Government to reconsider the designation of green belt land to boost land for potential development. Given excessive demands from Government to boost the supply of land for development some Councils have diminished the amount of land with greenbelt status. Threatening the green belt is completely unnecessary as developers are sitting on planning permissions for a million homes. In fact we should tax developers punitively for not developing on land that they have been granted permission to develop.\nAbolish Private Sector Building Control\nPerversely there is a competitive market in companies that developers can use to determine whether or not their buildings conform with Building Regulations. One thing we do know is that in reality many homes and other buildings use far more energy than we would expect if they had been built in accordance with Building Regulations. The suspicion is that developers have cut corners, built sub-standard housing and paid a private Building Control company to sign off their developments. Hence the performance gap. It is bizarre that private companies can pay another private company to decide whether or not they have complied with the law. It must stop and Building Control should be purely a public sector function resting with Local Authorities.\nWell that's what you could have had.\nExcellent article and good advice that would improve the lives of many if followed.\nReplyDelete",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2010_09_theres-no-such-thing-as-big-society_html/content_41.html": "| Newsome's 'Big Society' Clean Up Gang. |\nMargaret Thatcher famously informed us that that there was no such thing as 'Society' now her latest Conservative successor David Cameron not only believes Society exists but he wants it to be 'big' as well. This comes as surprise to many of us who were sure David Cameron believed in society but only 'High Society'. OK that's got the Posh Tory jibes out of my system and onto the subject of the 'Big Society'.\nA central belief of 'The Big Society' is that services are better delivered by individuals, community groups and charities rather than public bodies and a belief that we need to 'turn government completely on it's head'. There is also a belief that somehow people's natural desire to improve their communities is being stifled by local or central government and that barriers need to be removed to enable the Big Society to flourish. As David Cameron said in July \"stop us from stopping you do things for your area\".\nThe role of the 'Big Society' should not be to replace the management and provision of publicly funded services but to enhance them to provide additionality to what is provided already. The classic example in Newsome is 'Growing Newsome'. Volunteers working together on local food projects doing the level of detailed work that would never be provided by the Council nor should it be. This is individuals coming together with passion and commitment on a project which should be more fun than worthy. If the Big Society is not about additionality it is by definition about changing the management of local services from the public sector to charities or community groups. There may be some limited value in this. For instance I can imagine a strong role for the Fuel Poverty Charity, National Energy Action in taking on the role of managing and monitoring progress on action to improve energy efficiency taking powers away from DECC and possibly local authorities. I just wonder whether taking powers from central government is what Dave actually meant. It would be interesting to test this.\nCapacity and enthusiasm are the keys to successful volunteer action. A lot of people are simply not interested. Why support local food projects when there's so much quality Reality TV to watch. Those who are interested may have lots of different commitments limiting their capacity and eventually people will get bored of growing marrows for the community (or whatever) and want to move onto something else. This is one reason why we need to think very carefully before core services are moved from the Public Sector for the sake of those people who rely on them.\nA classic example of the 'Big Society' gone bad is the concept of 'Free Schools' where parents or charities can get together to run and manage a local school. This will undoubtably unfairly skew financial provision from publicly funded schools to once run by religious organisations or discontented parents who can't justify a school in their area under normal circumstances. Again this would not be additional provision it would be a dubious way of creating yet more inequality in our stupid 'choice' based education system. (Don't get me started!)\nAgreed!\nReplyDelete",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2023_12/content_681.html": "It was around 3 years ago that I and Councillors Karen Allison and Sue Lee-Richards were approached by the Church of England regarding the possibility of us taking on St John the Evangelist Church, in Newsome, for community use. It should have been a difficult choice. Taking on an old building with all the costs and upkeep that came with it. But it was a choice we couldn't walk away from. A large building in the centre of Newsome with huge potential for events, conferences and a community cafe, something the village lacks. A place where people could hold celebrations and come together as a community. We couldn't ignore that vision and started making plans.\nWe established a Community Benefit Society as the body we would need to purchase and develop the centre. We commissioned local architects, One17, to help us realise our vision for the building and to assess the maintenance and improvments we will need to make to the building. We have raised funding to pay for the building and carry out some essential repairs. We have secured planning permission from Kirklees for change of use from a place of worship to a community centre with ancilliary cafe. That is the short version of the story. There have been some frustrations and bumps in the road along the way.\nWe know that getting ownership of the building is only the beginning of the journey. The roof will need replacing. We have a variety of tarpaulins and buckets collecting rainwater from various points in the roof. The kitchen and toilet block are in a very poor state and we need a small extension and a refit to bring it up to modern standards. There's a lot more that we have planned including upgrading the heating and insulation, creating meeting rooms, removing the pews to give us a usable halls for dancing, exercise clases and events.\nWe have got local people together to discuss our vision for the building and to get their ideas and input. As local Councillors we have initiated saving the building for the community but now we will need the help of the community to ensure it has a sustainable long term future. There is a lot of work to do but it will be worth it.\nIf you can donate to our Crowdfunder it would be really appreciated\nMake a pledge to The Newsome Centre (Phase 2) Proposal on Spacehive\n.",

We were told we could only go out for exercise for an hour each day. So, for those of us who hardly exercised at all it seemed like a great challenge. For me and Liz it was a walk one day followed by a run the next. Despite the obvious background horror of it all it was lovely getting out in the sunshine in the clear air exploring the countryside around where we lived. Then one day my foot went down a hole I limped a fair bit after that. When my leg got better, I couldn't run without pain and a long period of limping after I tried. Steroid injections didn't seem to make much difference, nor did physiotherapy so following an X-Ray I was sent into an MRI Scanner that's like a very noisy iron lung that gives detailed picture of your insides. When I got my results. it turned out I had arthritis in my right knee. I was offered a new knee. Now my parents in their 80s have 3 new knees so the principle wasn't unfamiliar to me, but I was only 57 and was it that bad really? I could walk for miles. Sometimes my knee hurt but it got better after a few days. In the end I wondered what the state of the NHS might be in a few years and decided to take the opportunity to get it done now when I could. There is so much uncertainty at the moment and with the Perma crisis that we are living in showing no sign of abating then it seemed foolhardy not to take the op.\nThe operation itself seemed to go well, was very professionally done. I was asked the same questions several times by different people in the same hospital. I was fine with this; they didn't want to make a mistake. and I didn't want them to make a mistake either! I came round was given a very nice cottage pie and the following morning was released with my cocktail of painkillers. So now I have my daily knee exercises and get a bit wiped out by the strong painkillers.

That will do nicely.\nNo history of Kirklees Green Party would be complete without a chapter on the Green Express. It was in 1989 that Huddersfield Green Party ran their first charter train up the Settle Carlisle Line which was under threat of closure at the time. Our train (a DMU for train fans) was all part of a campaign to keep the line open. Since then there have been countless charter trains going all over the country, Edinburgh, Brighton, Dundee, Carlisle, Bath.\nOf course the driving force for this was our first Green Party Councillor Nick Harvey now the proprietor of Green Express Railtours though the link with the Green Party is still strong with Clive Lord OLG (Oldest Living Green) organising the Green Party fundraising trips. Beer and Sandwiches are also important, not for negotiations with Trade Unions but as a source of revenue from our train trips.\nThere's a lot of olde world charm in taking a trip on old diesel locos while drinking hand pulled real ale. There's a whole team of people who make Green Express happen. Those who make the sandwiches, sell tea and coffee off the trolley or transport all the paraphenalia at the beginning and end of trips. I've done a bit of stewarding on the trains over the years and enjoy it once or twice a year (I did a lot in the early years). So why not go on one? The next is to Eton and Windsor on Thursday 10th June. You can go to Eton to see where our Prime Minister went to school! (or go down the road to the state run primary school and see where my better half went to school!)\nFull details of Green Express Charter Trains here\nhttp://www.greenexpressrailtours.co.uk/id11.html\n(Pictured Nicky and Adrian Cruden on the Green Express with Mark Mullany in the background.)\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2010_09/content_18.html": "|\n| Newsome's 'Big Society' Clean Up Gang. |\nMargaret Thatcher famously informed us that that there was no such thing as 'Society' now her latest Conservative successor David Cameron not only believes Society exists but he wants it to be 'big' as well. This comes as surprise to many of us who were sure David Cameron believed in society but only 'High Society'. OK that's got the Posh Tory jibes out of my system and onto the subject of the 'Big Society'.\nA central belief of 'The Big Society' is that services are better delivered by individuals, community groups and charities rather than public bodies and a belief that we need to 'turn government completely on it's head'. There is also a belief that somehow people's natural desire to improve their communities is being stifled by local or central government and that barriers need to be removed to enable the Big Society to flourish. As David Cameron said in July \"stop us from stopping you do things for your area\".\nWhat comes to mind is a conversation the Newsome Green Party Team had in a pub in the late 90s where we believed we were no longer just community activists but the providers of services. In fact as I remember it we went as far as to say we had become not merely Councillors but an alternative to Council Services. We started to list all the things we did or did with volunteers in the area. When buses were removed from service over the Christmas holiday period we brought in a free volunteer bus service, when areas got heavily littered we organised skips and clean up teams to clear rubbish, when no recycling services existed Councillor Graham Simpson did a waste paper collection round to many households around the Newsome area. I even stretched the point to the limit and suggested that at its height our casework gathering in Council estates was estate management. Like all conversations after a few beers the case may have been overstressed but there was a still a lot of truth there. While believing in voluntarism there was still a strong element of campaigning (and shaming) of the public sector to pick up the slack of inadequate provision in the Newsome area. So the waste paper collections played their part in encouraging Kirklees to put more effort into household recycling, the Christmas Buses pushed Metro into provision of services on Boxing Day at least. So if anything much as we believed in the power of people doing things for themselves we also believed that the public sector could do more than it was doing not less..\nThe role of the 'Big Society' should not be to replace the management and provision of publicly funded services but to enhance them to provide additionality to what is provided already. The classic example in Newsome is 'Growing Newsome'. Volunteers working together on local food projects doing the level of detailed work that would never be provided by the Council nor should it be. This is individuals coming together with passion and commitment on a project which should be more fun than worthy. If the Big Society is not about additionality it is by definition about changing the management of local services from the public sector to charities or community groups. There may be some limited value in this. For instance I can imagine a strong role for the Fuel Poverty Charity, National Energy Action in taking on the role of managing and monitoring progress on action to improve energy efficiency taking powers away from DECC and possibly local authorities. I just wonder whether taking powers from central government is what Dave actually meant. It would be interesting to test this.\nCapacity and enthusiasm are the keys to successful volunteer action. A lot of people are simply not interested. Why support local food projects when there's so much quality Reality TV to watch. Those who are interested may have lots of different commitments limiting their capacity and eventually people will get bored of growing marrows for the community (or whatever) and want to move onto something else. This is one reason why we need to think very carefully before core services are moved from the Public Sector for the sake of those people who rely on them.\nA classic example of the 'Big Society' gone bad is the concept of 'Free Schools' where parents or charities can get together to run and manage a local school. This will undoubtably unfairly skew financial provision from publicly funded schools to once run by religious organisations or discontented parents who can't justify a school in their area under normal circumstances. Again this would not be additional provision it would be a dubious way of creating yet more inequality in our stupid 'choice' based education system. (Don't get me started!)\nA real test of the Government's commitment to the Big Society would be to actually public fund it rather than doing a one off trawl of dormant bank accounts. If it really believes it will deliver better more efficient and cost effective services it would be worth it, wouldn't it?",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2021_10/content_7.html": "I got accused of a number of things at the last Kirklees Council meeting by Labour Cabinet members including \"politicking\" \"spinning\"and \"making up my own facts\". I found this particularly annoying as all I did was quote the facts provided by other independent and professional people with no political axe to grind . Facts that the Labour Administration of Kirklees found inconvenient to say the least\nI raised the issue of Kirklees Council's plans to remove over a 100 mature trees as part of their road widening plans on the A629 at Edgerton. Since the previous Full Council meeting a number of inconvenient facts had emerged that didn't fit their narrative. The first of these was the response to the Planning Application of the widening scheme from the Council's own Tree Officer. He gave a number of facts in his submission. These were:-\nNo positive impact on air quality\n\"The pollution levels are not predicted to improve as a result of the proposed scheme according to the Air Quality Assessment. There is no clear evidence however that the positive effects of trees on air quality have been considered and that the loss of mature trees may mean that pollution levels may get worse as a result.\"\nThe value of the trees\n\"The trees lining the A629 and side roads add to the character and setting of these areas and importantly provide a significant visual amenity and gateway feature when entering Huddersfield itself from the North\"\nThe replacement trees will take 50 years to provide the same benefit as existing trees\nThe mitigation proposed will take many years, potentially 50 years, to develop to the size where they can provide a similar amenity value and other benefits to the trees present today. the scheme seems to rely on the woodland creation at Ainley Top to provide significant numerical increases in trees but this is the creation of woodland which will take many years and will do nothing to address the lost amenity value within the urban areas of A and B which are one or two miles from the proposed woodland.\nThe scheme breaks both Kirklees and National Planning guidance\nThe proposals for the Blacker Road junction, area A, and Cavalry Arms junction, area B, are contrary to Kirklees Local Plan policies LP33 and LP35 as they have a significant impact upon the character and setting of the areas and will harm public amenity for many years. In addition, the proposals do not comply with the directions of the National Planning Policy Framework in that they are not sympathetic to the local character and history of the areas and do not ensure streets are tree lined. The impacts of the proposals based on the evidence provided have not been outweighed by the benefits of the scheme with regards to trees.\nKirklees Carbon impact Assessment makes dubious assumptions\nThe Council have a policy of planting more trees to address climate change and therefore the principle of planting new trees is supported. The Carbon Impact Assessment proposes however that tree planting will sequester a much higher amount of CO2 over time than the existing ageing tree stock but this assumes that the ageing trees will not be replaced when they reach the end of their safe lifespan. The report appears to not take into account that as protected trees are removed due to old age the Council can condition a replacement tree be planted. The trees present particularly those around the Blacker Road junction are protected and their replacement in time already assured by the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.\nConcluding sentence\nThe impacts of the proposals based on the evidence provided have not been outweighed by the benefits of the scheme with regards to trees.\nIn the report\nit says,\n“There appear\nto be several errors and points of confusion in the document.”\nIt goes on to\nsay\n“This document\ndoes not provide underlying evidence to validate its claims and the underlying\ndata does not appear to have been published. Without such data it is almost\nimpossible for the reader to have meaningful engagement with the assessment.”\nIn detailed\ncriticism the report cites serious defects in the report\n“The accurate\nquantification of emissions must be questioned when over 8000 of the\napproximately 8900 HGV movements described are effectively ignored by assuming\nthat the majority of the construction waste will remain on the site”\n“Where does\nthis material go and how much Greenhouse gas is not accounted for if removed?\nEach of those waste materials stored on-site will need removing at some point.”\nThe report goes\non to cast doubt on the accuracy of the measurements made in the Council\nreport.\n“If all of the\ndocument has had the CO2 divided by 3.67, then the whole of the emissions\nreported in the document could be significantly out by a factor of\napproximately two thirds.”\n“In summary the\nreport says without an appraisal detailing the whole life benefits or\ndis-benefits of this scheme; and without having a Kirklees wide road map in\nplace setting out year on year emissions savings required across the KRN, it’s\nimpossible to state whether any benefits predicted as part of the A629 will\nsupport Kirklees in meeting its objective”\nAnd the highly respected Woodland Trust said in it's submission to the Planning Application\nThe Woodland Trust in their response to the scheme said that the scheme\n\"should not be taken forward on the grounds it does not comply with national planning policy\".\nWhilst the council has pledged to plan more than 700 new trees to compensate for the loss of those being chopped down, the trust says the offer is not sufficient.\n\"New planting simply cannot replace the value lost when mature trees are removed, and such planting can never replace the loss of ancient and veteran trees.\n\"This large-scale loss of trees from a council scheme is simply inappropriate and alternative solutions must be found to prevent the loss of these trees.\"\nIt also considers the plan to be \"not consistent\" with the council’s own policy within its Local Plan.\nThese are not my \"made up facts\" but the views of respected organisations and professionals.\nThe A629 Widening scheme has a serious credibility problem and at present Labour appear to be doubling down in their backing for the scheme but they risk blowing their claims to having any legitimacy to be a leading 'green' Council. They may make the mistake of believing that this is between me and them. It isn't. They risk alienating the large community of informed environmental organisations in Kirklees who are their real critics. Critical friends should be valued and their evidence not dismissed and negated.\nSo what next? There are all sorts of ways of addressing an issue like this. If I am cast as an opponent as opposed to the critical friend that I regard myself as, then I'll just have to reconsider how to affect change. I have some ideas.",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2022_04_kirklees-green-party-councillors-2022_html/content_91.html": "Starting the retrofit revolution in Kirklees\n|\n| Cllr Cooper visiting Energiesprong homes in Nottingham |\nThe Council has made a start on retrofitting its own housing stock. This is positive but what is lacking is a financially sustainable model, which can deliver improvement to homes at scale to a zero-energy standard. Our proposal based on the Energiesprong (energy leap) model addresses this and provides a way of building the capacity and capability to deliver for owner occupiers and the wider housing sector.\nEnergiesprong work with local Councils on developing a programme to deliver warmer homes through a retrofit programme delivering a home which is net zero energy, meaning it generates the total amount of energy required for its heating, hot water and electrical appliances. It also provides superior indoor comfort. This is achieved using prefabricated facades, insulated rooftops with solar panels, smart heating, and ventilation and cooling installations. A refurbishment comes with a long-year performance warranty on both the indoor climate and the energy performance for up to 40 years. A complete home makeover can be completed in as little as a day!\nEnergiesprong are not a contractor themselves but work with councils to help procure contractors to deliver to the Energiesprong specification.\nCouncils such as Nottingham, Exeter and a number of London Boroughs are already working together on Energiesprong projects as part of the Retrofit Accelerator Homes Investment Partnership. They share best practice and expertise and have been successful in a number of funding bids to government drawing in millions to support the development of the Energiesprong model.\nHow much does it cost?\nThe cost for an initial 50 properties would be around £85,000/property. The expectation is that for future rounds of properties that this would reduce to around £55,000/property as economies of scale are realised.\nHow is it paid for?\nThere is some initial outlay for setting up the Energiesprong approach through the Housing Revenue Account but as the capital costs come down the expectation is that it would become self-financing through lower maintenance and servicing costs e.g., no gas safety checks, lower maintenance etc and through charging a comfort charge to the tenant. Energiesprong guarantee that the fuel bill that the tenants pay plus the comfort charge will be less than they were paying in energy costs for their home before refurbishment.\nhttps://www.energiesprong.uk/\nhttps://www.energiesprong.uk/newspage/innovation-partnership-why-a-new-approach-to-retrofit-procurement-is-key-to-net-zero\nhttps://www.ukgbc.org/news/nottingham-first-to-adopt-revolutionary-energiesprong-housing-approach/\nPassivhaus or equivalent as standard on all Council new build projects\n5 years after the all party Passivhaus group recommended that the Council build its new developments to the passivhaus standard Kirklees is now doing a pilot project on 12 houses. The lack of a policy on the standard for new build housing in Kirklees at a time when we ought to be leading by example is shameful. The purpose of the pilot has not been explained. What can be learnt by building in Kirklees that can’t be learnt from more progressive Councils in other parts of the country such as Exeter City Council? The lack of a policy is expensive as one-off projects like Kirklees passivhaus pilot come at a cost premium. Having a high energy efficiency standard means developers can invest in skills locally, build capacity and the capability to deliver to the passivhaus standard or equivalent. We should also be seeking funding from the West Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority to help pay for the 4% uplift in costs through gainshare or other regional funding sources.\nhttps://www.apse.org.uk/apse/index.cfm/news/articles/20181/passivhaus-exeter-city-council-leading-by-example/#\nSolar PV Panels on all Council new build projects as standard\nWith rising energy prices we need to find ways of reducing energy demand in the home. So, as well as ‘fabric first’ insulation measures we also should use renewables as much as possible on site.\nFunding could be sought from Combined Authority Gainshare funding but failing that HRA funds could be utilised to achieve this.\n|\n| Cllr Karen Allison |\nEngaging the community in climate action Tackling climate change has got to be made real to local people. Involving people in positive projects helps give people a sense of well being and not just thinking they are at the mercy of decisions by national governments and decisions at global climate summits.\nWe can help them feel empowered and involved in addressing the threat to all our futures. For the next 2 years through the Place partnerships, we wish to support a range of community lead projects to address climate change.\nThis could be improving the energy efficiency of public buildings, tree planting, projects to support biodiversity and nature-based flood prevention measures.\nLearning from others\nKirklees needs to approach its role in addressing climate change with humility. We frequently hear from Labour Cabinet members about how we are ‘the best’ in this policy area. We aren’t. There are positive things happening on the climate agenda in Kirklees but we are not forerunners or innovators in addressing climate change. The lack of a climate action plan lead to the Council getting a 0% rating from Climate Emergency UK earlier this year. Joining the Global Covenant of Mayors would provide us with valuable insight and support form the international community of local and regional authorities addressing climate change. It works to provide value to participating councils by mobilizing the critical financing and technical assistance that members require to access investment. The Global Covenant of Mayors ensures that signatories are continuously supported in their efforts. Cities receive step-by-step guidance and have access to tools, materials, and a dedicated regional/national helpdesk.\nhttps://www.globalcovenantofmayors.org/\nRenewable energy installations in schools\nThe pupils of today are the citizens of the tomorrow. Showing them that renewable energy helps power their school be it from wind, solar or other renewables is a positive for learning and gives a demonstration of hope for a better future.\nFor this scheme we will seek funding through a Community Municipal Investment/ Climate Bond issue. These have been successful in West Berkshire Council and the London Borough of Islington and provide a return to community investors.\nhttps://info.westberks.gov.uk/wbcmi\nhttps://www.abundanceinvestment.com/invest-now/municipal-investments\nMobilising the community to help tackle the cost of living crisis\nThe massive hike in energy bills caused in large part by our dependence on fossil fuels is something that Kirklees Council needs to mobilise itself to address, and a single budget amendment is not the way to do that. There are things we can do though and establishing a fuel poverty fund to help improve the energy efficiency of people living in cold homes in the owner occupied and private sector. We will seek initially to fund this through a charitable trust that the council will establish and seek contributions too through a variety of methods including an appeal through the Council Tax mailing.\nSimilar charitable trusts have been established in other parts of the country and have raised hundreds of thousands of pounds. It has initially been tried in rich Council areas in the south of England but it is worth trying here to bolster and support work being done on broader poverty issues by a range of third sector organisations.\n|\n| Cllr Sue Lee-Richards |\nSupporting active travel We lack a programme to support the development of a protected cycleway network in Kirklees. This proposal will kick start that programme and we would push for a reprioritisation of the West Yorkshire Transport Fund away from road building and road widening projects.\nSafer streets for all\nThose of us who have tried to get traffic calming to make people feel safer in their communities from speeding traffic have frequently been frustrated.\nGreen Councillors have prioritised ward budgets, public realm funding and any other funds we could use to get roads traffic calmed to make roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists. This has been in the face of limited budgets and against Kirklees Highways policy. We need sustained funding to support area wide traffic calming on residential roads so we are able to respond positively to community concerns, take a preventative approach to traffic speeds rather than one rationed on the basis of injury accidents.\nBetter adult social care\nPositive work was carried out a few years ago by the Administration helping establish Valley Care a community based care cooperative. Our proposal is to provide staff to support the development of Community Based Care Cooperatives in Kirklees. Members of the Care Cooperatives will have a stake in the organisation they work for and the emphasis is on care not the profit motive.\nWe will support the development of Care Cooperatives that will operate on the basis of reinvesting surpluses in improving and extending the services they offer to provide a wide range of care services.\nThese cooperatives will provide all staff with at least the living wage, a training programme which supports development and progression. This model of care provision will also play a role in raising standards in the wider care sector.\nhttps://www.valleycare.coop/\nUnder development – An Employers Workplace Parking Levy\nWe believe establishing a workplace parking levy to support public transport and active travel in Kirklees is worth investigating further. Employers with fewer than 10 parking spaces pay nothing at all. Employers offering more than 10 parking spaces pay a fee of £1.17 per day per parking space. There are exemptions for local emergency services, NHS frontline staff and blue badge holders.\nIn Nottingham, the Workplace Parking Levy on employers has raised more than £9 million each year, with the revenue used to fund tram infrastructure, a smart card scheme, electric buses and cycling facilities. Leicester are also looking at introducing a Workplace Parking Levy.\nKirklees Climate Commission\nWe are disappointed that there appears to be no dedicated budget line in the Administration’s budget for Kirklees Climate Commision (KCC). Given the importance the Administration have placed on setting up KCC and their position as vice chair we would have expected to see a dedicated budget that KCC would manage independently of the council to facilitate administration, sourcing third party research and working in the communities' interest.\nWe would hope that the council can rectify this outside the 2022-23 budget process so the KCC can establish independence in order to demonstrate a degree of self-determination that they can exercise in collaboration with other partners such as the Chamber of Commerce, University of Huddersfield and others.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

The pedestrian crossing will be at the junction of Damside Road and Kings Mill Road where it meets the end of Newsome Road just before Kings Bridge. The route is a well used route by locals and students making their way into Huddersfield Town Centre. The works will commence in May and take around 4 weeks but the route through Newsome Road over the bridge into the Town Centre will be open with the 2 adjoining roads closed off as work take place.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper said,\n“We have been asking for a safe crossing here for some time\nand are pleased to let people know that pedestrian facilities are finally to be\ninstalled at Kings Bridge. This is a busy route between Newsome and the Town\nCentre where people literally take their life in their hands crossing this busy\nroad.

He's not a big fan of equality laws and would rather we just managed to do the right thing without them. It doesn't take a genius to work out the pretty dire state we would be without the protection from unscrupulous employers that equality laws have provided.\nThe portion of the interview that took me by surprise was that a woman in one part of the world has apparently married a dog. I just took this to be a dubious and bizarre skateboarding duck type story and treated it accordingly. Tom however saw this as a seriously moral issue and cited the Bible. I did wonder whether there was a negative subtext from Tom here about recent changes in the law allowing gay marraige. I hope not. He really needs to lighten up a bit.\nOverall I enjoyed the experience despite feeling a bit ropey but more opportunity for debate between different viewpoints would make these interviews more interesting to potential viewers.\nGreens welcome EU move to cut clutter with single charger for mobilephones - Meanwhile UKIP charge in wrong direction!\n| Andrew Cooper with a multitude of different phone chargers |\nYorkshire and the Humber Green Party’s Andrew Cooper said,\n\"What a great idea! I hate having to look for the right charger and fish through different sets of wires for that special socket. Mobile phone companies have had people over a barrel on chargers for years, demanding often exorbitant prices for replacements. They add to the ever growing clutter of redundant plastic and metal waste which ends up in landfill or worse, dumped in the environment harming wildlife.\"\nUKIP have opposed the move claiming that it will harm creativity, but Cllr Cooper, the Greens’ lead Euro candidate in May’s elections, disagreed.\n\"How will having a single socket harm creativity?\" he asked. \"We don’t need separate adaptors for TV sets or washing machines, so what's different about mobile phones?\n“UKIP are charging completely in the wrong direction! If anything, I hope the EU will extend the ruling to cover MP3 players, cameras and all the electronic gadgets that are increasingly basic parts of day to day life.\"\nThe European Parliament decision follows a previous ruling to reduce data roaming charges imposed by mobile phone companies on consumers travelling across Europe.\n\"This is simple regulation which works. It shows the power of the Parliament to act for the benefit of ordinary people,\" Cllr Cooper added. \"But we need to elect more MEPs who are committed to consumer protection. Greens consistently put people before profit.\"\n------------------------------------------\nFriday, 14 March 2014\nSaturday, 8 March 2014\nMonday, 3 March 2014\nPRESS RELEASE - Andrew Cooper makes it into Top Ten Sustainability Twitter users\n| \"What I had for breakfast\" - a subject not covered on Andrew's Twitter |\nEcobuild the top industry event for sustainable construction and the built environment has named Andrew Cooper as one of the most influential Twitter users.

The list is comprised of public nominations, from which the Ecobuild team has carefully selected the final 100 based on relevant content, engagement and Klout score.\nIn response to popular demand, we have this year, also selected a list of the top ten individuals within the #Ecobuild100, recognising some of the unsung heroes in the industry who are striving to bring sustainable issues to the forefront of the social debate\"\nAndrew said,\n\"Obviously pleased that my use of 140 characters has found favour. I never tweet about what I've had for breakfast but I do link it to my blog where I've usually a fair bit to say about matters to do with sustainable energy, the local council and issues in the area that I represent as a Councillor.

Speaking at a fringe meeting at the Green Party's spring conference\nin Liverpool they expressed their determination to kick the far right out of\nthe North West and Yorkshire & Humber regions. These regions elected the\nBNP's only members of the European Parliament in 2009.\nAndrew\nCooper, lead candidate for Yorkshire and Humber region and a Kirklees\ncouncillor, said:\n“It’s\na stain on Yorkshire and Humber that we elected a BNP member to the European\nParliament in 2009 and we're determined to reverse that decision this time. But\nrather than focusing on a political party whose days are numbered, I'll be\ncampaigning on the issues that really matter to people - explaining how we\ncreate more jobs, how we can improve our local economy and how we use practical\nsolutions to tackle climate change.\n\"We\nwant to be proud of our MEPs so that we can say 'there's someone in Brussels\nfighting for what I believe in'.\"\nSpeaking\nabout UKIP, Andrew Cooper said \"UKIP don’t turn up to vote in the European\nParliament and they’re not involved in the business of the parliament, but\nthey’re very happy to take the money. Greens have an excellent attendance\nrecord which means we're at the table when crucial decisions are being\nmade.\"\nThe\nfringe meeting also welcomed Clara Palliard, PCS Culture Sector President and a\nmember of Merseyside TUC, who urged her fellow trade unionists to back the\nGreen Party in May. She highlighted the violence, intimidation and threats\nsuffered by many anti-racism campaigners in the region and called on trade\nunionists to back the Greens.\nClara\nPalliard said: \"The Green Party is clearly in a good position to beat the\nBNP in May. That's why trade unionists across the region are coming out in\nfavour of the Greens as a robust challenger to the threat of the far right. The\nbottom line is we’ve got one fascist too many and that's Griffin. We also have\nto be vigilant against the rise of UKIP who are simply fascists in disguise.\nUKIP and the mainstream parties would have us believe that austerity is the\nonly show in town, that the cuts are inevitable. The Green Party rejects that\nview and offers an alternative - jobs, decent working conditions, a fairer\ndistribution of wealth and a sensible strategy to tackle climate change and its\ndevastating consequences.\"\nPeter\nCranie, the Green lead for the North West region said: \"Sadly the BNP has\nnot gone away. They were out on the streets of Wythenshawe at the recent\nby-election. We came incredibly close to stopping them back in 2009 and we're\nhopeful that we will kick them out this May. If they lose their seats they'll\nlose their European funding and without that money they’ll be finished as a\npolitical force. Their ejection from the parliament will remove their\nlegitimacy and their right to participate in media debates.\"\nHe\nconcluded: \"As for UKIP, I intend to expose them for what they are. Their\nracism, lies, double standards and a shocking lack of policy should mean they\nhave no place in British politics. Our job is to engage with people about their\nproblems and their fears and show that xenophobic rhetoric from businessmen who\ncall for more cuts and less protection for working people is not the answer.\nThe Green Party is challenging austerity, standing up for working people and\nmaking the case for a positive alternative.\"\n-------------------------------------\nContact:\nCllr Andrew Cooper\nLead\nGreen Euro candidate, Yorkshire and the Humber\n01484\n667519 | 07721 348619\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",

We weren’t willing to accept large reductions in care for vulnerable people, and so we took an opposing position (along with the verbal abuse from the 3 larger parties) We are confident we did the right thing.\nFebruary Kirklees successfully gained Fairtrade status, and many community groups, children’s centres and schools joined us in celebrating this achievement during Fairtrade fortnight. The Fairtrade Foundation was successful in gaining the world record for the longest length of bunting and it was all made from Fairtrade cotton. Many of the bunting triangles came from Kirklees. In February I was being re-elected as Chairperson of Newsome Ward Community Forum. The title of Chairperson gives the impression of leading on the work we do, and in some cases that is true, but in other cases, the team just tell me what to do now!\nFebruary included the ongoing debates over the budget and we continued to champion the needs of vulnerable people. We also had a visit from Caroline Lucas Green Party MP, and I hosted the public meeting where she addressed a large crowd, supported by our Andrew. The questions from the public were constructive and considered.\nIn March I went to a free conference provided by the Local Government Association about Localism. I know many people are anxious about the bits of information in the news and how it would affect local people. The conference didn’t help much, it focussed mainly on Social Enterprises and working with the voluntary sector; something I already do a lot of and is commonplace across Kirklees.\nApril I lead on arrangements for a street party in my neighbourhood for the Royal Wedding, and it was great to see so many people, from many different backgrounds, come out to celebrate just being British. April was also very busy with the build up to the local elections, but also very enjoyable, as I got to speak to many positive people.\nMay: What a great result in the Local Elections! I was delighted to have won so convincingly with over 50% of the vote. Thank you to all of you who believe in me – I won’t let you down.\nFollowing the elections I was reappointed as Lead Member for the Council’s Overview and Scrutiny Panel for Resources. It oversees very complex fast moving issues due to the need to restructure the Council due to big reductions in Council budgets. Trying to save £83m without impacting on front line services will be difficult to achieve, e.g. front line workers need to do their own admin / office work as back of house staff are reduced, so they can’t be out doing their main role as much as they used to.\nIn June I was appointed to the Board of Trustees for the One Community Foundation. It was established in May 2010, to generate financial support for local community activities. Our role is to build and manage a series of endowment funds, so that we can make a lasting contribution across Kirklees, by delivering grants to local groups and the wider community. You can help raise funds by doing your on-line Christmas shopping via http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/causes/onecommunity\nIn July, I made time to do a sponsored Dragon Boat Race for the Huddersfield Rotary, and I got to Captain their team. The majority of the money raised went to the two hospices, with a little of the profits going to their local charity funds. I also managed to do the Race for Life this year, I’d not been able to do it for a couple of years, and it was great to be a part of it again.\nThe Newsome Out To Play sub group of the community forum gained funding to develop local play opportunities for children of all ages, arrange training for volunteers, enable better co-ordination of activity, etc. One of the highlights of the year was the Play Day event on 3rd August; I was amazed by how many people joined in.\nAugust: Newsome High School had tremendous GCSE results, and is going from strength to strength. I’ve been a Governor at the school for several years and I’m so pleased with the continual improvements and achievements.\nSeptember: Members of CPRE (Campaign for the Protection of Rural England) arranged for us to talk to local residents at a public meeting in Hall Bower Chapel, which was very helpful. Andrew and I were able to share our views about the impending Localism Bill and the National Planning Policy Framework, and listen to concerns of local people.\nOctober: While I was Mayor of Kirklees, I chose to champion local farming and local food production, and this campaign had several lasting legacies. In October I was delighted to help present awards to several more schools who have achieved the Soil Association Food for Life Bronze Awards. We now have 24 local schools who have achieved this award and 25 more progressing towards it. The School Catering Service itself has achieved the Soil Association’s Bronze Food for Life Catering Mark for its healthy meals supplied to 184 schools across Kirklees. The March figures show that Kirklees Catering Service was the second largest local authority caterer in the country and the only one in the Yorkshire and Humber region to have achieved this award.\nNovember:\nThere is a Special Meeting of Council scheduled for 23rd November regarding the LDF, which hadn’t taken place at the time of writing this report. We will do all we can to influence the LDF policies; to protect our valuable open spaces, to ensure there is space for agriculture, and to ensure development is targeted at the real needs of our communities.\nDecember: We’ve arranged a Special Public meeting for 1st December to help raise awareness about Welfare Reform. Another huge challenge facing everyone is the cuts to benefits, there are 47 in total which are being introduced in stages until April 2013. One of the biggest changes will be the Housing Benefit changes which will be introduced in January. Council have produced an information booklet to try and help. Copies are available at Together Shop in Newsome, as well as Children’s Centres, Council Information Points and Job Centre Plus.\nThe Budget process starts again in December, meaning another series of briefings and debates on the best way to manage the huge reduction in funds provided by the Government. It’s a position no one would want to be in and some tough decisions will need to be made. I’m not looking forward to it, but I do take it very seriously and will be taking an active part in the process.\nThe ‘Kiddies Xmas Party’ takes place again on 10th December, all organised by volunteers of Newsome Ward Community Forum, and always a wonderful occasion; the start of the Christmas season for me. I’ll be doing the ‘Santa Dash’, organised by the Lions Club of Huddersfield, in Huddersfield the next day to help raise funds for the Mayor’s Charity Appeal – the ‘Forget Me Not Trust’; a very seasonal weekend.\nThroughout the year, casework for individuals seems to be getting more complex; I’ve helped people with things that are common concerns e.g. planning, highways, cleansing issues, but this year there seems to be an increasing number of more personal issues, e.g. home care, care for people with dementia, domestic violence, and anti-social behaviour.\nDespite this sad note to end on, I am looking forward to Christmas and wish you all warmth, health and happiness this Christmas and for the year ahead.\nCllr Julie Stewart-Turner\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2018_06_humanity-on-slab_html/content_627.html": "In Brussels today I saw a 10 foot tall slab of multi coloured concrete erected in a Park between the European Parliament and the Committee of the Regions. There is a small plaque nearby explaining that it is cut from the Berlin Wall and was sent to Brussels in 2014 to commemorate the wall's demise following the end of the Cold War.\nAs I stood there and looked it up and down I pondered its significance. My immediate thought was how reminiscent it was of the black slab in the film '2001 - A Space Odyssey' That rectangular slab (or Monolith) was created by a benevolent alien intelligence that had been subtly but significantly influencing the progress of humanity towards the advanced technological species that we are today.\nThis slab however was not created by anything benevolent at all. It was part of a wall designed to divide people, to provide a physical barrier between 2 different political ideologies. The significance of this particular part of the walls relocation to Brussels was to show by its very presence that the wall did not exist any more in its previous location. Its purpose had been lost, that people divided were now united. So why relocate it to Brussels? As Europe's Capital, Brussels represents the blurring of national boundaries and a recognition that people beyond nation states can have common purpose, that walls and boundaries had less relevance than they once had.\nOf course that positive vision has taken a bit of a battering in recent years. We have seen the subject of walls and barriers between nations rise as people seek to move from areas of war and poverty to countries where they see the opportunity for safety, opportunity and a living. Their actions are completely understandable. Politics has failed them, often in the most dramatic of fashions, and they are on the move. The reactions from the countries that they are moving towards has been mixed. Some have acted with humanity showing the best of what we can be. They have welcomed people often from cultures different to their own and have understood that many have skills, abilities and knowledge that can add to their own and give some positive benefits to society. Then there are those who have been less welcoming. Donald Trump's recent actions on the Mexican border have shown him to be a 'borderline Fascist' in more than one sense and I am not one of those politicians who call someone a 'Fascist' at the drop of the hat. He has truly 'earned' that title. In Hungary the barbaric move to make helping migrants illegal has also shown that some Governments are quite prepared to make common humanity a crime. Being a Good Samaritan has become a risky business in Hungary.\nSo what are we to make of the multicoloured slab in a Park in Brussels? First of all it is important to note that it remains. It may be silent, it may be inert, its purpose may not be immediately apparent but whatever turmoils happen in the political world it will stay there in the park. As walls rise it will remain as a reminder of a more hopeful time when barriers between people were removed. The influence it has will not be of a super advanced technological basis such as the black slab in 2001 but more of a more subtle nature. It will make people ask questions, it will demonstrate that there was widespread hope for the future once and that common humanity and a sense of a bond across national boundaries was a view held by many millions. Any piece of concrete that can make people ask questions is a one important piece of concrete.\nFor those of you who are desperate to understand what '2001 - A Space Odyssey' is all about but can't be bothered to read the original Arthur C Clark's short story 'The Sentinel' here is an explanation of what went on in in the film. Some folks found it a bit cryptic understandably\nSo what are we to make of the multicoloured slab in a Park in Brussels? First of all it is important to note that it remains.

I referred the application to Planning Committee so Councillors could make the decision. They wisely recognised that the extension would not look at all out of place and that the original building was not exactly an architectural masterpiece in any case.\nAt the other end of the architectural scale Huddersfield Parish Church in town wanted to put a 2 storey glass extension which would allow them easy access to the upper floors which are currently inaccessible to the elderly and those with poor mobility. Again Planning opposed the application on aesthetic grounds and I referred it to Planning Committee and Councillors approved it. The argument I put, as well as enabling them to actually use their own building, was that the glass extension would actually enhance the building and that the juxtaposition in architectural styles would actually be a positive thing.\nI've also helped the church at Thurstonland in my Parish Council patch, by putting them onto a low cost loan to help them refurbish their building. I feel I need to make clear that all this work on behalf of religious bodies is by no means a form of insurance just in case my atheism doesn't turn good in the end but a recognition that churches actually fulfill a valuable social role in our communities. There was once last year that a vicar suggested he might turn me on to christianity. I think I manage to convince him that in religious terms at least that I was a bit of a lost cause.\nIt has to be remembered Andrew that the income they draw will be from the Government in terms of subsidies for the production of \"greener\" electricity. So the £5000 grant will cost £50000 in the end.\nReplyDeleteEx Tory candidate.\nWrong Bernard I'm afraid. The Feed In Tariff is not paid for out of taxation.\nReplyDeleteYhe power companies get their money from....?\nReplyDeleteThe Power Companies get their money from customers not taxation. I guess you'd call this a stealth tax but then if you are going to change the way we generate electricity it has to be paid for anyway.

I'm sure she will make valuable contributions to political life there and be a working peer. I look forward to hearing her official title' Baroness Pinnock of Cleckeaton' maybe? The latest round of Lords appointments brought the not unexpected controversey, a number of big donors to the Tory Party got their rewards by being appointed to 'The Lords'. For the Lib Dems this latest round of appointments takes their numbers over the 100 mark. The Green Party has 1 member in the House of Lords, 'Baroness Jones of Moulscomb' or Jenny to her freinds. Moulscomb is the name of the Council Estate in Brighton where she grew up and when she was 'signed up' for the Lords she wore a fake ermine gown for the ceremony so really proud of Jenny for sticking to her principles on that one.\nDid I mention 'principles'? It is always interesting talking about 'principles' and the House of Lords. A few thoughts. Recently in the news we had the positive news that women could soon become Bishops in the Church of England as that institution comes kicking and screaming into the 20th Century just as we are well into the 21st. What I found bizarre was the lack of much mention that this progressive move would mean that these new women bishops would find themselves automatically appointed to the archaic unelected House of Lords. OK quick quiz question, 'Which 2 countries allow religious priests into their legislative bodies?' Ok you know one, it's the UK right! The other is another beloved well respected democracy, yes you guessed it, Iran! Is there any logic to having people in the House of Lords, who represent a body that as a central tenet believes in the supernatural? Well they have gone through an election process of sorts from within their membership unlike many Tory donors . I'm always happy when someone stands up to the many Government policies which I regard as regressive and that is often Bishops in the absence of many political defenders. It does however make me feel uncomfortable that these champions of the underprivileged seem about as relevant as the wizards in Hogwarts Castle. They are generally benign but the fact that I am reluctant to see them go is more a reflection of the awful state of our backwards democracy more than any logical argument for their retention. in our legislature.\nThis brings us, (on the subject of principles and the House of Lords) to House of Lords reform, the Coalition Agreement and the Liberal Democrats. It was going to be great, well better anyway. We were going to have a wholly (or mainly) elected second chamber elected by proportional representation with 450 members. The draft bill when it went in front of Parliament in 2011 was by no means perfect. There were still appointments and 12 'Lords Spiritual'. Ultimately 91 Tory MPs defied their Government Whip and Labour didn't exactly cover themselves in glory by effectively allowing the status quo to continue.So it was dead in the water and so much for the Coalition Agreement. Future appointments to the House of Lords were to reflect Party shares of the votes at the 2010 General Election but definitely not the 2014 Euro Election where the Greens beat the Lib Dems. I'd like to see more Greens in the House of Lords influencing policy but I find it bizarre that the archaic House of Lords is allowed to continue in existence as well as still having elections by the 'first past the Past system. We are truly a backwards excuse for a 'democracy'. We may well be the mother of all democracies but our children have by far surpassed us and left us behind.\nDid I mention 'principles'?

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2022_02/content_187.html": "Starting the retrofit\nrevolution in Kirklees\n|\n| Cllr Cooper visiting Energiesprong homes in Nottingham |\nThe Council has made a start on\nretrofitting its own housing stock. This is positive but what is lacking is a\nfinancially sustainable model, which can deliver improvement to homes at scale\nto a zero-energy standard. Our proposal based on the Energiesprong (energy leap)\nmodel addresses this and provides a way of building the capacity and capability\nto deliver for owner occupiers and the wider housing sector.\nEnergiesprong work with local Councils on developing a\nprogramme to deliver warmer homes through a retrofit programme delivering a\nhome which is net zero energy, meaning it generates the total amount of energy\nrequired for its heating, hot water and electrical appliances. It also provides superior indoor comfort.\nThis is achieved using prefabricated facades, insulated rooftops with solar\npanels, smart heating, and ventilation and cooling installations. A\nrefurbishment comes with a long-year performance warranty on both the indoor\nclimate and the energy performance for up to 40 years. A complete home makeover\ncan be completed in as little as a day!\nEnergiesprong are not a contractor themselves but work with\ncouncils to help procure contractors to deliver to the Energiesprong\nspecification.\nCouncils such as Nottingham, Exeter and a number of London\nBoroughs are already working together on Energiesprong projects as part of the\nRetrofit Accelerator Homes Investment Partnership. They share best practice and\nexpertise and have been successful in a number of funding bids to government drawing\nin millions to support the development of the Energiesprong model.\nHow much does it cost?\nThe cost for an initial 50 properties would be around\n£85,000/property. The expectation is that for future rounds of properties that\nthis would reduce to around £55,000/property as economies of scale are realised.\nHow is it paid for?\nThere is some initial outlay for setting up the\nEnergiesprong approach through the Housing Revenue Account but as the capital\ncosts come down the expectation is that it would become self-financing through\nlower maintenance and servicing costs e.g., no gas safety checks, lower\nmaintenance etc and through charging a comfort charge to the tenant.\nEnergiesprong guarantee that the fuel bill that the tenants pay plus the\ncomfort charge will be less than they were paying in energy costs for their\nhome before refurbishment.\nhttps://www.energiesprong.uk/\nhttps://www.energiesprong.uk/newspage/innovation-partnership-why-a-new-approach-to-retrofit-procurement-is-key-to-net-zero\nhttps://www.ukgbc.org/news/nottingham-first-to-adopt-revolutionary-energiesprong-housing-approach/\nPassivhaus or equivalent\nas standard on all Council new build projects\n5 years after the all party\nPassivhaus group recommended that the Council build its new developments to the\npassivhaus standard Kirklees is now doing a pilot project on 12 houses. The\nlack of a policy on the standard for new build housing in Kirklees at a time\nwhen we ought to be leading by example is shameful. The purpose of the pilot has\nnot been explained. What can be learnt by building in Kirklees that can’t be learnt\nfrom more progressive Councils in other parts of the country such as Exeter\nCity Council?\nThe lack of a policy is expensive as one-off projects like\nKirklees passivhaus pilot come at a cost premium. Having a high energy\nefficiency standard means developers can invest in skills locally, build\ncapacity and the capability to deliver to the passivhaus standard or\nequivalent. We should also be seeking funding from the West Yorkshire Mayoral\nCombined Authority to help pay for the 4% uplift in costs through gainshare or\nother regional funding sources.\nhttps://www.apse.org.uk/apse/index.cfm/news/articles/20181/passivhaus-exeter-city-council-leading-by-example/#\nSolar PV Panels on all\nCouncil new build projects as standard\nWith rising energy prices we need to find ways of reducing\nenergy demand in the home. So, as well as ‘fabric first’ insulation measures we\nalso should use renewables as much as possible on site.\nFunding could be sought from Combined Authority Gainshare\nfunding but failing that HRA funds could be utilised to achieve this.\n|\n| Cllr Karen Allison |\nEngaging\nthe community in climate action\nTackling climate change has got to be made real to local\npeople. Involving people in positive projects helps give people a sense of well\nbeing and not just thinking they are at the mercy of decisions by national\ngovernments and decisions at global climate summits.\nWe can help them feel empowered and involved in addressing\nthe threat to all our futures. For the next 2 years through the Place partnerships,\nwe wish to support a range of community lead projects to address climate\nchange.\nThis could be improving the energy efficiency of public\nbuildings, tree planting, projects to support biodiversity and nature-based\nflood prevention measures.\nLearning from others\nKirklees\nneeds to approach its role in addressing climate change with humility. We\nfrequently hear from Labour Cabinet members about how we are ‘the best’ in this\npolicy area. We aren’t. There are positive things happening on the climate\nagenda in Kirklees but we are not forerunners or innovators in addressing\nclimate change. The lack of a climate action plan lead to the Council getting a\n0% rating from Climate Emergency UK earlier this year. Joining the Global Covenant\nof Mayors would provide us with valuable insight and support form the\ninternational community of local and regional authorities addressing climate\nchange. It works to provide value to participating councils by mobilizing the\ncritical financing and technical assistance that members require to access\ninvestment. The Global Covenant of Mayors ensures that signatories are\ncontinuously supported in their efforts. Cities receive step-by-step guidance\nand have access to tools, materials, and a dedicated regional/national\nhelpdesk.\nhttps://www.globalcovenantofmayors.org/\nRenewable energy installations\nin schools\nThe pupils of today are the citizens of the tomorrow. Showing\nthem that renewable energy helps power their school be it from wind, solar or\nother renewables is a positive for learning and gives a demonstration of hope\nfor a better future.\nFor this scheme we will seek funding through a Community Municipal\nInvestment/ Climate Bond issue. These have been successful in West Berkshire Council\nand the London Borough of Islington and provide a return to community\ninvestors.\nhttps://info.westberks.gov.uk/wbcmi\nhttps://www.abundanceinvestment.com/invest-now/municipal-investments\nMobilising the community\nto help tackle the cost of living crisis\nThe massive hike in energy bills caused in large part by our\ndependence on fossil fuels is something that Kirklees Council needs to mobilise\nitself to address, and a single budget amendment is not the way to do that.\nThere are things we can do though and establishing a fuel poverty fund to help\nimprove the energy efficiency of people living in cold homes in the owner\noccupied and private sector. We will seek initially to fund this through a\ncharitable trust that the council will establish and seek contributions too\nthrough a variety of methods including an appeal through the Council Tax mailing.\nSimilar charitable trusts have been established in other parts\nof the country and have raised hundreds of thousands of pounds. It has initially\nbeen tried in rich Council areas in the south of England but it is worth trying\nhere to bolster and support work being done on broader poverty issues by a\nrange of third sector organisations.\n|\n| Cllr Sue Lee-Richards |\nSupporting\nactive travel\nWe lack a programme to support the development of a\nprotected cycleway network in Kirklees. This proposal will kick start that\nprogramme and we would push for a reprioritisation of the West Yorkshire\nTransport Fund away from road building and road widening projects.\nSafer streets for all\nThose of us who have tried to get traffic calming to make\npeople feel safer in their communities from speeding traffic have frequently\nbeen frustrated.\nGreen Councillors have prioritised ward budgets, public\nrealm funding and any other funds we could use to get roads traffic calmed to\nmake roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists. This has been in the face of\nlimited budgets and against Kirklees Highways policy. We need sustained funding\nto support area wide traffic calming on residential roads so we are able to\nrespond positively to community concerns, take a preventative approach to\ntraffic speeds rather than one rationed on the basis of injury accidents.\nBetter adult social care\nPositive work was carried out a few years ago by the\nAdministration helping establish Valley Care a community based care\ncooperative. Our proposal is to provide staff to support the development of\nCommunity Based Care Cooperatives in Kirklees. Members of the Care Cooperatives\nwill have a stake in the organisation they work for and the emphasis is on care\nnot the profit motive.\nWe will support the\ndevelopment of Care Cooperatives that will operate on the basis of reinvesting\nsurpluses in improving and extending the services they offer to provide a wide\nrange of care services.\nThese cooperatives will provide all staff with at least the\nliving wage, a training programme which supports development and progression.\nThis model of care provision will also play a role in raising standards in the\nwider care sector.\nhttps://www.valleycare.coop/\nUnder development – A\nKirklees Workplace Parking Levy\nNot included in this Green Party Budget amendment but we\nbelieve establishing a workplace parking levy to support public transport and\nactive travel in Kirklees is worth investigating further. Employers with fewer\nthan 10 parking spaces pay nothing at all.\nEmployers offering more than 10 parking spaces pay a fee of £1.17 per\nday per parking space. There are\nexemptions for local emergency services, NHS frontline staff and blue badge\nholders.\nIn Nottingham, the Workplace Parking Levy on employers has\nraised more than £9 million each year, with the revenue used to fund tram\ninfrastructure, a smart card scheme, electric buses and cycling facilities.\nLeicester are also looking at introducing a Workplace Parking Levy.\nKirklees Climate Commission\nWe are disappointed that there appears to be no dedicated\nbudget line in the Administration’s budget for Kirklees Climate Commision\n(KCC). Given the importance the Administration have placed on setting up KCC\nand their position as vice chair we would have expected to see a dedicated\nbudget that KCC would manage independently of the council to facilitate\nadministration, sourcing third party research and working in the communities'\ninterest.\nWe would hope that the council can rectify this outside\nthe 2022-23 budget process so the KCC can establish independence in order to\ndemonstrate a degree of self-determination that they can exercise in\ncollaboration with other partners such as the Chamber of Commerce, University\nof Huddersfield and others.",

It would have been more\ndifficult for the Coalition Govt to introduce these changes if a previous\ngovernment hadn’t opened the door to privatisation. By changing the NHS from a\nservices provider to a commissioner of services it gave a far greater role to\nthe private sector in the NHS. Hospital Trusts increasingly contracted out\nservices to the private sector. Public money supported the extortionately expensive\nPrivate Finance Initiative used to build hospitals with no reasonable\nalternative funding source provided by govt. Unfortunately there are many other\nexamples of the creeping privatisation of the NHS allowed under a previous\ngovt.\nThe Coalition’s view of the Health service is very narrow\nand infact NHS to them stands for a Narrow Health Service. One where the Health\nService delivered by the public sector narrows and one where the private,\nprofiteering sector just keeps on growing.\nThe Green Party is 100% behind a publicly funded,\npublicly managed and publicly delivered National Health Service focused on\nprevention of illness, the promotion of good health and the treatment of those\nin need whatever their income or background. Such a National Health Service is\nthe hallmark of a civilised society. One which invests taxation to the benefit\nof the public not one which uses peoples taxes to pay the profits of\nshareholders .\nWe know that when the private sector gets involved in the\ndelivery of public services that there will always be a tension between the\nneed to deliver good quality care and the need to provide a dividend to\nshareholders. Something will have to give be that staff wages, specialist\nequipment or even lifesaving drugs. Will we be faced with a situation where\nincreasingly the cost of delivering vital health services will be the deciding\nfactor to an even greater degree than it is at the moment.\nWe now need to broaden the Coalitions narrow vision of the\nNHS to one which inspires and fits with the expectations and values of our\nnation\nThe National Health Service is a whole and holistic\nservice not one where the public sector picks up only the parts which the\nprivate sector finds too difficult, problematic or simply unprofitable\nThe National Health Service is a public service not one\nfor private profit\nThe only ‘shareholders’ who should benefit from the\nNational Health Service should be the public who fund it.\nThe initials ‘CCG’ should not stand for Clinical\nCommissioning Groups.

Films and TV programmes have placed the social fabric under stress in any number of dystopian and post apocalyptic dramas. The BBC's Survivors about a pandemic in the 70s with devastating effects killing millions and spread by global air travel springs to mind. Whether its zombies, triffids or a pandemic the story is all about how society and individuals respond when placed under strain. Already we have seen the best and worst of human nature. People volunteering to help the vulnerable in their droves, council services reshaping themselves to deal with the current crisis and Government giving unprecedented support to seek to ensure we return to some sort of normality. We have to hope they succeed. And then there's the panic buying. I guess a lot of us wish we had shares in toilet roll manufacturers as toilet rolls appear to be like gold dust at present. The panic buying is because there is panic. Many people have not adjusted to the new 'normal'. because it isn't normal and we're only at the beginning.\nWhat is the role of local politicians in these times? More than ever we have to be visible, available and reassuring. Life goes on. There are potholes to fix, drains to be unblocked, traffic calming to be installed. As Newsome Ward Councillors we will be doing a street by street survey over the next few weeks. Most of the Council and community meetings we were scheduled to attend have been cancelled. We are not banned from walking the streets so why not. So if you're a Newsome Ward resident and you see one of us then please say \"hello\" (from 2 metres apart) and let us know your story. We'll get through this.\nRather than the chilling opening sequence from 1975 BBC's Survivors here's Curtis Mayfield's 'Move on up' It's a shot of optimism that's helped lift me when I needed it so maybe it will help you too.

Predictably the members of the Home Builders Federation were resistant from the start and increased cost of building for their membership would be a constant pressure to dilute the target. Ironically the feed in tariff for renewable electricity could completely negate the cost of installing solar photovoltaic panels for developers by assigning the tariff to them ( and would provide them with an income to boot). This could also be the same for renewable heat technologies dependent on the outcome of the Renewable Heat Incentive consultation in October. So ironically the 'eco-bling' as its critics call it, the highest cost could cost the developer nothing and indeed make them a profit.\n| The Denby Dale Passivhaus |\nSo the real question is around the thermal performance standard of new build housing, the insulation, the airtightness, the recovery of heat through ventilation. The emphasis on the importance of this in the design has been stressed by proponents of the Passivhaus approach where addressing the need for energy demand during the design and construction phase is paramount. Here in Huddersfield, where else, we are ahead of the game with the Denby Dale Passivhaus. This was constructed for a private owner by the Green Building Company and it has raised serious questions about the governments Code for Sustainable Homes on which the Zero Carbon Standard was to be based. Ironically their property would only acheive a Code Level 3 on the Code for Sustainable Homes because of it's calculation methodology not because of its actual carbon emissions. So to put it clearly, one of the best performing homes in the UK in terms of thermal performance ever would be illegal if the zero carbon homes standard became law but would probably produce less emissions. There's some great resources on how the property was constructed including Bill Butcher's excellent construction diary here.\nSo what are we to conclude from all this. Well the government would not be right to water down the Code for Sustainable Homes if anything it should be tightened up. Should we ignore microgeneration as many in the Passivhaus movement suggest? I don't think so, electricity consumption by homes remains an issue and if anything the use of photovoltaics should be mandatory on new build houses and the financial mechanisms that make this possible should be retained. The rumblings are that government is looking again at the tariff levels for the feed in tariff. Let's hope that if they are it doesn't take us backwards.\nHi Andrew,\nReplyDeleteI know this is not within the topic of your blog post but I would like to pose a question if I may. What is your interpretation of 'Big Society' and what implications does it have for us in Newsome ward?\nThanks\nGareth\nGareth\nReplyDeleteWorthy of a seperate blogpost in itself. Lots of locally relevant stuff on the 'Big Society', Newsome Ward Community Forum, Growing Newsome, Free Christmas Bus Service, Clean Ups.\nThe big questions\nIs it more than just saying volunteering is really good?\nIs there the capacity and the will amongst people to get involved in their community and run services. Is it always appropriate anyway?\nIs it just another way of marketing of cuts by the ConDems?\nBy nature I prefer community led approaches such as that promoted by the Transition Towns movement but can we really believe this approach is part of the Conservatives DNA? Actually is it really part of the Lib Dems DNA? Now that is worthy of some examination.\nThanks for this, obviously I've outlined my prejudices here but I'll give it some thought and do a blogpost on it shortly\nRegards\nAndrew\nThanks Andrew I'll look forward to reading that post.\nReplyDeleteI agree with your Big Question about the capacity and will in local communities. The examples you mention in Newsome I think indicates that there is an impressive degree of social capital in the neighbourhood already, and this is as I'm sure you are aware, the elusive 'money can't buy' component of regeneration projects across the north of England. On the subject of resources, it would be interesting to know just how government intends to distribute the funds of the Big Society Bank and how aspiring citizens and communities can access it.",

The area I highlighted was the increase in the interest costs of prudential borrowing for Councils. Just as Government is saying to the banks that they should make it easier to lend money (and are largely being ignored) Government itself is raising the costs of public sector borrowing making it more expensive to get economic regeneration projects off the ground.\nThe next area we looked at was the localisation of Council Tax. One possible impact is that adjoining boroughs could have differing policies on Council Tax Benefit. This is clearly bonkers and inequitable and not in the least fair. The reality however may be that there is so little financial flexibility anyway that varying policies may become more difficult but peraps not in Dorset!\nResponsibility for Consessionary Fares is being transferred to Councils but surprise, surprise the funding allowed from central government may not actually cover the costs. I did wryly point out that the cuts in funding to the PTEs will mean less subsidy for rural and off peak services. These are the very services that many pensioners use and as such the opportunity for them to take advantage of free public transport might be more limited anyway. Less public transport , less concessionary fares. So perhaps this is a well thought out Government policy!\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

The idea behind this is to give the old Milnsbridge Socialist Club a new lease of life and as a useful centre and venue for radical/progressive politics. It gave me some cause for thought about some of the labels we go by in politics. As Milnsbridge Socialist Club it's traditional allegiance would have been to the Labour Party when 'socialism'and Labour were regarded as pretty much the same thing. With the loss of Clause 4 and a recent Labour Government which did its own share of privatisation, being a Socialist in the Labour Party may be more of a convenience than a conviction for those who label themselves as such. There's also no end of other groupings who are proud to shout from the rooftops their socialism e.g. The Socialist Party, Trade Unionist and Socialist against the Cuts, the Socialist Workers Party, the Alliance for Green Socialism. Within the Green Party we have people who regard themselves as socialists and organise themselves under the banner of 'Green Left'.\nI've never regarded my own politics as socialist. I'm philosophically a Liberal and believe strongly in the positive freedoms of the individual and freedom from 'Ignorance, Poverty and Conformity' as we used to say in the Young Liberals back in the 80's. I'm sure some folks in the Liberal Democrats still say that now but with much less credibility given their bedfellows. In Kirklees Council meetings the Tory Leader once described me as an 'extreme socialist' which I found pretty amusing and reflected more how far to the right of the Tories he was than any understanding of my own politics or motivations. I'm not frightened by the word 'socialist' nor regard it as a negative it just doesn't reflect my own political background . I usually tell Tories who accuse me of being a Socialist or a 'Watermelon' (red on the inside green on the outside -geddit? Yawn) that they've got it wrong and \"No I'm not a Socialist I'm much worse than that!\" They sort of wander away looking a bit confused.\nBack to 'The Red and Green Club' and all credit to Labour Cllr Paul Salveson for pushing this venture and for stepping above the tribalism that is Party Politics. The Colne Valley has a strong radical tradition with the Luddites, Socialist MP Victor Grayson and I would argue Liberal MP Richard Wainwright a life long pacifist who worked as an ambulance driver in World War 2 rather than take up arms. I'm not suggesting Paul changes the name to 'The Red, Green and Yellow Club' the Lib Dems have obviously moved a long way since Richard Wainwright's time.\nIf you want to have a go at objectively testing how socialist/radical/tender you are there is a test you can take. I guess Tories/UKIP people could take it in the same way someone might want to test if they've got some awful disease. My scores for the record were radicalism 96.75 socialism 88 tenderness 55 (got a bit of work to do on that last one) so here's Andrew Strong singing 'Try a little Tenderness'\nMonday, 5 August 2013\nWelcome to Frackland! - land of gassy gaffes\nConservative Peer Lord Howell's gaffe that fracking for natural gas should be pursued in the 'desolate North East' was shortly followed by a correction that he meant the North West - oh that's alright then! This was followed up by yet another gaffe by Tory Energy Minister Michael Fallon saying in a private meeting \"It's from Dorset all the way along through Hampshire... perhaps into a bit of Surrey and even my own County of Kent.... All these people writing leaders saying 'Why don't they get on with shale?' We are going to see whether they like the flaring at the end of the drive.\" The truth is that most regions in England, including Yorkshire and the Humber, are potential targets for the fracking industry.\nThere are of course going to be comparisons with wind energy and already toff Tory boy MP William Rees Mogg has made comments along the lines of preferring fracking to wind energy, that according to his uniformed view doesn't produce significant amounts of electricity. Untrue, but then the truth isn't what this is all about, because this is about money and interests. There are strong Tory links to the petrochemical industry hence the tax breaks for this polluting form of energy and the warm reception to the prospect of wide scale fracking operations by many of them. Less explicable is the support from the Lib Dems, Labour and UKIP for fracking but then all their energy policies are in a complete mess. All support the expansion of cost spiralling dangerous nuclear energy at a huge potential public subsidy of the scale that the renewables sector could only dream of. All ignore the long term financial and environmental costs of both fracking and nuclear.\n'Fracking' (and nuclear) are being pursued in the name of 'energy security' but real security will come from reducing our demand for all energy, no matter how it is produced. All the 3 large Westminster parties have no credible domestic energy conservation strategy relying instead on the public to take out Green Deal loans to improve their homes over 25 years at 7%+ interest rates. This is not surprisingly proving to be very unattractive to householders and DECC have now released £20million to encourage Councils to draw up plans to promote this failing scheme. As the product itself is no good no end of promotion is going to make this turkey fly. Contrast the underfunded ill conceived Green Deal with the use of £50billion of public money in HS2 which will end up being a private business rather than using it to improve the energy efficiency of the public's homes. Surely supporting the reduction in domestic energy demand is more important than simply accommodating it through provision of locally polluting and globally damaging fracking for gas but then what interest is there in the saving of energy when you're a Tory making money out of using it?\nSaturday, 3 August 2013\nPoll predicts first Green Party MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber\n| Yorkshire Greens - coming out of the shadows |\nThe latest independent opinion poll specifically about next years European Elections is good news for the Green Party and shows we are on target to achieve our first MEP for the Yorkshire and Humber Region.\nThe European Elections are conducted under the list system of voting which gives more proportional outcomes and with 6 MEP positions the prospects for one of those places seeing a Green elected are good. The Yougov Poll for the Electoral Reform Society shows the Greens on over 12% beating the Lib Dems into fifth place and anything over 10% gives us a good chance of ensuring we getting a Yorkshire and Humber seat. As I am the Lead Candidate for the the Greens in our Region this is an exciting prospect and gives people who oppose establishment parties, but don't want to vote a Right Wing Conservative Party Mark 2 like UKiP, a real choice. At the last Euro Poll in 2009 the Greens were just over 1% short of winning and lost out narrowly to the BNP who won the sixth seat. The collapse of the BNP and faltering support for the Lib Dems leaves a real opportunity for the Green Party to make a breakthrough.\nIf elected I wouldn't want it to be one off expression of discontent but a positive vote for an MEP who is trying to get more European funds to help create jobs and worthwhile investment in our communities. Someone who is working to improve the energy performance of our homes and businesses and at the same time helping young people develop skills in worthwhile jobs that they can build a life upon. It is locally owned and managed businesses working together that are the key to a truly sustainable economy where wealth is not siphoned out of our communities. As a Green MEP I would want to work with local councils across our Region to support the development of more sustainable local economies that are more resilient to the insecurities of an increasingly globalised economy.\nWhat concerns me about the current state of UK politics is the lack of a positive vision. Negativity and being against things seems to be how many politicians express themselves all of the time. Of course we need to say when we have legitimate concerns about issues affecting our communities but we must spend at least the same amount of time telling people what our vision for a positive future looks like and what we will do to help us get there.\nDetails of the Yougov Poll here\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",

Large halls, showers, secure, it seemed a good idea. Next let's look at what accommodation we could bring into use to address medium term needs. I was thinking of conversions of empty buildings such as Crown Court Buildings, Huddersfield Technical College, St George's Warehouse to provide personal space as an interim measure before people became embedded in the community. These refurbished units could also fulfil a role to address longer term local housing need and support. It became clear as the meeting unfolded that these ideas were far too radical and sadly unnecessary. The UK Government had not been in touch with Councils like Kirklees to ask for our assistance. Our views and support were not sought. No Minister wrote to us calling for plans on how we could best help at this time of desperate need. It is almost as if hey didn't care.\nThe UK Govt plan is to help 20,000 refugees over the next 4 years. That is equivalent to 96/week for the whole UK. Hungary were seeing 2000/3000 pass through their borders daily just a few weeks ago so we clearly are playing a very small Part. Given our role in destabilising the Middle East it could be argued we bear more responsibility than most European countries for the refugee crisis, but the UK Govt approach is paying money to support camps abroad so we don't have to have actual people coming to our country. I don't know whether you could call his conscience money but it sure does look like an excuse.\nUltimately I think the UK could be the losers here. The interviews with refugees showed people in crisis but also many resilient people who will make a success of their lives and bring real benefits to any community they become a part of. On that basis it looks like the new tranche of refugees could be Germany's gain and our loss. Of course people will raise the issue of population and the impact that this has on local services but if we duck our humanitarian responsibilities we abandon our humanity. Of course we have to work for a more just world and one free of conflict but if that can't be achieved then we have an obligation as fortunate people of the same species, on the same world, to help 'our own'.\nCouldn't agree more Andrew. We have numerous empty buildings in Kirklees AND by many accounts, Kirklees is willing to help. Its a travesty and completely undemocratic that central government is \"speaking and acting for us all\" on this. So many of us are ashamed of our country at the moment.\nReplyDelete",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2019/content_575.html": "|\n| Tough but still not enough! |\nWhat do we know? We know that the carbon savings agreed by governments from around the world will not meet the Paris Climate goals. They will in fact take us to a 3 degree world by 2050. A global temperature rise of 3 degrees across the world is a world where large regions of the world become uninhabitable, where the sea rises by a metre every 20 years, where coastal cities are either inundated or fortresses, with many millions of refugees, where agricultural production will crash. The Home Counties of England will be more like Marrakech. 500 Million tonnes of carbon will be released from melted permafrost locking in future temperature rises. People will die in their millions. So our current inadequate Nationally Determined Contributions to reduce carbon emissions are effectively a death sentence for countless people and will condemn many millions more into stifling, miserable and poor living conditions.\nSo what made Climate Change into a Climate Emergency? Last year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the United Nations sponsored body produced a special report on Climate Change stating that serious action to limit emissions was too slow and that if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change then action needs taking now. Currently it is estimated that the Earth's temperature rises by an average of 0.2 degrees every 10 years. So with global temperatures already estimated to be nearly 1 degree above post industrial levels we need to act very swiftly to have a chance of stabilising our Climate. Last years IPCC report said within 12 years it is now 11 years and the clock is still ticking downwards.\nSo what does this mean for us as local authorities?\nMany of us (over 100 now at the last count) have declared Climate Emergencies. The first was in Bristol City Council following a motion proposed by the Green Party Councillors there. Many Councils have now followed their lead including my own Kirklees Council.\nIn Parliament the Green Baroness Jenny Jones introduced a Climate Emergency debate to the House of Lords and Caroline Lucas MP raised it first in the Commons as an Early Day Motion and in May Labour tabled a motion which was agreed.\nLast week Leeds City Region announced that all the Councils within their boundaries will be net zero carbon by 2038. This target is undoubtedly tough but not enough. 2038 according to the science is 8 years too late, but it is a start and we should embrace it as an encouraging first step. Leeds City Region is a huge area consisting of the Councils of Leeds, Bradford, Wakefield, Kirklees, Calderdale, Harrogate, Craven, Barnsley, York and Selby so to get this degree of joint commitment is impressive.\nThe new Leeds City Region Climate Coalition needs a new committed partner and that has to be the UK Government. All the Council Leaders in the City Region need to send a letter to whoever the Prime Minister is next month and tell them \"Congratulations you are now a member of the Leeds City Region Climate Coalition!\". With membership comes responsibilities and we need their commitment to ensure we reach even the 2038 target and certainly the 2030 target that we really need to achieve.\nThe concern now is that feeling that the Councils that make up the Leeds City Region don't really appreciate what they have signed up to and consider it 'Business as Usual' but with a few green initiatives. What is needed now are robust action plans that demonstate what actions will be taken and by when and how much carbon emissions will be reduced by and how quickly.\nA demonstrable sense of urgency is essential in a climate emergency",

It is my first leaflet as a Green Party Candidate from 1989. A leaflet had been prepared and was ready to print the previous year as I was scheduled to be the Liberal Party Candidate for Paddock Ward in Kirklees but I had joined the Greens following the merger with the SDP so they had to bin that.\nIn 88 I'd gone back to North Staffs Poly to finish my degree and did my dissertation on the Political Strategy of the Liberal/SDP Alliance. I had worked for them for a couple of years as a Political Agent so I knew a bit about them. I went back a much better student. I was heading for a third before I broke my studies for a couple of years but a few years out, not drinking every night and spending more time in the Library meant I scraped a 2.1 . I also cut my teeth as a Green Party Candidate in the 1989 Staffordshire County Council Elections. There was a printers at the end of the road so I went down there with my artwork freshly letrasetted and pritt sticked and decided bright green on white paper might make a bit of an impression. I also persuaded my girlfriend Liz to stand in the elections as well. She had pointed out to me that she had been voting Green longer than I had anyway. So there we were, the only 2 Green Candidates in the whole of Staffordshire. We delivered a few thousand leaflets and plastered a mates car with the leaflets so people could read it on their way to the largest Polling Station. I got around 11% and Liz 9% in her ward.\nThe next time I persuaded Liz to stand for election again was in 2004 in the Kirklees Elections when we needed loads of candidates in the 'all out' elections following the boundary changes. The quality of the leaflets had improved somewhat by then. Somewhere I know I have a Nick Harvey Election leaflet from 1985 printed on a duplicator when recycled paper was little better than blotting paper.

One that benefits local authorities and the communities they serve. Happy to support that. This is developing technology and policy area that needs careful development and thought.

I asked about waste policy and pressed him on what he meant by 'ambitious' targets to reduce and recycle waste. The suspicion is that he is trying to actually dampen ambition and perhaps take more account of business interests than environmental ones. The other issue I raised with him was what action could be taken by the EU to tackle the UK and our abysmal record on renewable energy. Shamefully we look set to fail to achieve our diminished target. The EU average target is 20% of energy from renewable sources by 2020. The UK target is just 15% but even that is looking unattainable. They can slap a dirty great fine on the UK but the alternative in the mean time is to seek support from the EU under the 'infringements tool'.

The gig was a benefit in aid of the hard pressed families of firemen ( they were all men then ) who had been on strike for weeks. I'd love to be able to say I was there but the truth is that I would have been half a mile up the road in Edgerton at the family home at Imperial Road being 13 and all. What I do remember about punk was that it was a part of growing up for me and others around me a few years later. I was in a band called the Criminal Minds in 1981. There was a lot of gratuitous swearing involved and we did a few gigs, a barn in Sowood, the Venn Street Arts Centre and once at our school spring to mind. All good fun and I still have a cassette of our 'music'. Punk is anti establishment and our song 'F***the Government' was.definitely on message.\nThere was a good punk scene in Huddersfield which carried on a good few years after the Pistols departed. I always remember Punk as not just anti establishment but also pro people and anti fascist. (There were exceptions such as the Neo Nazi band Screwdriver' who were offensive but they were the exception not the rule). This pro people aspect came across listening to Johnny Rotten speaking about the Huddersfield gig and their motivations for doing it. It wasn't a big prestigious gig but doing it was right for the band that was finding it difficult to get gigs due to a hysterical media and for the striking firefighters who were going through hard times. It was authentic and demonstrated the humanity of the Pistols in choosing to do this benefit gig.\nSomething I take from the punk years is a healthy disrespect for authority and institutions and a dislike of deference to people, titles and positions. Is this contradictory as I've been elected to Kirklees Council five times now? Maybe a little, but I still feel slightly uncomfortable when people address me as 'Councillor' and recognise that power and authority is something that should be used carefully and sparingly.",

It says that it \"is a matter for local determination\" and \"it is right that these decisions are led by local clinicians, who best understand the healthcare needs of their local populations and in consultation with local people\".\nThe response fails to recognise that Government sets the rules and is the ultimate provider of NHS funding. Government makes the funding environment within which local decisions are made. Most people accept that the PFI deal, that was agreed years ago, was a bad one. This financial option is one that both Labour and Conservative Governments have promoted as a dubious, and often expensive, way of funding public sector projects. Successive Governments have set the rules and now this one wants to wash its hands of the issue and say it is a local decision. What I do find very strange is that Prime Minister David Cameron felt able to go to the Calderdale Royal Hospital in April last year, before the election and guarantee that A & E services would remain there. I am pleased that A&E will remain in Halifax but what makes that issue one that the Prime Minister felt he could comment on and yet the decison at Huddersfield A&E is a \"matter for local determination\"?\nThere has been plenty of legitimate talk about PFI in the context of the proposals for the future of Huddersfield Royal Infirmary but very little on the £30 Billion NHS funding gap that was such a feature of the General Election. There was no satisfactory answer to this gap by either potential Government Party, Labour or Tory. I wonder why local MPs are not referring to it now as an important element in this sorry saga.\nThe best possible tactic now (as well as putting pressure on local NHS decision makers) is for those of us who want to maintain Accident and Emergency and other Acute Service at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary to keep knocking at the Government door and to make them take responsibility. They are the majority Government after all, even if only 37% of Electors voted for them.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Something the Labour Party and the\nGreen Party have not committed to” -\nKirkburton Conservative Leaflet\nGreenbelt is the most protected land in law in any case, so\nthis ‘commitment’ in many ways is already there. In reality the real threat is\nto ‘Provisional Open Land - POL’ which many people assume is Greenbelt simply because\nit is usually green fields. There is lots of this land in the Kirkburton Ward. Both\nStrategic Planning Committee Conservative Councillors Bill Armer & Brice\nsupported a POL development at Brockholes on the basis that it was POL and they\nhad “no choice” (this was a recorded meeting). Because of the reasons that they\ngave, it is hard to see how they would not then support other POL applications\n– including developments in Flockton. - Green Party Response\n“I will not support\ntokenism like my Green Party opponent who prioritised funding for a study of\ninstalling renewable energy on Kirklees land over additional funding for the\nroads budget.” - Kirkburton Conservative Leaflet\nThe Green Party proposal was aimed at solar installations on\nlarge Kirklees buildings and on derelict land. The aim is to actually raise\nincome from the electricity generated which could support Kirklees services such as the roads budget. - Green Party Response\nConservatives say they\nwill “Reverse the cuts in front line services but forward by Labour and the\nGreen Party” - Kirkburton Conservative Leaflet\nThe GreenParty have put forward no cuts to frontline services. Labour have cut services but that is due to the £156 Million cuts to funding to Kirklees from Central Government. The reality is that if the Conservatives actually ran the Council they would have to make cuts. Any Party running the council would. - Green Party Response\nConservatives propose “Relocating\nHuddersfield Library saving £0.5million whilst saving local libraries.” - Kirkburton\nConservative Leaflet\nWhere will they relocate Huddersfield Central Library to? What will they do with the\nexisting Library building? If they propose selling it, who would buy it? This is\nnot a realistic proposal and they must know it. - Green Party Response\n“Green Party\nCouncillors only make the problem worse by voting along with their left wing\nallies (Labour)” - Kirkburton Conservative Leaflet\nGreen Councillors have worked with Conservative, Lib Dem and\nLabour administrations over the last 15 years, as Kirklees has had no Party with\nan overall majority over all that time.

Passivhaus homes have very low energy demand due to their high levels of insulation, airtightness and controlled ventilation. The average UK household fuel bill is £1236 per year. Passivhaus homes typically have energy bills much less than £100 per year. That is over a thousand pounds each year not going to energy companies and generally being spent in the local economy. For the Plane Street site, where 24 homes are indicated that would be over £30,000 every year with the value of that saving rising as energy prices rise, as they inevitably will. The Cabinet agreed subject to a report on the implications of this policy.\nWe are fortunate in Huddersfield to have local expertise and skills in passivhaus build and design. The Green Building Store have pioneered groundbreaking developments such as the Denby Dale Passivhaus and retrofit projects such as the CR8 Barn at Yorkshire Wildlife Trusts Stirley Farm in Newsome. I bumped into the owner of the Denby Dale Passivhaus on the train last week and when I asked him how much he was paying on his fuel bills he beamed and said 'I'm £20 up!' Very low energy demand plus his solar panels mean his home is a net contributor in energy terms. The Green Building Store are open with their expertise and have detailed case studies on their work.\nThe Passivhaus project at Plane Street would be a good thing to do in itself, but could become a blueprint for the specification Kirklees give for homes built on land it owns or as a condition for land it sells.

No longer will Zero Carbon Homes do 'what it says on the tin'. With this in mind it would be ironic indeed if Kirklees set higher environmental standards for building than the UK Government. My hope would be that our actions locally will have a national impact and make people ask why we can have better higher spec Passivhaus properties.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2013_12_eco-seeing-red-over-crap_html/content_705.html": "2010 - David Cameron announces the \"Greenest Government Ever\"\nIt's difficult to know where to begin with the complete shambles that is the Government's policy changes on domestic energy efficiency and the Energy Company Obligation in particular. Where I will start is on the subject of 'policy stability'. Last year I was part of Government delegation to Germany. The mission was to get German companies to invest in the UK energy efficiency and renewables sector. One of the messages that came back to us from German business was about the uncertain policy landscape in the UK for renewables and energy efficiency support generally and that this was seriously discouraging inward investment. It was a fair point and difficult to answer because it was true\nThe energy efficiency sector is a very changeable business to work in. The first stage of the £1.3 Billion/year Energy Company Obligation has barely begun. Companies delivering schemes are still ironing out issues with the rules and regulations which govern it and trying to develop, design and deliver workable projects which save carbon and energy for domestic householders. Some companies which were delivering energy efficiency schemes and measures have shut up shop unable to make a go of it, others have found ways to make ECO fly despite the bureaucratic nature of complying with its regulations. Now huge funding cuts to ECO have created another hurdle to overcome.\nThe large price rises from the utilities had very little to do with the Energy Company Obligation. Some estimates put only 1/6th of the increase as being attributable to green levies yet the energy companies, 'The Sun' and other right wing media were successful at getting the focus of debate on energy bills to be focussed on it. There was strong speculation that Ed Miliband's call for an 18 month energy price freeze might actually have sparked this round of big bill increases with utilities banking our money earlier for the 'rainy day' which might be the first year and a half of an incoming Labour Government. A Government at ease with its own policies would have recognised the misdirection and misinformation from the press and its own right wing for what it was and addressed it. The cut to funding itself was bad enough but the message it sent out to the energy efficiency industry on its lack of resolve was worse. Imagine you were a company that was considering investing significant sums of money in new plant and equipment to insulate homes. Within the space of a few weeks the whole policy landscape supporting your industry has changed. Companies don't invest, homes don't get insulated and it is the fuel poor who lose out.\nAs is common when introducing new policies particularly bad ones they are now badged as 'reforms', I guess this is 'reformed' as in \"I dropped a jelly on the floor and my 5 year old tried to 're-form' it\". It never turns out looking too good. One element of the reform is the new £500million financial incentive for new homeowners to insulate their homes. Several issues with this. People who are purchasing new homes are far less likely to be fuel poor as they have found enough money for a deposit and have means to pay a mortgage. So this is not a scheme targeted at the people who need it most. How long will it take to spend the £500million on energy efficiency measures in a housing market which is hardly very buoyant. You almost think that this is part of the plan. To give a headline big price tag on a measure which is going to take forever to spend and therefore not be that big a burden for the Treasury. All the illusion of action required for a goverment statement with none of the inconvenience and expense of actual activity.\nThe Energy Company Obligation changes are focused on the Carbon Emission Reduction Obligation (CERO) element of ECO. This was originally supposed to subsidise the Green Deal to make it work but seeing as the Green Deal is a bit of a flop there was a lot of brass sloshing round that needed using so Energy Companies could hit their targets. This funding went on a variety of different projects but as social housing was not eligible for the Fuel Poverty focussed part of ECO many social housing funded projects could well be funded through CERO. Now CERO is being cut as is the funding for solid wall insulation this is more likely to disproportionately impact on projects to improve the homes of social housing tenants on lower incomes.\nWhat is really frustrating about all this is that the Energy Company Obligation as it stood before the cuts was difficult enough and it lacked the ambition and vision we need for improving the energy performance of the nations housing stock. Ultimately saving households millions of pounds a year, avoiding unnecessary excess winter deaths and rapidly reducing our carbon emissions is not a priority for the 'greenest government ever'. Perhaps the clue to trying to make sense of all this is in the word 'obligation'. Obligations are things which people, and in this case energy companies, are morally or legally bound to do. Obligation does not require enthusiasm, belief or passion, that should be the role of government, but instead they have been obliged to set that nonsense aside in the name of expediency, bluster and populism.\nI agree with you, the government is not doing enough to support green energy or the people. Scientists are coming up with renewable energy ideas all the time but there are so many limitations in this country. They say it's too expensive to be green yet Ecotricity offer green power to the UK for the same prices as the big 6 before the price hikes. My husband and I want to build a passive house but can't afford the land or the mortgage and don't want one if we could as I have about as much trust for the banks as I do for our current government so that equates to 0. Green energy isn't expensive, yes there's outlay but there are people who post on youtube all the time and show how they create their own energy and conserve what they do have. I'm not surprised Germany wasn't interested, just look at German technology! It far surpasses the basic shacks we knock up on a regular basis with a pretty exterior and a price that far exceeds value. The houses built now are even worse than those built 200 years ago and it's supposed to be the other way around! Most of Europe is far superior to the UK in how they build, we aren't suited to either hot or cold and have to deal with both. It makes sense to be green, not just financially but for our futures and the future of this fragile planet we seem hell bent on destroying despite it being what keeps us alive.\nReplyDelete",

If your Local Government will not look to the Future go to a Church.<br /><br />The Island of Maui in the Pacific Ocean is truly a Tropical Paradise like many of the Hawaii Islands that has used Solar and wind Energy for many years. Its Seascapes are as Beautiful as its Landscapes. Many like Hana’s by Kipahulu in Maui were the coffee maker runs on the Sun Solar Power. Her freshly picked Tropical fruit smoothies are the greatest. You make the electrical power on a bicycle for the blender to run. Banana, Mango, Papaya, Guava and of course My favorite Coconut and Pineapple are just some of what you can make.<br /><br />Many of us that live and visit Maui already have Solar and Wind Energy. Very soon many more will and some day most all will be cutting the line to the Power Utilities Grid. Stopping them from putting their hands in our pocket book.<br /><br />Free Energy from the Sun. WHY pay for it, to some one else? Your Local Utility Provider is NOT A valuable resource in Your Time Of Financial Need. LOOK TO SOLAR AND WIND ENERGY on the internet it has been the learning platform for our Schools and Universities for Years. In this case look to the House of GOD.<br />It has always been the best place for the truth. The Church and the Bible.<br /><br />Many in the Island of Maui and other Islands have been off the Grid for years.<br /><br />There are many Reasons Home Owners Should Consider Going Solar there has to be at least 100 Good Reasons. Soon Hawaii will Lead with showcasing Solar Energy To the World.<br /><br /><br />GOD Bless for the good work all did to Help this Church<br />Light the Way.<br /><br /><br />Now if we can only get our World Leaders to Read the Bible More, and look to the real Paradise Heaven not Hell, and stay out of our Pocket books.<br /><br /><br />The Lord’s little Helper<br />Paul Felix SchottP.F.S.https://www.blogger.com/profile/09527885065760876564noreply@blogger.com",

People are paying the same\namount of council tax and getting less for it while government\nsubsidises multi billion pound projects like HS2 and the Trident missile\nprogramme.

There is an arrogance there which seems to stem from their confidence in their own positions. At cabinet on Tuesday Cllr Khan fooled around with the webcam while I was speaking, Cllr Molly Walton expressed her annoyance at having to listen to anyone from a 'minor party' and Cllr McBride was his on his usual form 'we're Old Labour and we know best'.\nValid criticisms I had for the lack of any mention of carbon emissions in the West Yorkshire Transport Proposals were not regarded seriously. I asked for a carbon impact to be taken of the plan which encourages the development of a link to Leeds/Bradford airport. Cllr Khan's response was that he'll back jobs and homes before a reduction in carbon emissions. It seems like they have made their plans and are going to work out the carbon emissions impacts afterwards. As I explained at Full Council it is a false conflict and a false choice to say you support jobs and homes over carbon emissions. You can promote jobs and homes without compromising our environment but you have to make the right choices and expanding Leeds/Bradford airport is clearly incompatible with any policy to address carbon emissions. If Labour are compromising on carbon emissions in this way they clearly do not believe or appreciate the size of the problem and are simply falling back into the unimaginative model of economic development based on growth at any price and any cost be it economic or environmental.\nSo here we are back with the old Labour attitudes I remember from the 1990s. Confidence in their position has lead to arrogance and a poor attitude to critics and criticism.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

We have 12 Greens out of 25 Parish Councillors which though not quite a majority due to the non attendance of Conservatives we do tend to hold sway. I first got elected to the Farnley and Thurstonland Ward of Kirkburton Parish in 2007 along with Robert Barraclough. It is a complete contrast to Kirklees Council. Kirklees has budgets running into the hundreds of millions with responsibility for social care, housing, environmental services, highways etc etc. Kirkburton Parish Council has a budget of just over £100k with ownership of a Village Hall, responsibility for allotments, a graveyard and a grant pot for numerous groups within the Parish. So does this mean that at a small scale politics doesn't feature? Well it didn't start out that way. There were certain individuals in the Tory group who went out of their way to give the Greens a hard time and were unnecessarily unpleasant and for at least the first year and it was hard going but we seemed to work our way through that particular pain barrier to get on with the job. To be fair some of the Conservatives were quite reasonable and eventually seemed to become sick of the antics of their colleagues and worked cooperatively with Councillors of all parties.\n|\n| Past Chairman Robert Barraclough and current Chairman John Hirst |\nSo what's been acheived? A Parish Walks project drawing in external funding, a training course giving teenagers a City and Guilds in Energy Advice, the repair of Kirkheaton Cemetery Wall (a long standing bugbear), solar panels on Burton Village Hall, winning the 2008 British Renewable Energy Awards with the judges comment, \"this small Parish Council appears to be doing more than our national government\". These are just some highlights there's plenty more but as with all things it comes down to a good team of people, Michelle Atkinson, Chairing the Environment Committee and introducing the popular Environment Fayre and Sunflower Competition, Geoff Hickey and Robert Barraclough ably chairing the Parish Council during some difficult times. The current Conservative Chairman elected with all Party support plays with a straight bat and across party divides. A special mention for Lin Holroyd, Independent who chaired the Parish in the 2007/8 year which was not an easy year at all which she handled with a determination to ensure no one got to far out of hand. I guess even myself on occasions!\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

So I drew the Kirklees Webcast to Brighton Green Party's attention and Councillor Jason Kicat had the following comment to make,\n\"Cllr Khan is speaking complete nonsense. We never pledged not to increase council tax and we have never pledged not to implement a legal budget. He should be asked to withdraw such rubbish.\nWe pledged to resist cuts to maximum extent legally possible. Furthermore the council has an ongoing value for money (efficiency) programme which actually over-delivered last year and is continuing this year.\"\nJason's blog provides more details of dubious Labour and Conservative attacks on the Green Party's position on Budget setting in Brighton.\nYou do wonder whether Cllr Khan's comments are part of a general fear about the Greens in the Labour Party. At their next Conference in Liverpool they even have a fringe meeting entitled \"Green to Red: How can Labour stop the Greens spreading?\"\nOf course Cllr Khan's 'wrath' is because we didn't join with the other parties in voting for extensive cuts to adult social care (which they have now been forced to backtrack on for legal reasons). He doesn't seem to recognise that for some of us voting for cuts to services for the most vulnerable when bankers get off scot free is a matter of principle and conscience. He may regard voting on the basis of your beliefs as a luxury or an indulgence. I believe by opposing the cuts we provided a greater service to politics as a whole by ensuring that people in the most difficult circumstances felt supported and that they had a voice.\nKhan Plots his revenge. \" He tasks me\"\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

It is encouraging to\nhave such a committed team from right across the Yorkshire and Humber region.\nWhat is particularly pleasing is that we have 3 men and 3 women represented on\nour list.\"\nIn the last European Elections the Green Party\nwere just 1.3% short of electing their first MEP losing out narrowly to he BNP\nwho took the 6th seat.\n\"A lot has changed since 2009 which should\nwork in the Green Party's favour\" said Councillor Cooper,\n\"the BNP as an electoral force has\ncollapsed and there is increasing cynicism about the 3 larger Westminster\nparties particularly the Liberal Democrats.

I am keen to use this\nposition to draw in more resources from the European Union to create worthwhile\nskilled jobs in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sector to give young\npeople in particular a career they can build a life upon. In this way we can\nimprove the insulation and heating standards of thousands of homes in our\nregion. This will not just save people money but give them more to spend in the\nlocal economy and less to BIG energy companies. Our region is home to many manufacturing and export jobs. We have the significant ports of Hull, Grimsby and Immingham which depend on European trade. Greens believe passionately in supporting sustainable local economies but some trade will always move internationally. It is scandalous that the UK Government has recently diverted\nfunding of over £200 Million of European funding away from the Yorkshire and\nHumber region to spend elsewhere.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_search_label_Streetlighting/content_105.html": "Finding ways of addressing the energy use of streetlighting has been an ongoing theme of the Kirklees Green Councillors over the last ten years. It is a huge issue and represents a significant proportion of the Councils carbon emissions. Early experiments were off grid solar streetlights on Malvern Rise, Primrose Hill. They worked, but they would never replace a standard streetlight in tems of illumination but ideal for places where an electrical connection is difficult. A hybrolight, combining wind and PV power for off grid locations is on a footpath between Close Hill Lane and Towngate is up and running and justified on the basis of the avoided costs of not connecting a long electrical connection. Our first grid connected solar streetlights were installed this year on Edale Avenue and they perform well and are comparable with a standard streetlight in terms of performance. There is an 'however' however and it is to question why have a streetlight connected to the grid which simply acts as a platform for a solar panel why not just stick a load of solar panels on top of a building instead of lots of little ones on top of individual streetlights. I guess the answer to this is to imagine them as part of a very intensively localised energy network utilising all available space to generate the maximum amount of electrical power. That is clearly not where we are at the moment but probably in my ideal scenario is where I would like us to be. Back to the 'here and now' we need to reduce the carbon emissions associated with streetlights quickly.\nThere is a whole agenda at the moment around dimming and turning off street lights in the early hours of the morning in isolated spots say between 2 and 6 in the morning. The other approach is to get streetlights which produce the same amount of light but use less power by utilising LED technology. We have trialled LED Streetlights with a Green Party initiative with 29 columns in the Highfields area of the ward and they are working fine (apart from the one pictured which was on during the day!).\nOur next, more low tech, solution is to put stickers on lighting columns telling people who to ring if the light is on during the day (dayburner) or isn't working at all. I have reported stacks of dayburners over the years to Kirklees Highways but the quicker they are noticed and reported the better and these stickers will help.\nOne last thought. Each year we go through a portion of space littered with dust particles sometimes resulting in spectacular meteor showers. Why not turn off streetlights for a few hours in the late evening/ early hours of the morning on that day, so we can have a free meteor show for the area without the distractions of light pollution.\nOne last thought.

The\nConservative Leader Cllr Light maintained that we had total flexibility to\ndetermine our own housing numbers and that there was no threat of government intervention\nto force us to have higher numbers in line with the now supposedly abolished\nRegional Spatial Strategy. On that basis he proposed a target even lower than\nthat proposed by the Labour administration which was itself way below that\nrequired under the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Spatial Strategy. The truth is\nthat the ‘abolished’ RSS is a Zombie policy – dead but somehow still alive with\nthe evidence base for the housing numbers in it somehow valid despite its\nabolition.\nSo now we have the Government’s\nbureaucrat from the Quango the Planning\nInspectorate in Bristol saying Kirklees have not fulfilled the ‘duty to\nco-operate’ with neighbouring Councils and therefore we are being ‘advised’ to\nwithdraw the Local Development Framework. When the LDF was being drawn up there were no\nguidelines on how to fulfil the duty to cooperate so how could the Council\ncomply. It would be like playing Monopoly for the first time without any rules and\nnot being told how many of those houses had to be put on the board.\nIn reality this has nothing at all\nto do with the duty to cooperate. Does anyone here really believe that if the\nhousing numbers were in line with the extortionately high figures in the RSS that we would be in this position now? Only apparently the Tories but this is a\ndeception just as the ‘duty to co-operate’ is a diversion.\nThe truth is that we are being\nasked today to withdraw this plan by the Governments Planning Inspectorate or\nthey will declare it invalid. It is like Kirklees is standing on the precipice\nof a cliff with the Planning Inspector with a gun to our head saying ‘jump’.\nWell I say ‘shoot’ do your worst. It will demonstrate to everyone that there is\nno true localism in the Planning process and that it is the Conservatives hand\nin glove with the developers that is the real threat to our countryside.\nSo what happens if the Government’s\nInspector does fulfil his threat to overturn the plan decided by this Council?\nIs that it? Is it Game Over? It doesn’t have to be because the Government in the\nform of Eric Pickles as Conservative Communities Minister can himself overturn\nthe Planning Inspectorate. Only last week he overturned the Planning\nInspectorate by opposing a solar farm in Sussex that had been approved by the Planning\nInspector. It is however possible for Eric Pickles to use his powers for good\nas well as evil.\nThe choice today is clear. To\nwithdraw the plan and have even more green space around Kirklees threatened\nwith development OR to hold our nerve with what is by no means a perfect plan\nbut has been decided in a democratic fashion. Our choice is between democracy\nor the diversion and deception we have seen here from the Conservatives today.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

The Green\nParty are opposed to the centralisation of power inherent in the Government’s\nMayoral proposals. Instead of a Mayor the Green Party would ideally prefer an\nelected Assembly for the whole of the Yorkshire and The Humber Region with the\nsame powers as the Scottish Government.\nGreens recognise that there\nis no actual increase in funds being offered to the Region by the UK\nGovernment, but instead the transfer of control from a remote Whitehall\nGovernment to remote Mayors. This is not true devolution of power that is on\noffer but the centralisation of power in the hands of one individual.\nThere are some attractions in\ntaking powers from Whitehall to the Yorkshire and The Humber Region. For\nexample, in 2013 the UK Government redirected £200million of European funding\nthat was destined for Yorkshire to Scotland, presumably with one eye on the\nIndependence referendum. If what is on offer could prevent that\nmisappropriation of funds by the UK Government then that would be a positive\nthing. It has to be pointed out that ‘Asks’ from Yorkshire Council Leaders have\nnot been voted on by the Councils in the Region so the negotiations themselves\nlack any democratic legitimacy.\nThe ‘Asks’ that Yorkshire\nCouncil Leaders have requested of Government in return for having Elected Mayors\nwill be meaningless if they are not accountable. The Combined Authorities in the\nRegion are not truly democratic or accountable bodies. Its members are there by\nvirtue of the fact that they are Leaders of Councils, along with a few Opposition\nleaders to nominally give political balance. They are effectively unelected\nappointees to a political body and have no mandate.\nGreen Party Councillors in the\nYorkshire Region believe there should be no Mayoral Deals without Elected\nAssemblies. The Assemblies, elected by proportional representation, should become\nthe Combined Authorities. They should have the same powers as the Greater\nLondon Assembly and be able to veto any Mayor’s proposed Budgets and Strategies\nwith a 2/3rds majority. What is good enough for London should be good enough\nfor Yorkshire.\nThe Green Party believes that\nany proposals for an Elected Mayor within the region should be subject to a\nReferendum to be held at the same time as the Police and Crime\nCommissioner/Local Elections in May 2016.

It seemed right that the companies that have made our communities less healthy due to emissions of NOX and other harmful particulates were made to pay for support for more sustainable forms of transport such as trams, cycle lanes and electric vehicle charging points. I had just come from Green Party Conference in Bournemouth and had heard the Greens Mayoral Candidate Sian Berry propose just such an approach.\nAs the Political Coordinator of the European Alliance Group on ENVE in the CoR I liaised with the other Political Groups Coordinators to see if we could agree a statement.

Poor air quality will have a\ndisproportionately severe impact on the health of people with respiratory\nconditions, the very young and elderly people.\nUndoubtedly\nthere will be fines that will be levied on VW and possibly other vehicle\nmanufacturers. Those fines should be dedicated to repairing the damage that has\nbeen caused. They need to be reinvested back in projects that improve air\nquality. They need to pay for alternatives to polluting combustion engines such\nas public transport, light rail, trams, infrastructure for electric vehicles,\ncycle ways and support for pedestrian routes.\nThis\napproach is in line with the Committee of the Regions opinion on the Clean Air Policy Package for Europe where it states hat we need to establish,\n\"Clean\nup programmes comprising measures aiming to meet the air quality standards\"\nWho\nbetter to pay for these clean up programmes than the manufacturers who bear a\nheavy responsibility for the quality of air in our towns and cities.\nThIs\nscandal also shows clearly that we need strict and transparent emissions and\nconsumption test cycles at the EU level which realistically reflect everyday\ndriving conditions. Such tests, which need to be checked by independent\nexperts, are essential to allow consumers to make informed choices and\nstimulate innovation towards more sustainable transport an lower emissions.\nWe\npropose that the Committee of the Regions write to the Commission calling\non them to support the passport of funds from any compensation claims to municipalities\nenabling them to establish clean up programmes.\nA helpful amendment was received from the PES Group (Socialists) on emissions testing which I was happy to accept. A short meeting of the 5 Political Coordinators and the Chair went over the text and agreed it. All seemed to be going well and we seemed on schedule to adopt it. As I took my place in the chamber for the afternoon session of the meeting I got approached by another member of the CoR ENVE Committee who I had not previously spoken with called Cor Lamers. He identified himself as the Rapporteur responsible for the Clean Air Policy Package opinion from 2014 that I referred to in the statement. He clearly wasn't happy with the proposed statement and said it was not the intention of the opinion he lead on to be used in this way. I did try to get to the bottom of what his real objections were but that didn't become clear to me through our, admittedly short, conversation.\nLater I read out the revised statement to the 40 or so members present so the translators could ensure all could understand its contents. No objections were received (Cor Lamers was no longer in the meeting). It was passed but with a proviso from the Chair that it be passed Mr Lamers as the Rapporteur on the Clean Air Policy Package for Europe Opinion to which the statement referred. The following day one of the right of centre groups, the European Peoples Party (EPP) withdrew its support for the statement. This meant it could not go out as a view of the ENVE Commission. I'm sure it's no coincidence that Cor Lamers is also a member of the EPP. Later the European Conservatives and Reformers (ECR) Group also belatedly withdrew their support. It was bizarre indeed that a statement that was agreed by all Political Coordinators in the ENVE Commission and then agreed by the meeting itself with no contrary voices should find itself effectively vetoed after the event.\nI am still mystified as to the reasons why. Why would politicians block a proposal to help improve the air quality in our towns and cities. I'm not a big fan of conspiracy theories but this makes no sense at all. We had an opportunity to produce a clear view from the CoR ENVE Commission that could influence the powerful European Commission but we were blocked. A disappointing and perplexing series of events.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Suma's values make it a strong force for good business practice not just in environmental terms but in treatment of its employees. I've worked in the public sector, the rapacious cut throat private sector and even an employee owned company so it was refreshing to see a successful workers cooperative of many years standing doing so well. It is not the sort of company you would join if you were looking to buy a luxury yacht or a holiday cottage in the Cotswolds. What it does offer, it seems, is job satisfaction and relative job security in an increasingly insecure world. I got a buzz and feel for the place over the couple of hours I ŵas there and you definitely got the impression that it was a happy workforce as well as an obviously successful one. For me it showed that it is completely possible for a company to have strong ethical values, a democratic structure and 'cut the mustard' in the business world (wholegrain organic mustard of course!",

It is a great place to walk, collect your thoughts, to appreciate nature and maybe gather a bit of wild garlic. There's lots of exploring to do along the woodland trails and part of it arches round Longley Park golf course. I first became aware of the woods about 20 years ago through the work of Stephen Preest, who is sadly no longer with us. He was one of the founders of the Friends of Longley Woods that represented the community interest in the woods and acts as its eyes and ears coordinating volunteer activity there. Stephen is sadly no longer with us but in recent years Louise Galvin and now Julia Clark have taken up his mantle as the community custodian of the woods, providing the focus for the Friends group and coordinating clean ups. Each of them showed/show a real passion for this area and care what happens there.\nIn recent years the main issues have been noisy trail bikes illegally using the woods, heavy littering especially on the boundaries and just a general impression that the woods has no institution that cared what happened there. Many would have no way of knowing that Kirklees Council actually owns it. So using our small ward budgets Newsome Councillors have been doing what we can to invest in the woods. Councillor Karen Allison has lead on a project to make it as awkward as possible for trail bikes to access the woods with new stiles and fencing placed strategically atpossible access points. This has enabled me to write such great headlines as 'Karen causes a fence' on our newsletters. I lead on a project to put new signage at the access points telling people what the expectations are for people using the woods. Karen, Sue Lee-Richards and I have all helped out with community clean ups which is an ongoing task unfortunately but it makes a real difference when it's done.\nFor the future I'd like to see more activity in the woods helping the community to appreciate this natural beauty and learn more about the ecology of our local area. As Green Councillors showing we and the wider community care for this valued woodland is the best way to secure its long term future.",

As we have a ‘hung Council’ and the greatest finanacila crisis Kirklees has ever faced we all need to work together. Sitting in comfortable opposition when Councillors were elected to take responsibility should not be an option. You could argue that voting for Councillors who then shy away from the opportunity of taking power on the Council is simply a wasted vote. That is why I have outlined some of the key priorities our group would pursue in an All Party Shared Administration. If other parties lay out their priorities then we have the basis for dialogue”\nGreen Party and Valley Independent Group Priorities for a Shared All Party Administration of Kirklees Council\n- Prioritising support to the most vulnerable. Adults and childrens services is the greatest part of the budget and where we need to focus effort not just to ensure funding but to demonstrate effective budget management.\n- Ensuring local control over a proportion of limited resources. We know that there are going to be less resources available so ensuring that these are allocated according to local priorities will be key. Politicians demonstrably working with representative community organisations is key. We need to argue strongly to government that we need a fair settlement for Councils like Kirklees not one that just favours the leafier Councils in the Home Counties.\n- Protect local green space from development but where development does occur encourage the highest construction standards and prioritise developments to new householders particularly those on limited incomes\n- Establishing effective partnerships with the private sector as appropriate to help the council realise income from its property portfolio\n- Use our links with community and voluntary sector organisations to draw in funds and resources that the Council cannot access to help protect local services. Kirklees needs to establish strong and real partnerships with Community Organisations. This will needa reprioritisation of limited budgets and dedicated staff to ensure real change happens.\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Unfortunately as it is an unadopted road, serving just a few houses, Kirklees has had no responsibility to repair the road and with funding being constrained anyway it was unlikely that it would be improved in the near future.\nKirkburton Green Councillors Derek Hardcastle and Robert Barraclough secured a supply of road planings from the Council which they could use to put a new surface on the road but were told that due to funding constraints it would be down to local people to lay the road.\nCouncillor Derek Hardcastle said, “The planings tipped in a large pile, needed spreading over the whole road surface. We realise that residents have work commitments and could be phased by taking on a new task like putting down a road surface and wouldn’t know where to start with hiring appropriate equipment so we thought we’d have a go ourselves. We were also fortunate to be helped by two of the residents”\nCouncillor Robert Barraclough said “As I’ve worked in farming for over 40 years I’m used to using machinery such as mini diggers and it is a fairly straightforward job. It is not the same as an adoptable road but it will be a much better road surface than these householders have had for quite some time”\nWe are happy to say, thanks to all this help, the resurfacing was completed in a single day.\nWell done Guys........Did Bill help you? he does say he helps the village more than any other member?\nReplyDeleteWell there's talking the talk and there's ..... you know the rest!\nReplyDelete",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2015_08/content_195.html": "|\n| A Mayor |\nKirklees had a referendum in 2001, asking the question whether we wanted an Elected Mayor or not. The result was 27977 (73%) against and 10169 (27%) for. That's a far bigger margin that the Scottish Independence Referendum and the Scots were told that this should settle that matter for a generation!There's been no clamour for an elected Mayor since then. All the other Local Authorities in West Yorkshire have had referenda on the Elected Mayor question (most much more recently than us) and they have all come back with similar results.\nThe principal argument against Elected Mayors is that it puts too much power in the hands of one person and that they will inevitably become remote and unaccountable. Rather than just accepting this, the Conservative Government are now pursuing the idea of an Elected Mayor with power across, not just one Council area but across a number of Councils. This would be on a similar basis to the deal that they have made recntly with Greater Manchester. The sweetner/bribe is that the regions will have greater access/control over money, currently controlled by the Government, that is spent in their regions. So we are not necessarily talking new money but perhaps a greater say over how funds are spent that were destined for the region anyway. In some ways this would be a good thing. It would stop Government misappropriating funds like they did in 2013,\nwhen nearly £200million of EU funding, allocated to Yorkshire, was sent to Scotland instead. I guess this was part of the strategy to keep Scotland as part of the United Kingdom. The problem is that instead of an illegitimate Government elected by 37% of the electorate deciding the fate of that money there will be a single person, a Mayor, somehow representing millions of people, deciding how it is spent. We have not necessarily made any progress here!\nIn West Yorkshire and the wider Leeds City Region there seems to be an almost resigned air amongst the Council Leaderships and a feeling that we must bow to the inevitable. So the West Yorkshire Combined Authority has produced a number of 'Asks' to central Government including\nthe ability raise funding through a 10 year infrastructire precept to improve public transport\npower to levy and retain business rates,\ndevolved budgets and responsibility for major roads including motorways\nControl of a new £500 million Housing and Regeneration Investment Fund\nPowers to incentivise developers to bring forward strategic sites and prevent land banking; and to bring empty listed building back into use\nResponsibility for local energy generation and efficiency\nResponsibility for managing European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) in the same way as London.\nThese are just some examples of the 'asks' and they are generally positive ones. The problem is that having responsibility for these new budgets will also mean having responsibility for any cuts handed down by central government. It also requires a degree of trust and a belief that Government won't disproportionately cut devolved budgets particularly in areas where the Conservatives have little electoral support.\nWhat has been dismally lacking from the 'asks' from the West Yorkshire Combined Authority is anything about improving governance and accountability for the Elected Mayor, that Government want to foist on us. In London the Mayor is accountable to the Greater London Assembly which has a role in scrutinising the Mayor's decisions. With a 2/3rds majority the Assembly can amend the Mayors strategies and budgets. The Assembly is elected by the Additional Member System so the number of seats are roughly proportional to the votes cast. If we are being pushed into a less democratic Mayoral model then we need to ensure that we have a new representative body to make sure the Mayor is more accountable. It should also be elected by a system of proportional representation. If West Yorkshire Leaders are opposed to creating a new West Yorkshire Assembly or Leeds City Region Assembly then, at the very least, we need to ensure our own local Councils have an effective scrutinising and vetoing role over any Elected Mayor's budgets or plans. This should not be the preserve of Council Leaders alone or a small group of 'the great and the good'. All elected Councillors should have a role in debating and amending any potential Mayor's plans. Preferably at the same time and in the same place each year.\nReviewing our own Councils electoral arrangements is long overdue, and this should be considered at the same time that we look at establishing any new potential Mayoral arrangements. With West Yorkshire Councils having elections 3 years out of every 4, we are in a state of almost constant electoral warfare. This is not good for governance and detracts from time Councillors can give to Council work and community focussed activity. Like York, London Boroughs and many other Councils we should have 'all out' elections in West Yorkshire on a 4 year cycle and ensure that these elections do not clash with General Elections. This will help ensure that we retain a focus on local issues and concerns. In May, when we had General, Local and Parish Elections all on the same day the General Election naturally dominated political discourse. We also have the opportunity to elect Local Councillors through a system of proportional representation. If it is good enough for Scottish Councils then why not English ones as well?\nAs with all negotiations you have to be prepared to walk away and to recognise when what is on offer from the Government is simply not worth it. We do have to overcome the Conservatives desire to centralise power with a Mayoral model but we also have to democratise our own local electoral arrangements and drag them into the 21st Century.",

Out of the stream of illogical drivel he came out with one statement he made stood out. It was the claim that renewable energy technologies \"don't work\". It was a bizarre claim that could only be based on ignorance or prejudice but most likely both. If he was right and renewables didn't work then they wouldn't just not work in the UK they wouldn't work anywhere. Of course climate, topography and latitude will all play a part so the UKs wind, tidal, solar and hydro resource give us a huge advantage over many other EU countries. We are however doing very poorly compared with our European neighbours. The EU overall target for 2020 is to have 20% of total energy produced from renewable sources. The UK was given a lower target of 15% to recognise our poor starting point. To date with around 5 years to go we are hovering around the 5% mark. So we're going to fail and fail spectacularly. It is not our climate or latitude or topography that are the principal reasons for this failure it is politics. The faith in market approaches to deliver has simply not worked. A lack of investment in energy conservation and constantly changing policy on renewables coupled with outright hostility from Tory Ministers supported by compliant Lib Dems has meant the 'Greenest Government Ever' has turned out to be even worse than the previous ineffective Labour Government. So using the medium of Twitter I asked if the laws of physics were somehow different in other countries that meant their renewables worked and ours didn't. It struck a chord with some folk and managed 706+ retweets which is a record for your truly.\nThe big unanswered question for me is why did the 'hug a husky' Prime Minister Cameron make this idiot a Cabinet Minister for anything and for the Environment in particular. While at DECC he refused to meet with David Mackay the principal government advisor on energy matters. Paterson is clearly a man who wasn't interested in facts that conflicted with his own beliefs. He seems to have been introduced to appease the Tory right and George Osbourne who for all their hostility and inaction either are, or may as well be, climate change deniers.\nPaterson now is marketing himself as a posterboy for climate change denial by speaking at events run by Nigel Lawson's discredited Global Warming Policy Foundation and venting his disdain for green lobby groups by referring to them/us as Green Blobs. His status as an ex minister will mean the fruitcake will still get media coverage but it is a shame that he probably won't get very challenging questions and his views will be given undue credence.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2017_08_no-fracking-way-physical-limitations_html/content_1089.html": "When people asked about what physical preparation I made so I was able to walk the No Fracking Way I generally replied that I received some good advice, \" 120 miles in 5 days? Don't do it!\".\n|\n| compeed |\nAs a guy who could do with losing a pound two or more realistically a stone or three, I approached the task with a certain amount of trepidation. Having come up with the whole idea and fronting it up, the prospect of making a complete 'balls up' of it and having to drop out after a day or two would not go unnoticed and be quite embarassing. Some degree of preparation would have to be done. The walk between our house in Brockholes and Civic Centre 3 in Huddersfield Town Centre was exactly five miles. I tried to get as many of these walks there (and occasionally back) as possible just to build a bit of stamina and confidence. I could bomb along quite happily. It was just like leafleting without having to walk up the driveways and I could do that for hours. On average it took me about an hour and ten minutes. So given the fact that our longest walk was supposed to be 30 miles all I had to do was times my morning walk to work by 6 and it would all be done in 7 hours. This of course assumed no breaks for lunch, no stopping for 'natural breaks', no late starts and no days when we didn't quite make where we were scheduled to be at the end of each day. All of these things happened to some extent or another so we ended up walking from 7.00 or 7.30am most mornings till the sun started going down at dusk at around 6.00pm. So pretty much 11 hour days with occasional breaks.\nI and my fellow walkers were in pain to a certian extent a lot of the time so a couple of paracetemol with breakfast helped. No drug testing on the No Fracking Way fortunately.\n|\n| Compression tights |\nI did get some good advice besides 'don't do it'. The best advice I had was from my old friend Robin was to wear compression tights to sleep in. Normally if I do a long stint of walking for several hours after a long leaflet drop I'll wake up in the morning with stiff legs and walk like your average 90 year old for a couple of hours. After the first night I woke up in York took off the tights and I was amazed it actually worked and the legs were fine. Feet on the other hand were a different matter. I got some good advice on footwear from the Manager at Outdoor World on the Piazza in Huddersfield, which seems to be having a permanent closing down sale. He was really knowledgeable and got me lined up with a good pair of Merrell walking shoes with plenty of cushioning and '1000 mile' walking socks. All good but 10 hours + pounding on tarmac a day takes its toll. I got off relatively lightly on blisters but all of us in the Core Group of walkers got blisters to some extent or another. We discovered the joys of Compeed. Huddersfield Green Party Chair Simon Duffy had told me about Compeed, the plaster that you put over the blisters which then acts like a second skin. We were all using this wonder material that enabled us to carry on walking and according to its website it also helped women in poorly fitting high heels dance all night as well. Though blisters weren't that much of a problem for me the tiring effect on your feet of walking on tarmac meant that every time there was a nice level grassy verge I'd end up walking on it for a bit of relief. Having a camelback in my day sack filled with water and electrolyte to stop me getting cramps was more good advice. It also meant I could drink easily out of a tube without having to go in and out of my bag. Other physical effects of the walk were a certain amount of chafing here and there and the application of soothing creams to tender areas was essential. No more detail on this will be provided you will be relieved to know! Except I'm told it is the area \"between the Funfair and the toilets\". Don't ask!\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Looking back it was produced in a different age. We were in the times of relative plenty before the public purse would have to pay for the private banking sectors excesses. We were quite chuffed about it at the time, having our own local election 'broadcast' and we promoted it on our literature. It took a couple of days to put together with an all 'star' cast including me, Councillors Graham Simpson, Julie Stewart-Turner, Derek Hardastle and Kirkburton Parish Councillor Michelle Atkinson.\nIt's interesting to look back on it to see just how much has changed (or not) over the last couple of years. The free insulation offer in Kirklees Warm Zone had just got into its stride having been kicked off just over a year previously and was a runaway success. Our allotment initiave hadn't started but we had been successful in obtaining the funding to get sites restored and improved so, at the time, we had no idea how popular it would become and how it would give a timely boost to the local food movement. The RE-Charge scheme which helped people get solar panels and other renewable technologies installed with no upfront costs was just an idea when the video was produced and now its has won the 2009 British Renewable Energy Awards as Best Advocate for the renewables sector and hundreds of homes have benefited. What doesn't seem to be coming off though is the recycling of the funding I mentioned. The Feed In Tarrif has changed the economics of solar panels reducing the need for second charge type arrangements. Pool cars have become a reality in Kirklees Council linked to changes to terms and conditions of service. We also now have City Car Club which now has 7 vehicles being used by Council staff and other local businesses and individuals.\nOther things in the video have come to pass such as the end of Christmas Parties for Party Groups paid for by Council Tax payers see previous posts on how this came to pass and\nIt hasn't all come true though. The can crushers initiative never actually happened or the free reusable nappies for new parents. These would have been great initiatives but seemed to end up as too difficult to acheive. One we'll have to look at again in less financially constrained times. If we were to do another one of these what policies would we promote in these days where recession seems to be government policy. If anything the policies we were advocating 2 years ago are even more relevant on the national scale today when we need to generate new jobs and industries to tackle fuel poverty and climate change. Lets see what happens and be hopeful.\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Election expenses are different, they are about how much political parties are legally allowed to spend on local elections. The legal spending limit is based on a base amount and an amount per elector. In Newsome this equated to a spend limit of around £1300. The idea is that a political party can't effectively 'buy an election' by outclassing their opponent with flashy literature and paid support. During the election campaign in Newsome we became increasingly aware of the amount of colour literature being produced by Labour. We had a full colour A2 leaflet, An A4 full colour leaflet, a colour prepoll leaflet, a colour polling day card, student letters, postal voter letters, letters to asian householders (full of misinformation), a colour leaflet for Council tenants, posters. I strongly suspect the people putting posterboards up were paid, at least they said they were when I asked them!\nSo I went to the Elections Office last week to get a copy of the election expense return for the Newsome Labour Candidate intrigued to know what they had put down as their expenses because we were absolutely sure they must have completely blown their legal limit. What was interesting in the document was the total lack of detail. Their (friendly?) printer was Sheaf Graphics of Sheffield (the Labour Party's usual printer and provider of receipts). Leaflets on the form said a straight £1095 which was supposed to cover all their printing supplied. On the breakdown of all their printing it states:\n- Election addresses (2 sorts) - £740\n- Pre-poll cards - £140\n- Letters - £120\n- Posters - £95\nThere was no specified number of leaflets that were produced but it is clear that the number of different items Labour distributed was not reflected in the information provided on the election expenses submission and their leaflets are extremely cheap according to their receipt.\nThe official election agent for the Labour campaign was Sheikh Noor Ullah but it is well known that the real manager of their campaign was one Mehboob Khan, Leader of Kirklees Council.\nSounds sadly familiar - we know that Labour were paying people to canvass and knock up, and we suspect that some leafleters were being paid as well. This meant that they could give the impression that candidates were active all year when in some cases they had only been announced a few weeks before close of nominations.\nReplyDeleteOf course a lot of this 'buying' of elections wouldn't have happened if Labour hadn't been given stacks of regional trade union money to win seats. I wonder how many regional trade union members would be happy to know that they're funding a party that in my area put senior management (including Chief Exec) pay up by 23% two years ago at the same time as pay freezes and job losses for other Council staff.......\nThanks Elise. Just for those reading comments. Elise's relate to Oxford City Council not Kirklees.\nReplyDeleteSo zero facts, just spurious allegations?\nReplyDeleteNot at all 'Anonymous'. The election material distributed by the Labour Party in the 2012 Newsome election campaign does not tally with that declared on their election expenses return - FACT!\nReplyDeleteThis is very worrying. You should call the police.\nReplyDeleteThat is exactly what I will do if there is any repetition of this abuse of the electoral process by the Labour Party.\nReplyDeleteWhat a load of complete bollocks - just slurs and envy, typical of the greens\nReplyDeleteWhat here is 'bollocks' Anonymous. I've been pretty specific in what I've accused them of. What have I got wrong?\nReplyDelete",

The headline figures to date are Loft insulation – 41387 homes and Cavity wall insulation 20357 homes. It has been the largest insulation scheme of it's kind ever in the UK. This will rise by a few hundred but we're pretty much at the end of it. We have acheived the previous Labour Government's target of insulating every avalable loft and cavity by 2015 a whole five years early! (Incidentally no plan was ever produced by the last government to acheive this national target)\nOne particularly gratifying things is to see the parliamentary debate on energy efficiency today to see the Kirklees scheme feature strongly with references to the strong community links by Energy and Climate Change Minister Greg Barker and our own Caroline Lucas MP. The new focus under the Carbon Emissions Reduction Targets legislation is to have a greater a focus on insulation measures what is key is whether the insulation can be installed for free or at the very least with no upfront costs. We have shown in Kirklees that you get 3 times more installations with a free area based insulation scheme than you get with able to pay offers. If you are going to the trouble of knocking on every door in your council areas, as we did with Kirklees Warm Zone, then you want as much take up as possible therefore a free scheme makes perfect sense. Officers have calculated for every £1 that the Council has spent on the scheme a further £4 has been generated in the local economy. An anti-recessionary policy? You bet it is!\nIt's not quite the end. The Warm Zone may end but the offer of free insulation to Kirklees households continues so those who have somehow been missed will still be able to get their homes insulated. We now have to move onward and carry on driving down carbon emissions with other schemes\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2011_11_solar-sundown_html/content_931.html": "| Many council and free solar schemes have checked into the Sundown Motel |\nA few weeks ago, and somewhat inexplicably,Winchester City Council in Hampshire cancelled its plans to install solar panels on their municipal buildings as they said that they did not stack up financially and that the prices they got back from their tender were not what they were expecting. To any informed outside observer this must have been nonsense. Up and down the country Councils had been pursuing schemes to install panels on their own buildings and council houses having done the maths and concluded their proposals were self financing. Possibly Winchester knew something the rest of us didn’t about the FIT cuts that were coming over the horizon.\nThe implications of the Governments rushed review of the Feed In Tariff rates for solar photovoltaics are significant and in many ways tragic. In Leeds the City Council had innovative plans to use the Feed In Tariff incomes from installations on Council houses to help finance free insulation for private homes. That great idea would now appear to be a total dead duck. In Kirklees we have/had a thousand house solar PV programme some of which are in the Newsome Ward. I’ve asked the Council’s Leader Councillor Khan and the Chief Executive to see what can be done to accelerate installations ahead of the cut. It’s going to be difficult and I anticipate a lot of weekend working to get PV systems commissioned and working ahead of the deadline.\nSo why are government making this cut? Well the first thing to say is that this is not public money we are talking about so this is not saving you and me tax. We do however all pay for the feed in tariff through a levy on our fuel bills along with a number of charges which subsidise nuclear and renewable programmes. The FIT element of this is reckoned to cost the average household around 30 pence per year or less than 1 penny/week. As the FIT is the result of public policy however it is counted in the governments Public Sector Borrowing Requirement and so Treasury has put a cap on it OR as Climate Change Minister Greg Barker refers to it ‘a budget’. Given the very low cost of the tariff the cap is obviously set very low demonstrating a very limited ambition by government for the solar sector. Government’s argument is that the capital costs for installing PV have dropped dramatically and therefore the FIT should drop. While this is true it is only half the story. Government are ignoring the fact that demand for PV has been generated by the level of FIT that has in turn helped generate the economies of scale that have enabled prices to come down. So if you reduce the FIT rate then capital costs are likely to start rising significantly. There is probably a reasoned argument for a limited FIT reduction but not one of over 50% that will put companies out of business and make thousands unemployed.\nThe cuts to the FIT rates take effect on the 12th of December yet the consultation on the review of feed in tariffs is due to close on the 23rd of December. So Merry Christmas everybody! This is just one of the reasons that solar companies are pursuing legal routes to challenge government over this abomination of a consultation. The other reason is that right now there will be many millions of pounds worth of solar panels and inverters on the high seas already bought and paid for by British companies on the understanding of a return based on current FIT rates. Some of these solar panels will have been destined for Council projects such as those planned for Kirklees, Leeds and York but NOT Hampshire.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Simply having one person in the Council with the ability to give a draft copy the 'once over' would have been sufficient. Clearly that did not happen and clearly no one at the regional level thought it would matter too much if Kirklees had very little mention and no visibility in the document.

Ive always been amazed at the loophole that has traditional, dIrty, coal on sale everywhere across the Clean air zone of Bristol, when it can't be legally burned.<br />And as you say we need better promotion of how essential it is to use DEFRA approved stoves for wood burning and a supply of clean, dry, wood fuel. People are already using the particulate pollution of wood stoves as a distraction to say the illegal and lethal pollution from cars should not be curbed.

It is an artificial construct cobbled together after Local Government reorganisation in 1974 and named after a place in neighbouring Calderdale rather than anywhere in the actual district. As such the name pleased no one rather than alienating any particular town by naming it after another. There are regular calls to split the Council by the Public and politicians seeking to garner a few populist votes but both Labour and Tory Governments have dodged this over the years.\nA lot of time and effort has gone into preparing and running Commission events and sourcing witnesses by Kirklees officers. My own view is that we have the opportunity to come up with some radical and far reaching proposals for the Council to implement and where necessary to seek Government approval. we cannot go through this whole exercise and only propose piecemeal changes. We also need to regard what we are doing as a possible template for other cOuncils We need to be bold, forward thinking and consider doing things that have never been tried before.

Lockwood is one of those areas.\nCouncillor Cooper, who is a member of the West Yorkshire Combined Authority Climate Change, Energy and Environment Committee, that approved the scheme said,\n“Back in February 2022 a number of businesses down Albert Street and Queens Mill Road were flooded. I remember it well as I was on the scene at the time redirecting traffic away from flooded roads. Several businesses in the area were badly affected and some businesses were out of action for several months\nThe half million pound scheme funded by West Yorkshire Combined Authority will install 2 pipes to redirect flood water back into the River Holme further downstream and reduce the risk of flooding for 28 businesses.\nHeavy rainfall events are becoming more frequent due to the impacts of climate change. So we need to invest in schemes which make homes and businesses more resilient to climate change.\nReferences\nSee Page 64",

Without cooperation from other opposition groups we cannot do more.\nAt no point during the whole budget process did I get a\nsingle approach from the Conservatives about how we may tackle the budget\nchallenges. I have tried in the past with the Conservatives but they made\nthemselves unavailable as they had already made a 2 year deal to allow Mehboob\nKhan to become Leader of the Council in return for additional Committee Chairs\nand the allowances which go with them. I\ndid get a late eleventh hour phone call from Kath Pinnock from the Lib Dems\nwhich appeared to be more a fishing expedition for information rather than any plan\nfor an alternative approach to the budget.\nThe Conservative and Lib Dem Groups need to accept\nresponsibility for the position the Council is in. After all it is your government\nthat is stripping £129million out of local budgets. You make matters worse by putting amendments in\nwhich make it harder to balance the Councils budget. Putting an additional\n£1m to £2million onto the revenue budget might enable you to make meaningless promises in a\nleaflet to fool somebody into voting for you but you are not being straight\nwith people or telling them the whole story.\nWhat we are pleased about is the commitment to use Housing\nRevenue Account reserves to install solar panels into the homes of up to 2000\ncouncil homes. This will come at no cost to the Council Tax Payer. It will\nhowever save the average householder money off their electricity\nbill and this money will put up to £400’000 back into the local economy and not\ninto the profits of the Big Six Energy companies.\nWhat comes next is the real challenge. Who would really want\nthe responsibility of running Kirklees knowing what is to come? The reduction\nin services for local people still paying the same amount of Council Tax and\nthe hundreds of staff redundancies that are to come with the impact on their\nfamilies.\nOur Group is keen to find ways to save local facilities such\nas Libraries, to have more devolved decision making over what remaining funding\nis available locally and to engage WITH communities and NOT retreat from them.\nWe do not want to take the cynical easy path of politicians who are willing to\ncomment but unwilling to help, willing to posture but unwilling to participate.\nWe urgently need more goodwill and more communication on the\nCouncil between the political groups recognising that the financial cliff edge\nthat is coming. If we do not, we let\ndown the people who elected us, the people Kirklees employees and the communities that we represent.\nTuesday, 4 February 2014\nLetter sent to all Yorkshire and Humber MEPs on Fracking\nDear Yorkshire and Humber MEP,\nAmendment 27 on 2030 Framework for climate and energy targets\nOn the debate regarding the 2030 framework for climate and energy\ntargets please could you support (Amendment n°27) directly related to shale gas\nwhich states\n“On the basis of the precautionary principle and taking into account the risks and the negative climate, environmental and health impacts involved in unconventional hydrocarbon exploration and extraction (e.g. of shale gas), and the gaps identified in the EU regulatory regime for such activities which the Commission has yielded to pressure not to regulate on, urges local and regional authorities not to authorise any unconventional hydrocarbon exploration or extraction operations in the EU, and urges Member States to refrain from preventing such decisions”\n“On the basis of the precautionary principle and taking into account the risks and the negative climate, environmental and health impacts involved in unconventional hydrocarbon exploration and extraction (e.g. of shale gas), and the gaps identified in the EU regulatory regime for such activities which the Commission has yielded to pressure not to regulate on, urges local and regional authorities not to authorise any unconventional hydrocarbon exploration or extraction operations in the EU, and urges Member States to refrain from preventing such decisions”\nThis is consistent with the motion approved at Kirklees Council in\nJanuary which stated:-\n|\n|||\nTo consider the following Motion in the names of\nCouncillors Cooper and Stewart-Turner.\n'That this Council: (a) Notes the enthusiasm of the Coalition Government for developing hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in the UK; (b) Notes the recent mass protests against shale gas drilling in both Lancashire and West Sussex; (c) Notes the controversy about both the supposed benefits of extracting on-shore gas resources and the local environmental impacts; (d) Notes the recent evidence that 60-80% of world fossil fuel reserves need to be left in the ground if average global temperature rise is to remain within 2 degrees; (e) Believes that there is also compelling evidence that UK shale gas and coal bed methane would form part of that 60-80%; (f) Notes that the large amounts of water needed for hydraulic fracturing to extract shale gas (known as fracking) would reduce water supplies in this region, which are also threatened by the impact of climate change; (g) Notes the well-documented risk of groundwater contamination as a result of fracking, which would exacerbate the pressure on water supplies and put residents at risk; (h) Notes the unavoidable increase in noise, visual intrusion and air pollution from heavy traffic in communities close to fracking sites; (i) Therefore calls on Kirklees Council to develop a Council policy on shale gas and coal bed methane extraction; (j) Will seek to attract to Kirklees appropriate funding for projects which increase energy efficiency, sustainability and self-sufficiency, stabilise energy bills, and create jobs in the green economy; and (k) Directs officers to send a copy of this motion to the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change and the Minister of State for the Department for Energy and Climate Change.' |\n|||\nDecision: |\nMotion carried.\n|\nYours sincerely\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper\nSaturday, 1 February 2014\nPRESS RELEASE - Greens call for solar panels to 2000 Council homes\n| Cllr Andrew Cooper discussing the 2000 house solar programme with Green Party Baroness Jenny Jones |\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper, Leader of the Greens on Kirklees Council said,\n\"The proposal we are putting forward would have no impact on the Council Tax. We are proposing that the solar panels would be installed using Housing Revenue Account reserves These are ringfenced funds for Council properties which cannot be legally be used for anything other than the maintenance of Council housing\"\n\" The capital costs of solar panels have come down significantly in recent years making this a more viable proposition. The Feed In Tarrif for solar electricity that a scheme such as this would attract will mean that the costs for the project will be completely paid back within 12 years. Council Tenants would get the benefit of the electricity off the roof. An average 2kWp solar installation would generate at least 1600 units of electricity a year the equivalent of £240 saving off the average electricity bill. For people on a low income this is a very significant saving.\"\n\"What this proposal would mean is that the Council would see a return on its investment within12 years, householders would have cheaper fuel bills and more electricity will be generated from clean renewable sources.\"\nGreen Party Peer Baroness Jenny Jones who was visiting Huddersfield to discuss the project said,\n\"This is a terrific idea. People around the country look to many of the initiatives coming from the GreenParty in Kirklees. What the Greens propose in Kirklees today is what other Councils will be copying tomorrow\"\nPeru, the 39th richest country in the world is pursuing a programme to provide solar energy for 2 million of its poorest people. The UK is the 7th richest country in the world.\nhttp://cleantechnica.com/2013/07/15/peru-solar-power-program-to-give-electricity-to-2-million-of-poorest-peruvians/\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2019_10_one-does-not-simply-declare-climate_html/content_131.html": "One does not simply declare a climate emergency. That became obvious, with stark clarity at last night's Kirklees Full Council meeting.\nI had resubmitted a motion that the Green Group had submitted to the last Full Council. This motion called for West Yorkshire Combined Authority to withdraw £100 million of support for the expansion of Leeds Bradford Airport. This motion despite my best efforts had fallen off the end of the agenda at the last meeting. This time in an effort to get it debated I withdrew a long standing Green motion that was nearer the beginning of the agenda and asked the Council to allow us to have the Leeds Bradford Airport motion heard in its place. This was rejected by Labour. When we got to near the end of the Council meeting there was a call from Labour, under Council rules to have their motion on Universal Credit voted on without debate. Quickly I asked for the same for our motion on Leeds Bradford Airport. We backed Labour to ensure their motion was put before the Council but then Labour, (with one or two honorable exceptions) voted against our motion being put. They really didn't want to discuss or vote on the motion at all.\nAnticipating that this would happen, earlier in the meeting, I had submitted a question to the Deputy Leader of the Council, Councillor Peter McBride which said,\n\"Will you be calling for West Yorkshire Combined Authority to withdraw the £100 million of support it is providing for the expansion of Leeds Bradford Airport in light of the Climate Emergency that we and they have declared?\"\nHis simple, unadorned, one word answer was \"No\". I pushed him in my supplementary question for a more serious answer to my question, to which he answered saying that the funding was for some sort of Park and Ride scheme and he effectively said it was nothing to do with airport expansion. There was clearly an illogical disconnect in his mind between developing extra transport capacity to Leeds Bradford Airport and its expansion.\nCouncillor McBride was also in the hot seat that evening to talk about progress under his Cabinet Portfolio. He mentioned that the Council would be promoting high energy efficiency standards in new housing. I welcomed this but then highlighted the 'performance gap' issue where housing, built supposedly in accordance with current building regulations, were using twice as much energy in operation as expected. So much as he might believe he was promoting high efficiency buildings that might not actually be the case in practice. As in previous meetings I then suggested the Council adopt 'Passivhaus' standards for new buildings which have a quality assurance system which ensures that buildings actually perform as expected and use around 75% less energy than a building built to current Building Regulation standards. I and Councillor Marchington from the Lib Dems highlighted other Councils that had successfully applied Passivhaus standards in new housing including the Sterling Prize winning 100 house scheme in Norwich. Councillor McBride then repeated a number of misunderstandings and myths around Passivhaus costs and the supposed complexity of living in a Passivhaus. This pretty much indicated that this wasn't a route he was going to go down.\nWe had considered Passivhaus in detail in the Climate Emergency Working Group where a lot of these issues that Cllr McBride raised were dealt with through evidence provided by an Observer on the Working Group, Chris Herring from the Passivhaus Trust . Hopefully some positive recommendations on the subject will appear in the Final Report. We will see.\nWhat struck me is that even if the Final Report from the Climate Emergency Working Group is as radical and inspiring as I hope it is then it has the hurdle to overcome of the Labour Cabinet. After last nights performance I doubt the Council will do anything other than a very mediocre response to the very real Climate Emergency we face. Unfortunately mediocre doesn't cut it.\n.\nGood try Andy, well done = tho head and brick wall comes to mind. Labour Greenwash has to be exposed.\nReplyDelete",

I had a Solar thermal system installed by Hebden Bridge company EcoHeat in April 2010. Any renewable heat technology installed after July 2009 with a valid Microgeneration Certification Scheme certificate would qualify for a legacy payment. So after more than 4 years I'd finally get the promised RHI payments but not without going through so e unnecessary hoops. First I'd have to get a Green Deal Advice Report at the cost of £120. This was supposedly to ensure I had insulation measures installed, but then I had an Energy Performance Certificate carried out only a couple of months ago to enable me to have cavity wall insulation installed. This just seemed to be an expensive exercise to allow DECC Minister Greg Barker to go on the television and claim people are 'taking action' as a result of Green Deal advice when I took action 4 years ago. Anyway I got the report done as otherwise I wouldn't have been able to claim the RHI.\nSo I get to the point where I'm completing the online RHI claim and it asks me if I have had any\nGrant support for my installation as this will be deducted. I remembered I'd had a £400 grant under the Low Carbon Buildings Programme so declared that and pressed 'submit'. A few days later I get an email from OFGEM who were administering the scheme saying they wouldn't process my RHI claim without proof of my Low Carbon Buildings Programme grant. This was particularly annoying as I hadn't got proof, I'd volunteered the information, all solar thermal grants under he LCBP were £400 and anyway shouldn't they have a database of people who had LCBP grants anyway as they are acting on behalf of government. After making these points to them OFGEM relented and decided to trust me. My first payment comes in September. Now remember, other legacy RHI applicants to make sure you declare your LCBP grants like I did!\nSo I get to the point where I'm completing the online RHI claim and it asks me if I have had any\nGrant support for my installation as this will be deducted.

I’ve been a\nGreen Party Councillor in Kirklees, in West Yorkshire for the last 17 years..\nOne of my more recent roles is as a member of the EU Committee of the Regions.\nThis little known body informs the EU about the impact of its policies at a\nlocal level. I was appointed to the politically balanced 24 member UK\ndelegation last year as the nominee of the Independent Group of Cllrs on the Local\nGovernment Association. As such I represent Independent, Green and UKIP Cllrs. I\nguess that makes me Nigel Farage’s Spokesperson in Europe on Local Government.\nFortunately I don’t think he knows this.\nThe Referendum Campaign has been\neventful. The bit I found most amusing was when the Vote Leave Campaign Bus\nvisited Harrogate and parked illegally. They were duly ticketed by the local\nCouncil. Vote Leave rejected the ticket saying that as they were part of the\nReferendum Campaign and therefore were exempt. Now my brother is the\nConservative Leader of Harrogate Borough Council and he tweeted the following “Let's see if they pay like everyone else has\nto. It's day one and counting #votepayup”- so the Brexitters don’t just\nhave a problem with EU Laws but seemingly some UK ones as well!\nIn the last European Parliament\nElections the Green Party took a 3 yeses approach to the EU.\nYes to Reform\nYes to Remaining\nYes to a Referendum\nYes Yes Yes! The last time I heard\n3 yeses in the same sentence was in the film ‘When Harry met Sally’ Somehow our 3 yeses never reached the same\nlevel of enthusiasm.\nYes to Reform because we know that the\nEU is by no means a perfect institution, the undue influence of big business\nover decision making, there’s TTIP that puts the interests of big business\nbefore democracy, there was the heavy\nhanded authoritarian austerity driven approach that was taken by the EU with\nthe Greek Government. These are just 3\nexamples that we could spend an entire conference talking about.\nBut if an institution needs\nreforming I’d start with one where a Government can get elected by 24% of the\nelectorate yet wield 100% of the power. I’d start with one where an unelected\nHouse of Lords wields power with the support of religious clerics – just like\nthey do in Iran. I’d start with the UK Government. At least in the EU MEPs are\nelected by a form of Proportional Representation, those who aren’t elected in\nthe European Commission need the support of the democratically elected European\nParliament to be appointed. So\npersonally (and this isn’t Green Party policy) I’d like a referendum on whether\nYorkshire should remain part of the UK or in fact become part of Scotland\nbecause I don’t know about you but I feel more affinity with Scotland than with\na Government led by Etonian Toffs.\nYes to Remaining\nBecause fundamentally I believe\nthat people forget that the binding together of our nations is more than simply\nan economic union but one that demonstrates the old Churchillian truism that “Jaw Jaw is better than War War”.\nIf we break those bonds of cooperation and friendship where that unravelling\nwill end doesn’t bear thinking about.\nYes to remaining because we live in\na globalised world with the impacts of big issues such as climate change, tax\navoidance and crime not stopping at political boundaries. They require action\nby nations across borders.\nRenewable Energy is a classic\nexample. The UK has an EU target of achieving 13% of our total energy from\nRenewable Sources by 2020. Other nations are already exceeding their much\nhigher targets, while we in the UK slip behind. This is due to a lack of UK\nGovt support for renewable energy. In the EU only Malta and Luxembourg are\nproducing less of their energy from Renewable sources than the UK. The point of\nthe EU target is that it makes the UK accountable, it compares us with others,\nand unfortunately it shames us and if there’s one thing this lousy Government\nneeds it is shaming.\nWhen the Paris agreement on Climate\nChange was signed the agreed EU Carbon reduction targets came as an\namalgamation of different countries contributions. I regarded this as a huge\npositive but the negative fly in the ointment was again our own Government NOT\nthe EU. At no point did they ask for the input of local Councils or Devolved\nAdministrations on how to reach this target, nor for our assistance or ideas on\nhow targets might be achieved. It’s almost as though we were irrelevant. UK\nGovernment was behaving remotely as if we didn’t exist in pretty much the same\nway that the Brexiteers regard the European Union treating the UK and its\ninterests.\nIf another Europe is to be possible I would\nwant it to be one where achieving EU targets is more strongly linked to action\non the ground. So where the EU has a target for improving energy efficiency I want\nthat to relate directly to warmer, healthier homes and working together to end\nthe misery of fuel poverty. This would be an example of a Europe that is\nrelevant to be peoples everyday lives. A Europe that has a common sense of\npurpose for Social and Environmental Good. This is why I believe a better\nEurope is not only possible but would be hugely popular.\nWe also said ‘Yes to A Referendum’\nand that is the big uncertainty. There are those who say we shouldn’t have done\nit. Why are our nations being used to try to solve an internal dispute in the\nConservative Party? Thats not going to work!\nOf\ncourse there are risks. With the EU Referendum we do not\nknow the outcome, peoples votes may be influenced by negative feelings or\ncherry picked facts but we will have our shot at getting our message across\nwith a positive vision of a sustainable and progressive Europe. In my\nexperience what wins votes is passion, belief and shoe leather. So between now\nand June 23rd let us use all these to get the result we need.\nIt is possible. Another Europe is\npossible!",

The first visit to an unregistered scrap dealer lead to an arrest for a drugs offence. The other visits to scrapyards involved the checking of records against what we could see around the premises. We came across\naluminium beer kegs which are not supposed to be sold as scrap, some very suspicious looking lead with no real explanation of its source and drain hole grates and covers. It was a good thing to do and sent a strong message that the authorities are keen to keep an eye on scrap dealers particularly with the number of lead and copper pipe and wire thefts going on out there. This is often linked, as so much crime is, to feeding drug addiction. It is an issue that many of us come across all the time. Burton Village Hall where we held our Parish meetings had the lead ripped off the roof three times. This is a community building run by volunteers and can ill afford this sort of crime. In Newsome the Roundhouse at Hall Bower Lane has also had similar lead thefts.\n|\n| Police and Kirklees Licensing officers at a scrap yard |\nSo what can the Council do to try and raise the standards in the local scrap dealers and stone merchants industry? My contribution to this question is to suggest a voluntary code of conduct for the industry which the Police, the Council and possibly Trading Standards would endorse. The code would ask scrap dealers and stone merchants to sign up to the following or similar:\n- to inform the Police immediately of any suspicious metal/stone presented to them on their premises\n- to not not accept drain covers and beer kegs as scrap\n- to commit to ask the people presenting scrap lead and copper wire where they have got the material from and to make a record of their response\n- to prominently display posters around their premises saying they will report any suspicious scrap/stone presented to them to the police\n- to refuse entry to anyone who turns up in a taxi to deliver scrap\nIn return Kirklees, West Yorkshire Police and Trading Standards would display on their websites lists of companies that sign up to the voluntary code of conduct. This will mean that law abiding people wanting to use a scrap merchant legitimately to recycle metals will be able to choose one which at least publicly says it opposes receiving stolen material. The Council could provide logos and signage for the scrap dealers to display around their sites. Of course a voluntary code has its limitations but at least people will know something about the companies that do sign up and importantly they will also know something about those who don't.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

It has been a real success with the Annual Mayor Making dinner using all local produce including Yorkshire Wine this year.\nOne important event initiated by Julie was an event where local food producers were teemed up with local buyers to help faciliate deals that make the green principles of local production for local needs very real. This was a hugely successful event and well worth doing again.\nhttp://www2.kirklees.gov.uk/news/onlinenews/newsdesk/fullstory.aspx?id=1662\nThe Awards were another element and a way of recognising acheivement of local food producers. It was a great event and pleasing to see Berry Brow Infants and Newsome High School both getting Awards. They were both in our patch and no, neither me nor Julie were Judges! But for me, and I think a lot of people, there it was great to see 'Growing Newsome' getting the recognition they deserved for all the food growing community projects by winning the Community Award. Diane Sims didn't hold back when she collected the award, with the rest of the gang, and her genuine enthusiasm and commitment to the project clearly showed why they had won.\nFortunately several people and companies won awards who were not associated with the Newsome Ward and well deserved they were too.\nWill the Awards continue? I think they will and not just because Julie says so, but because the local food agenda is really going to grow and has huge potential to bring people and communities together. That is something we can't really get enough of right now.\nI better plant my spuds!\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2010_08_green-deal-or-no-deal_html/content_379.html": "We've had the first 100 days of the \"greenest government ever\" and following on from my post on the subject last month we have a number of other green question marks over the Coalition Government's commitment to addressing climate change.\nIn abolishing the Regional Spatial Strategies, where the primary purpose was to abolish housebuilding targets, the government have also abolished the regional renewable energy targets. These were supposed to drive the installation of wind turbines, solar panels and other clean energy sources. With this gone there is very little hope of the UK hitting the EU's 2020 target of 15% of the UKs energy from renewable sources unless government acts quickly to put new policy drivers in place.\nThere is also concern over the government's commitment to high Environmental Performance Standards for new power stations and whether or not carbon capture and storage technology is yet mature enough as a technology to make coal fired plants viable. It is likely that though the Lib Dems supposedly are against using public money to finance new nuclear power stations that ways will be found in making them a reality. This will probably be though our energy bills. So no public money just the publics money. Fiendish or what! Despite all the public statements by politicians on the need for nuclear the case has never been properly made. Most opinions on this seem to be based on belief not facts. Lots of evidence contradicting assertions that we need nuclear energy 'to keep the lights on' can be found at http://www.noneedfornuclear.org.uk/\nSo we are left with reducing energy demand in the home as our best hope for reducing carbon emissions. The 'Green Deal' not the 'Green New Deal' (as promoted by the Green Party at the last election) is what the Government is pinning its hopes on. Roughly the Green Deal will be a loan arrangement linked to the properties energy bills where the cost of measures will be recovered at a rate no greater than the cost of energy saved making it a win win scenario. This is due to be introduced in 2012 as primary legislation will be required to establish the property linked loan. So far so good but the devil is as always in the detail. There are contradictions to overcome. Within a month Greg Barker MP, Tory Climate Change Minister has said solar panels/microgeneration will not be part of Green Deal's finance package and Nick Clegg, Lib Dem leader has said they will. There are questions over whether simple cost effective insulation measures are best dealt with through loan arrangements in value for money terms compared with public/CERT funded area based initiatives like Kirklees Warm Zone. The answer is probably no. So if microgeneration is not to be included and low cost insulation measures are not appropriate that leaves us with solid wall insulation which may be a 'hard sell' for many households. So there are more questions than answers yet and the governments stated belief that somehow finance packages and project management by supermarkets hold the key to reducing household carbon emissions does not bear much examination. If anything it is local authorities in conjunction with energy utility partners that have the best models for delivering mass energy efficiency measures to households not Tescos.\nThere is always hope however and we need to see what can be done to steer the Green Deal on the right path in a world where public money is tight and where the risk of a double dip recesssion is ever present. There are more questions than answers at present and the danger is that models for delivering energy efficiency to householders are designed by people who have never had to deliver a successful energy efficiency project of this kind using untested policy models but I'm sure the government wouldn't do that!\n(Pictured Noel Edmonds creator of Channel 4s Deal or No Deal gameshow and of course Mr Blobby, proponent of cosmic ordering and also an anti wind Campaigner who created the Renewable Energy Foundation that campaigns against renewable energy.

This was particularly popular with older people wanting to keep active and healthy. These classes ran in Community Halls and were sponsored by Kirklees Council as part of their ‘Early Intervention and Prevention Strategy’ to help those with less mobility keep in shape. The sessions had become really popular bringing the community together, tackling loneliness and improving health.\nThen the Coronaviris stopped all group activity!\nNewsome Green Councillor Andrew Cooper contacted Lynne and suggested using ZOOM, a video conferencing app, to keep her pilates sessions going virtually. The classes are now being done virtually and keeping people in touch with each other in these times of social isolation.\nLynne said,\n“I’ve never been the best at social media and technology but Andrew introduced me to ZOOM and talked me through the set up and how it works, it was very easy which has been confirmed by how many of my pilates people have joined me, including those over 70. Many thanks to Andrew. With his help and advice I have been able to continue my classes and keep me sane as I am by nature a sociable person. This media enables everyone to chat before the session starts and enables me to correct body positions whilst the class is in progress… I love it!”\nCouncillor Cooper said,\n“I’m so pleased Lynne’s classes are going so well and that she is able to help so many people stay active when they even are confined to their homes for much of the day. The exercise will not just make people physically healthier but mentally stronger as well by having valuable social time with friends, sharing a fun experience. Who knows I might give it a try!”\nLynne runs six sessions a week, two for those who are looking for a more gentle exercise, exercising from a chair, two for Beginners to Pilates who may wish to learn or who just want to keep toned and in shape, and 2 sessions of the more Advanced/Intermediate sessions for those who really want to work their bodies and have done pilates/exercise in the past. Membership is just £20 a calendar month and gives access to 2 sessions per week.\nFor more information email Lynne at pilateslynne@gmail.com\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Whatever happened to them?\"\nWell to be honest that was my thought and the answer seems to be that they became a global success and spawned lots of community based resilience activity all over the world being particularly successful in France, Belgium and Japan to name but a few but sadly they need to re-imagine themselves back in the UK I feel and it would be good if they could.\nIn a nutshell the Transition Network is all about resilience. Resilience to a world less reliant on dwindling fossil fuels and where more goods and resources can be sourced sustainably locally. Where a thriving community becomes even more important and a vital part of the solution.\nOne of the reasons for the 'Rest of the World' success of the Transition Network is the smash hit film 'Tomorrow'.\n\"What? You mean Tomorrow Never Dies with Pierce Brosnan as Bond?\"\nNo 'Tomorrow' a film about the Transition Movement. It's won stackloads of film awards and scores 92% on Rotten Tomatoes. Its success is attributed to the fact that it spends the first 5 minutes on environmental doom and gloom 'get me out of this room' stuff and the rest of the movie on solutions, optimism and hope. Its been inspirational to people around the world and I'm ashamed to say that until today I'd never heard of it. I wonder if its on Netflix.\nThe reason I know all this is because today I was one of the speakers at the European Day of Sustainable Communities event in Brussels hosted by the EU Committee of the Regions and EESC which was full of people from around Europe who have been inspired by the resilience message of the Transition Movement. Their Umbrella body is ECOLISE or 'the European network for community-led initiatives on climate change and sustainability' It was great to be among like minded people to whom the ethos of 'Think Global Act Local' is intrinsic to their very being. They think small scale and value community, incremental change and recognise that as I put it today \"That we don't just want to save the world but create a better world\". It was a very positive event and full of articulate, bright and many young people. So when we were asked for a word to sum up our thoughts of the day I chose 'hope'.\nI wonder what can be done to revitalise the fortunes of the Transition Network in the UK? It warrants serious thought. We have a group near us Holmfirth Transition Town which continues to do some excellent work but I get the feeling across the UK they are not as active as they were five or six years ago. Maybe one of the reasons is that they came out of 'The End of Oil' debate that seemed to place the crisis with the lack of fossil fuels as opposed to the fact that we'll burn them and ourselves to oblivion before we have to worry about them running out. This doesn't make the Transition Network any less relevant at all in fact the 'Hothouse Report' and ongoing extreme weather events mean that we must find ways of making the approach they take relevant to many more communities.\nMy resolution from today? To watch the film 'Tomorrow' and if I like it to get many more people to watch it probably at Huddersfield Green Drinks at the Media Centre. Here's the trailer\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2022_12_cllr-andrew-coopers-speech-on-kirklees_html/content_759.html": "Just to be clear and to avoid accusations by Cllr Simpson, that I am making up my own facts, I'll only quote from the report that is in front of us today.\nWhen is a Climate Change Action Plan NOT a Climate Change Action Plan? I guess the answer to this question is when it says it isn’t. The report on the Climate Change Action Plan says,\n“The CCAP is not a list of firm commitments, investment proposals or instructions at this point in the process. But it does set out detailed actions that can be taken by the Council, key partners, and members of the wider community to help deliver the district's net zero and climate ready target.”\nNow I don’t know about you but that doesn’t sound anything like an action plan to me.\nAnd what consequences flow from “the plan”. For instance costs, risks, legal implications. The report says\n2.15. As this version of the CCAP is not a list of commitments and instructions at this stage in the process, there are no costs associated with its approval.\nFurthermore it says,\n2.23. There are minimal risks associated with the publication of this plan, due to the non-committal nature of the CCAP”.\nAnd on legal implications\n5.2. As the CCAP shown in Appendix 1 of this report is not a list of commitments and instructions, there are no broader legal implications in the approval of this plan.\nI am disappointed that there are no implications from this report. I want the report to be consequential, important and substantial.\nI do the report a slight misservice as there is a risk identified. It says:\n2.24. The core risks with this CCAP comes primarily from potential communication and publication of the documentation. Specifically associated with the positive and negative response expected from the public, partner organisations such as the Kirklees Climate Commission.\nWhen you are expecting a possible poor response from your principal partner the Kirklees Climate Commission you’ve got to be asking yourself some serious questions as to why we are in this space.\nIt further goes on to say\n5.14. A core focus of this criticism is expected around the non-committal nature of this CCAP at this stage in the process. To combat this, we are striving to clearly communicate how the next steps in our action plan process will result in firm commitments, once we have developed and identified – through extensive resident and stakeholder engagement, a refined number of high-priority actions by place, which will be accompanied by a business case providing indicative costs and carbon figures.\nSo in a strange way I am reassured by this report. Reassured because I have heard certain Cabinet Members saying how we are one of the best Councils in the country on addressing climate change. I tell you now, we are not and recognising that is the first step towards improving so I commend officers for their candour in this report and all the good work they are doing but I’d like a clear understanding from Cabinet Members of when we will have a real Climate Change Action Plan given that we are nearly 4 years since the Council declared a Climate Emergency.\nI was a bit bemused by this statement in the report\n3.11., Kirklees Council have and will continue to deliver a Young Persons Climate Festival helping educate, inform, and give young people a chance to get involved with the various environmental initiatives taking place across Kirklees.\nIf there’s something I’m really clear about, it is that young people, ( with one or two exceptions), get climate change almost instinctively, as the future that we are just beginning to see is getting worse and the consequences of our actions are ones that they will experience acutely. Many are well informed, and educate themselves, you do that, when it is a threat to your future and your very survival.\nI think we need another “Festival'' to inform and educate Councillors, Directors, Heads of Service. Why not ensure we all go through a Carbon Literacy course so they properly understand the implications of decisions on future generations.\nIn some ways the most shocking part of the report was this statement,\n“6.3. Review by portfolio holders: Cllr Simpson (Green and Clean), Cllr Davies (Environment) and Cllr Mather (Corporate) were consulted and had no comments on the options or recommendations put forward in this report.”\nWhat nothing? Zilch? Nada? Arguably the most important document about what we are doing locally to address climate change and our Kirklees Cabinet members had nothing to say?\nUtterly shocking!\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

That roof's looking a bit bare! |\nAt first glance you might think Calderdale didn't need much 'Greening'. It is indeed a green and pleasant area and a Council I worked for for a while as their Home Energy Conservation Officer. They pioneered universally free insulation for the over 60s regardless of income before any other Council in the country and did so for around 8 years before funding constraints took hold. Calderdale has Hebden Bridge with the Alternative Technology Centre and more 'right on' folk than you can shake a stick (that may be later used as biomass) at. It also has Todmorden which pioneered the food growing revolution that is 'Incredible Edible'. The Council is also doing some pioneering work on new social housing with high Code for Sustainable Homes standards. So there's a lot for them to shout about on the green front but even the more proactive areas have a blind spot and Calderdale's is their Planning Department's approach to solar PV on listed buildings.\nA recent planning application for a solar PV panels on a listed farmhouse at Scholes Farm is a case in point. The applicants wanted to put their panels on a section of roof that was on a new extension to the listed building that could not be seen from the road or particularly easily from anywhere else. Calderdale Planning however reckoned that this was still adversely impacting on the buildings listed status and recommended refusal. All I could imagine that the applicants could have done to make the panels more acceptable to planners would have been to bury them in the garden but this would have rather negated their purpose in life.\n| St James Piccadilly Solar Panels |\nI advised the applicants of their right to ask one of their local councillors to refer the matter to the Planning Committee for a decision rather than be decided by officers. Fortunately the Councillors could see that the interpretation of government planning policy in this instance was not being regarded as an enabling one but in a more restrictive light. Evidence was ably provided by Mr Adam Gillespie of the Energy Saving Trust on behalf of the applicant. The Councillors wisely approved the application.",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2010_12_december-full-council-report_html/content_684.html": "Yesterdays Full Council was I think the first 'full on' Tweet Council with myself, Kath Pinnock from the Lib Dems and Leader of the council Mehboob Khan all participating on Twitter (plus 'LibDemKitty' I think I've worked out who that is!). Was there a value in it? Yes I think so. You could certainly get an insight into our meetings you wouldn't have had otherwise. Take for instance the Lib Dem amendment on opposing the cuts to provision for Schools Sports Partnerships. The Greens supported their amendment. When I tweeted to this effect the twitterfeed from Kath Pinnock rather churlishly said 'Shame that 50% Green Group absent from Council'. For those of you who don't know there are only 4 us. One of our 4, Cllr Julie Stewart-Turner had to leave the meeting as she was a Governor for Newsome High School, a Specialist Sports College and had an interest in the motion, and Cllr Graham Simpson was late because he was attending a Tenants Association meeting. So a rather unpleasant attack on the Greens who were actually supporting a Lib Dem Amendment. I thought they could do with all the support they could get at present.\nAnother Lib Dem Amendment we supported was one on Planning Protocols. The amendment insisted that Cllrs on the Planning Committee attend training on Planning (what else). The Conservaties were opposed to this as many of them hadn't gone to training and were quite happy to spout away in an uninformed fashion at Planning meetings potentially leaving the Council open to challenge during an appeal process. My contribution to the debate was to point out that decisions backed up by knowledge should be more important than simple opinion on planning matters. This provoked a rather unpleasant verbal barrage on me by Conservative Councillor Mrs Christine Smith which I found fairly amusing to be honest. I'm not on her Christmas Card list!\nDuring questions I asked the Labour Cabinet Member Councillor Mr Ken Smith what his opinion was of the impact of the rise in Tuition fees on young people in Kirklees. He gave his view that it was potentially disastrous and agreed to my request to write to the Government to express this view. This provoked much comment from Lib Dem Cllrs who defended the tuition fees policy. This directly contradicted the expressed opinions of Lib Dem Candidates during the General Election which I pointed out (and they ignored). I also asked Cllr Peter O Neill what his views were on 'The Big Society'. He gave me a very full response. So much so that I was unable to get my supplementary question in before time was up unfortunately.\nOver 600 people watched the Council meeting on the Web but according to Kath Pinnock webcasting of Council meetings 'doesn't work'. Yes there have been some technical issues that some people have encountered but generally it has gone pretty well. I think the problem for Kath is that it was a Green Party proposal and that gives her a rather jaundiced view on the subject. Cest la vie.\nAfter the meeting I collected a large sealed envelope with the papers for the 'Star Chamber' meeting on Friday and Monday to discuss the Kirklees Budget for the next year. In the envelope are the officers views of how we will acheive the Lib Dem/Con Governments spending cuts. This will not make pleasant reading.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Will the flag be at half mast on the 12th of December when the FIT rate drops? |\nSomehow I can’t separate in my mind the cuts in Solar PV tariffs from other unrelated news items other than they are all outpourings of policy announcements from Government.\nThe basic mantra from Climate Change Minister Greg Barker is ‘Solar PV is expensive, the tariffs are unaffordable, capital costs are dropping so fast that the FIT is overgenerous that’s why we are cutting it. Its times not right yet for mass deployment, it’s a regressive tax on energy bills and adversely affects the fuel poor. Its like the poll tax and we all know how unpopular that was!’\nThis line doesn’t stand a lot of examination but it represents their expressed views and it would seem that DECC have pulled the drawbridge up on this one and are sticking their fingers in their ears to reasoned argument. So given it only cost a few million last year, the equivalent of 30p on the average energy bill what other things have the government been spending our money on? Well there’s the £600 million for Free Schools, a totally unnecessary support for a new school system usually parent led which will run parallel and in addition to local authority schools. There was the £250 million by Eric Pickles offered to councils to recommence weekly bin collections which actually nobody is much bothered about. Then there’s all the money for new infrastructure projects that has been announced this week. All this yet solar PV a technology that has been made available for the fuel rich and the fuel poor, that can be quickly deployed, that significantly reduces fuel cost and carbon emissions is regarded as too expensive (it isn’t). It simply doesn’t add up as an argument. You can’t really believe that they believe it. When we are talking about expanding nuclear generation this is couched in the terms of energy security and there’s no real reference to the impact on energy bills. The same arguments could be used for solar PV but they aren’t. So what is really going on? I’ll stick my neck out and say that it must be lobbying from the energy generators and suppliers. How would you feel if your monopoly over the provision of electricity was under threat from millions of people sticking solar panels on their roofs and then you have to pay them for the privilege. I’ve heard no mutterings, I have no proof but given the government’s position on FITs isn’t really credible this seems like a believable explanation. DECC Ministers may wag their fingers at the suppliers and generators but ultimately they’re going to need them to pursue their energy ambitions for new nuclear.

I went out to investigate and there they were lying on the surface being watched over by a heron who looked like he had already had his fill of this unexpected bounty. The theories from local people came thick and fast. Poisoning and pollution were what people initially thought but following investigations it turned out it was none of these. The long hot dry spell had de-oxygenated the water and the fish had simply suffocated. The had been killed by the weather.\nIn the past, as a Green, who wants to be taken seriously on climate change I've been reticent to link single weather events to climate change, but this is different. The phenomenon we are experiencing is a global one. We have had huge moorland fires on Saddleworth Moor, wildfires in Greece that have killed many, even wild fires within the Arctic Circle due to the heat and record temperatures in Japan. Comparisons with the summer of 76 are not really valid as that was very much a UK experience. This is global one and we know that extreme events such as these are going to become more common as climate change begins to have a greater impact.\nTwo events happened today of note. One was a new report titled 'Planning for Climate Change - a guide for Local Authorities' by the independent Local Government Information Unit. It referenced a report by the Royal Town Planning Institute from last year stating,\n\"that a lack of integration of climate change into local plans was\npartly a result of a skills shortage related to budget cuts, and partly due to\nchanges in national government policy that appear to de-prioritise climate\nchange action.\"\nSadly this comes as no surprise. The actions of our Government appear to be those of Climate Change deniers not that of an enthusiastic signatory to the Paris Climate Agreement. The evidence is there for all to see not least of which being a huge drop in renewable energy and energy efficiency installations.\nThe other event today was the Government decision to allow Fracking at Preston New Road in Lancashire against the wishes of the Lancashire County Council. Nationally the Government is pushing through permitted development rights for fracking exploration drilling overriding any local democratic objections. There is a sad lack of politicians in Westminster who 'get it' who understand that promoting these policies threatens us all.\nThe other event today was the Government decision to allow Fracking at Preston New Road in Lancashire against the wishes of the Lancashire County Council.

There is a sad lack of politicians in Westminster who 'get it' who understand that promoting these policies threatens us all.\nPromoting action on climate change is so positive in terms of skilled jobs, putting money back into local economies, increasing energy security not to mention actually ensuring our survival and that of many other species that it beggars belief that any Government can turn its back on it. The disconnect between the impact of climate change on our weather and the decisions Governments and some opposition MPs make is truly worrying. These MPs must be made accountable and challenged for the stances they take. It has to be us and it has to be now. It is that urgent.",

It's a real acheivement for Kirklees and has a very high green specification. The walls are highly insulated with wool from local sheep, it has a green roof using sedum and is heated using an air sourced heat pump. Most importantly the kids, the local mums and dads and the staff like the building. I and Parish Cllr Michelle Atkinson were lucky enough to look round the building during construction and experienced first hand the enthusiasm of the builders for the eco features of the new centre they were working on. One particularly satisfying thing was that it was partly financed by the Renewable Energy Fund established by the Green Party in a budget amendment over 10 years ago now. I mentioned this to one of the Conservative Councillors in Kirkburton Ward today and she got all unnecessarily unpleasant asking what I was doing there. I came up with a bizarre spurious answer saying I was a Kirkburton Parish Councillor and it's a Childrens Centre for the whole of the Kirkburton area. Dubious I know.\n|\n| Parish Cllr Michelle Atkinson with the wool |\nWith the price of wool dropping , finding a new insulation market for sheepswool could be a real boon for many hill farmers. It won't replace mineral fibre wool overnight but it could play an increasingly important role in prestige buildings where the low embodied energy of construction products will be valued. From this base sheepswool could go on to become a much more mainstream product.

He\nwould always end by naming us. My favourite was when he referred to us as\nCompo, Clegg and Foggy. Which I pointed out were 3 old guys from Holmfirth who\nhad some bizarre ideas. I suggested that perhaps he should look closer to home\nfor these characters. But I guess nothing from the Tories today, no Tory Budget\namendment so they must be happy with Labour’s budget. No ideas not even bizarre\nones. So I guess it will be a dignified silence from them now. Perhaps not.\nWe have\nreiterated our call for support for rough sleepers in our town centres, to\nrestore play areas removed for health and safety reasons and greater support\nfor safety schemes on our roads.

We of\ncourse recognise the increasingly embarrassing record of Kirklees on recycling\nand have suggested ways to address this.\nWe have been\ninspired by the Council’s Declaration of a Climate Emergency and want to get\nKirklees off to a flying start in efforts to reduce carbon emissions and play\nour small part not just saving the world but also creating a better world for\nus here in Kirklees.\nWe have\nsought a realisable but ambitious tree planting programme. The Kirklees Forest\nProject, where every school child will get the opportunity to plant at least\none tree during their education. But this is not just a fluffy feel good\nproject, or as has been suggested by one uninformed commentator ‘virtue\nsignalling’. This is a project to plant 150,000 trees over 4 years and the\nprecursor to a much larger project over the next 25 years. The Kirklees Forest project\nis not just about capturing carbon, it is about flood resilience through\nstrategic planting, it provides habitats for wildlife, reduces air pollution\nand noise levels in built up areas, creates natural space which is good for\ncommunities, well being and mental health.\nAs you will\nsee from our amendment it is not all Council money we are using it as leverage\nto bring in funding from other sources. It is an ambitious and worthwhile\nproject the sort of thing we need to be doing if we are to be a leading Council\non something that stands out in this country and beyond on addressing climate\nchange.\nWe have\nagain called for a much more ambitious investment in electric vehicles.

We need to be bold, we need to regain the lead we once\nhad, that has been lost, as a ‘Green Council’. We propose 127 electric vehicles\ncutting emissions on our roads, lowering running and maintenance costs for our\nvehicles and the investment in the charging infrastructure needed to support\nthem.\nNot a matter\nfor this budget but we also need to see what we can do to set higher energy\nefficiency standards in our Local Plan though Supplementary Planning Guidance.\nWe can do this and we should\nWith these 3\nmeasures we can make a beginning on the road to action. Without some sort of\nsignificant, substantial actions on climate change then you simply make the\nwords of the naysayers true. If your house is on fire it is an emergency. You\ndon’t throw a cup of water on it you call the fire brigade and get a hosepipe\non it. Declare a Climate Emergency yes but then act accordingly.\nSo I propose\nthat after we have heard the Lib Dem amendment that we have a short recess to\nconsider the elements of the amendments that refer to a climate emergency and\nsee if we can come to a consensus on this one crucial issue.\nThe support\nfor a Declaration of a Climate Emergency was agreed on a cross party basis so\nwhy not an amendment to the Council Budget agreed by those parties who voted\nfor the Climate Emergency and those that have actually submitted amendments.\nIn other parts of the country we have people protesting in council chambers because they feel they are not been listened to on action on climate change.

The impact on the services provided by the council cannot be overstressed, Roads that are already poor will get even worse, costs for adult social care will rise, funding for vulnerable children is uncertain, libraries and museums are threatened with closure. At a time when Kirklees is facing its greatest ever crisis it makes no sense to have a minority Labour Administration having the responsibility alone of trying to protect the services that people across the district rely on, need and value.\nIt is all too easy for opposition parties to criticise from the sidelines with the comforting knowledge that they have no responsibility for any council decisions that are made, while knowing that if they were in charge they would be faced with exactly the same dilemmas. At times of real crisis political parties should put aside differences and work together on solutions that are built around consensus and the common good.\nThere are no easy answers or silver bullets to address the problems that the Council is facing. That is why every Councillor, of which ever political party, has a duty to want to responsibility to get the best outcomes possible for local people. For these reasons we are calling for a shared All Party Administration of Kirklees Council. This proposal will not work if one Party decides it prefers the comfort of opposition and we would only consider being part of a Kirklees Cabinet if all Parties represented on Kirklees took part.\nI have today written to the other Party Group Leaders on Kirklees Council requesting a meeting to discuss our proposal ENDS\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

It is being held in Lyon in France and I am there in my role as a Political Coordinator for the ENVE Commission of the EU Committee of the Regions.\nOne of the most telling slides in one of the presentations contained the words 'Cities Act while Nations Talk'. Governments can set targets but ultimately it is the implementation at the local level that is going to deliver the changes we need.\nIn the UK we seem to be going backwards. Onshore wind has been effectively outlawed in the UK with recent Government pronouncements following the General Election. So called 'Zero Carbon Homes' due to enter building regulations next year, will be nothing of the sort following Government caving in to the Home Builders Federation on energy efficiency standards. So what has this got to do with the summit I am attending? A particular recommendation I have sought to get included in the text for the summit was calling for national government policies and standards on energy efficiency and renewable energy to be regarded as a minimum beyond which local government could set higher standards. Effectively I was calling for a national policies and standards to be a floor not a ceiling on individual Councils ambition and activity.\nCurrent agreements on climate change from Governments from around the world are inadequate if we are to have a chance of halting global temperatures at around a 2 degrees C. So one way that we could ensure there is greater progress would be to free Local Councils of the constraints on what energy efficiency and renewable energy standards they can specify in their local plans. In Kirklees I would like us to be allowed to specify Passivhaus standards for all new buildings. At a stroke this would cut new buildings energy demand by 90%. To put this policy in our Councils local plan would undoubtedly be challenged/thrown out by the Government's Planning Inspectorate as being too onerous or costly for those hard pressed developers. An International Agreement in Paris freeing Local Authorities to specify high energy effiency standards in buildings would be really helpful.

It is\nsimply replacing a remote Westminster politican with a remote individual who is\nsupposed to represent millions of people which they cannot. When mayoral models\nhave been put before local people in referenda before they have rejected. Now\nit is proposed to impose a Mayor on West Yorkshire without a referendum.\nThe Mayoral Combined\nAuthority – Some members are more equal than others\nThe proposed West Yorkshire Combined Authority will have 11\nmembers. 5 of these members will most likely be the Leaders of the constituent\nCouncils. These will be Councillors who have been elected by the unfair first\npast the post electoral system unlike the WYCA mayor. Having members of the\nsame body elected by different electoral systems is bizarre and perverse. The 3\nadditional members will also be Councillors elected under the first past the\npost system but these places will be allocated on the basis of the number of\nCouncillors in political groups on the constituent councils not on the basis of\npopular share of the vote. We believe that West Yorkshire should have an Assembly\nlike the GLA in London elected by Proportional Representation. If it is good\nenough for London why not West Yorkshire?\nThe 3 additional constituent council members on the Mayoral\nCombined Authority appointed for political balance should be referred to as\n“Second Class Members” as their support is not required to pass the Mayor’s\nSpatial Development Strategy, the designation of land for a Mayoral Combined\nAuthority Area, the compulsory purchase of land, decisions that could incur a\nfinancial liability on a constituent council or any matter pertaining to the\nMayoral Combined Authority’s Constitution. Using the same logic the 5 members\nappointed by each constituent Council should be referred to as “Premier Class\nMembers” as their support is required to approve the above matters.\nAll Councillors need\nto be represented on the Mayoral Combined Authority\nOver 8% of elected Councillors in West Yorkshire are from\nparties other than Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats. All these\nCouncillors are members of the LGA Independent Group. Current proposals would\nmean that these Councillors and the communities they represent would have no\nrepresentation at all on the Mayoral Combined Authority. Provision should be\nmade on the board to represent all groupings represented by LGA Political\nGroups including the LGA Independent Group which consists of Independent and\nGreen Party Councillors. We propose an additional member for political balance\nto ensure Councillors who are members of the LGA Independent Group, and\ntherefore the people who vote for them, are represented.\nThe proposals for 2\nDeputy Mayors are undemocratic\nThe proposal for the Mayor to be able to simply appoint a 2\nPaid Deputies is undemocratic and will most likely be given to ‘Party worthies’\nas a form of patronage. If it follows the model of the West Yorkshire Police\nand Crime Commissioner the Deputy Mayors positions will attract an allowance of\nat least £50’000/year with no democratic mandate. The Leader of Kirklees\nCouncil has stated at a Kirklees Scrutiny meeting that a Deputy Mayor position\nwill be taken by a Leader of one of the Constituent Councils. There is no\nreference to this in the Governance Review.\nMayoral Compulsory\nPurchase and Development Area powers should need approval of a meeting of the\nconstituent Full Council\nThe Mayor will have the power to compulsory purchase land\nwithin each Combined Authority area and set up Mayoral Development areas.\nBefore any of these powers are put into effect they should require the approval\nof a vote in Full Council in the constituent Council affected.\nAs with the Compulsory Purchase powers we strongly believe\nthat proposals to establish a Mayoral Development area should also require Full\nCouncil approval.\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer transport functions and new transport related\nfunctions to a West Yorkshire Mayor and mayoral combined authority?\nDisagree\nAdditional Transport\nfunding should simply be passed down to each Constitutent Council\nGovernment should simply devolve the additional funding for\ntransport related functions to Local Authorities anyway without requiring the\nestablishment of a new undemocratic Mayoral Authority.\nTransport funding\nshould not be used to support higher carbon emissions\nThe West Yorkshire Combined Authority is currently proposing\nthe use of funding for transport functions to support the expansion of Leeds\nBradford Airport. This is inconsistent with the Zero Carbon Agenda the\nAuthority is currently signed up to. We would need a commitment from the\nMayoral Combined Authority to not fund transport projects that increase carbon\nemissions when we should be reducing them.\nThe Key Route Network proposed could involve the\nestablishment of new roads encouraging car use and destroying valued green\ncorridors. This would also be inconsistent with WYCA’s commitment to have a zero\ncarbon economy by 2038.\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer skills and employment functions to a West\nYorkshire mayoral combined authority?\nNeither agree nor\ndisagree\nThe important thing to recognise here is that this is not\nnew money and the Mayoral Combined Authority will have no control over the\namount of money invested in West Yorkshire for skills and employment functions.\nWe strongly believe that the funding that is passed down\nfrom central government should play a key role in supporting the skills needed\nfor the Zero Carbon Economy Agenda.\nQuestion 4\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer housing and planning functions to a West\nYorkshire Mayor and mayoral combined authority?\nDisagree\nPlanning decisions\nshould be taken at a local level\nWe believe that planning decisions are best taken at a local\nlevel not by a remote Mayoral Combined Authority and as such we would want any\nplanning decisions to require the support of the Planning Authority of the\nrelevant constituent Council and be put before them for debate and decision.\nThe Mayoral Combined\nAuthority should be able to suspend the ‘Right to Buy’\nOne function we would like devolved to a local level is the\npower to suspend the Right to Buy scheme. We have seen a massive reduction in\nCouncil Housing at a time of high demand for income particularly for the\nmillions left behind in the policy push over the last 40 years towards home\nownership. Not everybody can own a home and we need a secure affordable option\nfor the millions who cannot. Suspending\nor preferably abolishing the Right to Buy would boost the business case for\nCouncils wanting to build new affordable homes.\nThe power we need is\nto insist on higher energy efficiency standards for buildings\nThe Mayor will not have powers to insist on higher building\nstandards in the region such as Passivhaus for all new build. This would be\ncompatible with WYCA’s stated commitment to a Zero Carbon Economy by 2038 but\nis a power that we won’t have.\nWe need a 2030 Target\nfor the West Yorkshire Zero Carbon Economy\nWe strongly believe that the Mayoral Combined Authority\nshould set a new, more ambitious target for a Zero Carbon Economy by 2030 in\nline with report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange Repor . This would help support our argument for stronger housing and\nplanning policies either at the local or regional level.\nQuestion 5\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer Police and Crime Commissioner functions to a\nWest Yorkshire Mayor?\nStrongly oppose\nPolice and Crime\nfunctions are even more unaccountable under the Mayoral Combined Authority.\nThe abolition of the Police and Crime Commissioner role is a\npositive in that it is a role that has not excited interested the electorate\nand takes away from rather than adds to local democratic accountability of the\nPolice. The appointment of a highly paid unelected Deputy Mayor to lead on the\nPolicing function however just makes matters worse and will undoubtedly put an\nunelected politician in a role where the people scrutinising them will have a\ndemocratic mandate (albeit through FPTP) but they will not.\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer additional finance functions on a West Yorkshire\nMayor and mayoral combined authority?\nStrongly oppose\nNo taxation without\nadequate representation and scrutiny.\nOur opposition to these additional powers is due to the lack\nof a suitable democratic mandate as we have detailed in our answer to question\n1 and the lack of suitable scrutiny and powers to limit the powers of the Mayor\nby a democratically elected Assembly.\nThe power to charge a precept for policing would mean that\nthe funding gained could be the responsibility of an unelected functionary.\nQuestion 7\nAre there any\ncomments you would like to make that you do not feel you have addressed in your\nresponse?\nWhat about the\nchallenge of Climate Change?\nThe West Yorkshire Authorities Governance Review document\nhighlights the major challenges to the sub region. It includes growth,\nproductivity, diversity, innovation and trade but Climate Change is not\nidentified as a challenge bizarrely. The self-declared target of having a Zero\nCarbon Economy in just 18 years time is a significant challenge but it is\nconcerning that it has not been included here. For the record the Green Party\nbelieves that our target should be 2030 not 2038 in line with the evidence from\nclimate scientists.\nWhat about a\nresilient economy?\nAnother significant challenge highlighted by the COVID19\ncrisis is the need for a resilient economy that is less affected by global\nfactors such as international trade, the money markets and financial speculation.\nA more resilient economy would have an emphasis on local\nproduction for local need, more locally owned and managed businesses trading with\neach other ensuring money remains within the regional economy. This is not\nidentified as a significant challenge and therefore cannot be regarded as a\npriority by the Mayoral Combined Authority. This is a major weakness in the\nGovernance Review Document",

This is the document that included the now infamous ‘phasing down’ rather than ‘phasing out of coal reference. Many of us feel immense dismay about the COP26 outcome but within the document it is worth knowing what is in it that is relevant to our local Councils.\nA blog by Green Party Councillor Andrew Cooper about Green Politics, action on Climate Change, Kirklees Council and our activity to improve the local and global environment (and also anything that I fancy talking about) Promoted and published by A Cooper, 76 Brockholes Lane, Holmfirth HD9 7EB\nMonday, 15 November 2021\nCOP26 - What did it mean for Local and Regional Government?\nCOP26 resulted in what is officially known as the Glasgow Climate Pact. This is the document that included the now infamous ‘phasing down’ rather than ‘phasing out of coal reference. Many of us feel immense dismay about the COP26 outcome but within the document it is worth knowing what is in it that is relevant to our local Councils.\nWednesday, 10 November 2021\nCOP26 countries cop out!\n| This hygiene kit isn't working. COP26 still stinks |\nAt COP26 yesterday I went to the UN Environment Programme's Press Conference to watch them present the findings of their 2021 Emissions Gap report. This is where UN scientists get their chance to number crunch the pledges that countries have made to reduce their carbon emissions and see if they have any significant impact on helping achieve the Paris Climate goals. The short answer is a big NO.\nThe panel were pretty scathing. \" There's a leadership gap not an emissions gap\" was damning of the world's political leaders. One particular point they made was countries that were making Net Zero by 2050 statements with no convincing plan to achieve them. Australia being the most obvious example.\nIf (and it is a very big if) we believe all the countries statements produce the emissions then we are still heading to miss both the 1.5 and 2 degree C Paris Climate goals. The UNEP report says we need a 4 fold increase in ambition to reach 4 degrees temperature rise and a 7 fold increase to achieve 1.5 degrees. It is that stark. That is all if they keep to their promises. 7 of the G20 countries are currently 'off track' with their carbon savings so that is to say the least unhelpful.\nWhat now? We have 3 days left. Apparently Boris is coming back to the COP summit. Given a large part of this process is about keeping commitments and trust why does that not fill me with confidence?\nHere's Juice Media's from Australia's take\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1FqXTCvDLeo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\nSunday, 7 November 2021\nUK Government finally implements COP24 - 3 years later\nAt COP24 I was on a mission to get the concept of Locally Determined Contributions (LDCs) accepted by the UNFCCC. LDCs were to give the ability for Local and Regional Authorities to set their own carbon reduction targets in conjunction with Nationally Determined Contributions which are the responsibility of national governments. This would establish a clearer role for sub-national bodies like Councils and Devolved Administrations in taking action to reduce carbon emissions and help towards achieving the Paris Climate goals. I had some excellent support from staff at the EU Committee of the Regions and Locally and Regionally Determined Contributions were backed by the LGMA, the body that represented Local Government globally.\nIn the end we didn't get LDC's adopted but we had moved the debate significantly and there was a statement in the final text on how to assess Nationally Determined Contributions that referred to \"preparing implementation plans to include domestic institutional arrangements, public participation and engagement with local communities”. In the UK context this basically meant Governments would have to work more closely with Councils on action to address climate change. Then (in the UK at least) nothing happened. Councils still had no official role. the UK Government continued to make statements and policy about climate change with no significant involvement with Local and Regional Authorities.\nThe Green Party made one of our goals in the run up to COP26 to push Government to set up a joint Central/Local Government Taskforce to put pressure on Government to act. Then at the end of last month the Government produced their Net Zero Strategy and in it there was a statement saying they would establish a,\n\"Local Net Zero Forum to ensure that there is direct input from local leaders. Chaired by BEIS, the Forum will be cross departmental and bring together national and local government senior officials on a regular basis to discuss policy and delivery options on net zero. The forum will build on our current engagement mechanisms through the representative bodies such as the Local Government Association (LGA), Association for Public Service Excellence (APSE), Core Cities and the Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning & Transport (ADEPT)\".\nSo a Taskforce and a success of sorts!\nI first raised the need for National and Local Governments to work more closely together in Paris at COP21 back in 2015 in a side event where I was representing the EU Committee of the Regions. So my own involvement in calling for something like this degree of cooperation is nearly 7 years old. All that really has happened, with the establishment of the Net Zero Forum is that a structure is now in place so we can have discussions, there is still a lot of actual work to do! Though the Forum will be chaired by BEIS the culture of the Forum should be that all participants come to the table as equals and that it is not dominated by national government. We need initiatives for policy change to be able to come forward from local government. After all it will be councils that will have to deliver a lot of the action needed to reduce emissions so why not allow the practitioners the chance to be the policy makers as well?\nThere is a lot to do. Changes to Building Regulations, a revised National Planning Policy Framework that takes into account climate change, addressing skills gaps and the need for a large scale domestic retrofit programme, all these need serious attention to get us on track towards a genuinely Zero Carbon Strategy for the UK.\nLets get to work!\nSaturday, 6 November 2021\nAnd the award for missed opportunities goes to........ Kirklees Council\nThe word on the street is that Kirklees Council is Award chasing. Don't get me wrong I think it is important that work by some of Kirklees Council's excellent staff is recognised but it would be interesting to see the ratio of awards applied for, how many were shortlisted and how many resulted in winners. Among other things Kirklees Council has recently won Catering Business of the Year which I'm sure is well deserved but if there is a push to chase awards for their own sake that would be worrying\nAnother Council that has received recognition this week is the Green Party /Lib Dem Administration in York. It has been named by the United Nations as a Global Centre of Excellence for high performance buildings - one of 26 around the world to mark COP26 including New York, Pittsburgh and Renfewshire in Scotland. This has been lead by Green Party Councillor Denise Craghill the Cabinet Member responsible for housing and is a recognition of the Councils plans to build an impressive 600 houses to the Passivhaus standard There has been a big push in the Green Party to get action the Passivhaus Standard more widely adopted and I wrote a Passivhaus Flatpack Campaign Pack back in 2016 and around the same time I chaired an All-Party Policy Group at Kirklees Council which in It's final report recommended the following to Kirklees Labour Cabinet:-\nRepeated question on how the Cabinet would respond to the recommendations were met with silence or misinformed myths about the Passivhaus standard. Now 5 years later the Council is carrying out a 12 house pilot project. At the last Council meeting I asked what the point of the pilot was? What will we learn that we don't already know from the now numerous projects around the country and places where they are now working to mainstream the standard. We should drop the pilot and go straight to more ambitious passivhaus projects at scale.",

As well as 4 Kirklees Party Leaders we also\nhad Jason McCartney Tory MP and Tracy Brabin Labour MP there to support our\ncase.\nIt was a strange meeting. We put our case, the Junior Minister and his civil servants silently heard it. They didn’t contradict us or say we were wrong. They just said sorry there’s no money. All the meeting amounted to was just Tea and sympathy only they didn’t offer us any tea.\nIt was a strange meeting. We put our case, the Junior Minister and his civil servants silently heard it. They didn’t contradict us or say we were wrong. They just said sorry there’s no money. All the meeting amounted to was just Tea and sympathy only they didn’t offer us any tea.\nSo what was our\ncase. Simply put because we had taken\nGovernment advice on taking their Council Tax Freeze Grant the Council is over\n£14 million worse off than we would have been. All parties represented here supported taking\nthe freeze grant and no one expected the Government to penalise us for taking\nthat grant leaving us high and dry. But\nthey did.\nSo is it\njust bad luck that we took the grant. Well not so for all councils. Does anyone\nremember last years so called ‘Transitional funding’ for councils - £300\nmillion was made available. This is what some Councils got.\nSurrey -\n£24.1m/ Hampshire - £18.7m/ Hertfordshire - £15.6m/ Essex - £13.9m/ West Sussex - £12.4m/ Kent - £11.4m/ Buckinghamshire - £9.2m /Oxfordshire\n- £8.9m/ Leicestershire - £6.6m/ Cambridgeshire - £6.4m/ Wiltshire - £6m/ Warwickshire - £6m/ North Yorkshire\n- £6m/ Cheshire East - £5.9m/ Dorset - £5.9m/ Richmond upon Thames - £5.8m/ Devon - £5.6m/ Staffordshire\n- £5.6m/ East Sussex - £5.4/ Worcestershire - £5m\nSo how much\ndid Kirklees get?\nZilch, Nada,\nZero , nothing!\nThe need of\nthe leafy Tory Shires was obviously somehow greater than ours.\nSo this year\nTory Surrey comes with the begging bowl again and comes up Trumps again. The\nthreat of a referendum on a 15% Council Tax rise receded quicker that £350million/week\npledge to the NHS post Referendum\nI’m sure\nthey didn’t get a meeting with a nodding hand wringing functionary like we did.\nSo for all\nthose reasons I believe that we should send an invoice to UK Government for\n£14million for taking their advice which has cost the people of Kirklees dear.\nIt stinks\ndoesn’t it? No amount of smoke and mirrors from the Conservative Group can hide\nthe fact that the people of Kirklees have been stuffed by their Government.\nThere will be sound, from them there may even be fury, but we all know that\nsound and fury signifies nothing. Which is why they can offer nothing - no\nideas, no rabbits out of hats. Nothing.\nStill not\nputting a Budget Amendment in which would inevitably expose the lack of options\nKirklees has and the real necessity to raise the Council Tax means the Tory’s\ndon’t have to have anyone go off on Budget Sick Leave. Offering Nothing and\ndoing Nothing except talk.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Now these advice measures, like turning your\nthermostat down 1 degree and only boiling as much hot water as you need etc, will save more money than they used to.

Hundreds of\nthousands, if not millions of people are not going to be in that fortunate position.\nTuesday, 7 July 2020\nPRESS RELEASE Green Councillor proposes making Government Insulation scheme free to all.\nGreen Councillor proposes making Government Insulation scheme free to all.\nKirklees Councillor and Green Party Energy Spokesperson Andrew Cooper has proposed making the scheme free to boost the take up by householders, ensure quality work is carried out and so help reduce fuel bills and carbon emissions.\nCouncillor Cooper said\n\"This scheme falls well short of the Green Party's proposal for a Green New Deal in terms of funding and scope but there are still positive things we can do to improve the scheme announced by the Chancellor.\"\n“When Kirklees ran the free Kirklees Warm Zone project between 2007 and 2011 we insulated over 50,000 homes and it was the biggest scheme of its kind in the country. What really made the scheme fly was the Green Party amendment to the 2007 Council Budget that made the scheme free for all applicants. This is what we should be doing with this scheme.”\n“With the cost of capital borrowing so low at present the Council can use its financial leverage to top up the Government proposal ensuring people don’t have to dip into their pockets during a time of recession and job losses. Really the Government should make the scheme free but in the absence of that Councils like Kirklees and across the Country could fill the gap and make the difference. Existing funding via Regional Sources such as the West Yorkshire Combined Authority could also play a big role in financing such a scheme ”\n“For householders the hundreds they will save oon their energy bills means more money in their pockets at a time of huge financial uncertainty. The impact on reducing our carbon emissions will also be significant,”\n“The involvement of local councils in the scheme will help with local promotion and also provide local accountability helping ensure quality of work”\n“ This level of funding could allow us to carry out insulation work on hard to treat cavity walls, provide external wall insulation, attic room and under floor insulation. It is a huge opportunity if done properly wih a focus on quality work.”\n“ Kirklees has the opportunity once again to be a national Leader in action on Climate Change and show through example what can be achieved with imagination and political commitment. If other Councils follow our lead we could make the scheme free for millions across the UK. “\nThursday, 8 October 2015\nPRESS RELEASE - Greens call for Government rescue package for the Energy Efficiency Industry\n| Mark Group established in 1974 & closed down as a direct result of Tory Government policies in 2015 |\nThe Green Party have called on the Conservative Government\nto provide an immediate rescue package for staff who have lost their jobs in\nthe energy efficiency industry and for a complete rethink of their lack\nof support for green industries.\nLarge long standing energy efficiency companies Mark Group\nand Climate Energy have gone into administration following Government cuts to\nthe Green Deal, an abandonment of Zero Carbon Homes and faltering funding\nthrough the Energy Company Obligation.

And yet actual investments in energy efficiency measures remain very small in comparison to this potential.\nTo achieve the EU objective of a 20 percent improvement in energy efficiency by 2020 (from 1990 levels), the European Investment Bank estimates that EUR 85 billion per year is needed, with EUR 60 billion per year required for buildings alone. The forthcoming EU budget for 2014-20, currently being negotiated, has a vital role to play here for the UK and Europe's other more developed countries as well as the less developed countries.\nThe future budget, expected to total around one trillion euros over seven years, seeks among other things to realise Europe 2020 objectives – supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy in all sectors is paramount in the European commission's budget proposals to date. Backing this up, a figure of at least 20 percent of the total budget for climate change related activities has been put on the table by the commission. More specifically, a doubling of current allocations for energy efficiency and renewable energy to EUR 17 billion has also been proposed under the European Regional Development Fund.\nGiven the scale of the challenges we now face, these figures should be higher – some members of the European Parliament have recently been vocal in calling for this 20 percent 'climate mainstreaming' to be bumped up to 30 percent. Meanwhile, with some of the EU's larger member states, including the UK, pushing for real terms cuts in the future EU budget, there are growing fears that the budget's climate potential could be seriously impaired. Here's why this must not happen.\nKirklees Council in West Yorkshire, where I serve as a Green Party councillor, has been a leading local authority in the UK in addressing fuel poverty and improving the energy efficiency of people’s homes. An insulation programmethat we implemented between 2007 and 2011 offered free loft and cavity wall insulation to all households irrespective of income or tenure. Thousands of homes were insulated and Kirklees is recognised by the UK’s Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) as the council in the UK that has been most successful at insulating its housing stock.\nThe question now for Kirklees and hundreds of other councils up and down the UK is: where next?\nThe UK government's 'Green Deal' that has just been launched aims to improve insulation in 14 million of the UK's leaky homes. However, there is scepticsm from many quarters as to whether or not the Green Deal is fit for purpose. For one thing. the loans offered to improve the energy efficiency of people’s homes under the Green Deal are expected to be offering interest rates at around the seven percent mark, while in Germany similar loans are offered at one percent.\nDavid Kennedy, chief executive of the government's official advisors, the Committee on climate change, has warned of the Green Deal's finance model: “We think there is a significant risk in leaving it to the market, as that has never worked anywhere in the world and is unlikely to happen in the UK.”\nThe Green Deal's unique selling point is that the loans offered to home owners are supposed to be more than covered by the savings made as result of the measures installed. This is called 'the Golden Rule', but more expensive measures such as solid wall insulation will have to be highly subsidised by the utilities through the Energy Company Obligation.\nConsumer resistance to solid wall insulation is expected to be high mainly due to aesthetic reasons. The Golden Rule is not guaranteed, and changes in people’s circumstances or how they use the home could impact negatively (or positively) on savings made. Industry is expecting a slow start for the Green Deal and in traditional loft and cavity wall insulation sectors a downturn in orders and staff redundancies seems likely. Early attacks on the Green Deal from the UK press are underway and will probably accelerate as the scheme is launched.\nThe Green Deal is being introduced at a time when ‘feed in tariffs’ for solar PV and other renewable technologies are being massively cut, leading to a reduction in capacity in the micro-generation sector. It is against this backdrop that the UK's ability to achieve an array of EU environmental targets must be judged.\nWhen asked DECC officials are bullish about being able to hit the EU target for 16 percent of total energy from renewable sources by 2020. The evidence would indicate otherwise, particularly with regard to the renewable heat and transport sectors.\nThere are other avenues, though, to ensure positive action on energy efficiency in the UK materialises – this is likely to occur where local authorities and energy utilities disregard problematic policies such as the Green Deal and instead develop their own programmes. Local authorities have the 'reach' for this. They have access to community networks and to a great extent the trust of their communities as official bodies where people feel they have a recourse if they have concerns.\nEnergy utilities do have funding of GBP 1.3 Billion per year through the Energy Company Obligation, but if matched funding is required to make a scheme fly then local authorities, like many public bodies, are highly constrained both in terms of capital and revenue expenditure.\nThis is where EU funds could really make a difference, bridging the gap between local schemes that lack finance but that nonetheless have every likelihood of succeeding.\nSuch an opportunity has already been grasped in France, where social housing organisations have rapidly deployed 320 million euros of European Regional Development Fund money to improve energy efficiency in existing housing. This European finance triggered investments of 2.2 billion euros, created 15,000 local jobs and has resulted in financial savings of 98 euros per month per household thanks to a 40 percent average decrease in heating costs.\nThe best route for such EU funds at a time of limited budgets would be via a route where councils and energy utilities have to demonstrate the robust nature of their proposals in terms of delivery as the key to open EU funding. High quality, 'deep' renovation proposals are essential here – cosmetic fixes such as replacement windows should be a non-starter.\nAnd the UK could maximise leverage on EU funds to co-finance projects if the UK government sets the EU funding element to cover 75 percent of costs. This will ensure we get more back from the EU on projects that give us a better deal from Europe, and certainly a greener one.\nDesigning such programmes coud be developed in conjunction with the Local Government Association (LGA), the representative body for councils in England and Wales. The LGA is regularly engaging with DECC on government policy and is one of the most informed bodies in the country on the delivery of energy efficiency programmes.\nThese are difficult times for many sectors of industry, but through imaginative links between the EU and local government bodies in the UK, we can produce imaginative and effective programmes that deliver carbon and financial savings while generating jobs and, for many, much needed hope.\nSaturday, 8 September 2012\n‘Canute Syndrome’ – the medical term for climate change denial\n| 'Canute syndrome' - a belief you can go against nature |\nThe real hardcore sufferers though are those in the extreme state of ‘climate change denial denial’ In this manifestation of the condition sufferers deny they don’t believe in climate change but their actions give them away. They cut feed in tariff subsidies to decimate the solar industry, they cut investment in renewable energy projects and champion fracking as a new energy source and call for more gas turbines and a third runway at Heathrow. Would they do this if they really believed in the devastating impact of climate change? Of course not. Crazy as it may seem our own government are sufferers of what I am now calling ‘Canute Syndrome’. King Canute (sometimes spelt ‘Cnut’) is of course the English and Norwegian King who tried to send back the incoming waves from his throne by a beach in Hampshire and got his feet soggy. I fear there are quite a few ‘Cnut’s’ in the cabinet and even more since the reshuffle. Actually Canute is supposed to have been demonstrating his humility before nature and God to his courtiers when he got his feet wet. This is a humility before nature that our current politicians need to demonstrate by their actions or perhaps they should give up their responsibilities and take the treatment they so obviously need in both their best interests and that of the wider planet.\nMonday, 5 December 2011\nFeed In Tariff letters in Huddersfield Examiner\nAnother recent exchange of emails regarding the cut to the solar PV Feed In Tariffs in theHuddersfield Examiner. RJ Bray can be forgiven for taking some of the dubious misinformation from Government and in the papers about the cost of Feed In Tariffs at face value but maybe not on describing me as \"Clr Khan’s friendly Green \". More research required R J! If he'd stuck 'occasionally' in front that would be fine! Anyway here's R J followed by myself\nKIRKLEES Council leader Clr Mehboob Khan’s latest gripe is that money which he hoped to receive for a solar energy panel scheme which were to be fitted to 1,000 council properties has now been cancelled.\nClr Khan’s friendly Green Clr Andrew Cooper told the Examiner that it was a blow to the elderly and vulnerable people currently living in fuel poverty.\nSo does Clr Cooper’s statement mean that there are only 1,000 people in the Huddersfield area living in fuel poverty and all are currently living in council property? I think not.\nCome the cold months myself and her that shall be obeyed will be wearing more layers than an onion has skins due to the criminally high energy prices.\nClr Khan and Clr Cooper I feel would have more credibility if they represented the collective rather than a select few.\nWhy do they not campaign for cheaper energy for everyone or more winter fuel allowance for those in more need?\nInstead, they help create higher energy bills for people by having them fund through their meters the feed-in tariffs for those who have solar panels or wind turbines.\nIn this manner they also put more money into the energy companies’ pockets. In all fairness, is this right?\nAlternative energy will never drive our country forward. It will have the reverse effect and send our country back to the Stone Age.\nIndustry along with our homes cannot be sustained by wind, solar or wave power. It’s a little like a dripping tap into an empty reservoir at the height of summer.\nThe country needs a nuclear project and it needs it now if we are to get away from fossil fuels and be less dependent on gas from overseas. Let’s not forget the madcap carbon capture process that is to get underway at the cost of billions of pounds to the taxpayer along with industry itself.\nMaybe Clr Khan and Clr Cooper could ask for some money from that major worthless project called the European Union which drives these schemes.\nI agree that we must pollute our atmosphere less and giant steps have been taken – but let us remember that this cannot be at the cost of the extinction of mankind, otherwise what has it all been for?\nR J Bray\nShelley\nRead More http://www.examiner.co.uk/views-and-blogs/reader-letters/2011/12/03/examiner-letters-june-2011-86081-29886400/#ixzz1fgGUnGIB\nTo the Editor\nRJ Bray (Examiner 3/12) takes me to task for my dismay over the government cuts to the funding of the Feed In Tariff for solar panels and in particular the suspending of the Council scheme to install solar panels on the homes of 1000 Council Tenants. He says,\n“does Clr Cooper’s statement mean that there are only 1,000 people in the Huddersfield area living in fuel poverty and all are currently living in council property?”\nNo I don’t, but it would be a start to help those people by running such a scheme which could then be expanded later. There are also currently schemes available for private householders where the panels are installed for free and the householders get the benefit of the electricity in return for handing the Feed in Tariff to the installing company. A number of households around Huddersfield have done this already. If he wants details I’ll pass them onto him. Of course not everyone can benefit from this scheme due to the orientation or size of their roof but many can. So the existing policy framework for solar is one which many people can take advantage of but changes by the government threaten its viability for everyone.\nMr Bray says that Feed In Tariffs,\n“help create higher energy bills for people by having them fund through their meters the feed-in tariffs for those who have solar panels or wind turbines”\nThe actual impact of the Feed In Tariff policy on energy bills last year was 30p for the average household. This is less than a penny a week. The cost of a new nuclear power station, which Mr Bray is so keen on, can be a round £4.25 Billion and that doesn’t take into account the decommissioning costs and the costly handling of dangerous nuclear waste. This will have a much more significant impact on energy bills.\nHe asks of myself and Cllr Khan,\n“Why do they not campaign for cheaper energy for everyone”\nI don’t presume to speak for Cllr Khan but for my part I successfully proposed making insulation free for all householders in Kirklees, I was the trustee of a national fuel poverty charity for 8 years and have helped many householders reduce their fuel bills through advice on energy tariffs and by getting information out to householders on a number of ways to help reduce fuel bills. So I don’t believe I’m deficient in wanting to help people reduce their bills.\nMr Bray goes on to say,\n“Industry along with our homes cannot be sustained by wind, solar or wave power.”\nI agree to a point. In addition we are going to need greater levels of energy efficiency in buildings better controls and energy management, district heating systems, anaerobic digestion and a whole host of other actions to make the future of energy supply in the UK more secure. Althis l does rather beg a question why only Malta and Luxembourg in Europe have a worse proportion of their energy generated from renewable sources than the UK. What is technically possible on the continent seems somehow difficult here. The laws of physics are not different this side of the channel but some attitudes, prejudices and opinions among some certainly are.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper - Green Party\nThursday, 21 July 2011\nGreening Calderdale\n| Scholes Farm in Calderdale. That roof's looking a bit bare! |\nAt first glance you might think Calderdale didn't need much 'Greening'. It is indeed a green and pleasant area and a Council I worked for for a while as their Home Energy Conservation Officer. They pioneered universally free insulation for the over 60s regardless of income before any other Council in the country and did so for around 8 years before funding constraints took hold. Calderdale has Hebden Bridge with the Alternative Technology Centre and more 'right on' folk than you can shake a stick (that may be later used as biomass) at. It also has Todmorden which pioneered the food growing revolution that is 'Incredible Edible'. The Council is also doing some pioneering work on new social housing with high Code for Sustainable Homes standards. So there's a lot for them to shout about on the green front but even the more proactive areas have a blind spot and Calderdale's is their Planning Department's approach to solar PV on listed buildings.\nA recent planning application for a solar PV panels on a listed farmhouse at Scholes Farm is a case in point. The applicants wanted to put their panels on a section of roof that was on a new extension to the listed building that could not be seen from the road or particularly easily from anywhere else. Calderdale Planning however reckoned that this was still adversely impacting on the buildings listed status and recommended refusal. All I could imagine that the applicants could have done to make the panels more acceptable to planners would have been to bury them in the garden but this would have rather negated their purpose in life.\n| St James Piccadilly Solar Panels |\nI advised the applicants of their right to ask one of their local councillors to refer the matter to the Planning Committee for a decision rather than be decided by officers. Fortunately the Councillors could see that the interpretation of government planning policy in this instance was not being regarded as an enabling one but in a more restrictive light. Evidence was ably provided by Mr Adam Gillespie of the Energy Saving Trust on behalf of the applicant. The Councillors wisely approved the application.\nSaturday, 16 July 2011\nShepley First School 'Eco Lodge'\nShepley First School has opened a new Eco Lodge for its pupils. It incorporates a solar PV panel, a sedum roof, a mini wind turbine, water recycling and a mini greenhouse to the rear. It was erected by Timberline who have put a case study up on the web.

Kirklees isn't in it! |\nKirklees doesn't do so badly when you look at the solar PV top ten coming in at a respectable 9th with 1 megawatt of installed microgeneration capacity. Much of this will be due to the award winning RE-Charge scheme a Green Party initiative that is now completed and ' A Shade Greener' has done some installs in Kirklees as well. There was a time when we could claim to be producing 5% of the UKs solar PV capacity but not anymore. We can now only claim to have 0.933% of the UK's microgeneration resource.\nSo what are future prospects like for Kirklees in the microgeneration league? There are plans for putting solar PV on a thousand council houses and a lot on Council buildings so this looks good doesn't it? Maybe but procurement rules, as interpreted by Kirklees, seem to be slowing things up and of course other authorities have plans as well - we're not operating in a vacuum. Now RE-Charge is over the Council has no strategy or plans to promote the take up of microgeneration in the private sector at present, but is looking to link in with the Green Deal which is over a year off . There remains uncertainty as to whether or not it will be a compelling offer anyway (see previous posts). Of course if the government imposes its cap on the feed in tariff all plans to increase take up of microgeneration could come to naught.\nReview - 'Behaviour Change and Energy Use' by the Cabinet Office\n'Behaviour Change and Energy Use' just published by the Cabinet Office. It is principally annoying because it presents information on how people and organisations react to exhortations to save energy as if they were startling revelations rather than things that are well known and widely understood in the energy sector. The other annoying element is the way the laudable 10% reduction in CO2 emissions is presented. It states (overstates?), \"The Government has led the way on showing that it is possible to reduce emissions rapidly and cost effectively\". OK its good but government has hardly 'led' on this. The very fact that it has been relatively easy to acheive shows that government must have ben fairly inefficient in the first place. This agenda has been led by local government, which at its best has made significant reductions based on a combination of belief in reducing emissions linked with financial necessity.\nAnother revealing aspect of the report is how it addresses reluctance to take up energy efficiency measures by householders. While praising the Green Deal mechanism they are creating (and which many are sceptical of) it goes on to say \"we also recognise that households may need additional prompts and encouragement in order to overcome their natural inertia\". It then goes on to reveal trials which include incentives such as B&Q and Homebase vouchers and loft clearance services etc. All these trials are based on the lower cost measures not the higher end measures such as solid wall insulation. There is a tacit acceptance that Green Deal on its own is not going to be enough of an attractive and compelling an offer. The other measure mentioned was the possibility of a month's Council Tax 'holiday' for people taking up energy efficiency measures. One question you always have to ask with this government, (which knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing) is 'where is the money coming from?'. The obvious one is the Energy Company Obligation. Its not taxation so will be recycled from our energy bills. That is not my principal concern (though we need to keep an eye on the impact on low income households) The ECO is an increasingly called upon pot in terms of supporting Green Deal with subsidised high cost measures and supporting those on low incomes so if it is to be used as an incentive mechanism then its impact must be transparent and understood. No mention is made in the document about area based approaches to insulation schemes such as Kirklees Warm Zone. It's proven, it works, therefore Government are ignoring it. Because it doesn't fit at all well with the Green Deal, an unproven mechanism requiring additional incentives?\nAnother revealing aspect of the report is how it addresses reluctance to take up energy efficiency measures by householders.

They give people epilepsy, make bats explode, decapitate people, explode, don't work and on and on it goes. These same 'issues' with sometimes a small grain of truth don't tend to arise in Europe where most countries get more renewable energy installed where the laws of physics obviously work differently. Here's one such letter from Dr David Hill who's standing as an Independent at the next election. Interestingly he's anti nuclear as well. My response follows (but it's not quite as long)\nWindmill madness\nI HOPE that Clr Andrew Cooper and all those who believe in wind power took notice of Look North’s recent exposé which showed that over the past two months wind turbines have provided virtually no electricity.\nAdded to this, international studies have determined over the years that, on average, these monstrosities at their maximum only work 23% of the time.\nWhen we consider that international research also determined that these white elephants need completely replacing in less than 20 years from being built (wear-out of components is high), we the taxpayers will have to pay out billions again over the next 20 years to simply keep them going.\nThis strategy devised by the former Labour government and continued now by the present coalition government is sheer madness.\nIt is also remarkable that the so-called wise men of Whitehall, who advise government, are proposing to commit £10bn to the construction of a single nuclear power station.\nThis new station will have major nuclear waste problems in the years to come, most probably costing the taxpayers again another £10bn to get rid of it, and will only provide at the best, 5% of our future electricity needs.\nFor in this respect, a scheme put forward to government for a hydro-electric scheme that would cut shipping costs substantially, has the same cost but will provide the UK with 10% of its electricity needs in perpetuity.\nThis would have been clean energy with no toxic waste and would have lasted forever once built with very little maintenance at all.\nAre we crazy in this country and just like throwing taxpayers’ money away as though it was going out of fashion?\nIt certainly seems that way to me or is it there are some very powerful lobby groups doing very nicely indeed out of this old codswallop?\nThe Green Party should be backing this hydro scheme, not stupid wind turbines that have a bottomless pit and appetite for continual finance.\nOur town planners and Kirklees councillors should take note of all these facts when giving the ‘green’ light to these schemes, as they invariably do!\nBut I have to say that I was happy to see that at least David Brown’s is getting some work out of this stupidity (Examiner, January 8).\nFor if politicians are so stupid to see wind as the Holy Grail, at least Huddersfield is getting something out of it.\nA sane world? I think not when it comes to spending our hard-earned tax.\nIt’s about time our central and local government politicians started to do a bit of their own research for all our long-term sakes.\nDr David Hill\nProspective Independent candidate, Golcar\nDr Hill goes on to say that the Green Party should be supporting hydro power schemes. Actually the Green Party does support large scale hydro and I don’t know why he believes we don’t. Hydro projects can store energy to be released at times of high demand. The truth is that we need a mix of energy sources renewable and non renewable hopefully using the developing carbon capture and storage technologies. Crucially though we need to be wasting less energy and using it more efficiently in the first place.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper\nSunday, 5 December 2010\nSnowlar Panels\nSnow has had a not unexpected impact on my solar panels. A thick covering of snow does not make for a good flow of solar electricity. At lower temperatures photovoltaic panels generally operate more efficiently but as there is less available light during the winter months the benefit of the increased efficiency is negligible.\nAmong the usual letter writers in the Examiner last week was one Bernard McGuin ex Tory Candidate for Newsome. He focussed on my support for renewable energy and the financial subsidies for it. Amongst the ramblings and many inaccuracies (photovoltaics do not heat houses Bernard they create electricity) was the assertion that solar photovoltaic panels need a lot of maintenance. As there are no moving parts and it is a solid state product that's clearly not the case. Some of the first panels installed in Japan 40 years ago, on lighthouses, are still working. Panels do slowly lose efficiency (as all things do) over time but are warrantied for up to 25 years.\nClearly Mr McGuin is no expert but he does have opinions and that's important. So above is my demonstration of some of the maintenace requirements of solar panels\nThursday, 2 December 2010\nsNOw Insulation\nThermal imaging cameras can cost thousands of pounds but everytime it snows we have the opportunity to do a check of how effective our loft insulation is. I went down the street in Newsome today knocked on a couple of doors with clear roofs and referred them to the Kirklees free insulation scheme. Wish I'd tucked my shirt in!\nHere's the Press Release from work.\nhttp://www.yorkshireenergyservices.co.uk/news.html?newsId=48\nSaturday, 27 November 2010\nSupermarket Sweep?\n| Dale Winton of Supermarket Sweep fame. |\nWe need to understand how 'the Golden Rule' will work, which says that any savings made will greater than the cost for paying back the measures. With so many different house types, with different usage patterns, different heating requirements this is going to be a tall order and if the golden rule isn't convincing for all householders whatever their circumstances then confidence in the Green Deal will be severely shaken. The other good news is that Private Landlords could be fined if they don't improve the energy efficiency of their dwellings, with Local Councils being able to penalise them up to £5000 for non compliance.\nThis is all good stuff and credit where its due. I don't however believe that Greg's yet given up on his supermarkets as a major deliverer. Lets hope its not a clean (supermarket) sweep when it comes to who actually does the Green Deal and Local Authorities that demonstrate the capability to deliver also get the opportunity.\nThursday, 14 October 2010\nThe Denby Dale Passivhaus\nHere's a film about the Denby Dale Passivhaus completed this year. I saw it during construction an at its opening and I'm incredibly impressed by the work the groundbreaking work the Green Building Company have done on this project. The estimated heating costs are around £75/year and around £100 for the hot water (though the solar thermal system may reduce that cost). It is of national significance as it uses cavity construction and so could by replicated by the building industry across the UK. The commitment to reducing energy demand through airtightness, super insulation standards and heat recovery ventilation is impressive. Great to see such an important project in the Huddersfield area.\nMonday, 30 August 2010\nZero Commitment\nNews that the 'GGE' (Greenest Government Ever) is watering down the Labour Government's commitment to make zero carbon homes mandatory for new build by 2016 is disappointing. I guess this also means that the commitment to make all new buildings 'zero carbon' by 2019 is also scrapped.here\nThe 2016 target always stood out as an ambitious government aim and you had to ask yourself why a Labour government that was so lamentable on its action to reduce the emissions of existing homes was being so stringent on new properties. Predictably the members of the Home Builders Federation were resistant from the start and increased cost of building for their membership would be a constant pressure to dilute the target. Ironically the feed in tariff for renewable electricity could completely negate the cost of installing solar photovoltaic panels for developers by assigning the tariff to them ( and would provide them with an income to boot). This could also be the same for renewable heat technologies dependent on the outcome of the Renewable Heat Incentive consultation in October. So ironically the 'eco-bling' as its critics call it, the highest cost could cost the developer nothing and indeed make them a profit.\nSo what are we to conclude from all this. Well the government would not be right to water down the Code for Sustainable Homes if anything it should be tightened up. Should we ignore microgeneration as many in the Passivhaus movement suggest? I don't think so, electricity consumption by homes remains an issue and if anything the use of photovoltaics should be mandatory on new build houses and the financial mechanisms that make this possible should be retained. The rumblings are that government is looking again at the tariff levels for the feed in tariff. Let's hope that if they are it doesn't take us backwards.\nThe 2016 target always stood out as an ambitious government aim and you had to ask yourself why a Labour government that was so lamentable on its action to reduce the emissions of existing homes was being so stringent on new properties.

The emphasis on the importance of this in the design has been stressed by proponents of the Passivhaus approach where addressing the need for energy demand during the design and construction phase is paramount. Here in Huddersfield, where else, we are ahead of the game with the Denby Dale Passivhaus. This was constructed for a private owner by the Green Building Company and it has raised serious questions about the governments Code for Sustainable Homes on which the Zero Carbon Standard was to be based. Ironically their property would only acheive a Code Level 3 on the Code for Sustainable Homes because of it's calculation methodology not because of its actual carbon emissions. So to put it clearly, one of the best performing homes in the UK in terms of thermal performance ever would be illegal if the zero carbon homes standard became law but would probably produce less emissions. There's some great resources on how the property was constructed including Bill Butcher's excellent construction diary here.\nSo what are we to conclude from all this. Well the government would not be right to water down the Code for Sustainable Homes if anything it should be tightened up. Should we ignore microgeneration as many in the Passivhaus movement suggest? I don't think so, electricity consumption by homes remains an issue and if anything the use of photovoltaics should be mandatory on new build houses and the financial mechanisms that make this possible should be retained. The rumblings are that government is looking again at the tariff levels for the feed in tariff. Let's hope that if they are it doesn't take us backwards.\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",

The object of the project is to plant 1000 fruit trees across the ward. These trees will bring many benefits to the area including improved landscape quality, improved diets for locals who pick the fruit, (including improved levels of physical activity), additional wildlife habitat for some endangered wildlife species and also reduction in pollution levels.\nPhase 1 involved the planting of fruit trees across Newsome Ward on council owned open green space. Phase 2 will involve 100 apple trees being planted in house gardens across Newsome Ward by the householders. Any Newsome resident will be offered one apple tree at the reduced price of £5. This will also include a tree stake, tree tie and planting /care instruction sheet. The money collected will then be used to provide plants for a proposed herb corridor along a public footpath in the Newsome Ward.\nGrowing Newsome Seed Swap on Saturday 26th March, 10am to 12 noon at Newsome Scout Hall\nto distribute trees and to offer advice to those wishing to take part.\nFor further information on the seed swap visit\nhttp://growingnewsome.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/seed-swap-saturday-26th-march-2011/",

We are proposing that the solar panels would be installed using Housing Revenue Account reserves These are ringfenced funds for Council properties which cannot be legally be used for anything other than the maintenance of Council housing\"\n\" The capital costs of solar panels have come down significantly in recent years making this a more viable proposition. The Feed In Tarrif for solar electricity that a scheme such as this would attract will mean that the costs for the project will be completely paid back within 12 years. Council Tenants would get the benefit of the electricity off the roof. An average 2kWp solar installation would generate at least 1600 units of electricity a year the equivalent of £240 saving off the average electricity bill. For people on a low income this is a very significant saving.\"\n\"What this proposal would mean is that the Council would see a return on its investment within12 years, householders would have cheaper fuel bills and more electricity will be generated from clean renewable sources.\"\nGreen Party Peer Baroness Jenny Jones who was visiting Huddersfield to discuss the project said,\n\"This is a terrific idea.

I fear that this deficit can only be reclaimed from the tax paying residents of Kirklees.\nThis is funding from the Housing Revenue Account RESERVE and as such the proposal does make economic sense and won't have to be funded from elsewhere.\nReplyDelete",

The people managing the blocks now need to rectify the problems identified so Kingfisher Court can be a safe place for people to live in.\nThe relatively new buildings have had a troubled history with some of the student flats appearing as places to stay on Air BnB in contravention of their student status and therefore eligible for Council Tax. There was also some speculation that those rooms may have been used for purposes other than simple overnight stays.\nSo how do we end up with a situation where new buildings end up in contravention of fire regulations? Building Regulations in the UK are privatised. Developers don't have to use the Council's diminished Building Control function. Instead they can get a private contractor to carry out this work who they pay, who may cut corners and not be as stringent on compliance with the rules as they should be. It looks highly possible that this is what has occurred in this case, So with all that been revealed in the Grenfell Enquiry has anything meaningful being done to change the Building Control system? Last years amemdments to Building Regulations certainly tightened things up but in my view Building Control should be re-regulated brought back into the public sector and be properly resourced to ensure safety for residents and strict compliance with Building Regulations. The private sector should never override the public interest ever again.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2009_11_lighting-way_html/content_481.html": "Finding ways of addressing the energy use of streetlighting has been an ongoing theme of the Kirklees Green Councillors over the last ten years. It is a huge issue and represents a significant proportion of the Councils carbon emissions. Early experiments were off grid solar streetlights on Malvern Rise, Primrose Hill. They worked, but they would never replace a standard streetlight in tems of illumination but ideal for places where an electrical connection is difficult. A hybrolight, combining wind and PV power for off grid locations is on a footpath between Close Hill Lane and Towngate is up and running and justified on the basis of the avoided costs of not connecting a long electrical connection. Our first grid connected solar streetlights were installed this year on Edale Avenue and they perform well and are comparable with a standard streetlight in terms of performance. There is an 'however' however and it is to question why have a streetlight connected to the grid which simply acts as a platform for a solar panel why not just stick a load of solar panels on top of a building instead of lots of little ones on top of individual streetlights. I guess the answer to this is to imagine them as part of a very intensively localised energy network utilising all available space to generate the maximum amount of electrical power. That is clearly not where we are at the moment but probably in my ideal scenario is where I would like us to be. Back to the 'here and now' we need to reduce the carbon emissions associated with streetlights quickly.\nThere is a whole agenda at the moment around dimming and turning off street lights in the early hours of the morning in isolated spots say between 2 and 6 in the morning. The other approach is to get streetlights which produce the same amount of light but use less power by utilising LED technology. We have trialled LED Streetlights with a Green Party initiative with 29 columns in the Highfields area of the ward and they are working fine (apart from the one pictured which was on during the day!).\nOur next, more low tech, solution is to put stickers on lighting columns telling people who to ring if the light is on during the day (dayburner) or isn't working at all. I have reported stacks of dayburners over the years to Kirklees Highways but the quicker they are noticed and reported the better and these stickers will help.\nOne last thought. Each year we go through a portion of space littered with dust particles sometimes resulting in spectacular meteor showers. Why not turn off streetlights for a few hours in the late evening/ early hours of the morning on that day, so we can have a free meteor show for the area without the distractions of light pollution.\nOne last thought.

Following newspaper reports and mistakenly leaked documents it has become clear that the Government has plans to halve the Feed In Tariffs for solar photovoltaic panels.\nCurrently people can claim 43 pence for every kilowatt of electricity they generate off their roof but the government now plans to cut this to around 21p from the beginning of December.\nCouncillor Cooper who has solar panels himself said,\n“If people install solar panels now before the cut is due to take place in December then they will get the 43p rate for the next 25 years if they were to install them after that they would get less than half that.”\nI recommend that people get three quotes from local companies. You can save significant amounts of money by comparing the prices of installers. A list of installers in our area can be obtained from the Yorkshire and Humber Microgeneration Partnership website www.yhmp.org\nYou should make sure your contractors and the components they install are registered under the Microgeneration Certification Scheme. All companies on the www.yhmp.org website should be.\nIt is also worth checking the warranty period on the solar panels and the inverter which converts the DC electricity from the panels into the AC electricity that we use in our homes. You can get warranties of over 20 years for solar panels but it can vary more with inverters.\nIf you can’t afford the capital cost of solar panels then there are companies that will install them on your house for free. They claim the feed in tariff and you get the benefit of the electricity generated of the roof saving you around £150 - £250 per year depending on the number of panels you have and the current cost of electricity. One such company is A Shade Greener who are based in Tankersley www.ashadegreener.co.uk another is Home Sun www.homesun.com\nCommenting on these cuts Councillor Cooper said,\n“These cuts by the government are nonsensical. Over 25,000 people are employed in the solar industry and these cuts are a threat to them. The cost of the Feed In Tarrif is very small less than 50p/year on the average fuel bill and a fraction of the cost of government subsidies of nuclear power stations. As always it is those on the lowest incomes who will suffer the most. This cut will jeopardise free solar schemes for people unable to afford the upfront costs of solar panels and planned schemes for council tenants properties which are self funding under current Feed In Tariff arrangements but may not be following the proposed cut. The government’s claim to be the Greenest Government ever is looking increasingly hollow and lacking in substance.”",

Councillor Derek Hardcastle said,\n“For Shepley to put forward a convincing case to Kirklees to transfer the building to the community it will need to demonstrate that it has secure funding to maintain the buildings plus costs for water, gas, electricity, cleaning, waste removal costs etc. We will propose that at the Parish Council’s annual budget meeting the Council agrees an amount to be set aside for that purpose. This would help to provide a sustainable long term future for the Library.”\nCouncillor Robert Barraclough said,\n“I would like us to put aside this money over a full four year term of Kirkburton Parish Council and seek to ensure that this becomes a ring fenced element of the Parish Councils budget for future years\"\nContact:- Robert Barraclough – 07778 315577 Derek Hardcastle – 07779 628147\nOn behalf of the Shepley community I can only thank Councillors Robert Barraclough and Derek Hardcastle for all the work they have already done for the village and this latest proposal will certainly make our efforts to secure the future of Shepley library and building more sustainable. We are very fortunate to have a wealth of experience and skill in our village as well as a strong feeling of community however we are more than aware of the challenge ahead of us.\nReplyDeleteThese are trying times but they are also times for great opportunity for small rural groups.\nAndy Scott - Chairman Shepley Village Association",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2017_05_andrew-cooper-green-party-leader-speech_html/content_173.html": "The Democracy Commission Report is significant and its recommendations\ncan take this council further forward with our engagements with local citizens.\nThere are however some real missed opportunities that could have made this\nreport even more far reaching than it is.\nThere are 4 areas I’d like to\nhighlight which I guess form my minority report.\nProportional\nRepresentation for Local Elections\nIn Scotland they have just had their local elections using\nthe tried and tested Single Transferable vote method where the percentage of\nvotes more closely align with the number of elected Councillors. Proportional Representation. This fairer\nsystem doesn’t favour particular parties it favours the electorate and their\nwishes. So under a First Past the Post System in Scotland at the last elections\nall but 3 MPs came from the Scottish National Party whereas in the local\nelections that they have just had the number of Cllrs elected reflects the vote and\nbizarrely one of the beneficiaries of this system was the Conservative Party\nwho would have had far less representation in the traditional archaic electoral\nsystem we have for local elections in England. I’ll leave that there and to be\nfair it was always a non starter as a recommendation sensible though it would\nbe.\nOther potential recommendations should have been less\ncontroversial.\nLocal Elections every\n4 years\nAs Commissioners it was our role to go where the evidence\ntook us and the vast majority of it said that all out elections every 4 years\nwere good for the governance of public bodies like the Council. Of course there\nis concern about how accountable this makes us politicians but there lots of\nprecedents for elections every 4 years e.g. County Councils, the Greater London\nAssembly, Scottish Local Authorities, Doncaster Council, Rotherham Council and\nour own Government. This Council can be in a state of almost constant electoral\nwarfare. No sooner have we finished one election than we start another.\nDifficult decisions that need to be made due to financial pressures get fudged.\nWe need to be able to present a programme to citizens for a four year term so\npeople can really judge how well their council is over a reasonable amount of\ntime. Local elections every four years could become event not the usual trek\nfor the faithful few to the polling station. This is not one of the recommendations\nbefore you and in my view it is a shame.\nReducing the number\nof Cllrs\nAnother recommendation that is not here is to reduce the\nnumber of Councillors. Some good arguments have been put as to why we need to\nmaintain the number of Councillors we have and to be fair I agree with those arguments.\nSo what is the proble?m. Well I also agree that we should not be cutting funding\nfor roads. I also believe that we shouldn’t be shutting Libraries. I firmly\nbelieve that many of the 1000s of people that have left the Council’s\nemployment were doing a good job and I think perfectly good arguments could\nhave been made to keep many of them. The problem is that our budgets have been\nslashed hugely by the Government. We need to demonstrate to show the public\nthat elected representatives share the organisations pain. It is about giving\npeople confidence that we as Councillors don’t regard ourselves as untouchable\nor insulated from harsh realities\nHuddersfield Town\nCouncil\nThe last thing I’ll mention is not specifically excluded\nfrom the report and that gives me hope and that is establishing a Huddersfield\nTown Council. Next year will be the 150th Anniversary of the founding\nof the County Borough of Huddersfield and it would be marvellous if we could\nmake some real progress to establishing a new council for the area. Town\nCouncils have recently been established in other areas. They have access to\nfunds we don’t. By their nature they are closer to the people and have a\nstronger local connection by their very nature. As Kirklees considers the abolition\nof district committees, as funding is cut back we need to provide people with hope\nand show them that there is a plan to not simply manage decline from Kirklees\nCouncil but find new forms of democracy that they can identify with, be part of\nand know is on their side.\nTogether these 4 proposals would provide a radical and I\nbelieve popular change to Democracy in Kirklees that would capture local\npeoples imagination, trust and enthusiasm\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Could webcasting have saved the site from development? |\nSaturday, 13 August 2011\nThe Wrath of Khan\nThe last Full Council meeting saw Kirklees Council Leader Mehboob Khan attack the new Green Party Administration in Brighton in a response to one of the many planted questions he'd arranged for the meeting. His answer was riddled with inaccuracies and lies but I guess everyone has there own leadership style. If you want to follow the actual point in the meeting in the webcast it begins about 35mins 30 seconds in (my reaction to Cllr Khan's comments can't quite be made out on the webcast fortunately!)\nThe crux of his case was that the Green Party in the run up to the local elections had promised that cuts were unnecessary and wouldn't happen if they were elected. So I drew the Kirklees Webcast to Brighton Green Party's attention and Councillor Jason Kicat had the following comment to make,\n\"Cllr Khan is speaking complete nonsense. We never pledged not to increase council tax and we have never pledged not to implement a legal budget. He should be asked to withdraw such rubbish.\nWe pledged to resist cuts to maximum extent legally possible. Furthermore the council has an ongoing value for money (efficiency) programme which actually over-delivered last year and is continuing this year.\"\nYou do wonder whether Cllr Khan's comments are part of a general fear about the Greens in the Labour Party. At their next Conference in Liverpool they even have a fringe meeting entitled \"Green to Red: How can Labour stop the Greens spreading?\"\nOf course Cllr Khan's 'wrath' is because we didn't join with the other parties in voting for extensive cuts to adult social care (which they have now been forced to backtrack on for legal reasons). He doesn't seem to recognise that for some of us voting for cuts to services for the most vulnerable when bankers get off scot free is a matter of principle and conscience. He may regard voting on the basis of your beliefs as a luxury or an indulgence. I believe by opposing the cuts we provided a greater service to politics as a whole by ensuring that people in the most difficult circumstances felt supported and that they had a voice.\nKhan Plots his revenge. \" He tasks me\"\nThe crux of his case was that the Green Party in the run up to the local elections had promised that cuts were unnecessary and wouldn't happen if they were elected.

You know it makes sense!\nIts come round to the Total Politics blog Awards again. If you fancy voting for Greening Kirklees I'd appreciate it. If you don't that's OK too. It fits into the 'Green' and 'Councillor' categories. Here's the link\nTuesday, 9 August 2011\nWalking the walk\n| My preferred mode of travel |\n\"Fact of the evening (according to Cllr Khan at least): #Green Cllr Andrew Cooper has four cars #doastheysaynotastheydo\"\nIt's difficult to work out who to be more annoyed with, Cllr Khan for lying or Cllr Blanchard for repeating it.\nThe truth is that we have only one car in our household and went down from 2 about 2 years ago and have never had more than that. Also I generally don't use it as I either walk to Huddersfield or use the train or very occasionally the car if I need to go somewhere where I'd need a car or to trasport something heavier than I could carry any distance. I also use City Car Club if I need a car but my better half needs ours.\nMy advice to Cllr Blanchard would not to necessarily believe everything Cllr Khan says nor to repeat it without checking it out first. He could also have a look at Cllr Khan's car. Very nice and flashy with a personalised number plate.\nPermit Parking – Kirklees to propose £30 charge\nKirklees Councils proposal to charge households £30 for their parking permits is likely to adversely affect households in the Springwood, Highfields, Aspley and parts of Primrose Hill. Previously households got their parking permits for free. Over 8000 homes are expected to be asked to pay and it seems that smaller and lower income households could feel the impact.\n£30 is not a lot of money for some people but if you are a pensioner on a fixed income or receive income support then it is effectively another tax on you at a time of rising food and fuel prices. For many people a parking permit is not even a guarantee that you can park on your own street as particularly in the Springwood area contractors and people working on behalf of Kirklees often take up these spaces. Though many low income and pensioner households may not have a car they value the permits to use for family and friends who come to visit them.\nIf Kirklees were to make concessions to low income households, as we would want them to do, this would reduce the amount of revenue the scheme would generate thereby making charging as a policy less viable. For that reason we want Kirklees to scrap the idea of introducing a charge for parking permits for all households.\nBefore any proposed charge is introduced all 8000 permit parking holders will have to be consulted by letter and allowed 21 days to respond. These responses will then have to be considered by Kirklees Cabinet.\nThe Liberal Democrats are also opposing permit parking charges currently in the Lindley area but were in favour of them during the budget process which set the wheels in motion on this proposal.\n£30 is not a lot of money for some people but if you are a pensioner on a fixed income or receive income support then it is effectively another tax on you at a time of rising food and fuel prices.

Having just read his article, he's saying the same things.<br /><br />He may be right about the relatively low return on investments (i.e. actual cost per kWh) and he's certainly right that investing in insulation will make a bigger difference, but you're already doing that!<br /><br />Even in the cloudy north of the UK, over the long term, the panels will save more CO2 than is used in their production and are worth installing. Also, increased sales should reduce costs and improve efficiency: over around ten years while installation of PV solar panels was subsidised in Japan, the price of the panels halved. After they stopped the subsidies, prices leveled. Now they have reintroduced subsidies.<br /><br />The main point, as you say, seems to be the energy generating democracy and the effect on energy awareness. <br />David Mackay, (according to www.withouthotair.com) found the biggest impact on reducing his energy bill was recording how much energy he was using!Mark Brierleyhttps://www.blogger.com/profile/14160330762632065005noreply@blogger.comtag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7196059482061221339.post-19865271415063574262010-03-08T15:08:08.336+00:002010-03-08T15:08:08.336+00:00Try to get this on CiF as a free-standing article,...Try to get this on CiF as a free-standing article, Andy!Ruperthttps://www.blogger.com/profile/04334135270533978426noreply@blogger.comtag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7196059482061221339.post-68325383985353475592010-03-05T07:19:14.235+00:002010-03-05T07:19:14.235+00:00These was a bit of false start with micro CHP uni...These was a bit of false start with micro CHP units a few years ago and a commercial unit never quite got off the ground. There is however the new Baxi Ecogen Unit which shows a lot of promise and seems to be being brought to the market having gone through some rigorous field trials. I've been to the factory where they are being produced and they are scaling up for a mass market product. Currently it retails at around £5000 but I would expect that to come down significantly over the next 18 moonths or so.

When we first came here, 20 odd years ago, we would pass the Silvasol solar company on the way into town which I always gave me a warm glow as I went off in search of tapas. When it began it would have focussed mainly on solar thermal but now PV is of course a big part of the business. Further into town is a company called Ecoforest that sells and installs wood pellet biomass boilers! I say bizarrely but the temperatures can drop below shirt sleeves standards for a few months of the year so having even a wood pellet stove can be an of value for occasional heating during the winter months. The solar story in Spain is a mixed one with solar energy having received a lot of Public investment but now it is being taxed as part of the Spanish Government drive to search for new sources of income in difficult economic times.\nInsulation is still an issue even here. As we know thermos flasks keep liquids hot OR cold. The same principle applies to buildings and for those self builders out here with cash a 'Thermo Casa' home with high insulation standards which limit the need for air conditioning is an option. I wonder how far off Passivhaus standards they are and those standards would best apply in a hot climate?\nOne of the most interesting articles for me was about the grants that the Spanish Government makes available to householders carrying out energy efficiency (2000 Euros) or conservation works (4000 Euros) for homes built before 1981. This is at a time in the UK where funding to support the Green Deal loans has been cut as well as Government support for the Green Investment Bank. Clearly even in an economy which is generally regarded as weaker than the UK for Spain energy efficiency is still a higher priority.\nThe final story which gave me pause for thought was one about putting pigeons on the pill. Pigeons often regarded as flying vermin and we have issues in Springwood and the Town Centre with hundreds of the birds doing what they do all over the place. The town of Badia Del Valles in Barcelona reckons that contraceptive laced feed will cut the pigeon population by 80%. Not sure what I think about this yet but worth investigating.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

My headtorch lit up various parts of the woodland but I couldn't hear or see the headtorches of the others I had been with 15 minutes earlier. Then I saw the eyes gleaming back at me. The fact they were a foot off the floor and the faint silhouette made me think dog but definitely not a chihuahua. Then I saw another pair of gleaming eyes about the same height but this time with a shadowy person shaped figure. He called the dogs to him and I felt a bit more secure as he put their leads on. I thanked him continued along the woodland path and emerged from the woods at Manor Estate in my shorts, fluorescent coat with my bulging bin bag and litter picker in hand. I was somewhat relieved to know where I was and worked my way back down Kings Mill Lane to meet the others at the other entrance to the woods.\nSo what was I up to in the woods late at night? \"Well Officer it's like this.......\" Actually I wasn't doing a reinactment of 'The Blair Witch Project' or anything untoward I was in fact doing good things with Goodgym Huddersfield.

They convey meaning, intent and in these strange days, even occasional understanding. So when one of the right wing groups on the ENVE Commission of the EU Committee of the Regions sought to change the word 'higher' to 'ambitious' with regard to the emissions targets in the work plan for the Commission that dealt with Energy, Environment and Climate Change the alarm bells started ringing.\nThe word they wanted rid of was 'higher' the one they wanted to replace it with was 'ambitious' with reference to the targets agreed to address climate change at COP 21 in Paris. Currently as signatories to the Paris Climate agreement the EU (and the UK) are signed up to a 30% reduction in carbon emissions but democratically elected MEPs in the European Parliament have been calling for a 40% reduction. So another 10% at least is higher. Of course if you want to replace the word 'higher' with the word 'ambitious it rather implies that you don't want it to be higher. Ambitions vary from individual to individual and from nation state to nation state. One state may have limited ambition another much greater BUT you can't dodge the reality of the science and that says we need to be striving for much higher reductions in emissions than is indicated in the Paris Climate Agreement. Those calling for 'ambitious' targets were really seeking to protect the status quo of the existing economy. The problem is that current levels of emissions supporting our polluting economy are ecologically unteneable. We need to develop a new clean economy based on renewable energy , demand reduction and energy efficiency. That is where the real ambition lies.\nI and others made the case to retain the word 'higher'. We had a vote. We were successful.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

In the case of the UK our NDC made no reference to the work being undertaken by Local Authorities to reduce emissions. Efforts at the local level such as improved building standards beyond building regulation, installing LED street lights, planting trees to capture carbon emissions etc were simply not measured or taken into account in those national contributions and therefore not valued. A system of Locally Determined Contributions would change all that and allow Local and Regional Authorities to determine their own targets with robust plans to acheive them.\nThere is of course a strong relevance here to those in the United States who are opposing the Trump Administration's abandonment of the Climate Agreement. Many States are already forging ahead with carbon saving plans despite Trump but an agreed system of Local and Regionally determined Contributions gives structure and legitimacy to their action based on an international agreement.\"\nSo what is it like at a Global Climate Summit?\nI'm here at the COP23 Climate Summit in Bonn and I thought I'd try to convey to you what its like.\nThe first thing to say is that it is huge. There are over 20,000 people who are registered delegates for this event from all round the world so there is a very diverse and sometimes colourful array of people attending. The venue is essentially a huge rigid tent like structure with halls , meeting room, restaurants all connected\nby corridors. The number of events is dazzling and you have to pick what you can go to\ncarefully.\nI got an invite to a screening of Al Gore's new film 'An Inconvenient Sequel' with the man himself speaking afterwards which was a must do.\nThere is of course all the events around Summit of Local and Regional Leaders which have been my focus as part of my push for 'Locally and Regionally Determined Contributions. I've also done a number of media interviews which of course is a key reason to be here and to get the message across. There are a number of exhibition areas where national\ndelegations and NGOs have stands in big halls. Occasionally you'll meet someone you know as you travel between venues and catch up before you move on to the next thing. It is interesting, its different and big opportunity to make contacts and increase your knowledge on the biggest\nchallenge facing humanity.\nFor me getting something tangible out of this unique experience is what its all about. Only a few hours to go to find out if that's been acheived.\nFriday, 10 November 2017\nCOP23 Bonn - Preview Video on Locally Determined Contributiuons\n#COP23 where @clrandrewcooper will put the case for #Local and #Regional determined contributions in the fight against #ClimateChange @EU_CoR @europeangreens #EUlocal pic.twitter.com/YGeEJBw41Q— EA group - CoR (@EA_CoR) November 10, 2017\nMessage of support to Kirby Misperton Protection Camp from COP23\nA message of support to Kirby Misperton Forward Protection Camp from #COP23 pic.twitter.com/pr6YBAnsDh— Andrew Cooper (@clrandrewcooper) November 10, 2017\nSaturday, 4 November 2017\nPRESS RELEASE - Green Councillor to take on Trump at Bonn Climate Change Talks\n| Councillor Andrew Cooper |\nGreen Party Councillor Andrew Cooper is attending the COP23 Climate\nChange Talks in Bonn, Germany next week and he has a plan to tackle the Climate\nChange Denying US President, Donald Trump.\nAndrew is a member of the UK Delegation to the EU Committee\nof the Regions that represents the views of Local and Regional Governments in\nthe European Union. At a meeting of the Committee last month he successfully got\nthis European Institution to back a policy that would give Councils and\nRegional bodies the ability to contribute directly towards the Paris Climate\nChange targets without referring to their National Governments.\n“Currently all action to reduce carbon emissions goes\nthrough National Governments through a system of ‘Nationally Determined\nContributions’.” said Councillor Cooper “My proposal is to establish Locally and\nRegionally Determined Contributions where Councils and bodies below National\nGovernments could establish their own targets and produce plans to implement\nthem.”\nNow Councillor Cooper’s initiative has been passed at the\nEuropean Level, the EU Committee of the Regions is taking it as one of their principal\nproposals to the COP23 Global Climate Talks in Bonn this month. Councillor\nCooper will be attending the Summit of Local and Regional Leaders and will seek\nto get the policy inserted into the Summit Declaration.\n“Adopting this policy will provide a way for State Governments\nin the USA to produce plans to reduce carbon emissions without seeking the\npermission of their President. We cannot allow the illogical and unscientific\napproach taken by President Trump to go unchallenged. This is a way he can be side stepped and give those politicians who take a rational approach in the USA\nthe policies they need to make the action they take at the local level count\ntowards international climate change targets.”\nCouncillor Cooper also explained the benefits of the policy\nfor Councils in the UK\n“This proposal is also very relevant to us in Kirklees.\nAction we take at the local level, such as mass insulation schemes,\ninstalling LED Streetlights or tree planting projects would not currently be\ntaken into account in the UK Government’s Carbon Reduction Plans. Under my\nproposal any action we take to reduce carbon emissions would be taken into account and make it\neasier to achieve our challenging targets to reduce global greenhouse gases.”\nThe Climate Summit of Local and Regional Leaders will be\nheld on 12th of November with the Summit Declaration being announced\nat the end of the day.\nENDS\nA Briefing Note on\nLocally Determined Contributions\nEU Committee of the\nRegions backs Local Targets on Climate Change\nContact\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper – Mobile - 07721 348619 Email – andrew.cooper@greenparty.org.uk\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",

What really made the scheme fly was the Green Party amendment to the 2007 Council Budget that made the scheme free for all applicants. This is what we should be doing with this scheme.”\n“With the cost of capital borrowing so low at present the Council can use its financial leverage to top up the Government proposal ensuring people don’t have to dip into their pockets during a time of recession and job losses. Really the Government should make the scheme free but in the absence of that Councils like Kirklees and across the Country could fill the gap and make the difference. Existing funding via Regional Sources such as the West Yorkshire Combined Authority could also play a big role in financing such a scheme ”\n“For householders the hundreds they will save oon their energy bills means more money in their pockets at a time of huge financial uncertainty. The impact on reducing our carbon emissions will also be significant,”\n“The involvement of local councils in the scheme will help with local promotion and also provide local accountability helping ensure quality of work”\n“ This level of funding could allow us to carry out insulation work on hard to treat cavity walls, provide external wall insulation, attic room and under floor insulation. It is a huge opportunity if done properly wih a focus on quality work.”\n“ Kirklees has the opportunity once again to be a national Leader in action on Climate Change and show through example what can be achieved with imagination and political commitment. If other Councils follow our lead we could make the scheme free for millions across the UK. “",

Pretty fair to say that they were embarrassingly rubbish and reflected the time and effort I put into achieving those grades. Me and my mate Jim Griffiths often arrived late back at Greenhead College following a heavy drinking and pool session at The Grove Pub. The Grove then wasn't the real ale emporium of today but had chemical Stones bitter on tap (not hand pulled) at 50p/pint and a pool table. We'd arrive back for History or English late and end up having to skip out for an emergency pee after half an hour or so. So the results shouldn't have been a surprise. I was offered North Staffs Polytechnic to study Politics and International Relations or North London. I opted for Stafford. In Stafford I discovered the beer was an amazing 45p/pint. Fortunately half way through my degree I took 3 years out to work for the old Liberal Party as a Political Agent. I went back as someone with more knowledge of life and with a greater appreciation of the value of education. I still went to the bar but I spent a lot more time in the library and put much more effort and thought into my work. I ended up with a 2.1 and a First in my dissertation. So A level grades didn't define me, nor do they necessarily dictate your path in life. It is just important that young people are given many routes to achieve their personal goals and have a good chance of a happy and fulfilling life be that through education or work or vocational training or whatever and at different points in their young lives.\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Yet it undoubtably is.\nThe first solar panels were for water heating and were installed in Council Housing in Kirklees on Tolson Crescent in Dalton in 1995. 8 properties were helped but in retrospect it was a poorly conceived project and I was responsible. 6 of the properties were flats with pensioners living in them with very low hot demand and as the Estate Management Officer at the time I sourced funding from Kirklees Environment Unit to get them installed. Half the Councillors in Kirklees at the time traipsed through the tenants houses feeling their sun sourced hot water. Another 7 properties were installed the following year at St John's Avenue in Newsome (pictured) as Labour's attempt to show there was no need to vote Green. As I remember I was specifically not required for the photocall on that occasion. Though I was the project manager I was also the Green Party's Campaign Organiser and that didn't endear me to the Labour administration of the time.\nThere followed a bit of a lull until 2000 when we established the Renewable Energy Fund and since then it has been project after project. In Newsome Ward alone we have a multitude of projects including Primrose Hill Solar village, around 120 properties with solar PV and some solar thermal, Castle Grange Residential Home with 10kWp of solar PV, the new Hillside School with a range of renewables, Croftlands with 30 or so properties with PV, Civic Centre 3 with 18kWp on the roof, Lowerhouses Junior and Infants also has a small pv system and not forgetting our solar street lights on Edale Avenue. With the RE-Charge scheme that we established for private householders taking off we have another 15 or so PV systems going in soon along with PV going in on the Edale Avenue sheltered block.\nIt is all exciting stuff and with the Clean Energy Cashback coming in next year we should be in for another boost. I have proposed a £5 million project to use the new feed in tariff to fund the capital outlay of purchasing and installing the photovoltaic panels. This will effectively mean we will be able to install as many solar panels on Council buildings as we like for free with no impact on the Council Tax. All we need now if for Government not too muck up the legislation and we will be fine. I also have to think of a name for the scheme. Ideas welcome.",

Halifax is where I grew up. So I asked friends and\nfamily if they had any unwanted items and then went on sales sites. I contacted\na few friends to help me collect things and then take them to Halifax. We also filled 2 trollies at Asda and took\nthem down. In the past I have been helped by others in difficult times so this\nwas my way of giving back. Walking through Elland it broke my heart seeing\nfamiles homes destroyed and lots of belongings in gardens covered in mud and\nwater.

The added bonus is that it is made in Holmfirth a couple of miles away. It is connected to our thermal store as is our gas boiler and solar thermal system. It also has a hot plate on the top so we can cook on it if the mood takes us. So though we have a stone built edwardian house it's carbon emissions should be pretty low.

The Green Party with our 130 or so Councillors is linked with the Independents on what was the Local Government Association. Yesterday's Programme Board had an interesting agenda which was, as you can imagine, dominated by the impact of the Coalition Government's cuts agenda.\nThe first major item was on Investment and Growth and the demise of the Regional Development Agencies. The area I highlighted was the increase in the interest costs of prudential borrowing for Councils. Just as Government is saying to the banks that they should make it easier to lend money (and are largely being ignored) Government itself is raising the costs of public sector borrowing making it more expensive to get economic regeneration projects off the ground.\nThe next area we looked at was the localisation of Council Tax. One possible impact is that adjoining boroughs could have differing policies on Council Tax Benefit. This is clearly bonkers and inequitable and not in the least fair. The reality however may be that there is so little financial flexibility anyway that varying policies may become more difficult but peraps not in Dorset!\n| Wot no Bus! |\nThe first major item was on Investment and Growth and the demise of the Regional Development Agencies.

I did wryly point out that the cuts in funding to the PTEs will mean less subsidy for rural and off peak services. These are the very services that many pensioners use and as such the opportunity for them to take advantage of free public transport might be more limited anyway. Less public transport , less concessionary fares. So perhaps this is a well thought out Government policy!\nSunday, 16 January 2011\nWindmill Madness\n| An Industrial scale wind turbine ! |\nMisinformation is rife from the foaming mouth brigade when it comes to wind turbines. They give people epilepsy, make bats explode, decapitate people, explode, don't work and on and on it goes. These same 'issues' with sometimes a small grain of truth don't tend to arise in Europe where most countries get more renewable energy installed where the laws of physics obviously work differently. Here's one such letter from Dr David Hill who's standing as an Independent at the next election. Interestingly he's anti nuclear as well. My response follows (but it's not quite as long)\nWindmill madness\nI HOPE that Clr Andrew Cooper and all those who believe in wind power took notice of Look North’s recent exposé which showed that over the past two months wind turbines have provided virtually no electricity.\nAdded to this, international studies have determined over the years that, on average, these monstrosities at their maximum only work 23% of the time.\nWhen we consider that international research also determined that these white elephants need completely replacing in less than 20 years from being built (wear-out of components is high), we the taxpayers will have to pay out billions again over the next 20 years to simply keep them going.\nThis strategy devised by the former Labour government and continued now by the present coalition government is sheer madness.\nIt is also remarkable that the so-called wise men of Whitehall, who advise government, are proposing to commit £10bn to the construction of a single nuclear power station.\nThis new station will have major nuclear waste problems in the years to come, most probably costing the taxpayers again another £10bn to get rid of it, and will only provide at the best, 5% of our future electricity needs.\nFor in this respect, a scheme put forward to government for a hydro-electric scheme that would cut shipping costs substantially, has the same cost but will provide the UK with 10% of its electricity needs in perpetuity.\nThis would have been clean energy with no toxic waste and would have lasted forever once built with very little maintenance at all.\nAre we crazy in this country and just like throwing taxpayers’ money away as though it was going out of fashion?\nIt certainly seems that way to me or is it there are some very powerful lobby groups doing very nicely indeed out of this old codswallop?\nThe Green Party should be backing this hydro scheme, not stupid wind turbines that have a bottomless pit and appetite for continual finance.\nOur town planners and Kirklees councillors should take note of all these facts when giving the ‘green’ light to these schemes, as they invariably do!\nBut I have to say that I was happy to see that at least David Brown’s is getting some work out of this stupidity (Examiner, January 8).\nFor if politicians are so stupid to see wind as the Holy Grail, at least Huddersfield is getting something out of it.\nA sane world? I think not when it comes to spending our hard-earned tax.\nIt’s about time our central and local government politicians started to do a bit of their own research for all our long-term sakes.\nDr David Hill\nProspective Independent candidate, Golcar\nDr Hill goes on to say that the Green Party should be supporting hydro power schemes. Actually the Green Party does support large scale hydro and I don’t know why he believes we don’t. Hydro projects can store energy to be released at times of high demand. The truth is that we need a mix of energy sources renewable and non renewable hopefully using the developing carbon capture and storage technologies. Crucially though we need to be wasting less energy and using it more efficiently in the first place.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper\nSunday, 9 January 2011\nThoughts on 2011\n| Labour off the hook due to the short memories of many. |\nLabour appear to have got 'off the hook' with many people which is odd given they introduced tuition fees in the first place against a manifesto promise. Many appear to have the memories of goldfish where Labour is concerned and of course we'll never know what the alternative universe would be like if Labour had won the General Election but I reckon it would have still been a slightly different but still the unpalatable cocktail of cuts that we are experiencing right now.\nSo now we head into May, the local elections and the Alternative Vote Referendum. This I think was the Lib Dems single biggest error during their coalition agreement negotiations. The inequities of the first past the post electoral system are well known. Governments can be chosen by a minority of the electors and most constituencies are 'safe seats' so it is only the votes in a minority of constituencies that decide the election. This is not a matter for a referendum it is about what's right. Either the Tories should have simply agreed to a system of proportional representation or there should have been no deal, this should have been a 'red line' for the Lib Dems. Instead we have a question on an inferior version of 'PR' on offer which is acually not even proportional. A binding agreement to support the introduction of the Single Transferable Vote was what the Lib Dems should have insisted on. Of course we need to back the improvement that AV offers in the referendum but it's association with the increasingly unpopular Lib Dems might ironcallly work against it in the ballot. The word 'fair' has been so contaminated and misused by this government that valuing 'fair' votes and been seen to be rewarding the Lib Dems by supporting AV might not sit well with many people. I mean how do we feel about putting the duplicitous Nick Clegg in a position of power after the next General Election? Though electors may have the memory of goldfish where Labour are concerned I don't believe they are going to forget the broken Lib Dem pledges for a long, long time.\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",

Could webcasting have saved the site from development? |\nWebcasting council meetings has been a very successful initiative that was originally proposed in a\nGreen Party motion to Council a few years ago. The\ncouncil certainly took its time implementing webcasting but we now regularly have hundreds of people logging on and seeing how their elected representatives are acting on their behalf. To a large extent they see it warts and all. Full Council and Cabinet meetings are webcast but not Planning Committee meetings. We have recently had some interesting and controversial items at Huddersfield Area Planning Committee such as the proposed developments of housing and a data centre at Lindley Moor. No doubt many people would have logged on to watch if it were possible. I guess the Councils main concern is that webcasting may aid applicants who appeal to the Secretary of State against decisions that are made against them. If those decisions were made on the basis of flawed logic, dodgy arguments and didn't show Councillors in a particularly good light then that is something the Council might not want displayed for all to see. My own view is that if we are to see standards rise then transparency through webcasting of Planning meetings can only make things better. If meetings aren't webcast then the only option for many who want a 'live feed' will be to follow those 'tweeting' from the Council meeting and you would certainly lose a lot of the drama and nuances e.g. the rapturous applause from the public for Cllr Khan as he supported building on Lindley Moor at the last Planning Meeting. Okay that's not the reaction he got, but if meetings were webcast you'd know that for sure!\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

As you\nwould expect it is a mixture of good and less good and areas for improvement.\nThat is the point of the exercise. There’s praise in the report for the Chief\nExecutive and the Council Leader and recognition for the ambition in the\nHuddersfield Blueprint. There are also observations and suggestions for changes.\nOne of the most perplexing statements in the report for me\nwas this one,\n“ The Cabinet and senior leadership team work well together,\nhowever sharper delineation of roles between Cabinet Members and senior\nofficers needs to be articulated as there is some confusion between the roles\nof Members and officers. Members should develop policy and officers should\nimplement and deliver it.”\nTalk about stating the rather obvious! What could have\nprompted such a statement. Perhaps things like when senior officers do the media and TV\ninterviews particularly when there is bad news. It also indicates to some\ndegree that there is a lack of political direction in the cabinet or parts of\nthe cabinet. This is worrying. People go to a lot of trouble to get elected So if and when they are and they don't have an agenda and are simply officer lead it is disappointing and a waste of peoples valuable votes.\nThe action to address this point that the Council has decided to take makes no reference to the Cabinet at all and instead defaults to addressing the relations between all members and officers. This is wilfully and conveniently misinterpreting the recommendation from the Peer Review Team.\nAnother part of the report states that\n\"The business community is keen to work with the Council and its voice needs to be strengthened as currently they feel outside the tent.\"\nI guess this may reflect the poor communication that many indoor market traders feel they have had regarding their future in the Huddersfield Blueprint. Or perhaps the creation of One Huddersfield and the excellent work they do is partly a reflection of the need for business to develop a stronger voice when dealing with the Council. Of course there is a danger that if you have a \"We know best\" approach you are by your very nature going to exclude all sorts of people, businesses, Councillors from other parties and anyone who disagrees with you. Maybe the statement in the Report that says there is a\n\"outmoded paternelistic approach which the peer team heard still exists in some parts of the organisation\"\nis a big part of the problem and if that is reflected in some Senior Politicians then that is a cause for concern and stands in the way of us being a modern forward thinking Council that is open not only for business but for fresh ideas and approaches.\nThe Peer Report also asked us to review our electoral arrangements\n\"Consider reviewing the electoral cycle to bring it in line with councils that have adopted a longer, more stable electoral pattern with the strong leadership model\".\nThe UK Government has a 5 year cycle (usually!) North Yorkshire County Council has 4 year electoral cycle, many Principal Councils have a 4 year electoral cycle, our Parish Councils have a 4 year electoral cycle but not us. I appreciate the arguments made about accountability to electors but former leaders and Chief Executives of this Council have identified the continual cycle of annual elections as a barrier to good and sometimes difficult decision making. I also think we will have better quality elections if we have them every 4 years. Parties will be able produce manifestoes that demonstrate a programme of activity that could seek radical and positive change. Timidity and risk averse decision making would be less likely. As the report says\n\"The peer team identified a lack of risk appetite in the Council, which could constrain the Council’s pace and ambition. A bolder approach to risk and opportunity is required throughout the organisation and existing governance processes should be strengthened to support this.”\nSo my suggestion would be that we establish as well as the Corporate Risk Register we already have a Corporate Opportunities Register where we systematically look at the opportunities that this Council could take to put up front to Councillors showing what we could do if we had the capacity and political will to do so.\nThe action to address this point that the Council has decided to take makes no reference to the Cabinet at all and instead defaults to addressing the relations between all members and officers.

Predictably the members of the Home Builders Federation were resistant from the start and increased cost of building for their membership would be a constant pressure to dilute the target. Ironically the feed in tariff for renewable electricity could completely negate the cost of installing solar photovoltaic panels for developers by assigning the tariff to them ( and would provide them with an income to boot). This could also be the same for renewable heat technologies dependent on the outcome of the Renewable Heat Incentive consultation in October. So ironically the 'eco-bling' as its critics call it, the highest cost could cost the developer nothing and indeed make them a profit.\n| The Denby Dale Passivhaus |\nSo the real question is around the thermal performance standard of new build housing, the insulation, the airtightness, the recovery of heat through ventilation. The emphasis on the importance of this in the design has been stressed by proponents of the Passivhaus approach where addressing the need for energy demand during the design and construction phase is paramount. Here in Huddersfield, where else, we are ahead of the game with the Denby Dale Passivhaus. This was constructed for a private owner by the Green Building Company and it has raised serious questions about the governments Code for Sustainable Homes on which the Zero Carbon Standard was to be based. Ironically their property would only acheive a Code Level 3 on the Code for Sustainable Homes because of it's calculation methodology not because of its actual carbon emissions. So to put it clearly, one of the best performing homes in the UK in terms of thermal performance ever would be illegal if the zero carbon homes standard became law but would probably produce less emissions. There's some great resources on how the property was constructed including Bill Butcher's excellent construction diary here.\nSo what are we to conclude from all this. Well the government would not be right to water down the Code for Sustainable Homes if anything it should be tightened up. Should we ignore microgeneration as many in the Passivhaus movement suggest? I don't think so, electricity consumption by homes remains an issue and if anything the use of photovoltaics should be mandatory on new build houses and the financial mechanisms that make this possible should be retained. The rumblings are that government is looking again at the tariff levels for the feed in tariff. Let's hope that if they are it doesn't take us backwards.",

My brief was well, 'brief'. I was told that I would be talking about transport policy. There was to be Lord Lucas (not Lucan mores the pity) down the line from London who would talk about the fact that Councils are wanting to charge more for parking tickets and about the possibility that in addition to the cuts that Councils could be asked to repay millions in parking fines due to poorly painted yellow lines and incorrect signage. This is just what we need more money taken off councils when we're being asked to make huge swingeing cuts. I was to come in after the Lord when they widened it out to a more general discussion about transport. In reality there was very little time for that and I just made the link between this policy and the lack of revenue Councils had for jobs and services following government cuts. As I wandered home towards the station after the interview I realised the line I wanted to say,\n\"Don't you realise that Councils have to raise these fines and cut jobs and services for local people. I mean otherwise how are the banks going to be able to afford to pay some of their staff huge bonuses if we were to tax them instead.\"\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Previously households got their parking permits for free. Over 8000 homes are expected to be asked to pay and it seems that smaller and lower income households could feel the impact.\n£30 is not a lot of money for some people but if you are a pensioner on a fixed income or receive income support then it is effectively another tax on you at a time of rising food and fuel prices. For many people a parking permit is not even a guarantee that you can park on your own street as particularly in the Springwood area contractors and people working on behalf of Kirklees often take up these spaces. Though many low income and pensioner households may not have a car they value the permits to use for family and friends who come to visit them.\nIf Kirklees were to make concessions to low income households, as we would want them to do, this would reduce the amount of revenue the scheme would generate thereby making charging as a policy less viable. For that reason we want Kirklees to scrap the idea of introducing a charge for parking permits for all households.\nBefore any proposed charge is introduced all 8000 permit parking holders will have to be consulted by letter and allowed 21 days to respond. These responses will then have to be considered by Kirklees Cabinet.\nThe Liberal Democrats are also opposing permit parking charges currently in the Lindley area but were in favour of them during the budget process which set the wheels in motion on this proposal.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

There had been concern that\nDECC had on occasions implemented relevant policies (such as changes to Feed In\nTariffs) with little or no consultation with Local Authorities. I made 2\ncontributions on the proposed shared statement between DECC and LGA. One to\nacknowledge that Councils had been the instigators of many of the leading\nenergy efficiency projects that have occurred in recent years and that it is they and\nnot central government that have the expertise and experience to deliver action\non climate change.. Another point I made was that simply reducing local\nauthority estate emissions on its own was not enough. If this was achieved\nsimply through the sale of old energy inefficient buildings this and not\nthrough improvements to the existing stock this would not necessarily mean any\nreductions in carbon emissions in the area just a transfer of those emissions\nfrom the public sector to the private sector.\nDEFRA are to hold a\nFlytipping Summit in July. One proposal on their agenda is to encourage\nCouncils to exempt farmers from costs for disposing of flytipped materials.\nThis proposal is fraught with difficulties. A small minority of unscrupulous\nfarmers could effectively run illicit waste disposal businesses at no cost to\nthemselves. There is also the question as to why should we exempt farmers as\nopposed to any other private landowner and why should cash strapped local\nauthorities shoulder the cost of disposing of this waste. We should be\nfocussing on the problem of flytipping not letting one particular group off the\ncosts of paying for it. This proposal from DEFRA looks like an unworkable non\nstarter.\nThe ongoing welfare\nreforms was another contentious issue on the agenda. The proposed benefits cap,\nthe size criteria for under occupied rented housing and benefit payments no\nlonger go to private landlords but straight to tenants all seem designed to make\nlife more difficult for those on low incomes and to generate more homeless\nfamilies and suffering. Government seems to have developed these policies believing there is a mass availability of\nalternative cheap accommodation in other areas and that households would be\nable to move many miles to find a job in another area with cheaper\naccommodation. The broad thrust of this\nwas that households in London and the South East would move from the\novercrowded and expensive south to the cheaper North where there are apparently\nlots of jobs. Clearly a policy not in\nany way related to the real world.\nI informed the meeting\nthat I had been in touch with Councillors in Calderdale asking for feedback on\nissues arising from the recent floods in\nmy capacity as the Chair of the LGA’s Inland Flood Risk Working Group.\nTodmorden, Mytholmroyd and Hebden Bridge were badly affected by the recent\nfloods and I am keen to ensure our contacts with DEFRA on flooding issues are\ninformed by real life experiences from people and communities affected.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Just to recap, there was a by-election last month in the Golcar Ward which the Liberal Democrats won after promising to \"Stop Labours Gridlock\" in Milnsbridge, or so it said on the signs said which they plastered all over the lamp posts. Of course it would cost millions and one thing Kirklees has got a lot less of is millions, so it was never a realistic option. Say the Council were to pay for a bridge, what services would be cut to pay for it. Shamefully the Labour Party and the Conservatives backed a feasibility study into the unfeasible bridge during the By Election campaign. I tried to put a bit of 'realism' into the debate by calling for a monorail from Scapegoat Hill through Golcar, Milnsbridge and into Huddersfield. My tongue was firmly in my cheek as I asked for something even more unfeasible than what all the other parties were asking for. Bizarrely Conservative Leader got up and insisted his Party were the first to think of a monorail.\nIt will be interesting to see what the Lib Dems put in their Council budget proposal in February on this one. If their government were to restore Council finances perhaps the Lib Dems could have a bridge.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

As usual no Party had an overall majority on the Council. In fact no single Party had even a third of the seats. Labour were the largest Party following the election with 24 out of 69 Councillors and they put their leader forward to lead the Council for the next four years. The Conservatives with 19 Councillors did not put a candidate before the Council to lead Kirklees and instead, and bizarrely nominated the Leader of the Liberal Democrats with 20 Councillors forward. What was bizarre about this was they hadn’t even asked her before the meeting whether she was willing to be put forward and of course she wasn’t. It was just some strange political game being played out.\nSo the Labour leader Mehboob Khan was the only one put forward. His term is supposedly for 4 years but local elections and votes of no confidence could conceivably bring that date forward as could Cllr Khan’s promise to submit himself for re-election before the Council each year despite their no longer being any legal requirement for him to do so.\nSo the only option put before the Councils was a Labour leader. The four Greens on the Council backed the Labour leader on the basis that we would work together on protecting the local economy as much as we could from the effects of the recession.\n(The picture is from Star Wars and is Garven Dreis who narrowly missed blowing up the Death Star and was shortly after killed by Darth Vader. And the relevance is? His callsign is 'Red Leader'.

Ballot papers are out and we'll know next month who will be the public face of the Green Party. In reality we are expecting Caroline Lucas as our sole Westminister representative to remain a key 'go to Green' for the media, but our new Leader and Deputy will still have a significant profile and media role.\nThe contest has been pretty good humoured and the leadership candidates have all conducted themselves well through the process. Many activists have had an opportunity to form informed views of the candidates style and abilities. Politically there is very little between them even though some lay claim to 'unique' positions. In reality when you look at what they're saying their uniqueness is the language they use and the particular badges they choose to wear when seeking to attract a particular constituency of support.\nThe real differences between leadership candidates is in the tone that they use and in how accessible their approach will make them to the wider public. We should not appear to be so strident that we could almost be speaking a foreign language to many electors and even to many members of the the Green Party. As a Party we can be earnest, intelligent and worthy but if we appear to lack the common touch and a sense of humour we will fail to resonate with the wider electorate. Our strength is when we are down there with the people, standing shoulder to shoulder with them in difficult times and doing it with confidence and a smile, in the sure and certain knowledge that we are on the side of the angels. If you have gone through difficult times it gives your words an undeniable authenticity and from that you gain the natural authority that a Leader needs. It is this approach that will give us the confidence we need to give others hope, to show them another path which puts people and planet before the political establishment and profit.\nThe Green Party was originally called 'People' even before it was the 'Ecology Party'. We have got to show that we are the 'People's Party' because such a poltical force is so desperately needed . That is why I have voted for Peter Cranie.\nI have read through some of the information about the candidates, and based on personal knowledge of them. I will probably be voting for Pippa, vibrant, different, could stir things up, and not more of the same. I like her not left not right but forward. Richard Mallendar for deputy, decent bloke always willing to listen, an important attribute!\nReplyDeleteAbsolutely right , the Green Party has to show itself as being the \"People's Party\". I switched from Labour because it ceased to be and joined the GP becuse it is.\nReplyDeleteAs you indicate amongst other qualities ,the Leader ought to have a common touch, & a sense of humour to resonate with the wider public.\nI believe both Romayne and Peter project this.

We have two grown up children and one new grandson. I have been\nChairman of the local NFU Branch and served on the NFU County Executive\nincluding through the Foot and Mouth crisis. I am passionate about promoting\nlocally produced food and have managed projects to promote it across the\nregion. I have served on Kirkburton Parish Council for Farnley Tyas,\nThurstonland and Stocksmoor Ward since 2007, have been re-elected twice. I was\nelected as Parish Chairman for the 2010/11 Municipal year.\nHow long have you\nlived in the area?\nI have lived and worked in Farnley Tyas all my life, and was,\nuntil my retirement from farming, a third generation farmer in the village. My\ngrandfather first moved into the village to become landlord of the “Golden Cock”\npublic house, moving away, to return in the 1930’s to take on Beech Farm. My\nfather succeeded him and took on the tenancy until his death in 1981. I then\ntook on the farm at 32 years of age and ran a successful dairy and mixed farm\nuntil 2003.\nWhy the Green Party?\nI’ve always worked close to nature being a farmer and I have\nwatched the seasons and weather patterns change. I feel that the Green Party\nstarts from a different place and isn’t left, right or even centre. There are\npeople who wrongly see the Green Party as ‘sandal\nwearers’ or politicians who would take us to living back in caves. I\ncertainly don’t fit that stereotype! I’ve seen that Greens can work\nsuccessfully alongside business and innovators on practical and worthwhile\nventures that make the world a better place.\nHow did you feel when you were\nfirst elected as a Councillor in 2011?\nBemused! I’d worked alongside local Councils and been a\nParish Cllr for 5 years but it was a big step up and a steep learning curve at\nfirst on Kirklees. However I quickly got up to speed with how you make things\nwork on Kirklees and what is and what is not possible. I’m not afraid of hard\nwork and I enjoy a challenge so it has been and continues to be, a rewarding\nand enjoyable journey.\nGetting the trust of local residents across a wide range of political\npersuasions and widely differing backgrounds. I know a lot of my personal\nsupport doesn’t come from people who traditionally vote Green but people who\nknow I will try my best and give a straight answer to a straight question.\nHaving been self-employed\nfor almost all my working life I know the value of a Pound and I am acutely\naware of the need to get best value whilst protecting essential services. I can\nwork constructively with Councillors from all political parties and council officers\nto try and limit the damage resulting from cuts and communicate these changes\nto residents in a politically unbiased way.\nWhat do you think\npeople want from the person they elect as their local Councillor?\nFirst and foremost people want their local Councillor to be\nhonest and approachable. They want someone who has an ability to get things\ndone but to be realistic about what can be achieved. People don’t want\npoliticians to make false promises and not to play party political games that\ninsult peoples intelligence.\nWhat difference does\na Green Party Councillor make?\nI don’t feel I am constrained by a national political agenda,\nnor am I asked to tow the party line. We have a small, but influential, group\nof Councillors who are committed to working locally to protect local services in\na time of government cuts. We try to think ‘outside the box’ and to innovatively\nsolve problems. The easy thing to do is just to oppose all cuts and not offer\nany real solutions but Greens are prepared to work across all political groups\nand engage with whoever is running the Council at the time. If you don’t take\nthis approach you can find yourself in a powerless position and just shouting\nfrom the sidelines.\nWhen you aren’t\nworking in the community or attending Council meetings how do you relax.\nI’ve still got my tractors and some equipment and it’s a\nreal pleasure to get out ploughing and driving for one of my fellow farmers\nduring the Summer months. I’ve always read a lot and in any spare time and\nlately taken to political autobiographies of ‘all political flavours’.

It is\nsimply replacing a remote Westminster politican with a remote individual who is\nsupposed to represent millions of people which they cannot. When mayoral models\nhave been put before local people in referenda before they have rejected. Now\nit is proposed to impose a Mayor on West Yorkshire without a referendum.\nThe Mayoral Combined\nAuthority – Some members are more equal than others\nThe proposed West Yorkshire Combined Authority will have 11\nmembers. 5 of these members will most likely be the Leaders of the constituent\nCouncils. These will be Councillors who have been elected by the unfair first\npast the post electoral system unlike the WYCA mayor. Having members of the\nsame body elected by different electoral systems is bizarre and perverse. The 3\nadditional members will also be Councillors elected under the first past the\npost system but these places will be allocated on the basis of the number of\nCouncillors in political groups on the constituent councils not on the basis of\npopular share of the vote. We believe that West Yorkshire should have an Assembly\nlike the GLA in London elected by Proportional Representation. If it is good\nenough for London why not West Yorkshire?\nThe 3 additional constituent council members on the Mayoral\nCombined Authority appointed for political balance should be referred to as\n“Second Class Members” as their support is not required to pass the Mayor’s\nSpatial Development Strategy, the designation of land for a Mayoral Combined\nAuthority Area, the compulsory purchase of land, decisions that could incur a\nfinancial liability on a constituent council or any matter pertaining to the\nMayoral Combined Authority’s Constitution. Using the same logic the 5 members\nappointed by each constituent Council should be referred to as “Premier Class\nMembers” as their support is required to approve the above matters.\nAll Councillors need\nto be represented on the Mayoral Combined Authority\nOver 8% of elected Councillors in West Yorkshire are from\nparties other than Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats. All these\nCouncillors are members of the LGA Independent Group. Current proposals would\nmean that these Councillors and the communities they represent would have no\nrepresentation at all on the Mayoral Combined Authority. Provision should be\nmade on the board to represent all groupings represented by LGA Political\nGroups including the LGA Independent Group which consists of Independent and\nGreen Party Councillors. We propose an additional member for political balance\nto ensure Councillors who are members of the LGA Independent Group, and\ntherefore the people who vote for them, are represented.\nThe proposals for 2\nDeputy Mayors are undemocratic\nThe proposal for the Mayor to be able to simply appoint a 2\nPaid Deputies is undemocratic and will most likely be given to ‘Party worthies’\nas a form of patronage. If it follows the model of the West Yorkshire Police\nand Crime Commissioner the Deputy Mayors positions will attract an allowance of\nat least £50’000/year with no democratic mandate. The Leader of Kirklees\nCouncil has stated at a Kirklees Scrutiny meeting that a Deputy Mayor position\nwill be taken by a Leader of one of the Constituent Councils. There is no\nreference to this in the Governance Review.\nMayoral Compulsory\nPurchase and Development Area powers should need approval of a meeting of the\nconstituent Full Council\nThe Mayor will have the power to compulsory purchase land\nwithin each Combined Authority area and set up Mayoral Development areas.\nBefore any of these powers are put into effect they should require the approval\nof a vote in Full Council in the constituent Council affected.\nAs with the Compulsory Purchase powers we strongly believe\nthat proposals to establish a Mayoral Development area should also require Full\nCouncil approval.\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer transport functions and new transport related\nfunctions to a West Yorkshire Mayor and mayoral combined authority?\nDisagree\nAdditional Transport\nfunding should simply be passed down to each Constitutent Council\nGovernment should simply devolve the additional funding for\ntransport related functions to Local Authorities anyway without requiring the\nestablishment of a new undemocratic Mayoral Authority.\nTransport funding\nshould not be used to support higher carbon emissions\nThe West Yorkshire Combined Authority is currently proposing\nthe use of funding for transport functions to support the expansion of Leeds\nBradford Airport. This is inconsistent with the Zero Carbon Agenda the\nAuthority is currently signed up to. We would need a commitment from the\nMayoral Combined Authority to not fund transport projects that increase carbon\nemissions when we should be reducing them.\nThe Key Route Network proposed could involve the\nestablishment of new roads encouraging car use and destroying valued green\ncorridors. This would also be inconsistent with WYCA’s commitment to have a zero\ncarbon economy by 2038.\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer skills and employment functions to a West\nYorkshire mayoral combined authority?\nNeither agree nor\ndisagree\nThe important thing to recognise here is that this is not\nnew money and the Mayoral Combined Authority will have no control over the\namount of money invested in West Yorkshire for skills and employment functions.\nWe strongly believe that the funding that is passed down\nfrom central government should play a key role in supporting the skills needed\nfor the Zero Carbon Economy Agenda.\nQuestion 4\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer housing and planning functions to a West\nYorkshire Mayor and mayoral combined authority?\nDisagree\nPlanning decisions\nshould be taken at a local level\nWe believe that planning decisions are best taken at a local\nlevel not by a remote Mayoral Combined Authority and as such we would want any\nplanning decisions to require the support of the Planning Authority of the\nrelevant constituent Council and be put before them for debate and decision.\nThe Mayoral Combined\nAuthority should be able to suspend the ‘Right to Buy’\nOne function we would like devolved to a local level is the\npower to suspend the Right to Buy scheme. We have seen a massive reduction in\nCouncil Housing at a time of high demand for income particularly for the\nmillions left behind in the policy push over the last 40 years towards home\nownership. Not everybody can own a home and we need a secure affordable option\nfor the millions who cannot. Suspending\nor preferably abolishing the Right to Buy would boost the business case for\nCouncils wanting to build new affordable homes.\nThe power we need is\nto insist on higher energy efficiency standards for buildings\nThe Mayor will not have powers to insist on higher building\nstandards in the region such as Passivhaus for all new build. This would be\ncompatible with WYCA’s stated commitment to a Zero Carbon Economy by 2038 but\nis a power that we won’t have.\nWe need a 2030 Target\nfor the West Yorkshire Zero Carbon Economy\nWe strongly believe that the Mayoral Combined Authority\nshould set a new, more ambitious target for a Zero Carbon Economy by 2030 in\nline with report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange Repor . This would help support our argument for stronger housing and\nplanning policies either at the local or regional level.\nQuestion 5\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer Police and Crime Commissioner functions to a\nWest Yorkshire Mayor?\nStrongly oppose\nPolice and Crime\nfunctions are even more unaccountable under the Mayoral Combined Authority.\nThe abolition of the Police and Crime Commissioner role is a\npositive in that it is a role that has not excited interested the electorate\nand takes away from rather than adds to local democratic accountability of the\nPolice. The appointment of a highly paid unelected Deputy Mayor to lead on the\nPolicing function however just makes matters worse and will undoubtedly put an\nunelected politician in a role where the people scrutinising them will have a\ndemocratic mandate (albeit through FPTP) but they will not.\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer additional finance functions on a West Yorkshire\nMayor and mayoral combined authority?\nStrongly oppose\nNo taxation without\nadequate representation and scrutiny.\nOur opposition to these additional powers is due to the lack\nof a suitable democratic mandate as we have detailed in our answer to question\n1 and the lack of suitable scrutiny and powers to limit the powers of the Mayor\nby a democratically elected Assembly.\nThe power to charge a precept for policing would mean that\nthe funding gained could be the responsibility of an unelected functionary.\nQuestion 7\nAre there any\ncomments you would like to make that you do not feel you have addressed in your\nresponse?\nWhat about the\nchallenge of Climate Change?\nThe West Yorkshire Authorities Governance Review document\nhighlights the major challenges to the sub region. It includes growth,\nproductivity, diversity, innovation and trade but Climate Change is not\nidentified as a challenge bizarrely. The self-declared target of having a Zero\nCarbon Economy in just 18 years time is a significant challenge but it is\nconcerning that it has not been included here. For the record the Green Party\nbelieves that our target should be 2030 not 2038 in line with the evidence from\nclimate scientists.\nWhat about a\nresilient economy?\nAnother significant challenge highlighted by the COVID19\ncrisis is the need for a resilient economy that is less affected by global\nfactors such as international trade, the money markets and financial speculation.\nA more resilient economy would have an emphasis on local\nproduction for local need, more locally owned and managed businesses trading with\neach other ensuring money remains within the regional economy. This is not\nidentified as a significant challenge and therefore cannot be regarded as a\npriority by the Mayoral Combined Authority. This is a major weakness in the\nGovernance Review Document",

There are over 20,000 people who are registered delegates for this event from all round the world so there is a very diverse and sometimes colourful array of people attending. The venue is essentially a huge rigid tent like structure with halls , meeting room, restaurants all connected\nby corridors. The number of events is dazzling and you have to pick what you can go to\ncarefully.\nI got an invite to a screening of Al Gore's new film 'An Inconvenient Sequel' with the man himself speaking afterwards which was a must do.\nThere is of course all the events around Summit of Local and Regional Leaders which have been my focus as part of my push for 'Locally and Regionally Determined Contributions. I've also done a number of media interviews which of course is a key reason to be here and to get the message across. There are a number of exhibition areas where national\ndelegations and NGOs have stands in big halls. Occasionally you'll meet someone you know as you travel between venues and catch up before you move on to the next thing. It is interesting, its different and big opportunity to make contacts and increase your knowledge on the biggest\nchallenge facing humanity.\nFor me getting something tangible out of this unique experience is what its all about. Only a few hours to go to find out if that's been acheived.\nHope you managed to get the agreement you were looking for.\nReplyDeletePeter",

I would challenge Government to ensure we are recognising loss and damage in our response to climate change. I would seek dialogue with representatives from the global south through my links with the international organisation ICLEI (Local Governments for Sustainability).\n- Protecting workers and communities through a just transition from a fossil fuel-dependent economy to a low-carbon, nature-rich, circular economy, including delivering over 42,000 new jobs.\nThe groundbreaking ‘One Million Green Jobs’ proposal by the Campaign against Climate Change showed us how addressing the climate crisis will deliver meaningful, worthwhile and rewarding jobs. There is a lot to do and the amount of retrofit work needed to buildings in West Yorkshire could easily generate 42,000 jobs. The opportunity is so much greater though, improving our public transport and active travel networks, enhancing biodiversity in communities, tree planting, establishing nature based solutions to heavy rainfall events. The role of the Mayor is to ensure investment is directed to deliver those jobs but also to provide the training and skills needed. There are things we are going to have to stop doing e.g. building new roads, widening roads, airport expansion so it is vital that we replace jobs from sectors that are incompatible with a stable climate with ones that are. There is more than enough to do.\n- Introducing policies and measures that ensure new development is net zero carbon and existing homes are brought up to high energy-standards and addressing fuel poverty.\nOne of the flagship policies in my bid for the West Yorkshire Mayoralty is the Green Building Fund where I will seek to ensure that all public sector procured or influenced projects are built to the Passivhaus Standard or equivalent. I will establish a fund that will support an uplift in expected capital costs by 5% to cover the expected additional costs of building to that standard. I have proposed such a policy on Kirklees Council for several years but have met opposition from the Labour administration who have exaggerated the capital cost uplift by wrongly referencing the costs of one off projects to seek to justify their opposition.\nI have a strong record on initiating projects to retrofit homes and initiated the UKs first free insulation scheme, the award winning, Kirklees Warm Zone in 2007. There are strong plans being developed by WYCA looking at the challenge of retrofitting existing buildings. What is lacking is a convincing offer to householders to invest in whole house solutions to reduce their emissions. I will ensure funds are available for a Green New Deal Demonstrator Project that will be used to show Government the value of HS2 levels of investment in large scale retrofit projects. It will demonstrate positive health outcomes of living in warm homes, alleviation of fuel poverty, putting more money back in the pockets of the community and out of the pockets of the big energy companies. I have a strong record in addressing fuel poverty in my previous career as an Energy Efficiency Advice Centre Manager and as a Trustee of the fuel poverty charity, National Energy Action for 6 years.\n- At\nleast doubling public transport use, cycling and walking within the next\n10 years, to cut emissions and ensure everyone can breathe clean air.\nSupporting active travel is something that I would want to\nsee a huge expansion of. The West Yorkshire Carbon Pathways report indicates\nthe need to expand cycling by 8000% but at present travel for cyclists is often\ndangerous so we need to invest more in dedicated and protected cycle lanes so\nwe can expand and democratise cycling. I would also want to support the\nexpansion of e-bikes and would seek financial mechanisms to make the purchase\nand rental of e-bikes more accessible to more people. I would also want to\nsupport projects like the Queensbury tunnel to give more and safer options for\ncyclists.\n- Powering the city region with clean, renewable energy, reaping the economic and job opportunities that this brings.\nWe have to start planning for clean energy production by reducing the demand for energy through efficiency measures. This has to be at the top of our plans as it gives us more choices, more cost effectively than a simple predict and provide approach.\nI would want to see the return of Solar PV and other renewable technologies as mass market options for the majority of householders during my first term as West Yorkshire Mayor. I would establish a revolving loan fund enabling householders to install renewable technology in their home by accessing a preferential loan based on a second charge on the value of a property. This would effectively mean no upfront costs to the household and the loan being paid back to the fund upon sale of the property. This is based on the Kirklees RE-Charge scheme I initiated in Kirklees which was the winner at the British Renewable Energy awards in 2008. With the Mayor being unable to reintroduce a feed in tarrif this is the next best option to kick start the household renewable sector. Beyond households I would seek to establish Mayoral Development Areas in conjunction with local Councils to build solar farms and wind farms. I would also seek a relaxation on the constraints on wind development in local planning.\n- Greening the city-region by increasing tree cover, protecting nature, and eliminating green-space deprivation.\nI am an enthusiast for promoting tree planting and have initiated a small scale tree planting project in my role as a Kirkburton Parish Councillor. The 1000 fruit tree project engaged communities across the Kirkburton Parish in planting fruit trees in their own community and was taken up by village associations and schools. There are great opportunities to integrate tree planting programmes with wider climate education and engagement with young people. Ensuring tree cover is included as an integral part of any urban regeneration schemes will be a stipulation and condition of Mayoral funding.\nI have a proven track record of promoting tree planting projects and in 2019 proposed a 150,000 tree planting project over Kirklees which unfortunately was not accepted by the Labour administration. I will ensure that any Mayoral Development Area that may be designated is not on redesignated greenbelt on greenfield land. The focus will be on the regeneration of brownfield land.\nI am shocked that WYCA funded schemes like the widening of the A629 at Edgerton in Huddersfeild is going to see 126 mature trees removed. Schemes such as this I would simply not support.\nI am keen that biodiversity gain is achieved for all developments we make and that the ecological crisis we face is addressed as well as the climate crisis by protecting habitats and creating new ones.\n- Becoming\na zero-waste city-region by 2030 without relying on landfill or\nincineration, to reduce pressures on nature from resource extraction and\npollution.\n- Calling on the local government pension scheme to divest from fossil fuels, to stop profiting from environmental harm.\nI have been calling on Labour Councillor representatives on the West Yorkshire Pension Fund Investment Panel to divest from fossil fuels for many years but have met resistance. I have worked with divestment campaigners and will continue to do so. Apart from the environmental reasons to divest there is also the very real possibility that they could become stranded assets lacking any significant value. So there are good financial reasons to divest from fossil fuels as well. As West Yorkshire Mayor I would give my wholehearted backing for the WYPF divesting fully from fossil fuel investments.\n- Opposing the unsustainable growth plans for Leeds Bradford Airport and joining with Metro Mayors across the country to ensure regional airports keep within carbon budgets.\nI watched hours of the Leeds City Council Planning Committee\nwhen sadly they decided to pass Leeds Bradford Airport Expansion Plans. I am\npleased that some Cllrs on the Leeds Planning Committee including my Green colleague\nCllr David Blackburn voted against expansion but sadly they were not in the\nmajority. I have raised the issue at Kirklees Council meetings trying in vain\nto get the Leadership of the council to come out against the proposals. As West Yorkshire Mayor I will not back any\nproposals that support Leeds Bradford Airport expansion and I am happy to try\nand make expansion of Regional Airports an issue on all Metro Mayors agendas",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2010_10_oil-glass-is-half-empty_html/content_223.html": "This week saw the publication of 'The Post Peak World' by Dr Colin Campbell of the Institute for Policy Research and Development. It says that we have already passed the peak of oil discovery and that production of oil and gas from fossil sources will inevitably decline. Given much of our civilisation is based on fossil fuels this is disturbing reading. The concept of peak oil is well established and has moved from a concern of environmentalists to well informed former oil company insiders. The oil companies themselves play down the peak oil debate and their own brand of denial pushes the issue down the political agenda. But it is coming.\nDr Campbell outlines a future where oil goes up to 100 dollars a barrel and where the world population falls by billions to a level half what it is today in 40 years. All pretty apocalyptic stuff. Modern food production is highly dependent on oil and therefore food production and prices are highly sensitive to the cost and availabity of oil. It seems crazy that we are actually using oil to produce plastic bags and useless plastic rubbish from mainly China when oil should be used carefully and sparingly. It gives an additional push for renewable energy in a post oil world.\nToday I've been in a Council briefing on the Kirklees budget issues we face and quite rightly we are looking at how we deal with the cuts being passed down by central government and it is truly horrendous. We are as we know 'in a deficit situation' a financial deficit and the Tories (and Lib Dems) tells us we are living way beyond our needs. Whereas money is an artificial construct, oil is a very real commodity and a limited resource which we have been using at an alarming rate. We are effectively in an 'oil and gas deficit' with consequences which affect our very civilisation. We have to really understand and accept there's a problem before it can be addressed. We have a long way to go in a short time.\nWe have been here before of course back in the 70s with the OPEC crisis which prompted a flurry of concern about oil depletion and apocalpyptic films which the deniers point to as 'proof' that the peak oilers are crying 'wolf'. The other charge of course is that there is some sort of hankering to live in the past and that talk of a transition to a low oil (and carbon) economy is anti - progress. This sort of talk is just dodging the issue, the problem exists and we have to find ways of dealing with it some of this will be using technology to take us to a low carbon future and yes there will probably be some old skills that we have to employ to boost local food production. Anyway to reinforce a few prejudices about peak oilers here's 'Heavy Horses' by Jethro Tull from 1978 about a time when the 'Oil Barons have run dry' and when we will be using horses again to work the land.\nSplendid Blog.\nReplyDeleteIt brings out one EXTRAORDINGLY \"hidden\" point, that our world food production is HEAVILY dependent on OIL! Very few people seem to be prepared to face up to this, and gradually change our farming to NON chemical dependency and LOW animal foods This is the MOST inconvenient truth that most people are afraid to talk about. Animal farming is , after transport, the largest producer of global warming gases, and the wastage in land, food and water is unbelievably high, But FEW, except vegetarians & vegans are prepared to even CONSIDER that diets have to change to a VERY low animal intake. We have to grow food for humans not cattle and birds. there will be no other way to feed the world. Organic farming will be a necessity, not a high priced way of living for the better off.\nApart from the fact you more or less passed this by, your blog is GREAT\nThanks for the compliment. I accept the argument and was a vegetarian for 9 years but now sadly lapsed I'm afraid. Limiting the amount of meat we eat has to be a good thing for all sorts of reasons and the Meat Free Mondays campaign is a start. If we accept that we are not going to all become vegetarians overnight or even want to then I think we just need to get people to value meat more and like oil use it sparingly.\nReplyDelete",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2021_12_kirklees-reneges-on-rugby-league-museum_html/content_152.html": "Last year, with much fanfare, Kirklees Council announced that Rugby League would be 'coming home' to its birthplace, The George Hotel in Huddersfield, after the Council won a tightly contested bid against other towns to host the National Rugby League Museum. It was the fact that the sport originated from a meeting in The George Hotel in 1895 that was the clincher. At the opening representatives from the Council and Rugby League Cares held a press conference. The Leader of the Council Shabir Pandor said,\n\"This is absolutely fantastic news and we’re really excited to get started and bring Rugby League home\"\n“It is so much more than a building to local people and to Rugby League fans across the world. This is where it all began for Rugby League and there is no better place to create a museum that celebrates and remembers the history of the game.”\nNews broke last month that Kirklees was to renege on it's promise to have the Rugby League museum in the hotel. This has provoked much anger by Rugby League fans around the world as the Council had used The George Hotel to secure the Museum and also some external funding. The Council now says that the business case just doesn't stack up and so it would be now sited in the 'Cultural Heart' of the town that is being developed as part of the Huddersfield Blueprint. At Wednesday's Council meeting, in response to a question I asked on the proposals, West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin let slip that the Council was proposing to put the Museum in what is currently the Huddersfield Library and Art Gallery on the other side of town from 'The George'. As someone who is elected to represent the ward that includes the Town Centre finding out this way, by accident was to say the least annoying.\nWhen the Council said it was buying The George Hotel I was very supportive but at the time I asked to see what the Business Plan was going to look like and kept asking. More recently Conservative Councillors have also been asking about the Business Plans. Now we are told the numbers for including a Rugby League Museum in The George don't stack up, but still we haven't seen the papers that demonstrate this. As a local Councillor I'm just asked to trust the judgement of officers with no detail, no business case, no options to weigh up. It is all deeply disappointing and the big question is how did we end up in a position where the Council made such a firm and public commitment and a partnership with the Rugby League and then had to make such an embarrassing climbdown? As someone who is elected to represent the Council I would really like to know the answer to that question.\nA bit of nostalgia now. Here's the joint Kirklees/Rugby League event announcing the Museum last year.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

And today's Suffragettes are the Anti Fracking Nannas like Tina Rothery and some of us blokes who turn up as well. At Kirby Misperton Fracking Site I've been jostled and kettled by North Yorkshire Police but not actually arrested yet. Of course there are risks in getting arrested you could be found guilty and fined or even imprisoned but then that's all part of what you sign up for as a 'Protector'. Protectors is a much more positive term than 'Protestor'. Protectors are seeking to protect our environment they are acting for a better world as well as protesting against the threat to it.\nThe last time I went to Kirby Misperton I was doing a speech to the assembled masses (about 20 folks to be honest) and we were surrounded by around 25 Police. In a homage to 'The Blues Brothers' I opened with the words \"I'd like to thank members of the North Yorkshire Law Enforcement Community for choosing to be with us here today\" some of the Police got the reference and had a chuckle.\nI continued talking over the megaphone as we were pushed away by the Police from the entrance to the Fracking Site to allow the HGVs carrying equipment to gain access. We slowed things up a bit, the Police and ourselves were engaged in the usual game of cat and mouse at the entrance. Chatting with the Police you can tell they don't really want to be there. They have had some Public Relations disasters at Kirby Misperton most famously in harrassing a the 'Tea lady' pensioner in a video that went viral right round the world. Now we hear that some Fracking equipment is being removed from the site as costs for Policing continue to mount and the future of Fracking at the site is beginning to be in doubt. Victory may be in sight.\nIt is in this context that this week as a nation we have been noting the Centenary of the moment some women first got the vote in our country. We are celebrating the actions of law breakers, women who were persecuted, demonised by the press, imprisoned and force fed by the state. It is in that context that todays anti fracking protestors should be viewed.\nSo where is the new front line of Non Violent Direct Action? It could be back to the voting system. For years majority Governments have been elected by a minority of voters in the UK. Millions of peoples votes are effectively disregarded by the electoral system. It suits the larger parties but is archaic and most European countries have abandoned this bizarre unfair voting system in favour of some form of Proportional Representation. Arguments against it are often bogus and self serving and make our claim to be the mother of democracies very hollow indeed. It was in that context that 410 people around the country had a 24 hour fast this week (including yours truly) for fair votes to 'Make votes matter'. Some participants called it a 'hunger strike' which I felt was inappropriate given the real hunger strikes that suffragettes held at considerable risk. Given the way the campaign for fair votes has been ridiculed by the powerful people and parties who benefit from the status quo then I can't see the electoral system being changed anytime soon.\nThe 24 hour fast was a first step. We need to up the anti if we are to ensure that democracy means anything to the millions of voters it ignores. Anyone fancy handcuffing themselves to First Past the Post Fan Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn or our own Barry Sheerman MP?\nHere's 'Breaking the Law' by Judas Priest\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

You're sitting at home minding your own business and someone knocks on your door.\n\"Hello sorry to bother you I'm calling on behalf of Kirklees Council about providing free solar panels for your house.\"\n\"This is a privately owned house the council estates round the corner\"\n\"No this offer is for private householders\"\n\"So how much do I have to pay?\"\n\"Nothing they're free\"\n\"And exactly how much has our Council Tax got to go up to pay for this so called 'free' scheme by the Council?\"\n\"Your Council Tax is unaffected the costs of the panels will be paid for via the new Feed in tariff. All you have to do is sign this form to assign the tarrif to us and you get the panels on your roof\"\n\" Well if I'm going to get no financial benefit why should I do it? I'm not one of these lentil eating, treehugging green types who fit solar panels for the good of the planet you know.\"\n\"Actually on average usage you should be able to reduce your electricity bill by about 25-30% per year using the electricity generated by your solar panels so you could save anywhere between £100 and £200 each year for as long as the panels are installed.\"\n\"Ok you can fit them but don't make a mess and can I choose the colour?\"\nSo could this happen? We might not be that far off at all. The finances certainly stack up and this week the Green Party on Kirklees got agreement from the incoming Labour Administration to draw up plans to make this a reality. There are issues to be addressed to make this a reality but they are not unsurmountable. Hopefully within the year we will have another revolutionary nation leading scheme to tackle carbon emissions, reduce fuel costs and create jobs.\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nHow fantastic - well done.

Of course there's very little choice in reality. This week has been redundancy/retirement week at Kirklees Council. The numbers of staff leaving the Council is huge, around 500 are gone with around another 1000 to go over the next few months but even this will not be enough services will have to be cut further to satisfy government demands or as Eric puts it,\n\"For the first time, councils will have real power and a real say over how money gets spent. \"\nanother particularly irritating quote,\n\"We've cut the apron strings which have tied (Councils) to Whitehall for too long, giving them freedom to act on behalf of their residents,\"\nThis is just utter tosh and a degree of spin that would make Mandelson blush (OK maybe not). People are being 'freed' of local facilities, services and income. He makes a virtue of getting rid of reporting such as that needed for the Comprehensive Performance Assessment and more reporting to citizens on how ther money is spent. OK but we do need to report on the impact on public services, the jobs lost, the impact on the wider economy, the health and social impact of cuts, the loss of public facilities.

You mean Tomorrow Never Dies with Pierce Brosnan as Bond?\"\nNo 'Tomorrow' a film about the Transition Movement. It's won stackloads of film awards and scores 92% on Rotten Tomatoes. Its success is attributed to the fact that it spends the first 5 minutes on environmental doom and gloom 'get me out of this room' stuff and the rest of the movie on solutions, optimism and hope. Its been inspirational to people around the world and I'm ashamed to say that until today I'd never heard of it. I wonder if its on Netflix.\nThe reason I know all this is because today I was one of the speakers at the European Day of Sustainable Communities event in Brussels hosted by the EU Committee of the Regions and EESC which was full of people from around Europe who have been inspired by the resilience message of the Transition Movement. Their Umbrella body is ECOLISE or 'the European network for community-led initiatives on climate change and sustainability' It was great to be among like minded people to whom the ethos of 'Think Global Act Local' is intrinsic to their very being. They think small scale and value community, incremental change and recognise that as I put it today \"That we don't just want to save the world but create a better world\". It was a very positive event and full of articulate, bright and many young people. So when we were asked for a word to sum up our thoughts of the day I chose 'hope'.\nI wonder what can be done to revitalise the fortunes of the Transition Network in the UK? It warrants serious thought. We have a group near us Holmfirth Transition Town which continues to do some excellent work but I get the feeling across the UK they are not as active as they were five or six years ago. Maybe one of the reasons is that they came out of 'The End of Oil' debate that seemed to place the crisis with the lack of fossil fuels as opposed to the fact that we'll burn them and ourselves to oblivion before we have to worry about them running out. This doesn't make the Transition Network any less relevant at all in fact the 'Hothouse Report' and ongoing extreme weather events mean that we must find ways of making the approach they take relevant to many more communities.\nMy resolution from today? To watch the film 'Tomorrow' and if I like it to get many more people to watch it probably at Huddersfield Green Drinks at the Media Centre. Here's the trailer",

Louise's Facebook feed was full of pictures of her on various runs and fell races looking terribly energetic. Her bandana proudly declared 'vegan runner'. If I had to get a suitably descriptive bandana it would have to say 'omnivorous slob'.\n| Louise Galvin |\nGeorge (Georgina) Perry was from Leeds Green Party and worked in the health sector. For a while I'd got her mixed up with the George (Georgina) from Lancashire who had helped us work out the route. I'm easily confused.\nSo we had a magnificent 7 walkers plus Ann Forsaith in the support vehicle. I christened us 'The Fellowship of the Frack'. There were 8 of us, just like in 'The Lord of the Rings', we were being guided by a tall guy with a beard (Tom). I of course was the moody, good looking (self deluding) Aragorn. I would have to be careful about how far I should take the analogy because that would mean we would be equating our final destination in Lancashire with Mordor, the home of the army of Orcs and that\n| Colin Noble |\nwere seeking to seeking to send.\nThe day of the walk drew near. We were to assemble in Scarborough at a 'kick off' meeting in the towns Central Library on the Tuesday night. After a leisurely trip I met up with Louise in Scarborough she found a Vegan Friendly cafe on her Vegan eating app and we strolled towards it. I remember thinking it was a bit of a long walk to the cafe (it wasn't) and then thinking If you think thats a long walk Cooper what sodding chance will you have of completing this walk you fool!\" I can be a bit tough on\n| Georgina Perry |\nanimal unfriendly burger and chips. We strolled towards the Library. I remember feeling stuffed and unenergetic \"No backing out now Cooper you idiot!\" I thought. The hall in the Library was beginning to fill up a bit for our 'send off' event with about 40 or so in the audience and a panel I was on with representatives from the Green Party, Frack Free Scarborough, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats and me for the Core Team of Walkers. All good earnest stuff from all the speakers about why Fracking was such a bad thing from different perspectives. I stood up to talk about the walk itself and it occurred to me that I didn't know who Carolyn Popple was or Georgina Perry. I knew Nigel Corser was meeting us the next day at Kirby Misperton Protection Camp where he was camping. In a moment of inspiration I said \" Can\n| Ann Forsaith |\nto applause! Ah! Carolyn Popple doesn't always wear reflective sunglasses. She must be George. Right got that! I then went on to explain that we were the 'Fellowship of the Frack' and that every Fellowship should have a 'precious'. I revealed an old battered Harrogate Toffee Tin which had been the repository for our tea bags back home before I liberated it. I explained how soil would be dug up from Kirby Misperton Protection Camp and carried all the way to Preston New Road where Lancashire and Yorkshire soil would be mixed together. Then the soil would be used to help plant a self seeded oak tree sapling that Ann Forsaith was bringing with her from Yorkshire. This was to be a symbolic act to demonstrate that an attack on land in Lancashire would be an attack on land in Yorkshire. Our soils were mixed, our fates entwined.\nThe meeting ended, we did some photos and went off to our respective beds for the night. We were to set off from Kirby Misperton at 7.00a.m. The next morning we would be on the road. Here we go.\n| The Fellowship of the Frack assembles (minus Nigel Corser) |\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Below is his letter and my response\nTurn up on time\nON Thursday, for the first time in my 70 years, I went to a planning meeting at Huddersfield Town Hall to discuss the proposed Tesco’s new store and I declare I am in favour.\nThe meeting started on time with people address the meeting both for and against. At 11am – one whole hour after the meeting started – in storms Clr Andrew Cooper waving his papers to attract the chairwoman’s attention. After the person that was speaking had finished he was allowed to make his speech to the council.\nHe was against the proposal. The meeting continued with councilors given their views and raising points. This was done with caustic comments by Clr Cooper who had to be told by the chairwoman to desist on at least three occasions.\nMy comment to this councillor if you feel so strongly about something being discussed by the council have the decency to turn up on time and listen to all the points raised both for and against.\nGeorge Senior\nHolmfirth\nAnd here's my response..........\nMr George Senior ( Examiner letters 26/2/11) criticises me for turning up late to the Planning meeting which agreed the Tesco development. What Mr Senior may not know is that the meeting was originally advertised as being at 1.00pm but was brought forward to 10.00am. This clashed with a work meeting I had pre arranged but I still managed to get time off work to attend the meeting at 11.00am.\nMr Senior goes on to criticise my 'caustic comments' and that the Chairwoman had to tell me to 'desist on at least three occasions'. Well I counted two occasions but the real point is that this was perhaps one of the most frustrating Planning meetings I have attended. Councillors were placing 'conditions' on Tesco with absolutely no guarantee that Tesco will take any notice of them whatsoever. If Mr Senior really expects me to sit meekly by and watch this disastarous decision for our town to be taken without comment then I'm afraid he's got the wrong man.\nThe Planning Meetings should really be webcast like Full Council meetings so then people could see how Councillors perform in these meetings. I wonder why they are not?\nPerhaps Mr Senior ought to be criticising all those Councillors who were not members of the Planning Committee for failing to turn up to express any opinion whatsoever. At least as a Green Party Councillor I made the effort to turn up to express a view. No other Party fielded anybody to represent their views to the Committee. That is the real scandal here.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2012_10/content_8.html": "The EU budget, in the crosshairs of the government, needs to be greener, not leaner and meaner,\nIt is now widely acknowledged that there is enormous potential to reap environmental, social and economic dividends through improving the energy efficiency of Europe's 160 million buildings. And yet actual investments in energy efficiency measures remain very small in comparison to this potential.\nTo achieve the EU objective of a 20 percent improvement in energy efficiency by 2020 (from 1990 levels), the European Investment Bank estimates that EUR 85 billion per year is needed, with EUR 60 billion per year required for buildings alone. The forthcoming EU budget for 2014-20, currently being negotiated, has a vital role to play here for the UK and Europe's other more developed countries as well as the less developed countries.\nThe future budget, expected to total around one trillion euros over seven years, seeks among other things to realise Europe 2020 objectives – supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy in all sectors is paramount in the European commission's budget proposals to date. Backing this up, a figure of at least 20 percent of the total budget for climate change related activities has been put on the table by the commission. More specifically, a doubling of current allocations for energy efficiency and renewable energy to EUR 17 billion has also been proposed under the European Regional Development Fund.\nGiven the scale of the challenges we now face, these figures should be higher – some members of the European Parliament have recently been vocal in calling for this 20 percent 'climate mainstreaming' to be bumped up to 30 percent. Meanwhile, with some of the EU's larger member states, including the UK, pushing for real terms cuts in the future EU budget, there are growing fears that the budget's climate potential could be seriously impaired. Here's why this must not happen.\nKirklees Council in West Yorkshire, where I serve as a Green Party councillor, has been a leading local authority in the UK in addressing fuel poverty and improving the energy efficiency of people’s homes. An insulation programmethat we implemented between 2007 and 2011 offered free loft and cavity wall insulation to all households irrespective of income or tenure. Thousands of homes were insulated and Kirklees is recognised by the UK’s Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) as the council in the UK that has been most successful at insulating its housing stock.\nThe question now for Kirklees and hundreds of other councils up and down the UK is: where next?\nThe UK government's 'Green Deal' that has just been launched aims to improve insulation in 14 million of the UK's leaky homes. However, there is scepticsm from many quarters as to whether or not the Green Deal is fit for purpose. For one thing. the loans offered to improve the energy efficiency of people’s homes under the Green Deal are expected to be offering interest rates at around the seven percent mark, while in Germany similar loans are offered at one percent.\nDavid Kennedy, chief executive of the government's official advisors, the Committee on climate change, has warned of the Green Deal's finance model: “We think there is a significant risk in leaving it to the market, as that has never worked anywhere in the world and is unlikely to happen in the UK.”\nThe Green Deal's unique selling point is that the loans offered to home owners are supposed to be more than covered by the savings made as result of the measures installed. This is called 'the Golden Rule', but more expensive measures such as solid wall insulation will have to be highly subsidised by the utilities through the Energy Company Obligation.\nConsumer resistance to solid wall insulation is expected to be high mainly due to aesthetic reasons. The Golden Rule is not guaranteed, and changes in people’s circumstances or how they use the home could impact negatively (or positively) on savings made. Industry is expecting a slow start for the Green Deal and in traditional loft and cavity wall insulation sectors a downturn in orders and staff redundancies seems likely. Early attacks on the Green Deal from the UK press are underway and will probably accelerate as the scheme is launched.\nThe Green Deal is being introduced at a time when ‘feed in tariffs’ for solar PV and other renewable technologies are being massively cut, leading to a reduction in capacity in the micro-generation sector. It is against this backdrop that the UK's ability to achieve an array of EU environmental targets must be judged.\nWhen asked DECC officials are bullish about being able to hit the EU target for 16 percent of total energy from renewable sources by 2020. The evidence would indicate otherwise, particularly with regard to the renewable heat and transport sectors.\nThere are other avenues, though, to ensure positive action on energy efficiency in the UK materialises – this is likely to occur where local authorities and energy utilities disregard problematic policies such as the Green Deal and instead develop their own programmes. Local authorities have the 'reach' for this. They have access to community networks and to a great extent the trust of their communities as official bodies where people feel they have a recourse if they have concerns.\nEnergy utilities do have funding of GBP 1.3 Billion per year through the Energy Company Obligation, but if matched funding is required to make a scheme fly then local authorities, like many public bodies, are highly constrained both in terms of capital and revenue expenditure.\nThis is where EU funds could really make a difference, bridging the gap between local schemes that lack finance but that nonetheless have every likelihood of succeeding.\nSuch an opportunity has already been grasped in France, where social housing organisations have rapidly deployed 320 million euros of European Regional Development Fund money to improve energy efficiency in existing housing. This European finance triggered investments of 2.2 billion euros, created 15,000 local jobs and has resulted in financial savings of 98 euros per month per household thanks to a 40 percent average decrease in heating costs.\nThe best route for such EU funds at a time of limited budgets would be via a route where councils and energy utilities have to demonstrate the robust nature of their proposals in terms of delivery as the key to open EU funding. High quality, 'deep' renovation proposals are essential here – cosmetic fixes such as replacement windows should be a non-starter.\nAnd the UK could maximise leverage on EU funds to co-finance projects if the UK government sets the EU funding element to cover 75 percent of costs. This will ensure we get more back from the EU on projects that give us a better deal from Europe, and certainly a greener one.\nDesigning such programmes coud be developed in conjunction with the Local Government Association (LGA), the representative body for councils in England and Wales. The LGA is regularly engaging with DECC on government policy and is one of the most informed bodies in the country on the delivery of energy efficiency programmes.\nThese are difficult times for many sectors of industry, but through imaginative links between the EU and local government bodies in the UK, we can produce imaginative and effective programmes that deliver carbon and financial savings while generating jobs and, for many, much needed hope.",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2016/content_103.html": "Here's the final response we gave to the West Yorkshire Transport Strategy. I was persuaded to take the following sentence out of our response as it wasn't the right tone I quite liked it though\n\"The\nintermediate West Yorkshire stop on the Northern Powerhouse Rail route HS3\nshould be located in Narnia as a fantasy project should be located in a fantasy\nkingdom.\"\nSo if you're reading from West Yorkshire Combined Authority that is what you could have had!\nThe Green Party Response\nto the West Yorkshire Transport\nStrategy 2016 - 2036\nThis response to the\nWest Yorkshire Transport Strategy represents the views of the Green\nParties of West Yorkshire and has been shared and agreed with our elected\nrepresentatives on Leeds, Bradford and Kirklees Councils and through\nconsultation with Party members throughout West Yorkshire.\nHow strongly you\nagree or disagree with our proposed policies described in each of the core\nthemes and the cross-cutting theme?\nWe believe a 60\nyear vision is needed. 20 years is too short a period to realise the sort of\ntransformation in our transport system that is needed.\nAn initial\nobservation on the consultation questions is that there are a lot of obvious\n‘Motherhood and Apple Pie’ statements that we are asked to express an opinion\non. This devalues the consultation exercise and\ncould lead respondees to question its validity.\nDelivering the\nStrategy is very dependent on road improvements with a strong emphasis on road\nschemes which will lead to increased capacity on Major routes. This\naccommodation of demand can only be temporary in nature. Delivering road\nimprovements to local congestion hot spots is eventually and inevitably\nself-defeating as demand increases and diminishes the dubious benefit of the\ninvestment.\nRoad\nsurfaces however desperately need improvements for all road users\nespecially cyclists who are at most personal risk from potholed\nroads. The austerity budgets being imposed by central Government on local\nCouncils is leading to a rapidly deteriorating road network\nIn the Consultation\nquestionnaire it asks whether we should “Provide new roads to improve\naccess to development sites” – This seems a very odd\nquestion and leads to a strong suspicion that it is aboutencouraging\ndevelopment in green belt as it assumes development will be away from existing\nhubs.We need to develop housing and employment around existing transport hubs\nand communities rather than creating new ones. We must avoid monoculture\ncommunities e.g. commuter belt towns. We also have concerns that improving\norbital roads may well suck the life out of city centres\nDemand reduction\nneeds to be an aim of the Strategy. We must have policies in place that limit\nthe necessity to have vehicles. Spatial Planning that links existing\ntransport hubs with new development is one way of addressing demand, as is l.\nTravel diaries/Travel Planning are important tools to\nhelp people adopt healthier forms of transport. More food grown and used\nlocally to avoid food miles is another\napproach. You should also be working with local\ncouncils, developers, and bus operators to ensure that developments proposed\nover the next 15- 20 years in DLP’s can be serviced by public transport,\ncycling and walking. The alternative is more congestion and\npressure to carry out self-defeating road improvements\nWe strongly believe\nthat local and community rail improvements should be prioritised\nover new road schemes, as should improvements to the bus network\nwhich currently carries 5 – 6 times more passengers than\nrail. A process of “Debeechification” should begin with greater\nemphasis on improving and expanding the rail network; while more road space\nshould be dedicated to bus priority lanes.\nHS2 is largely\nirrelevant to our local transport needs and the money would be much better\nspent on improving public transport infrastructure locally ie rail,\nlight rail, tram and bus networks. We strongly oppose a\nmasterplan for a new HS2 Yorkshire Hub Station in Leeds on that basis.\nThe question as to\nwhere the intermediate West Yorkshire stop on the Northern Powerhouse Rail\nroute HS3 should be located is unfortunately irrelevant as we believe this is a\nfantasy project not grounded in reality.\nThe Consultation\nQuestionnaire says that we should “Involve Communities in making\nimprovements to their neighbourhoods to create safer and healthier places” –\nHow and with what money?\nAccessibility for\npeople with disabilities should be an important part of the\nStrategy particularly as we move to more pedestrian friendly town centres.\nWe should look\nto banning diesel cars from all Town and\nCity Centres – California has set a good example with\na policy that we should follow – starting by announcing a\nban on the worst polluting diesel vehicles/cars from Town Centres to start\nby 2020.\n“The current duopoly of First and Arriva in\nWest Yorkshire is uncompetitive and does not act in the interest of the public\ntransport user. It gives unfair advantage to the dominant operator in any\nsub-area and stops the development of other operations that could significantly\nimprove services. Effectively the market works for First and Arriva, but\nnobody else. In our view anything short of the powers that Transport for\nLondon have regarding buses means the main providers of public transport in\nWest Yorkshire will not work in the interest of its people.”\nWhat you think we\nshould measure to show our progress in delivering transport improvements in\neach of the core themes and the cross-cutting theme?\nThe Strategy should\nbe set against the context of the Paris Climate Agreement. It should be an\nintegral part of the Strategy to show how it is contributing to\nthe carbon emissions reduction targets set in the Nationally Determined\nContributions agreed in Paris last year. It is a major omission that it is not.\nThe Strategy says it\nwants to have “The best bus system in Europe” as an aspiration. This is a very\nstrange aspiration. Where is the best bus system in Europe? How is it\ndetermined – what about the rest of public transport? What about\nwalking and cycling?\nThe automatic\nassumption that all growth is good is a fundamental problem with the strategy.\nGrowth can negatively impact on quality of life through, for instance, air\npollution and the knock on impact on public health. What we should measure\nto show progress in delivering improvements to road network are\ndecreasing emissions in terms\nof Carbon/SOX/NOX/Particulates and noise reduction.\nWe need a\nholistic cost analysis of different transport options for instance\npublic transport V car would have added a lot of substance to the strategy.\nThere is no such analysis in the strategy and this is a major weakness.\nAnother important way\nto measure the success of the Strategy would be by measuring modal shift\nfrom car to Public Transport and measuring the use\nof the Mcard for regular public transport users.\n“Road deaths” are not\njust about traffic accidents but the premature deaths caused each year as a\nresult of emissions and low air quality – Gloucestershire’s Speed Reduction\nPartnership give communities their own speed guns – This is a\ngood example that West Yorkshire could emulate.\nWe were asked to say\nhow we should measure progress in delivering improvements to\nplaces to places to live and work? There is a well established methodology\ncalled the Happiness Index that would be well suited to this task. We\nshould also measure progress through satisfaction\nsurveys of commuters and general transport users using all modes of transport.\nHave we missed\nanything you feel should be included in the strategy?\nA hierarchy of users\nshould be followed through in the Strategy starting with the pedestrian\nfirst and the private car last.\nThe strategy should\nnot encourage aviation by supporting the expansion of Leeds/Bradford airport.\nThis would be in harmony with a strategy that took a holistic approach to\ntransportation and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nRail use for freight\nshould be encouraged and there is an absence of serious comment on this in the\nstrategy documentation.\nWe need to invest in\ntraffic signals so vehicles can move more freely, more efficiently and in a\nless polluting fashion. This should be linked with Action in the ground by the\nHighways Agency and local Councils.\nThere are jobs in a\n‘green approach’ to transport policies – e.g. cycle logistics firms. Showing\nhow the transport strategy is going to support employment would be a positive\naddition to the strategy\nThe benefits of new\ntechnology should benefit us all – autonomous and connected vehicles providing\n“collective” solutions rather than new gadgets for an elite. We are thinking\nparticularly of advances towards driverless cars which may become a reality during\nthe life of this strategy.\nFleet Managers need\nthe right policy levers to enable them to be the first movers on new vehicle\ntechnology such as electric and hybrid cars. Showing how this could be achieved\nin the strategy would have been helpful.\nWe would be happy to meet relevant officers\nof West Yorkshire Transport Authority to discuss our observations\nYours sincerely\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper on behalf of Green\nParties across West Yorkshire",

Temporary looking and colourful with banners from frack free organisations from all over the country. Colin Noble was already there. I spotted him by the wood fire having a cuppa. A few of the campers were there to see us off including Ian in his bushmans hat. Then I met Nigel Corser for the first time. He was carrying a large blue plastic barrel full of food supplies that he wanted to put in the support vehicle. The support vehicle was Ann's little blue Peugeot hatchback which was already crammed with our bags and a large supply of protein bars, a sapling etc. The barrel stayed at the camp!\n| Gathering 'sacred' Yorkshire soil |\nI remembered! \"I have a toffee tin to fill with Yorkshire soil\" I found a suitable patch of earth, posed for the photographer, smiled and filled the toffee tin with 'holy Yorkshire soil'. It is God's own country after all! I wouldn't even let my atheism interfere with that firmly held belief. I put it in the bottom of my rucksack. Time to get everyone together.\nThere was the Core Group of 7 plus about\nanother 10 hardy souls who joined us for the first few miles. We posed for more pictures and then turned left out onto the road ( just as the original Fellowship did when they left Rivendell). We were off! No Samba Band as Kirby Misperton residents wouldn't thank us for that at this hour. No Leo Sayer! His agent had ignored my emails. We were walking with 120 miles to go.\nAbout half a mile into the walk the BBC Radio York van had stopped and the reporter wanted to interview me live for the morning show. I stopped by his radio van and all the other walkers carried on as they should do. I explained about the walk, its purpose and how great I was feeling about it, which I did! Then the reporter recounted a recent encounter he had with someone who said that all these people walking in the road were more dangerous than fracking. I pointed out our 'No Fracking Way' Hi Vis vests, the Highway Code rules that we were following for walking in the road. Interview over and the other walkers were now nowhere to be seen. I pegged it up the road and caught sight of them just heading into the Kirby Misperton village proper. Once I'd caught them up we walked on for about another half mile and came to the point where the fracking site was to be developed, just opposite a farm with a few cows looking curiously at us. This was the point when the Core Group parted ways with those who'd come to see us off. We said our goodbyes, shook hands smiled and hit the road.\nThese were country roads, B Roads, quiet but long. We were to go on a trek from village to village. We came to our first village 'Great Habton'. I'm sure people who lived there thought it was great but like many of the placesit was just a lovely little village. We posed by the boundary sign and I tweeted. This was to become a feature of many of our triumphant entries into hamlets, villages and Towns throughout the walk. We were really getting a pace up. We made our way through Amotherby, Appleton Le Street and Slingsby ( I believe they make Gin there). As we entered Hovingham we were met by a group of about half a dozen folks from Frack Free Ryedale. This really lifted our spirits. People were thinking about us on the way, were tracking our progress and wanted to join us on our quest.\nAs we entered the beautiful village of Hovingham we made a stop at the Worseley Arms Hotel. A country hotel with nice carpets and big sofas. The sort of place that well to do country folk might frequent but on this occasion it was just us. Boots, walking gear and placards. We looked out of place but were made very very welcome sitting by the roaring fire being provided with tea and biscuits. I felt a certain amount of guilt. This was all too pleasant and not what I was expecting at all on this trek. The Manager of the Hotel proudly showed me his 'Frack Free Business' sticker alongside those from Michelin and Trip Advisor. Opposing Fracking was clearly good for business! We set off with still a long way to go. The good news was that for several miles the road we were to take out of Hovingham was closed to traffic for maintenance, but not to us so the next few miles we were able to bomb along without having to be too concerned about traffic. We were joined by Ian and Wendy from Rotherham Green Party. Wendy to walk with us and Ian to take some video footage of us on our trek.\nEntering Easingwold at about 4ish meant we still had a fair trek of another 7 miles before we hit Brafferton where we due to finish for the day. If we didn't crack on we were going to lose the light. In retrospect we spent far too much time in the Pub before setting off. Some of us were looking a bit knackered. It seemed like a very long 7 miles and the sun was starting to go down. Only Louise Galvin had a head torch and someone else had a hand torch. The sharp bends with hedges made this all feel really dangerous and it seemed to take ages before we actually entered our end point, a pub car park in Brafferton, in the dark after 30 miles feeling pretty tired and done in. We were relieved to be retreived by members of York Green Party in a couple of cars. They took us to York for an event in a local Hall in our honour with music, poetry, food and beer! When we got there the boots and walking shoes all came off and we hobbled around or sat down as if we were never going to get up. June Tranmer from York Greens provided us all with a foot massage and we each had some quality time in a footspa she brought. Heavenly! Then I saw Tom Franklin's knee. It had ballooned rather spectacularly and worryingly. He was clearly in some pain. We would just have to see what tomorrow would bring but the thought of losing Tom, our guide, our Gandalf was pretty worrying. This was the first of 4 evenings where we looked after by local Greens and Anti Fracking Activists along the route I was immensely touched by all the care we received along the way. So I stiffly rose and went off with my host for the evening, shared a glass of wine with him before going to bed, donning my compression tights and falling immediately into a deep sleep.\nAs we entered the beautiful village of Hovingham we made a stop at the Worseley Arms Hotel.

No one is going to be short of a coffee in Huddersfield. Apart from the Merrie England these are all national multiples and now, therefore, a common feature of the clone town. Merrie England has been in Huddersfield for as long as I can remember. It has many common charactaristics, mock tudor beams, horse brasses, frothy milky coffee. For me Merrie England is as 'Huddersfield' as Castle Hill, Castlegate and Roy Castle. It is part of the DNA of the town and it would be a shame indeed if the latte army of the national coffee chains threatened the future of the Merrie England. Having said all that you can usually find me at 7.00am in Cafe Nero reading my papers (the Merrie doesn't open till 7.45a.m.) and having an 'Americano' with milk. As I'm a bit of an early riser I tend to favour mock italian over mock tudor. I like the comfy chairs and the classical music and the whole 10th cup 'free' thing. Cafe Nero have a formula which obviously travels well and they have over 400 shops across the UK. I'm sort of pleased in a way that the Merrie England franchise is limited to the 5 shops in Huddersfield and the one in Brighouse and the one in Halifax. It means it is definitely part of our identity and one which, either by lack of ambition of the company or attractiveness to other areas, has not managed to travel beyond our corner of West Yorkshire My personal support for the Merrie England is purchasing occassional bacon and tomato baps. Mmmm very tasty.\nAs yet Huddersfield does not have a Starbucks. This I regard as a good thing. We must have reached the coffee shop saturation point by now.\nThere used to be a Merrie England in Bradford complete with \"mock tudor beams, horse brasses, frothy milky coffee\". How I used to idly consume pineapple icing cream cakes there in younger days....If as it sounds it is gone, and Merrie England is in decline, then is this just another sad metaphor for our changing times and the onward march of evil Corporate Coffee?\nReplyDelete",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2018_08/content_11.html": "The 'Hothouse Earth' Report makes grim reading and questions whether we can 'safely park' global temperature rises at 2 degrees C and indicates that we may have set in train a series of carbon releasing events that will be difficult to stop and that we may end up with global temperatures around 4 to 5 degrees C higher than the pr- industrial era. This really is a nightmare scenario with a significant rise in sea levels, highly disrupted weather threatening food supplies and much more frequent extreme and violent weather events. It is a respected summation of current peer reviewed climate science and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nA number of things have concerned me over the last few weeks. One is the cheery assertion by Conservative Government Minister Michael Gove that Climate Change and higher temperatures in the UK is a great opportunity for British Farmers to produce good quality sparkling wine. Now of course there may be some truth in this but it indicates a lack of perception of the grim reality of climate change. You could argue that what he said was taken out of context and that really he really does 'get it'. I'd like to believe that but you see the vote on the 3rd runway at Heathrow, the permission to commence Fracking at Preston New Road and the 4 new gas turbines at Drax that are on the cards and you can only conclude they don't believe and don't care about climate change. Sadly that goes for a lot of Labour politicians as well.\nMichael Gove gave the impression when he was first elected that he had hugged plenty of huskies in the fashion of David Cameron when he was in his 'vote blue go green' phase. With his positive comments on neonicitinoids and their impact on the bee population I thought well this is a little bit different from before. Now it seems that this is yet another attempt to detoxify the Tory Party using 'green issues'. Actually it is difficult to work out which needs the most detoxification Gove or the Conservative Party. So yes maybe there will be a brief mini-sparkling Wine Age before the very worst impacts of Climate Change hit us but we desperately need to be acting NOW to reduce emissions for the sake of civilization and human sentience on this planet. Even if they had the time away from their headlong pursuit of Brexit I doubt it would make them act any more responsibly.\nThanks to Ros for the picture.",

Below is his letter and my response\nTurn up on time\nON Thursday, for the first time in my 70 years, I went to a planning meeting at Huddersfield Town Hall to discuss the proposed Tesco’s new store and I declare I am in favour.\nThe meeting started on time with people address the meeting both for and against. At 11am – one whole hour after the meeting started – in storms Clr Andrew Cooper waving his papers to attract the chairwoman’s attention. After the person that was speaking had finished he was allowed to make his speech to the council.\nHe was against the proposal. The meeting continued with councilors given their views and raising points. This was done with caustic comments by Clr Cooper who had to be told by the chairwoman to desist on at least three occasions.\nMy comment to this councillor if you feel so strongly about something being discussed by the council have the decency to turn up on time and listen to all the points raised both for and against.\nGeorge Senior\nHolmfirth\nAnd here's my response..........\nMr George Senior ( Examiner letters 26/2/11) criticises me for turning up late to the Planning meeting which agreed the Tesco development. What Mr Senior may not know is that the meeting was originally advertised as being at 1.00pm but was brought forward to 10.00am. This clashed with a work meeting I had pre arranged but I still managed to get time off work to attend the meeting at 11.00am.\nMr Senior goes on to criticise my 'caustic comments' and that the Chairwoman had to tell me to 'desist on at least three occasions'. Well I counted two occasions but the real point is that this was perhaps one of the most frustrating Planning meetings I have attended. Councillors were placing 'conditions' on Tesco with absolutely no guarantee that Tesco will take any notice of them whatsoever. If Mr Senior really expects me to sit meekly by and watch this disastarous decision for our town to be taken without comment then I'm afraid he's got the wrong man.\nThe Planning Meetings should really be webcast like Full Council meetings so then people could see how Councillors perform in these meetings. I wonder why they are not?\nPerhaps Mr Senior ought to be criticising all those Councillors who were not members of the Planning Committee for failing to turn up to express any opinion whatsoever. At least as a Green Party Councillor I made the effort to turn up to express a view. No other Party fielded anybody to represent their views to the Committee. That is the real scandal here.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper",

The Huddersfield Methodist Mission and the work they do for those people in the direst of circumstances is a vital though not statutory service. They work with those people at the margins, the homeless, people with alcohol and drug addiction and people who wonder where the next meal is going to come from. Though the support they offer is very practical it is also very human where they take time and show care to people who may have not received real care from anyone for a very long time. My colleague Cllr Julie-Stewart-Turner has worked closely with the Mission and projects that they host such as 'The Welcome Centre'. As Mayor Julie made 'The Welcome Centre' one of her charities. Just as important as the money she raised was the profile that was given to the project and the acceptance that the Mayor would choose to support a charity which some people would casually characterise as being for 'the undeserving poor'. The tragedy is that the demands for their services is growing as a direct result of government policy. The role of the Council has to be one where we ask what we can do to assist them and also ask where are we being a barrier. One thing I want to ask Julie's advice on and people at the Mission is how we can ensure the Council is a better partner to them. One thing which I know would be very much valued is a phone line on the Kirklees contract to enable staff there to take up benefits queries for clients without racking up huge phone costs. A simple thing but it would be a step in the right direction which would be hugely appreciated\nHere's a video about the Mission featuring many of the people who work at The Mission and the incomparable Cllr Julie Stewart-Turner.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Here are some key asks that Government could do tomorrow but preferably today.\n- establish a National Climate Taskforce including Ministry of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Ministry of Communities, Housing & Local Government and the Local Government Association to drive action on climate change at the local level, addressing barriers to action and making good practice examples the mainstream\n- require Councils to produce Climate Action Plans on how they can cut emissions quickly and what actions they could take with greater support from central Government.\n- get Councils to lead local Climate Action Partnerships to drive deeper action on carbon emission reductions. This would draw in support from business, the wider public sector, the voluntary sector and the wider community\n- give a clear steer to local Councils that they are expected to insist on higher energy efficiency standards in new buildings up to (and preferably) the Passivhaus Standard.\n- Ask Councils to produce a plan (with a timetable) for a complete electrification of their vehicle fleets and to work with other large fleet operators on similar plans.\n- Revive the Home Energy Conservation Act powers of Local Government and ask for new plans to be established within a year for costed plans to improve the energy efficiency of homes in line with the emissions savings we need to achieve the Paris Climate goals within a ten year timeframe.\nThese are all initiatives that the UK Government and BEIS in particular could start work on or set in motion today. We clearly need more action than this to acheive the Paris Climate goals but this would be a significant start and I'm requesting a meeting with the BEIS Minister of State Claire Perry and the Local Government Association to see what progress we can make together to address the Climate Emergency we are facing.\nWell done, Andrew, really useful action points.

We have 1.3kWp of PV and a large solar thermal system feeding into a thermal store which will also be able to have heat input from a wood burning back boiler, the gas boiler and if we really need it an immersion heater. I really want to put the switch to the immersion heater in one of those glass fronted boxes saying, 'smash glass in emergency'.\nIn financial terms it will cost us a couple of grand with £10k of the costs covered by Kirklees Council's RE-Charge scheme and £2.5k by the now defunct Low Carbon Buildings Programme PV grant. Very roughly we will get a minimum of £400/year from the Clean Energy Cashback for 25 years another £400/year from the Renewable Heat Incentive and a minimum of £200/year fuel savings. So I estimate a very conservative financial benefit of £1000/year. I am sure George Monbiot would be foaming at the mouth if he was reading this now.\nWe get a couple of displays showing how much energy is being produced from each set of panels. It is quite a liberating feeling. I know one of my principal energy suppliers is 93 million miles away but I feel a much greater affinity with it than the earthbound energy companies. I guess it is because the sun never sends me any bills and 0p/kWh is by far my favorite tarrif! I do wonder if anyone has actually done any research into the psychological impact of having solar panels? It has to be positive. Being a producer of energy as well as a consumer. A feeling of control over your own energy, less dependence on big energy suppliers and the inevitable rise in fuel bills. Yup I'm feeling pretty positive.\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

It has some high points. I quite like the shop frontage for the hardware store, some of the pubs have made an effort to have attractive signage and quality fronts but then there are the dubious looking takeaways and other shops with tired old plastic signs.\nThe Ugarit Restaurant has recently opened on the street offering Syrian and Lebanese dishes and it looks like they have made a real effort to improve the appearance of the building both on the interior and exterior. I was surprised to discover that the Council's Conservation Team in the Planning Service deemed the signage outside Ugarit to be a detriment to a listed building and ordered changes to be made. The Restaurant was formerly an Estate Agent with a plastic sign outside. No damage has been caused to any of the buildings features as a result of the restaurant sign going up. A short wander down Cross Church Street and the vast majority of people I believe would regard the Ugarit shopfront as a positive thing compared with some of the garish signs on display. I have used my right as a Ward Councillor to refer this matter to the Planning Committee to see whether other Councillors see this issue as I do. There are a number of times I've seen matters differently to the Conservation Team in the Council. I really don't regard myself as some sort of Philistine who doesn't appreciate the need to preserve important architecture but I do find it difficult on a number of occasions to appreciate their viewpoint like this one on changes to New North Road Baptist Church from a few years ago.\nUgarit is a business which will hopefully be part of an improvement to the Town Centre and I hope the Council will be seeking to help businesses like this get established and not be regarded as an obstacle.\nGood point, Andrew. I think it's an improvement to the street and seems sympathetic to the building.\nReplyDeleteFully agree, the frontage of the Hardware store is as it should be, have often admired it and the window display. Fail to find any fault with that of \"Ugarit\",on the contrary an improvement on the previous frontage.(Also very nice eatery.\"\nReplyDelete",

It is important that the Government and local authorities ensure that developers build housing that doesn’t just withstand the growing number of extreme weather events we are seeing, but plays a part in reducing the impact of heavy rainfall and floods.”\nCentral to Cllr Cooper’s concerns are calls from the House Builders’ Federation to drop planning requirements for drainage systems to be included in building developments[2]. Instead, the HBF argue that councils should be responsible for building and maintaining higher capacity sewage systems to take away excess water – councils have responded by asking the Government to let them bill owners’ of new houses for the cost of this if the HBF’s proposal is adopted.\n“This is simply ludicrous,” Cllr Andrew Cooper said. “The HBF seems to be purely concerned about minimising developers’ costs, and maximising their profits, rather than considering the impact of their activities on local communities and even on the people they sell their houses to. Why should local taxpayers or new home owners foot the bill for building companies’ wanting to cut corners and save on their costs at the price of increased flooding?”\nCllr Andrew Cooper said that the Green Party has had deep concerns about the Coalition’s intentions on development even before it published its National Planning Policy Framework[3], which many environmental experts have argued is a gift to land-grabbing developers rather than a plan for sustainable housing.\n“Any new building needs to take account of the changes to weather we are seeing already,” said Cllr Cooper, “but more than that, architects, planners and developers need to be thinking constantly about how their work impacts on our society and environment.

Eleven years ago the Green Group on Kirklees cut our first budget deal. We thought it was crazy that Planning Notices were anonymous bits of paper sellotaped to lamp posts. They could easily be missed by people and the implications could be a lack of objections to controversial applications . Decisions could be passed without comment leading to anything from an unsympathetic development on someones street to 'heaven preserve us' a wind turbine in a field. In 2000 we stopped that following our budget deal with Labour. Planning Notices were to be put on bright yellow corex boards saying 'PLANNING NOTICE' on them. Now quietly, without approval, this policy has been dropped. In Kirkburton today I saw this anonymous piece of paper on a lamp post, clinging on for dear life hoping a gust of wind didn't tear it away from the moorings provided for it. It was a relatively cheap policy but in these times of spending cuts (when bankers have been given 8 years to seperate their gambling and banking divisions) we have to make, penny pinching, but real cuts in small things which make society better, which inform people about things that affect their lives on a day to day basis.\nGoing back to the future here's what it used to be like. Here we see Kirkburton Greens Derek Hardcastle and Michelle Atkinson next to the old style Planning Noticeboard which stands out and won't be overlooked. OK this cut is not the same as the slashing of Housing Benefit, the clamp down on disability allowances. It is not as infuriating as the Tories, seriously, unbelievably and perversely considering cutting the 50% tax rate for the rich. It is however another nail in the coffin of progress and Labour have implemented it on the Council in response to teh Coalition Government cuts agenda. Is there anything worse than when politicians decide things go backwards in a society.\nA rubbish decision lacking transparency forced on the Council by a rubbish government with a lousy sense of priorities who are kept in power by the Liberal Democrats. There is not nearly enough anger at the moment about this government.\nIt could prove to be a short-sighted 'saving': an important point of planning notices is that they ensure that objections come in promptly and systematically... If people hear about developments in a more haphazard way, because notices are spotted late or info comes thru word of mouth not notices, I imagine there will be more, and more costly, objections.\nReplyDelete",

There are deep divisions in our country rumbling on with Brexit. Racists now feel they have license to spout their nonsense more freely now they have 'got their country back'. In an already divided society people can now differentiate themselves further by identifying themselves as a Remainer or a Leaver. So the Government then goes and rubs the noses of half the country in it 'the losers' by minting a sodding coin. I felt pretty much the same way when the Government said there would be a national holiday on 'Brexit Day' so one half of the country can celebrate whatever it is they feel they have to celebrate while the rest of us cry into our pints at the chaos to come.\nMaybe it would be most fitting to have two 50 pence pieces. After all 2 x 50p makes a good old honest British pound. One could have Union Jacks on one side and the Queen on the reverse. The other coin could have the EU Flag on and Donald Tusk on the reverse. I'm of course joking but if the Government wants to make an overt dividing political statement with the coin of the realm favouring one side of the argument why not do it for the other side as well.\nHere's 'Anarchy in the UK' by the Sex Pistols.

We are now told by the Minister that the problem with\nclimate change policy is “left wing anti capitalists\". This can only be described\nas a highly cynical smokescreen by the Conservatives. When Ministers are in a\nvery weak position it is not an uncommon tactic for them to go on the offensive\nrather than have to defend the undefensible. This is what we have seen from\nAmber Rudd today”\n“The only rational explanation for the Tory assault on\npolicies to address climate change is that there is a covert strain of climate\nchange denial in the Conservative Party and particularly in the Treasury. If\nGovernment policy is being driven by an unscientific climate scepticsm then the\nGovernment should come clean and not hide behind paranoid, unsubstantiated\nconspiracy theories.”\n“What Green Business wants is the same as what all\nbusinesses want and that is certainty and not a Government that continually\nchops and changes the rules. If we are to seriously address fuel poverty,\ninsulate millions of homes and build the renewable sector we need to provide us\nwith stable prices and clean energy then Government has a big job to do to\nregain the confidence of businesses. The Government has provided certainty and\nsupport for the fracking industry, for the oil and gas sectors and the nuclear\nindustry yet it has abandoned the thousands of people employed in the green\nenergy and building industries.”\nCouncillor Cooper responded to the Ministers claim that the \"UK Government does not subsidise fossil fuel consumption\" - \"These are clearly weasel words. What the Government does subsidise to the tune of billions of pounds is fossil fuel production. In the March 2015 budget the North Sea Oil and Gas sector received over £1.3Billion of tax breaks.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2017_01_locally-determined-contributions_html/content_222.html": "Regular readers of this blog will remember that back in December I introduced the concept of Locally Determined Contributions (and Regionally Determined Contributions) as a way of filling the emissions reduction gap that needs to be bridged if we are to achieve the targets set in Paris at COP21. These LDCs and RDCs would form the basis of targets and delivery plans for Local and Regional Governments to lead on the reduction of emissions in their own areas. The good news is that the EU Committee of the Regions voted to include the development of this proposal in the work plan they are putting to the European Commission. Hopefully the EU Commission will adopt the idea. Local, Regional and devolved governments have many opportunities to reduce emissions through transport and planning policies and even by specifying higher energy efficiency standard on buildings that they procure and land that they own. The scope for action at the local level is immense. Never have the words 'Think Global Act Local' been more relevant.\nThe local level in the UK was simply not involved or consulted in any way on the Nationally Determined Contributions that were presented by the UK as part of our COP21 emissions reduction figure. Anecdotally this is the case right the way across the EU and is an issue I've raised many times in Brussels in my role on the ENVE Commission of EU Committee of the Regions. I have also raised the matter directly with the EU Commissioner responsible for EU Climate Change policy Miguel Canete.\nI await to see whether the EU Commission decide to adopt the development of Locally Determined Contributions in their work plan but in the meantime a number of issues are making me wonder how the concept could be adopted beyond the EU. If it is regarded as a good thing then it makes sense to empower the local level to take positive action from everywhere from Kathmandu to Kirklees. It could form the structure for a positive community based movement across the globe making tackling climate change more relevant to peoples everyday lives. Another issue that has made me want to see the idea adopted beyond Europe is of course Brexit. It would be ironic indeed if I developed an idea that was adopted by the EU and then we ended up leaving, and the policy was not adopted in the UK. The third reason is of course Trump. Among many other things he is a Climate Change Denier and policies that he may adopt in his Presidency to promote fossil fuels are a threat to us all. When Bush refused to ratify the Kyoto Treaty back in 2001 politicians at the State level defied him and took action to limit emissions at their level of Government. Locally Determined Contributions to reduce emissions below that of National Governments would give structure to that defiance and pull the USA back into action at the International level, Trump or no Trump.\nI've made ICLEI the organisation also known as Local Governments for Sustainability aware of the proposal. They promote local action on climate change and other environmental initiatives. They also coordinate the Global Covenant of Mayors a network of Local Governments championing action on Climate Change. They could be the initial adopters of Locally Determined Contributions testing out the concept and developing the organisational architecture needed to deliver the cumulative emissions savings we need to achieve. The EU's key partner in promoting the Global Covenant of Mayors is the EU Committee of the Regions.

At the same time they agreed targets for carbon emissions reduction at the national level these were called the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The problem is that the NDCs agreed fall short of what is required to deliver the carbon savings we need to deliver a 2 degree of less rise in temperature. So we need more action to ensure we achieve the reductions in emissions necessary.\nEstablishing Locally Determined Contributions (LDCs) and/or Regionally Determined Contributions (RDCs) could be an important step in bridging the emissions gap. Actions at the local and regional level can make an important contribution towards reducing emissions through policies to promote public transport and electric vehicles. Planning policies to ensure higher energy performance standards in buildings or even reforestation projects. All these areas and more fall under the competencies of many Local and Regional Authorities in the EU. Working with the EU Commission through their work programme to develop the concept of LDCs and RDCs could provide the stimulus and structure needed across the EU for emission reduction plans that start from the bottom up. This would give substance to the 'Think Global and Act Local' approach needed to deliver COP21's higher aspirations.\nThe EU Committee of the Regions could play a key role in developing and promoting LDCs and RDCs further raising their relevance and profile among Local and Regional Decision makers. Once LDCs and RDCs are established as a reality we can use our global links through the Covenant of Mayors to spread the concept and the action needed to deliver these targets. We have the exciting prospect here of enabling the mobilisation of climate reduction action on the ground. Ambitious targets on their own are not enough LDCs and RDCs will give tangible goals for us all to work together to achieve.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2017_04_no-fracking-way-beginning_html/content_1325.html": "The No Fracking Way was inspired by Leo Sayer though I'm not sure to this day that he knows it. Eclectic though my musical tastes are I'm not your natural Leo Sayer fan. He doesn't make me 'feel like dancing' but I came across a song of his on Ŷoutube called 'No Fracking Way' a rock anthem in support of the Austalian Anti Fracking Movement. I immediately learnt things such as Leo Sayer had moved to Australia, he didn't like Fracking and he could knock together a tune that I did quite like. Then it occurred to me, \"What if there was a real No Fracking Way like the Pennine Way or the Wolds Way?\" This would be a Way where you could walk between 2 relevant Fracking points.\nAt the time we had 2 approved Fracking sites in the North of England. The Planning Application to allow Fracking at Preston New Road, near Blackpool had been rejected by Lancashire County Council but they had been overruled by the Conservative Government in Westminister displaying their customary lack of respect for local democracy. No such minor inconveniences in North Yorkshire as the Conservative County Council did the bidding of their Whitehall masters and passed the plans despite huge local opposition.\nI had attended the first day of the 2 day planning meeting in Northallerton to decide whether Fracking was to be allowed near the quiet village of Kirby Misperton. The evidence provided by those opposing was considerable and compelling on health, transport, climate change and other grounds. North Yorkshire County Council was aware there was a lot of public interest in the Planning Application and set aside 2 areas for supporters and opposers of the Planning Application. On the left hand side of the path to the Council Offices it was like a festival. About 300 colourful protestors with banners including the 'Nana's from the Lancashire Anti Fracking movement were demonstrating not just their solidarity with us Yorkshire Folk but also showing that women of a certain age can be full of passion, vitality and political awareness. Very inspiring. So what about the right hand side of the path? Well it was fenced off like the left hand side. Sensible precaution to avoid mingling and potential trouble between opposing groups. Likewise there were portaloos provided. How thoughtful. The principle difference was the lack of anybody on that side whatsoever. You'd have thought the Fracking Company would have instructed all their employees to have a picnic there but obviously that didn't occur to them. It was pretty clear where the strength of public opinion lay. The proceedings of the meeting were transmitted to the crowd outside to the sound of cheers and boos as appropriate. In my role as Green Party Energy Spokesperson I gave interviews to the Yorkshire Post and to the BBC. In fact the BBC made me give 2 interviews as I couldn't be there for the 2nd and final day of the Planning Committee meeting. One interview was my reaction if the Planning Application was refused and the other if accepted. I was in turn jubilant and outraged. The following day I was outraged. The Conservatives and an Independent Cllr had accepted the application against the express wishes of their communities. Like many my view was this wasn't the end of the matter and was in fact was a call to arms.\nSo back to the No Fracking Way. We had our 2 points to walk between, both provided by the Conservative Party. So a check of the distance on Googlemaps indicated around 120 miles. I thought doable in about 5 days but then I am by nature fairly optimistic/foolhardy. I emailed the Yorkshire and Humber Green Party Chair Ann Forsaith with the idea and she immediately liked the concept but not my idea of doing it in January. I was keen to get the whole thing out of the way early in the year before the election season kicked in. I was due to be helping get North Yorkshire Greens in their elections in May so didn't want to be wrapped up walking for days really. I was overruled and quite right too really.\nI'd originally thought I'd be doing it on my own or I would walk one way and Green Lancashire County Councillor Gina Dowding would walk the other and we'd meet in Skipton. I did ask her but she wasn't too keen on that due to lack of availability. Now we had more time to plan and prepare, we could recruit a core team of walkers. Dates of Wednesday 8th March to Sunday 12th March were agreed as when we were to undertake the walk.\nThis thing was actually going to happen.\nThis thing was actually going to happen.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Green Party Co-Leader Jonathan Bartley was doing a visit to the Fracking site to lend his support the dedicated band of anti fracking Protectors (not just Protestors). What was very apparent was the excessive police presence on site. They lined up outside the gated entrance to the Fracking site and we lined up alongside them for a photocall with Jonathan.

You're no fun!\" To be fair I guess they were just trying to be 'professional' but they could have lightened up a bit.\nDespite the lack of Mexican Wave participation today was not a day when relations between the Police and protestors were at a particularly low point.

This is positive but what is lacking is a\nfinancially sustainable model, which can deliver improvement to homes at scale\nto a zero-energy standard. Our proposal based on the Energiesprong (energy leap)\nmodel addresses this and provides a way of building the capacity and capability\nto deliver for owner occupiers and the wider housing sector.\nEnergiesprong work with local Councils on developing a\nprogramme to deliver warmer homes through a retrofit programme delivering a\nhome which is net zero energy, meaning it generates the total amount of energy\nrequired for its heating, hot water and electrical appliances. It also provides superior indoor comfort.\nThis is achieved using prefabricated facades, insulated rooftops with solar\npanels, smart heating, and ventilation and cooling installations. A\nrefurbishment comes with a long-year performance warranty on both the indoor\nclimate and the energy performance for up to 40 years. A complete home makeover\ncan be completed in as little as a day!\nEnergiesprong are not a contractor themselves but work with\ncouncils to help procure contractors to deliver to the Energiesprong\nspecification.\nCouncils such as Nottingham, Exeter and a number of London\nBoroughs are already working together on Energiesprong projects as part of the\nRetrofit Accelerator Homes Investment Partnership. They share best practice and\nexpertise and have been successful in a number of funding bids to government drawing\nin millions to support the development of the Energiesprong model.\nHow much does it cost?\nThe cost for an initial 50 properties would be around\n£85,000/property. The expectation is that for future rounds of properties that\nthis would reduce to around £55,000/property as economies of scale are realised.\nHow is it paid for?\nThere is some initial outlay for setting up the\nEnergiesprong approach through the Housing Revenue Account but as the capital\ncosts come down the expectation is that it would become self-financing through\nlower maintenance and servicing costs e.g., no gas safety checks, lower\nmaintenance etc and through charging a comfort charge to the tenant.\nEnergiesprong guarantee that the fuel bill that the tenants pay plus the\ncomfort charge will be less than they were paying in energy costs for their\nhome before refurbishment.\nhttps://www.energiesprong.uk/\nhttps://www.energiesprong.uk/newspage/innovation-partnership-why-a-new-approach-to-retrofit-procurement-is-key-to-net-zero\nhttps://www.ukgbc.org/news/nottingham-first-to-adopt-revolutionary-energiesprong-housing-approach/\nPassivhaus or equivalent\nas standard on all Council new build projects\n5 years after the all party\nPassivhaus group recommended that the Council build its new developments to the\npassivhaus standard Kirklees is now doing a pilot project on 12 houses. The\nlack of a policy on the standard for new build housing in Kirklees at a time\nwhen we ought to be leading by example is shameful. The purpose of the pilot has\nnot been explained. What can be learnt by building in Kirklees that can’t be learnt\nfrom more progressive Councils in other parts of the country such as Exeter\nCity Council?\nThe lack of a policy is expensive as one-off projects like\nKirklees passivhaus pilot come at a cost premium. Having a high energy\nefficiency standard means developers can invest in skills locally, build\ncapacity and the capability to deliver to the passivhaus standard or\nequivalent. We should also be seeking funding from the West Yorkshire Mayoral\nCombined Authority to help pay for the 4% uplift in costs through gainshare or\nother regional funding sources.\nhttps://www.apse.org.uk/apse/index.cfm/news/articles/20181/passivhaus-exeter-city-council-leading-by-example/#\nSolar PV Panels on all\nCouncil new build projects as standard\nWith rising energy prices we need to find ways of reducing\nenergy demand in the home. So, as well as ‘fabric first’ insulation measures we\nalso should use renewables as much as possible on site.\nFunding could be sought from Combined Authority Gainshare\nfunding but failing that HRA funds could be utilised to achieve this.\n|\n| Cllr Karen Allison |\nEngaging\nthe community in climate action\nTackling climate change has got to be made real to local\npeople. Involving people in positive projects helps give people a sense of well\nbeing and not just thinking they are at the mercy of decisions by national\ngovernments and decisions at global climate summits.\nWe can help them feel empowered and involved in addressing\nthe threat to all our futures. For the next 2 years through the Place partnerships,\nwe wish to support a range of community lead projects to address climate\nchange.\nThis could be improving the energy efficiency of public\nbuildings, tree planting, projects to support biodiversity and nature-based\nflood prevention measures.\nLearning from others\nKirklees\nneeds to approach its role in addressing climate change with humility. We\nfrequently hear from Labour Cabinet members about how we are ‘the best’ in this\npolicy area. We aren’t. There are positive things happening on the climate\nagenda in Kirklees but we are not forerunners or innovators in addressing\nclimate change. The lack of a climate action plan lead to the Council getting a\n0% rating from Climate Emergency UK earlier this year. Joining the Global Covenant\nof Mayors would provide us with valuable insight and support form the\ninternational community of local and regional authorities addressing climate\nchange. It works to provide value to participating councils by mobilizing the\ncritical financing and technical assistance that members require to access\ninvestment. The Global Covenant of Mayors ensures that signatories are\ncontinuously supported in their efforts. Cities receive step-by-step guidance\nand have access to tools, materials, and a dedicated regional/national\nhelpdesk.\nhttps://www.globalcovenantofmayors.org/\nRenewable energy installations\nin schools\nThe pupils of today are the citizens of the tomorrow. Showing\nthem that renewable energy helps power their school be it from wind, solar or\nother renewables is a positive for learning and gives a demonstration of hope\nfor a better future.\nFor this scheme we will seek funding through a Community Municipal\nInvestment/ Climate Bond issue. These have been successful in West Berkshire Council\nand the London Borough of Islington and provide a return to community\ninvestors.\nhttps://info.westberks.gov.uk/wbcmi\nhttps://www.abundanceinvestment.com/invest-now/municipal-investments\nMobilising the community\nto help tackle the cost of living crisis\nThe massive hike in energy bills caused in large part by our\ndependence on fossil fuels is something that Kirklees Council needs to mobilise\nitself to address, and a single budget amendment is not the way to do that.\nThere are things we can do though and establishing a fuel poverty fund to help\nimprove the energy efficiency of people living in cold homes in the owner\noccupied and private sector. We will seek initially to fund this through a\ncharitable trust that the council will establish and seek contributions too\nthrough a variety of methods including an appeal through the Council Tax mailing.\nSimilar charitable trusts have been established in other parts\nof the country and have raised hundreds of thousands of pounds. It has initially\nbeen tried in rich Council areas in the south of England but it is worth trying\nhere to bolster and support work being done on broader poverty issues by a\nrange of third sector organisations.\n|\n| Cllr Sue Lee-Richards |\nSupporting\nactive travel\nWe lack a programme to support the development of a\nprotected cycleway network in Kirklees. This proposal will kick start that\nprogramme and we would push for a reprioritisation of the West Yorkshire\nTransport Fund away from road building and road widening projects.\nSafer streets for all\nThose of us who have tried to get traffic calming to make\npeople feel safer in their communities from speeding traffic have frequently\nbeen frustrated.\nGreen Councillors have prioritised ward budgets, public\nrealm funding and any other funds we could use to get roads traffic calmed to\nmake roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists. This has been in the face of\nlimited budgets and against Kirklees Highways policy. We need sustained funding\nto support area wide traffic calming on residential roads so we are able to\nrespond positively to community concerns, take a preventative approach to\ntraffic speeds rather than one rationed on the basis of injury accidents.\nBetter adult social care\nPositive work was carried out a few years ago by the\nAdministration helping establish Valley Care a community based care\ncooperative. Our proposal is to provide staff to support the development of\nCommunity Based Care Cooperatives in Kirklees. Members of the Care Cooperatives\nwill have a stake in the organisation they work for and the emphasis is on care\nnot the profit motive.\nWe will support the\ndevelopment of Care Cooperatives that will operate on the basis of reinvesting\nsurpluses in improving and extending the services they offer to provide a wide\nrange of care services.\nThese cooperatives will provide all staff with at least the\nliving wage, a training programme which supports development and progression.\nThis model of care provision will also play a role in raising standards in the\nwider care sector.\nhttps://www.valleycare.coop/\nUnder development – A\nKirklees Workplace Parking Levy\nNot included in this Green Party Budget amendment but we\nbelieve establishing a workplace parking levy to support public transport and\nactive travel in Kirklees is worth investigating further. Employers with fewer\nthan 10 parking spaces pay nothing at all.\nEmployers offering more than 10 parking spaces pay a fee of £1.17 per\nday per parking space. There are\nexemptions for local emergency services, NHS frontline staff and blue badge\nholders.\nIn Nottingham, the Workplace Parking Levy on employers has\nraised more than £9 million each year, with the revenue used to fund tram\ninfrastructure, a smart card scheme, electric buses and cycling facilities.\nLeicester are also looking at introducing a Workplace Parking Levy.\nKirklees Climate Commission\nWe are disappointed that there appears to be no dedicated\nbudget line in the Administration’s budget for Kirklees Climate Commision\n(KCC). Given the importance the Administration have placed on setting up KCC\nand their position as vice chair we would have expected to see a dedicated\nbudget that KCC would manage independently of the council to facilitate\nadministration, sourcing third party research and working in the communities'\ninterest.\nWe would hope that the council can rectify this outside\nthe 2022-23 budget process so the KCC can establish independence in order to\ndemonstrate a degree of self-determination that they can exercise in\ncollaboration with other partners such as the Chamber of Commerce, University\nof Huddersfield and others.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

This amendment aims to take Kirklees on to\nthe next stage of our journey to become a Net Zero Carbon Local Authority in line\nwith the 2038 target set for us through our membership of the Leeds City\nRegion. We also need to ensure that regional funding is not used to provide\ntacit support to Leeds Bradford Airport expansion plans that threaten the\nviability of our emission reduction targets.\nKirklees\nNew Build Passivhaus support fund\nCurrent informed estimates\nsuggest a 5% - 7% uplift in the capital\ncost for buildings built to Passivhaus standards when part of a consistent policy.\nThis fund would ensure that all projects commenced on Kirklees owned land were\nproperly resourced to achieve that higher energy efficiency standard, be they\nlead by the Council or part of a partnership arrangement using council owned\nland.\nKirklees\nGreen New Deal Demonstrator\nFollowing the Kirklees Warm Zone\nprogramme the next significant energy efficiency goal would be to carry out\nsignificant work on hard to treat properties particularly those with cavities\nthat can only be filled using polyurethane foam. There is also a need for a\nroom in the roof insulation project for homes that cannot receive mineral fibre\nwool insulation due to attic rooms. The aim would be to provide free insulation\nto 4000 properties as a showcase to other local authorities and national\ngovernment. Within this project we would also expect 25% of the funding to be\nallocated to properties in fuel poverty and that they benefit from a whole\nhouse approach aimed at achieving the ‘Enerphit’ standard.\nThis project will demonstrate to national government the\nbenefits and practicalities of applying ‘HS2’ levels of funding to domestic\nenergy efficiency to achieve our Paris Climate goals, address fuel poverty,\ncreate skilled jobs and regenerate local economies.\nKirklees\nNeighbourhood Housing Carbon Reduction Fund\nFollowing years of energy saving initiatives this Fund will\nbe used to carry out pathfinding work to demonstrate how we will drive down\nemissions still further to levels consistent with a 2030 zero carbon target.\nThe aim will be to achieve as close to the Enerphit standard as is practical.\nWe are also calling on Kirklees Neighbourhood Housing to transfer homes to a\nlow cost green energy provider when they become void.\nCommunity\nClimate Action projects – Place based working\nWe propose that the\nnext round of Place based working funding is to be allocated for community lead\nclimate action projects.

Now I am not for a second suggesting\nthat an energy transition means going back to some mythical prehistoric golden\nage but that the same issues which islanders of millennia gone by faced are\nstill relevant to the energy transition we are seeking today, the wealth of\nnatural resources, the independence of spirit and a desire to be separate from the\nmainland make them often enthusiastic partners in renewable energy and energy\nefficiency projects.\nToday’s\nOrkney is still a leading Island in the renewable energy\nrevolution but it is\nwind turbines and wave and tidal power that are the fuel and they now produce\n120% of their electricity needs from\nthe environment around them.\nThe EU has funded the Clean Energy for Islands Initiative to\nsupport energy transition in islands and to use them as testbeds for the Clean\nEnergy Transition more generally.\nWhy islands? – Fossil fuels can be expensive to transport\nand energy connections to the mainland can also be prohibitively pricey. Using\nlocally sourced renewable energy reduces dependency on fossil fuel imports.\nIslands by their nature are close to the sea and could take advantage of wave\nand tidal power and of course wind and solar energy just like anywhere else.\nSpecialist skills in maintenance and management may not be\neasily available but large scale renewable energy installations can give new\nopportunities for locals not just in installation but also in the repairs and\nongoing maintenance that all energy systems require. So the same boats which\nmay be used for local fishing and providing support to oil platforms may be the\nsame ones that provide maintenance to offshore wind turbine installations and\neven tourist trips to see these massive wonders of engineering close up.\nClean energy transition in small/medium island is a complex\nissue due to geographical boundaries, the condition of the energy network, the\ncost of the fuels to be imported, the difficulty in reaching critical mass and\neconomies of scale.\nWe have to recognise that the size of some islands make\neconomies of scale for significant capital intensive energy generation prohibitive which is where EU funding can help\nand be deployed appropriately to pump-prime renewables that provide a sustainable\nfuture for the communities they serve\nThese factors need taking into account and we need to make\nthe most out of the strong sense of\nbelonging that can characterise many island communities so community ownership\nand community share offers for renewable energy technologies fit well with the\npsyche of islanders who have the means to participate but also offer\nopportunities for publicly owned energy generation by the Local Authorities and\nCouncils responsible for public services.\nThe quadruple helix approach is critical where public\nservices, industry, academia and crucially citizens are directly involved in\nreaching solutions that fit best with an islands approach that can be tailor\nmade to meet their energy needs that also utilises the abundant resources\naround them.\nIt is of course a good thing to help islands achieve a\ndecarbonised economy but what we learn in the process will inform how we\napproach decarbonising mainland communities more widely on the mainland as well\nbecause ultimately we all live on an island.\nMonday, 17 June 2019\nOpen letter to Members of West Yorkshire Combined Authority - Will the WYCA declare a meaningful declaration of a climate emergency?\nTo members of West Yorkshire Combined Authority\nMany councils in the Leeds City Region have declared a\n‘Climate Emergency’. This follows the stark message from the Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change that we have only 11 years to bring our greenhouse gas\nemissions down to levels that will keep the global temperature rise to a\nsurvivable 1.5%. This clear warning requires action from every level of\ngovernment including the West Yorkshire Combined Authority (WYCA).\nWYCA is responsible for significant investment in\nactivities that promote economic activity, including the Leeds City Region\nLocal Growth Deal. WYCA has a strong focus on ‘Inclusive Growth’, but will the\neconomic activity we generate be both economically and environmentally\nsustainable? Can we demonstrate that all the activity that WYCA generates will\nreduce emissions? Can we demonstrate by how much? Can WYCA demonstrate how it\nwill use its leadership role to reduce emissions amongst its partners in the\nregion?\nCurrently there appears to be no rigorous assessment of\nthe impact on greenhouse gas emissions of the decisions of the Investment\nCommittee. In our opinion, given the significant funding of transport and road\nschemes by the Investment Committee, a full climate impact assessment should be\nproduced for such projects before decisions are made to proceed with them or\nnot.\nWe are, of course, aware of the valuable work being\ncarried out by the Leeds City Region Green Economy Panel; but we need to look\nat all the activity being generated by WYCA in totality to ensure it has a\npositive impact on climate emissions and one that is consistent with the COP21\nParis Climate Goals.\nYours sincerely\nCllr Andrew Cooper – Kirklees Council\nCllr Karen Allison – Kirklees Council\nCllr Sue Lee-Richards – Kirklees Council\nCllr Ann Forsaith - Leeds City Council\nCllr Anne Blackburn – Leeds City Council\nCllr David Blackburn – Leeds City Council\nCllr Kevin Warnes – Bradford City Council\nCllr Martin Love – Bradford City Council\nCllr Andy D’Agorne – York City Council\nCllr Denise Craghill – York City Council\nCllr David Taylor – York City Council\nCllr Rosie Baker – York City Council\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",

So we started to see what could be done. In the meantime I had been asked by the Green Party if there were any good examples of positive things Green Councillors had managed to do during the Covid crisis. This looked like a good example so on Thursday I appeared in a Green Party Political broadcast that went out on national TV. There I was in my kitchen over Zoom and I said the words,\n\"In Kirklees, Green Councillors saw that younger pupils were missing out on vital IT equipment to enable them to learn from home. They weren't being helped by government or council schemes so we stepped in to help using our local budgets.\"\nThe next day I get an email from Labour Councillor and Cabinet Member for Education Carole Pattison\n\"Andrew, I hope you read or have read the briefing that I am\nputting out to all councillors about the provision of laptops to children in\nKirklees Schools. You will note that Kirklees has distributed the 3rd\nhighest number of laptops in the country and that we are providing an extra\n1000 plus out of the council’s budget for them, your statement during your\nbroadcast last night was completely at odds with this. If any schools in your\nward are in need then please point them in the direction of the Learning\nService because we are trying to make sure that all children in Kirklees have\nequal access to the devices that they need and that none go wanting, again in\ncontradiction to what you implied last night.\nI had a number of problems with this email. The briefing was sent out in the afternoon that very same day and so of course I hadn't read it. Why would I withdraw a statement about some positive action we had taken in November because Labour had just announced a scheme 3 months after the one we did. A cynic might think that Labour's briefing went out as a hasty response to the publicity for our successful scheme and they didn't like the idea of anyone else other than themselves getting recognition for positive action. I also pointed out to Councillor Pattison that Kirklees Headteachers were not all aware of this offer from the Council as only this week we had contact from neighbouring schools asking how they could get funding for laptops like that we have provided in the Newsome Ward. It is all just a bit disappointing really. The most important thing is that children get the support they need and I am pleased that Kirklees is now providing the support that is needed. There was really no need for this petty politicking.\nHere's the 'offending' part of our broadcast.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

It is an artificial construct cobbled together after Local Government reorganisation in 1974 and named after a place in neighbouring Calderdale rather than anywhere in the actual district. As such the name pleased no one rather than alienating any particular town by naming it after another. There are regular calls to split the Council by the Public and politicians seeking to garner a few populist votes but both Labour and Tory Governments have dodged this over the years.\nA lot of time and effort has gone into preparing and running Commission events and sourcing witnesses by Kirklees officers. My own view is that we have the opportunity to come up with some radical and far reaching proposals for the Council to implement and where necessary to seek Government approval. we cannot go through this whole exercise and only propose piecemeal changes. We also need to regard what we are doing as a possible template for other cOuncils We need to be bold, forward thinking and consider doing things that have never been tried before.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2010_10_lib-dems-they-dont-like-it-up-em_html/content_832.html": "Seeing a Lib Dem motion to Kirklees congratulating the Coalition Govt on it's commitment to tackling climate change was somewhat annoying having seen cut after cut in energy programmes and broken promises associated with the new feed in tariff. So the Green Party Amendment listed many of these and annoyed the Lib Dems because of the length of the amendment but then there were a lot of cuts and broken promises. They also claimed the amendment was inaccurate but never really identified exactly what was inaccurate about it. There was an inaccuracy in the amendment. It said that funding for the Green Investment Bank had been scaled down from £6Billion to £2 Billion. Following the Spending Review yesterday this figure went down to £1Billion. Our apologies!\nThe focus of the Lib Dem motion was the new right for Councils to sell renewable electricity they generate back to the grid and this is indeed welcome but there are a few 'howevers'. One particular 'however' is the fact that a promise to extend the Feed In Tariff to early adopters of renewable technologies such as pioneers like Kirklees has now been dropped by the Coalition government. This means that thousands of pounds worth of funds that could have come to Kirklees now will not. The Lib Dems called for a Green Energy Action Plan to take advantage of the Feed In Tariffs. At no point in the debate did they mention the programmes already being planned such as the £650k worth of PV for Council Buildings or the £12 million for Council buildings, probably because they've had nothing to do with it. You can imagine however that a few months down the line a Lib Dem leaflet will appear somehow linking themselves with these developments. They do have some form in this regard. They poured scorn on the Green Party amendments for a free area based solar photovoltaic programme across Kirklees saying it was 'unaffordable' and a 'fantasy'. They are clearly not following developments in the capital financing of PV projects across the country where all the capital costs and more of the projects are being met by the feed in tariff. Indeed businesses are being set up seemingly weekly offering free PV. A Council led scheme could offer value for money and spread the benefit to households beyond those which are dead on due south with large roofs.\nAnyway for your delectation here is the Lib Dem Motion and the Green Amendment. For the record the Green amendment was defeated by the Cons and Lib Dems but was supported by many Labour Cllrs. The Lib Dem motion was passed.\nLib Dem motion\nCoalition Government's Commitment to Tackling Climate Change\nThis Council congratulates the Coalition Government for their positive commitment to tackling climate change.\nCouncil welcomes the decision by the Climate Change Secretary Chris Huhne to allow local councils to sell renewable energy to the grid, overturning a ban on this activity by the previous Government.\nCouncil recognises that we have a vital role to play in the switch to a new low carbon economy. This decision will allow us to take full advantage of the feed-in tariff and deliver long term benefits to support services delivered by this council.\nThe availability of feed in tariffs will provide this council with an opportunity to generate a significant income and reduce our energy bills via increased micro generation.\nThis Council therefore calls upon the Cabinet to urgently develop a “Green Energy Action Plan” to maximise the benefits and identify potential savings that can be delivered via the use of feed-in tariffs.\nGreen Party Amendment\nDelete all after ‘This Council’ insert\n‘questions the Coalition Government’s commitment to tackling climate change based on:-\n• the breaking of a promise by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats prior to the election to include early adopters of solar panels such as Kirklees in the Feed In Tariff\n• the abolition of the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Spatial Strategy which would have provided strong policies to encourage microgeneration in new buildings.\n• the breaking of a commitment by the Liberal Democrats not to support new nuclear power stations the cost of which will now be borne by the public.\n• the end of a commitment by the previous government to insulate all lofts and cavity walls where technically possible to 2020.\n• the abolition of the Sustainable Development Commission which actually saved the Government money.\n• Cuts of £12.6m from The Carbon Trust's grant for low carbon technology and business support funding from DECC\n• Cuts of £4.7m by cancelling final rounds of Bio-Energy Capital Grants Scheme and Bio-Energy Infrastructure Scheme\n• Cuts of £3m by reducing the scope of the Offshore Wind Capital Grants Scheme\n• Cuts of £3m from closing the Low Carbon Buildings Programme early\n• £2.9m cuts by reducing the scope of the government's Low Carbon Technology Programme\n• £1m cut to funding for development of deep geothermal energy generation\n• £700,000 cut by the closing of renewable technology trials early\n• The damage caused to the solar thermal, biomass and heat pump industry by the long period of speculation over the future of the Renewable Heat Incentive\n• The damage caused to the solar PV and small wind industry by long speculation over the future of the Feed In Tariff\n• The reported reduction in the Feed In Tariff by 10%\n• The halving in funding for Carbon Capture and Storage Projects\n• The reduction in funding from the proposed £6Billion to £2 Billion for the Green Investment Bank\n• The proposed abolition of the Warm Front scheme for Low Income households\n• The 10% increase in funding for nuclear decommissioning\n• The cancelling of the Severn Barrage which could have provided 5% of the UK's electricity needs\nThis Council has the following concerns about the Coalition Government’s ‘Green Deal’\n• An over emphasis on supermarkets as the deliverer of the Green Deal when clearly Council schemes such as the free insulation provided by Kirklees Council demonstrably deliver high numbers of measures while schemes lead by supermarkets have performed poorly.\n• The reported omission of microgeneration from the Green Deal finance package\n• A loan mechanism will not be the most cost effective way of funding low cost measures such as loft and cavity wall insulation.\nThis Council calls on the Coalition Government to ensure the Green Deal\n• makes Councils a key partner and/or deliverer of the programme.\n• enables area based approaches for the delivery of insulation and microgeneration measures\n• has a cost effective way of delivering low cost measures such as insulation measures\nThis Council calls on the Cabinet to\n• develop a free area based solar photovoltaic programme to be made available to all households where technically possible and where there is no impact on Council budgets.\n• Add carbon reduction as a 5th Council Priority\n• Develop a comprehensive action plan to reduce carbon which based including energy conservation, energy efficiency, behavioral change and green energy.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

I was a bit surprised in the last one to see Cllr Mehboob Khan make reference to the support his administration have from the Green Party and the Lib Dems. I'm a wee bit more philosophical about who we cooperate with on the Council. If your starting point is that there isn't really a lot of political difference between any of the larger parties then your chief considerations are the personalities involved, whether or not you can trust them and what you can get out of them to help further the Green Party's objectives of protecting our local and global environment.\nOur story of cooperating with the larger parties began with the 2000 budget in the February of that year when Labour needed 2 votes to get their budget through and we had 3 Councillors. That was the year we established the Renewable Energy Fund which since it was created has levered in millions of external funding. These were the dying days of a Labour administration that had been in a majority position for many years. Relations between the Greens and Labour were not good. It was due to the three seats we took off them that they lost their majority but the deal we secured was a good one and they were keen to demonstrate they were acting in good faith. You could be certain that their word would be kept.\nFollowing the local elections in 2ooo we ended up with an all party administration with all groups represented and with the Green Party responsible for Housing Policy. It didn't last long with Labour and the Conservatives falling out with the Liberal Democrat leadership who they accused of taking credit for the things that went well and sharing the blame for what went wrong. They walked away and we stayed put in a Lib Dem/Green Shared Administration. Graham Simpson was our Cabinet Member for the first couple of years and he helped steer Kirklees Council into putting its housing into an Arms Length Management Company. I followed on from Graham and we managed to get some significant initiatives up and running such as free insulation for the over 60s, planning notice signs, support for vountary Christmas Bus services etc . As time went on it became more difficult working with the Lib Dems and they were obviously running out of steam and were cracking under the strain of relentless pressure from Labour and the Tories in Council meetings. We had also had enough and felt we were getting little real progress from working with them by this point and trust was breaking down. If they had survived the 2006 election we decided the price for staying in the shared Lib Dem administration would be high in terms of our policy demands and if they weren't met we would more than happily walk away.\nWhen the Tories came to power our approach was pretty much the same as it would have been for the Lib Dems- the conditions for our support would be pretty high. We are a party of the progressive left and the idea of the Tories running the council did not really appeal to me or our party members. We ended up asking for, among other things, a £21million free insulation scheme to make the rather underpowered Lib Dem inspired Warm Zone scheme actually work. The Tories agreed ( the reasons how and why are another story) but they were as good as their word and our proposal became the properly funded Kirklees Warm Zone. Its been a combination of annoying and amusing since then to watch every Party on the council claim it was down to them. The Tories actually turned out to be not as rabid as they were in opposition and for their first couple of years did a pretty good job before they tore themselves apart trying to make the Building Schools for the future programme build a Birkenshaw High School, against evidence from officers on the educational benefits and additional costs (again another story).\nSo we come back to where this short tale began with a Labour administration. They were however brought in essentially because the Tories had to be removed. 'Trust' was an issue for us with Labour at the start but so far so good.\nIf I've learnt anything from the last ten years it is being clear about what you want from politics and make sure your proposals are significant enough to warrant you putting your support behind whichever Party is prepared to put themselves in the Kirklees Cabinet. Not knowing what you want is fatal for politicians they lose direction, focus and become vulnerable to circumstance and crisis. I've seen a Party try to run the Council with no clear programme and you start wondering why they went to all that effort of trying to get elected in the first place.",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2017_10_locally-determined-contributions-view_html/content_603.html": "| With Jenny Jones at Croftlands, Newsome in 2014 |\nThis was the question:-\nTo ask Her Majesty’s Government whether they will support the proposal by the EU Committee of the Regions to establish locally determined contributions and regionally determined contributions to the greenhouse gas emissions targets set by the Paris Agreement on climate change.\nThe response was very interesting\nUK greenhouse gas emission targets under the EU framework and our domestic Climate Change Act cover the whole of the UK. Devolved Administrations and Local Authorities also already have their own emissions targets and ambitions, and with wider actors in the UK, have an important role to play in contributing to UK emissions reductions.\nThe reason the response was interesting was because it just wasn't true. Local Councils don't have emission targets unfortunately and many are too busy dealing with the day to day job of delivering basic services with massive funding cuts to have higher ambitions on climate change. So as it wasn't true I thought it warranted another question.\nTo ask Her Majesty's Government, further to the Written Answer by Lord Prior of Brampton on 15 February (HL5165), what are the greenhouse gas emissions targets, broken down by local authority; and what assessment they have made of progress against each of those targets over the last seven years.\nand the response\nLocal Authorities are not mandated to have greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets. However, many cities and places have set their own targets following the Paris Agreement. Over 30 places are members of international agreements such as the Covenant of Mayors and, within the UK, over 70 places have now signed up to UK100 with a political commitment to use 100% clean energy by 2050.\n\"Over 30 places\" well there are 418 Principal Councils in the UK so it is hardly a comprehensive list of Local Authorities that are signed up to the Covenant of Mayors and clearly the second answer from Lord Brampton contradicts his first answer. The UK 100 mentioned has a worthy aspiration but I doubt that many councils have any detailed plans about how they will actually acheive this. I'm guessing they will be hoping national strategies deliver this for them. My conclusion is that there is still a strong case for adopting Locally Determined Contributions in the UK and the Government would lose nothing by recognising that too. In fact it may help them acheive their Nationally Determined Contributions towards the Paris Climate Agreement.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

These are some of the most important days of many people's lives so really important that these are done right and professionally.\nLeft Bank and its cafe are open 7 days a week and when we went it was full of young people, mainly students, using the Wi-Fi, having a coffee and doing coursework. Through the week a variety of different groups use the space such as Knit and Natter groups, life drawing classes, older persons art groups, pottery classes, break dancers. It is a vibrant hub for the community, and they have a rich programme of events including Beer Festivals, Arts Festivals, 70s nights, Christmas Parties and indoor 'car boot' sales.There is a mix of seating from comfy settees, desk space and a few pews. There's a recognition of their heritage as a church with a pulpit, the old organ and a number of other features remaining in place. You can buy a house plant or two there, a birthday card and paintings from local artists.\nThe look of the place is quite funky with attractive lighting installations and bright colourful murals. You would be quite happy to spend a few relaxing hours hanging out there with a coffee and a nice piece of cake.\nOne key bit of advice we had was \"be generous\" to organisations with time and space. There should be space for income generating activity but also free space to organisations which have a lot to give to the community and add to the activity and vibrancy of the place.\nA big thanks to Sue Jennings from Left Bank who gave us a real insight into the sort of things we need to be looking at in The Newsome Centre's Business Plan.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Then came Ed Carne to join us at the starting point that day. Ed told us how he was always walking round here and knew the paths really well. Ed talked to Nigel Corser (ex Army) and they nodded in agreement a lot while looking and pointing at the map. Ed knew what he was doing. Ed wore a bushmans hat! I had been usurped as the Fellowship of the Frack's navigator and felt pretty good about it! Colin Noble on the other hand did not feel good. He had applied 'Compeed' to his blisters the previous day and then removed them in the evening. Compeed acts like a second skin and isn't supposed to be removed like a plaster. Consequently Colin's feet had gushed blood rather spectacularly. He decided to soldier on and recompeed at the earliest opportunity.\nWe set off and soon our footpath entered a muddy farmyard as I passed the farmer I asked him \"Is this the way to Blackpool?\" and smiled. Then we were crossing boggy fields, went over a river and started working our way up the hill and foumd our way onto another farm driveway which became a country lane and at the top of the lane we met up with a group of about half a dozen Greens from Ilkley and surrounds. They were going to be with us all the way to Lancashire. We were back on country roads again and had saved ourselves a huge detour.\nIt was now a tale of hills. Down we went into Ilkley around lunchtime and we went into Boots to buy up all their Compeed, pain killers, cushioned insoles, that sort of thing. As we got to the main street we were greeted by a big crowd of new walkers plus a table with tea, coffee and cake. My feet were tired. I didn't know before this walk that feet could get tired but they undoubtedly were and we had another half of the day to go. So after posing with a huge banner our much enlarged group set off towards Silsden and back\n| Clive Lord - No Way Fracking! |\nHeading out of Silsden along a canal was a novelty and a nice break from the traffic, not that we had seen that much on the roads we had taken for most of the day. Then we were heading up another long deserted road. I remember this from the recce I had done with Ann Forsaith in January and of course it seemed much shorter in the car but I knew that near the top of the hill was a sign saying 'Welcome to Pendle' and therefore Lancashire and shortly beyond that a nice looking Pub. When one of the people who joined us that day pointed out a footpath we might take that might be a little shorter and take us all the way into Colne I could see us losing the picture of us entering Lancashire. I decidedfor good or ill we would plough on. It was a very long way and the group must have spread out over a mile. By the time we all reached the 'Welcome to Pendle' sign people in the Core Group , now at the end of Day 3 were exhausted and some us were very clearly in considerable discomfort.\n| Lancashire border - no checkpoint! |\n| Janet Russell |\nTime to take stock. It had been tough and the Core Group were clearly not all in the best of shape. My chafing required a wee bit of attention. Colin's feet were shot and he clearly wouldn't be walking tomorrow and was assigned to help Ann in the support vehicle. Otherwise we were all up for it. Getting into Lancashire, going past half way and the warmth and care we'd had at the end of the day were all good reasons to carry on. Back to Andy Brown's, topping up the Compeed, the careful application of soothing creams, on with the compression tights and sleep. Onward to deepest Lancashire tomorrow.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2013_02_flooding-evidence-to-efra-select_html/content_895.html": "I’m just back from my appearance in the Houses of Parliament on the EFRA Select Committee looking into the hot issue of flooding. Since becoming the Chair of the Local Government Association’s Inland Flood Risk Working Group we have wrestled with many aspects of central and local government approaches to the issue just as some of the worst flooding events ever experienced were hitting towns and vilages up and down the country. In all around 7,800 homes were flooded and some more than once.\nOne of the first issues raised by the Select Committee's Chair Ann Mcintosh MP was whether or not the funding provided by government was meeting the need for flood prevention measures. I pointed out the fact that the additional £120 million provided by government for schemes was a ‘drop in the ocean’ and that the flood alleviation scheme for Runnymede alone would cost around £200million. I was asked about the effectiveness of the Bellwin scheme - central government funding for flood hit councils. After a flood event such as hit Calderdale last year was not unusual to see government ministers giving interviews mentioning how central government emergency funds will be brought in under the Bellwin scheme to help out local Councils. To qualify for the scheme the damage must cost more than around 2% of a Councils annual budget. Millions of pounds worth of funds have to be incurred by Councils before they can be considered for Bellwin assistance. There are also an awful lot of items not covered by the Bellwin scheme such as damage to rads and infratructure. Calderdale incurred costs of around £2.5million following the Hebden Bridge/Todmorden Floods but under the Bellwin formula only qualified for around £80k. I was also probed about how Partnership funding was working. This is where central government funding for flood defences is matched against other sources such as private and Council funding. In many places there are no large companies to put their hand in their pocket to cover the cost of defences so often costs can fall on cash strapped councils or private householders. It is possible that some worthy schemes where there is a need for flood defences might fail due to lack of support funding and less worthy schemes are prioritised.\nAfter making these points one of the MP’s on the Committee (Conservative I’m guessing) asked me what I would cut to pay for flood defences. As he was asking (and I was trying to be helpful) I suggested cutting the billions of pounds being allocated to HS2 and Trident. He didn’t probe deeper. Maybe he agreed.\nHere's a link to video footage of the meeting\nhttp://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=12535\nGood work on flooding, Andrew. Remind them it would be possible to remove the need for £Billions in flood defences, but the answer is at European level or beyond.\nReplyDelete",

You knew exactly what you were getting with David. No\ndouble dealing, just straightforward and honest. Sure sometimes he’d get things\nwrong, he would do things I didn’t agree with, but you could trust him and trust\ncan be a rare and precious commodity especially in the world of politics. I\nwish him a speedy recovery.\nNow to today and we are offered a new Leader of the Council\nand as a hung Council it needs to be someone who can secure the trust, support\nor acquiescence of at least one other Political Group on this Council. I have\nto say to you today that Councillor Pandor will not have that support from\nCouncillors in the Green Party and Independent Group. Trust is vital in the role\nof a Leader. Trust in their ability and trust in what they say. We understand\nthat the Labour Group were told by their new Leader some days ago that our\nsupport for his administration had been secured. It had not. If a Leader cannot\ntell the truth to their own political colleagues, no matter how unpalatable\nthat might be, then how can he be trusted with the Leadership of this Council?\nThis bid to lead Kirklees Council is not built on\nprinciples, policies or a programme. It is a bid constructed of personal\nambition, fuelled by promises and secured by patronage. It cannot stand. It\ncannot be supported.\nKirklees Council is on the edge of a precipice, our budgets\nare declining and the longer we leave the administration in this chaos, the\nharder it will be for any administration to fix. We have a Draft Local Plan\nthat, if delayed, could leave our communities at the mercy of developers. Labour Members as the largest group on this\nCouncil have a special responsibility to recognise the reality of this crisis,\nto heal your internal wounds quickly, hard though I know that is, and to come\nback with an answer that unites not just your own Party but that of the Council\nas a whole. If you don’t then it is not just this Council as a body that you\nwill be letting down but all the communities of Kirklees.\nI say directly to Labour Members and particularly to those\nwho may have supported Cllr Pandor that he cannot lead this Council. Your\nloyalty to your Leader has been demonstrated by you putting him forward today\nas your Groups nominee to lead our Council. If he does not succeed in that, then\nthat reality has changed, all bets are off. The Labour Party will need to come\nup with a new solution and quickly. We will help you where we can to secure a\nstable administration. It is the responsibility of every Kirklees Councillor of\nwhatever Party today to help achieve that.\nThis is no 'Game of Thrones'. This is 'Game Over'.\nThis is no 'Game of Thrones'. This is 'Game Over'.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

So it was a very well informed gathering and an ideal place to get acquainted with the issues. I put the officers from DEFRA and the EA at their ease by telling them I was keen for us to have the meetings questions put to them and answered in a Select Committee fashion with lots of probing to get to the nub of concerns. They seemed suitably pleased by this and they defended the government as best they could.\nOne real bone of contention was the issue of how Insurance Companies approached flood risk. Insurance companies are approaching the insurance of properties for flood risk not on the basis of flood risk but on postcode. So you could have one property which could be at low/no risk of flooding and then further down the road a property at high risk. Both could be insurance blight areas. In fact this issue affects hundreds of properties in Runnymede which are completely unaffordable to insure for many householders and it would appear that their local MP isn’t desperately fighting their corner on this issue. Following flooding you would assume that Insurance companies would be keen to make areas ‘resilient’ to flooding in future by getting electrical sockets raised and having flood resistant flooring installed. You’d be wrong as Insurance Companies generally want things restoring to their previous state including low electrical sockets etc. Bonkers. I have suggested that there could be a 'green deal' type finance approach to paying for flood hardening measures for 'at risk' homes. A 'Wet Deal'?\nThe first actions I have asked for is a letter to the Association of British Insurers about the issue and a request for a meeting with the Minister along with other concerned Councillors and officials.",

Residents had long complained about the need for measures to slow down traffic much of which used it as a residential rat run into the town centre or to the ring road. Walls had been demolished by cars trying to take the dangerous corner at the junction of Oastler and Springwood Avenues at high speed. Thanksfully by more luck than judgement nobody was killed or injured. Its interesting that when the Greens were first breaking through in the Newsome Ward the Labour Party said warned that if we were elected we would put traffic calming everywhere. We haven't but we have certainly championed a number of traffic calming schemes around the ward and it remains a high priority for.

When the community is working well it gives people certainty, continuity and security. The Conservative and Lib Dems have bashed Labour over bankers, the economic crisis and selling british gold cheap but what the government have done to our communities has gone largely unmentioned. Think back ten years ago to the community that perhaps you live in. How many Post Offices, shops and pubs have closed. What has happened to the bus services that have served those communities? Are they as regular or frequent as they were? Do they still exist? Was there a local Housing Office or Library? Is it still there or under threat with public spending cuts?\nOf course the economy is important but it is the impact of government policy on the places we live that matters to people in the most immediate way, because it affects all of us in our everyday lives.\nWe have to turn this around and government and Kirklees policy should be directed more at supporting and protecting locally owned shops and businesses and public services in our comunities not big deals with big supermarkets that threaten those local businesses survival.\nUltimately the 'big idea' is not the big deal with a supermarket chain, such as the Kirklees deal with Tescos, but one which places the importance of locally owned and managed shops and services at the forefront. Thinking at the smallest level gives us the biggest gains as a society and as such the strength of our communities should be at the centre of government policy not an afterthought.\n(Picture - Green Valley Grocer - Slaithwaite)\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nAn interesting post but attempting to delineate 'the community' in a spatial sense is problematic. Just what do you mean by 'community' or by 'local'? Do you mean the nearest shops and community centre, a neighbourhood, a Council ward, the whole town?\nReplyDeleteI agree with your point about certainty, continuity and security. These are the foundations to the sense of 'attachment' we have to a place. But at what spatial level is this provided? There are only two studies that I am aware of that have compared the attachment that people have to places at different spatial levels. Both found that residents felt more attached to their own homes and their city than they did to their neighbourhood (I will forward on the PDF's if you are interested).\nAlso, is there any independent, reliable evidence that would suggest that the residents of Huddersfield feel less security and certainty in their community now than they did at the beginning of New Labour's term in office?\nGareth, Newsome\nFair point Gareth, Neighbourhood would probably have made more sense.\nReplyDeleteThe points about attachment are really the way I see it and what people say to me around the Huddersfield area. They will have an attachment to their neighbourhood, Newsome, Taylor Hill etc and this is reinforced by the local shop, pub where they have opportunities to talk to their neighbours in a neutral place as well as simply having services on hand. I'd be interested. Be interested in the PDFs.\nThere's lots at play in communities except just facilities and I think the work of the Newsome Community Forum and its sub groups is a useful counter to the negative impact of loss of facilities. So any empirical evidence on peoples security and certainty in their community should ask why they feel the way they do.\nAll the best. Leaflets to deliver.",

The impact on the services provided by the council cannot be overstressed, Roads that are already poor will get even worse, costs for adult social care will rise, funding for vulnerable children is uncertain, libraries and museums are threatened with closure. At a time when Kirklees is facing its greatest ever crisis it makes no sense to have a minority Labour Administration having the responsibility alone of trying to protect the services that people across the district rely on, need and value.\nIt is all too easy for opposition parties to criticise from the sidelines with the comforting knowledge that they have no responsibility for any council decisions that are made, while knowing that if they were in charge they would be faced with exactly the same dilemmas. At times of real crisis political parties should put aside differences and work together on solutions that are built around consensus and the common good.\nThere are no easy answers or silver bullets to address the problems that the Council is facing. That is why every Councillor, of which ever political party, has a duty to want to responsibility to get the best outcomes possible for local people. For these reasons we are calling for a shared All Party Administration of Kirklees Council. This proposal will not work if one Party decides it prefers the comfort of opposition and we would only consider being part of a Kirklees Cabinet if all Parties represented on Kirklees took part.\nI have today written to the other Party Group Leaders on Kirklees Council requesting a meeting to discuss our proposal ENDS\nA blog by Green Party Councillor Andrew Cooper about Green Politics, action on Climate Change, Kirklees Council and our activity to improve the local and global environment (and also anything that I fancy talking about) Promoted and published by A Cooper, 76 Brockholes Lane, Holmfirth HD9 7EB\nWednesday, 27 August 2014\nSunday, 10 August 2014\nSome thoughts on the House of Lords\nCongratulations to Ex Kirklees Lib-Dem Leader Cllr Kath Pinnock on her elevation to the House of Lords. I'm sure she will make valuable contributions to political life there and be a working peer. I look forward to hearing her official title' Baroness Pinnock of Cleckeaton' maybe? The latest round of Lords appointments brought the not unexpected controversey, a number of big donors to the Tory Party got their rewards by being appointed to 'The Lords'. For the Lib Dems this latest round of appointments takes their numbers over the 100 mark. The Green Party has 1 member in the House of Lords, 'Baroness Jones of Moulscomb' or Jenny to her freinds. Moulscomb is the name of the Council Estate in Brighton where she grew up and when she was 'signed up' for the Lords she wore a fake ermine gown for the ceremony so really proud of Jenny for sticking to her principles on that one.\nDid I mention 'principles'? It is always interesting talking about 'principles' and the House of Lords. A few thoughts. Recently in the news we had the positive news that women could soon become Bishops in the Church of England as that institution comes kicking and screaming into the 20th Century just as we are well into the 21st. What I found bizarre was the lack of much mention that this progressive move would mean that these new women bishops would find themselves automatically appointed to the archaic unelected House of Lords. OK quick quiz question, 'Which 2 countries allow religious priests into their legislative bodies?' Ok you know one, it's the UK right! The other is another beloved well respected democracy, yes you guessed it, Iran! Is there any logic to having people in the House of Lords, who represent a body that as a central tenet believes in the supernatural? Well they have gone through an election process of sorts from within their membership unlike many Tory donors . I'm always happy when someone stands up to the many Government policies which I regard as regressive and that is often Bishops in the absence of many political defenders. It does however make me feel uncomfortable that these champions of the underprivileged seem about as relevant as the wizards in Hogwarts Castle. They are generally benign but the fact that I am reluctant to see them go is more a reflection of the awful state of our backwards democracy more than any logical argument for their retention. in our legislature.\nThis brings us, (on the subject of principles and the House of Lords) to House of Lords reform, the Coalition Agreement and the Liberal Democrats. It was going to be great, well better anyway. We were going to have a wholly (or mainly) elected second chamber elected by proportional representation with 450 members. The draft bill when it went in front of Parliament in 2011 was by no means perfect. There were still appointments and 12 'Lords Spiritual'. Ultimately 91 Tory MPs defied their Government Whip and Labour didn't exactly cover themselves in glory by effectively allowing the status quo to continue.So it was dead in the water and so much for the Coalition Agreement. Future appointments to the House of Lords were to reflect Party shares of the votes at the 2010 General Election but definitely not the 2014 Euro Election where the Greens beat the Lib Dems. I'd like to see more Greens in the House of Lords influencing policy but I find it bizarre that the archaic House of Lords is allowed to continue in existence as well as still having elections by the 'first past the Past system.

Just got back from Cambridge Folk Festival and it was their 50th Anniversary bash. Its probably around the 10th time or more our family have been there. It is the usual mix of good company, food, music and beer that make it a relaxing 4 days. It's not as big as Glastonbury but still thousands of people go and research has shown that it is better for the local economy than Mr Eavis's Glastonbury making a cool £1.7million for the local economy each year for the Cambrige economy. So any lessons for Kirklees Council here on holding events to raise cash for the Council? Of course any Council can selflesssly support events for the community which may well come at a cost to the Council but have a wider benefit to the Local Economy. How much Councils could and should support such events when budgets for vital services are threatened by the Coalition Government cuts agenda is a reasonable question. In the 2013/14 Cambridge City Council budget book it quotes a net income from the Folk Festival of £237,000 from the paying punters like myself so a useful sum. To reduce the cost of the Festival the Council are looking at transferring the organisation of the Festival to a charity which they reckon will save the Council around £1 million over 5 years. Obviously there are real concerns about the transfer of jobs and pay and conditions issues for employees but the attraction for the Council in ensuring jobs remain, council budgets are healthier and the festival continues are very real.\nHuddersfield does have a Festival coming up called Huddlefest in Greenhead Park on Saturday 20th September. This is not a Council event but is using council facilities, lets hope it is a success. Inspiral Carpets and Aswad are playing and here's a link http://huddlefest.co.uk/\nAnd here's 'The Melodic' a band I came across in one of the lesser stages at Cambridge in 'The Den'. They are really good.\nHuddersfield does have a Festival coming up called Huddlefest in Greenhead Park on Saturday 20th September.

What amazes me is that Labour MPs can simply\nfall in line with cuts that could adversely affect some of the most vulnerable\npeople.

Yet again the vast\nmajority of Labour MPs, including Barry Sheerman, voted against and the motion\nwas lost.\nWhat is Labour for any more? If Labour MPs can't stand up for public services\nor oppose nuclear weapons what makes them fundamentally any different from a\nLib Dem or even a Tory MP. Over the next few months we will see a lot of sound\nand fury from Labour saying how terrible the Coalition Parties are, but in\nreality they are little different.

Newsome Councillors Andrew Cooper, Karen Allison, Sue Lee-Richards and Sue's husband Gideon will all be volunteering on the long running service on New Years Day\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper who is a volunteer driver said,\n“I remember the first one we ran in 1992 which we ran as a protest against the removal of services over the holiday period. Since then some services have been resumed in some areas, including Newsome in recent years on Boxing Day”\n“I really enjoy doing the bus service each year and it is now very much part of my holiday routine. At this time of year there can be limited public transport services, trains from Berry Brow are often cancelled and taxi journeys can be expensive so people who use the minibus we operate really do value it. We put timetables on bus stops and in local shops so people are aware of our schedule. The service is free to use but donations towards fuel costs are always welcome. Our thanks to Kirklees who provide the minibus while we provide drivers, stewards and fuel A copy of our timetable is below.”\nThe service provided are on New Year’s Day connects Berry Brow, Newsome into Town and on the Huddersfield Royal Infirmary.”\nPolling Day is tomorrow and why are we here? Essentially it was Jeremy Corbyn's decision. Without the Labour Party's support we would not be having a General Election now.\nAs was correctly reported Corbyn had again and again called for a General Election and had been called 'frit' and in particular 'chicken' a number of times and when, in recent months, Boris Johnson offered him one he resisted. Now anyone who has watched the 'Back to the Future' Trilogy will know that Marty McFly's achilles heel was reacting poorly when been called 'chicken'. It usually didn't end well. for Marty. Obviously Corybyn didn't watch it. So in the run up to Corbyn's decision to back a General Election they had someone following him around in a chicken costume and constant jibing of a 'chicken' nature in Parliament. It was almost as if they wanted him to react and sadly he did. He fell into a very obvious trap\nSo what should you do if you are Jeremy Corbyn before you agree to a General Election?\n\"A clear, agreed and easy to understand position on Brexit that appeals to core supporters who were Leave voters?\" - Check/Not Check?\n\"All that Anti Semitism issue addressed?\" - Check/Not Check?\n\"Contact with all other non Tory parties to agree a common strategy for the Election Campaign?\" - Check/not check?\nIt was all pretty much \"Not check\" wasn't it? So anyone with any political nous would say a big \"No\" to a General Election at this time. The problem was that Jezza was calling for a General Election at every opportunity over the last couple of years. Really the only way of addressing the Brexit Conundrum was by another referendum. It was through the 'magic' of a referendun that we created the Brexit turmoil, so only using the same 'magic' could you defeat it.\nCorbyn who had made his hallmark his conviction politics based on strong principles had become equivocal on Brexit. His message was far too nuanced and certainly wasn't the simple, and yes far too simplistic, \"Get Brexit Done\" message that the Tories have successfully pedaled for the last few weeks.\nWhat has irritated me during this campaign is the pressure Greens have been under by Labour Party activists not to stand in marginal seats. There has been no pretence that there would be any form of reciprocation from them. Not even a token gesture of standing aside in Caroline Lucas's seat of Brighton Pavillion. Their approach has shown contempt for the Green Party, our supporters and the validity of our politics. They have also made a gross assumption that non-Tory votes are their votes and, though they don't support Proportional Representation they believe we should deny people their Green First Preference on the assumption that Labour is their Second Preference. Though I respect a lot of individual Labour members I find this hugely arrogant and indicative of a wrongful sense of entitlement that has been with Labour for a very long time. As such I did all I could not to indulge them and to get as many Green Candidates to stand as possible. Others did indulge them and they had their justifications for their actions. Justifications I do not share.\nSo here we are, the dawn of battle. I can't help but think of King Theoden in 'The Two Towers' before the battle of Helms Deep when he faced almost certain defeat and he is supported despite his own doubts by his devoted uncritical subjects. Corbyn and Momentum? perhaps? In the end Theoden won but that was with help of others. Elves, a wizard and the occasional dwarf. Corbyn has no others to call upon. The Green Party's role in relation to Labour would only be as unquestioning subjects with no rights or will of our own. Simply the providers of a grudging endorsement to our supporters. Ironic for Corbyn I guess as someone who is undoubtedly opposed to the monarchy to have such an approach.\nThe best we can hope for is a hung parliament and I hope Greens have a significant influence in that if we are lucky enough for that to occur . If not we are in for 5 years of a Tory Government lead by someone who has, demonstrably, no respect for the truth. As far as I'm concerned Boris may as well be a different species as I, and so many others, have so little in common with him. He has surrounded himself with people who have made a huge catalogue of contemptible utterances that I and many others abhor. In many ways they should be easy to take apart for a competent principal opposition party but sadly not this one.\nIf Labour do lose they will blame a lack of resources, the mainstream media etc but ultimately they need to take a long hard look in the mirror as in reality they will have no one to blame but themselves",

LDCs were to give the ability for Local and Regional Authorities to set their own carbon reduction targets in conjunction with Nationally Determined Contributions which are the responsibility of national governments. This would establish a clearer role for sub-national bodies like Councils and Devolved Administrations in taking action to reduce carbon emissions and help towards achieving the Paris Climate goals. I had some excellent support from staff at the EU Committee of the Regions and Locally and Regionally Determined Contributions were backed by the LGMA, the body that represented Local Government globally.\nIn the end we didn't get LDC's adopted but we had moved the debate significantly and there was a statement in the final text on how to assess Nationally Determined Contributions that referred to \"preparing implementation plans to include domestic institutional arrangements, public participation and engagement with local communities”. In the UK context this basically meant Governments would have to work more closely with Councils on action to address climate change. Then (in the UK at least) nothing happened. Councils still had no official role. the UK Government continued to make statements and policy about climate change with no significant involvement with Local and Regional Authorities.\nThe Green Party made one of our goals in the run up to COP26 to push Government to set up a joint Central/Local Government Taskforce to put pressure on Government to act. Then at the end of last month the Government produced their Net Zero Strategy and in it there was a statement saying they would establish a,\n\"Local Net Zero Forum to ensure that there is direct input from local leaders. Chaired by BEIS, the Forum will be cross departmental and bring together national and local government senior officials on a regular basis to discuss policy and delivery options on net zero. The forum will build on our current engagement mechanisms through the representative bodies such as the Local Government Association (LGA), Association for Public Service Excellence (APSE), Core Cities and the Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning & Transport (ADEPT)\".\nSo a Taskforce and a success of sorts!\nI first raised the need for National and Local Governments to work more closely together in Paris at COP21 back in 2015 in a side event where I was representing the EU Committee of the Regions. So my own involvement in calling for something like this degree of cooperation is nearly 7 years old. All that really has happened, with the establishment of the Net Zero Forum is that a structure is now in place so we can have discussions, there is still a lot of actual work to do! Though the Forum will be chaired by BEIS the culture of the Forum should be that all participants come to the table as equals and that it is not dominated by national government. We need initiatives for policy change to be able to come forward from local government. After all it will be councils that will have to deliver a lot of the action needed to reduce emissions so why not allow the practitioners the chance to be the policy makers as well?\nThere is a lot to do. Changes to Building Regulations, a revised National Planning Policy Framework that takes into account climate change, addressing skills gaps and the need for a large scale domestic retrofit programme, all these need serious attention to get us on track towards a genuinely Zero Carbon Strategy for the UK.\nLets get to work!\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

This ‘interest’ is not our own but that of the Communities and Local Govt Minister Eric Pickles. He has said something along the lines of it being everyones right to have the remains of their Chicken Tikka Masala collected once a week by the Council. Many Councils, like Kirklees have transferred to bi-weekly collections for grey bins for a number of years now. This has been motivated by a desire to cut costs in response to budgetary pressures and also to increase the drive for householders to recycle more of their household rubbish. To incentivise Councils to go back to weekly bin collections Mr Pickles announced a £250 million fund to help councils to convert back. He has also stated in the Daily Mail (where else) that further cuts could come to councils who do not go back to weekly bin collections. So is Eric’s position reflecting a general concern amongst the population? Not really. A recent ICM poll showed 74% of people were happy with their bin collections and only 9% wanted a return to weekly bin collections. Even with the one off grants on offer, changing back to weekly bin collections would put additional ongoing costs back onto Council Tax payers for years ahead. Most Councils have realised this and only one (Stoke on Trent) is using the funding to convert from bi-weekly to weekly collections. What we do know is that if we were to go back to weekly grey bin collections that recycling rates will decline further. Nationally recycling is at around 43% of household waste. We have signed up to an EU target to reach 50% recycling by 2020 otherwise we will be fined for non compliance. The target is of course completely achievable, it is just the nonsensical policies from central government that are making this difficult to achieve. What is somewhat perplexing is that the waste specialism within government is with DEFRA but because Eric has a particular beef about his chicken tikka masala he is sticking his very unhelpful oar in from the Department of Communities and Local Government. There was cross party agreement on the board that Eric’s view on bin collections was just plain wrong. Knowing that logic makes little impact on people like Pickles my suggestion was to approach the issue from a different angle. I suggested we write to Eric and DEFRA requesting a meeting with Government to work together on a Waste Reduction Strategy to stop so much waste going into our bins in the first place. Measures such as taxes on packaging and plastic bags have been successful in other countries so why not here? The Board agreed with this suggestion and I’ll let you know how we get on.\nThe issue of Shale gas was raised as a topic for the Environment and Housing Board in the context of the Council's planning role in relation to applications to establish drilling operations. Concerns were raised about the impact on chemicals in the water table and seismic activity but the principal issues I highlighted were the impact on energy policy and carbon emissions. There is a reported 8% leakage of natural gas from fracking operations which is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. The other concern I had was the fact that extracting the last dregs of fossil fuels to fuel the economy rather than proper investment in low carbon technologies is at best a distraction but more likely a disaster in its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. The Conservatives on the panel were not swayed by these issues and talked of the boost to the economy and jobs it would give. I imagined the Captain of the Titanic giving the order to ‘Head faster towards that iceberg!’ Without a trace of irony or self knowledge one of the same Conservatives asked for concerns about wind turbines to be raised as a future agenda item.\nWe do need more ‘natural’ gas and there is plenty of this that can be sourced above the ground. In Europe, and Germany in particular, Anaerobic Digestion (AD) is big business. AD is the capture and usage of gas given off by farm, food wastes and manure to produce methane which can then be either injected into the existing gas network or used to generate electricity. This is a truly renewable gas of the type that we all produce from time to time, possibly after a chicken tikka masala!\nSo 'frack' or 'frak' was also the profanity of choice in the surprisingly good remake of Battlestar Galactica. Here's a selection of its use for your entertainment (or not)\n| As eaten by Eric Pickles |\nThe issue of Shale gas was raised as a topic for the Environment and Housing Board in the context of the Council's planning role in relation to applications to establish drilling operations.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2011_12_councillor-derek-hardcastle-2011-annual_html/content_298.html": "Councillor Derek Hardcastle – 2011 Annual Report\nDear Resident,\nThis year has been one of the most challenging in my time as one of your local Councillors. We have had one of the toughest budget settlements the Council has ever had to face with central government slashing £80 million from Kirklees Council services over the next 4 years with no reduction in the Council Tax we have to pay. We have had the Local Development Framework which threatens green fields and spaces (and not just greenbelt) right across the district. It is against this background that the Green Party team have been continuing to take up issues at the Kirklees and Parish level.\nIn February this year the Green Party leader and MP for Brighton Pavillion visited Huddersfield and we held a well attended public meeting the evening before Kirklees Councils budget decision. I must say she is a real asset to our Party and has impressed many people with her insights into the actions of the government and the impacts of the cuts on ordinary families up and down the country.\nIn the Council Budget meeting the Green Party stood alone in opposing Council cuts to services for elderly and vulnerable people. The majority of the cuts fell on those in the greatest need. The budget for care for older people was slashed from £52 million to £40 million. Daycare services were cut from £5.3million to £1.5million. We believed as a matter of principle that to cut services for those who are in the direst circumstances is morally wrong particularly when the bankers who got us into this economic crisis seem to be able to continue to reap the same rewards as before. You don’t have to be a ‘socialist’ to see that this is wrong. The Green Party made these points strongly in the Kirklees Budget meeting in February and received a lot of abuse from the other Parties on the Council for making that stand. We still believe it was right that we spoke for those in most need. As it turned out some of the proposed cuts to day care services were withdrawn following a legal challenge which has at least brought respite for some people. What really annoys me is when cuts are characterised as ‘improvements’ to services. If we have to make cuts the least the Council can do is be upfront with people about the impacts on heir everyday lives.\nThis year was the end of my first 4 years as one of your Councillors and so I was up re-election in May. What I really enjoyed was getting round to seeing so many people in the run up to the election. It is a huge ward that stretches from Farnley Tyas to Flockton so we had a big area to get round. As usual it was a nail biting election count and I was re-elected by 82 votes but then I‘ve lost by 5 in the past so I was very pleased. I still can’t get used to the misinformation and half truths from my local opponents that I get during local campaigns. There were some very misleading statements about my attendance at meetings and dodgy montages of a wind turbine at Grange Moor (which I actually opposed at Planning Committee). All I can really say to people is that if you see some criticism of us in our opponents please don’t take it at face value please ring me or one of my colleagues and we’ll give you a straight story. Having said all that I found my Conservative opponent Amanda Shaw to be a pleasant and capable candidate and I’m sure she wasn’t responsible for much of the material in her leaflets.\nThe other elections that were held this year were those for the Parish Council and I was really pleased that the Green Party got the most votes and Parish seats of all the parties and that every village in the Kirkburton Ward has a Green representative. We are the only party that can make that claim. Our candidates topped the poll in Kirkburton/Highburton, Shepley, Grange Moor and Farnley Tyas and Thurstonland. Thank you to everyone who voted for us.\nOf course the day to day role of a Councillor is taking up local issues. Here’s a small selection of the issues we’ve taken up this year:-\n• Getting Moor Top Avenue resurfaced at Thurstonland\n• Helping get funding for ‘The Hub’ at Kirkburton\n• Helping get a new bench for Stocksmoor (then getting Kirklees to turn it round to face the right way!)\n• Helping householders with planning advice for installing solar panels on their roofs\n• New street lighting for Grange Moor on Bedford Avenue\nThere are issues which continue to frustrate me such as the need to get the footpath at Paddock Road in Kirkburton resurfaced. I must confess that it has been difficult to get this issue resolved been one voice among three local Councillors who don’t share my view on this. The other issue I really want to see progressed is traffic calming in Stocksmoor. We successfully worked with local people in Farnley Tyas and Thurstonland on their schemes now we need to get some impetus behind resolving issues in Stocksmoor. My Parish Colleagues Robert Barraclough and Andrew Cooper are helping me and liaising with the village association.\nWind turbines continues to be a concern for some householders and I and my Green Party colleagues have taken a balance approaching where we have opposed those that are poorly sited and intrusive and supported those that aren’t. I have opposed new turbines at Shelley and Grange Moor but supported 2 small turbines on farmland at Thurstonland. Sadly there was a rather political letter produced at Kirklees expense distributed in Thurstonland by the 2 Conservative Councillors on the subject of the wind turbines and the Green Party response to this. I have no objection to people putting their opinions in a leaflet and letter but no funded by the Council Tax. We have always taken the trouble to speak to the Thurstonland Village Association about local concerns and we had in this instance and I think actually talking through some of the issues we managed to address a number of concerns people had which were associated with much larger turbines.\nMy year will end very much like the last one. I will be driving a minibus on Boxing Day from Flockton to Grange Moor through Lepton and on to town. We have been running this free service for local people for 4 years now and I really enjoy it.\nA Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all.\nYours sincerely\nCouncillor Derek Hardcastle\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

For the benefit of the half dozen people in the UK who don't know, 185 is the measure by which we judge how individual local authorities are doing in terms of reducing carbon emissions resulting from their own operations. This generally means things such as carbon from the vehicle fleets, use of energy in public buildings, powering the councillors free beverage machine in Crown Court buildings etc. With the abolition of the Comprehansive Area Assessment Regime (star ratings for Councils) the whole performance framework and what it's for is thrown into disarray anyway. I mean to say if civilisation is going to collapse and you're the government in charge you don't want anyone actually measuring it do you?\nIf we are still measuring emissions for national government (I guess we are but must find out) then its just been a good week for 185 in Kirklees. The Environment Unit has just moved out of Estate Buildings on Railway Street and gone into relatively more carbon benign premises in Civic Centre 3. With staff cuts already coming into affect the opportunities to fit more staff in less buildings is finally becoming a reality. Gone are the plug in electric heaters in victorian stone built offices and now into gas heated offices with solar water heating and electricity and the erm... wind turbine, wel the one that's still working anyway. The Environment Unit move is just one example of the reorganisation of the Councils offices and of course reducing costs is a bigger driver right now than reducing carbon emissions. The question has to be asked though as to whether or not this is a good thing? Estate Buildings is still there, it has not had a snazzy eco-refurb with internal insulation and a biomass communal heating system installed. Presumably if someone came along tomorrow and wanted to rent that office from the Council then they would soon be in there using plug in electric heaters.\nReducing Council carbon emissions is of course a good thing, but it should demonstrate an approach which improves the Council's carbon hungry stock or our vehicles not simply discards them to be used by others. Of course that would require money! Difficult things have suddenly become more difficult.\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Where's the fire?\nThe Con-Dem Coalition Government has a large section on the environment. Leaving aside for a second the fact that the targets they have adopted for reducing carbon emissions are inadequate it is certainly more ambitious than the Labour Govt's programme. As always implementation is the test. It will be interesting to see how the Cons try and get round the financing of nuclear without using public money. No doubt there will be some dodge somewhere that they have in mind. We'll see.\nThere was specific mention in the Con-Dem agreement for support for a \"full establishment for a feed-in tariff for electricity\". What this means we will see but if the Tories are true to their word this will mean that solar photovoltaic installations installed prior to the 15/7/10 will qualify for the feed in tariff. There are lots of ways that this could be interpreted to be more or less generous so the devil is as always in the detail.\nThe Environment section on Energy covers most of the main high level policy areas but oddly there is no mention of the proposed Renewable Heat Incentive due to come into being next April under Labour's timetable. In what has been a fairly lacklustre performance on the renewable energy agenda by Labour this was a real innovation a genuinely ground breaking proposal. It promised a huge growth in the biomass, heat pump and solar thermal industries with users of renewable heat being rewarded with a dedicated tariff.Of course it's omission does not mean they won't pursue this policy but it certainly worth a Parliamentary Question at the very least.\nThe other Labour Government target (which they had no plan to acheive) was to insulate every loft and cavity wall in domestic properties by 2015. It would be interesting to see if this policy is retained and how it will be implemented. The Kirklees programme is due to finish in about 6 weeks with over 50'000 properties insulated in the last three years. So we have acheived the Government target 5 years ahead of target! So another Parliamentary Question worth asking Mr Chris Huhne.\nIf only we had a Green Party MP. Ah we do!\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nWill they keep the renewal heat incentive that the last government was working towards?\nReplyDeleteMy understanding is that this will pay us to generate the heat we use in our buildings sustainably, and will tax fossil fuels to pay for it.",

Lockwood is one of those areas.\nCouncillor Cooper, who is a member of the West Yorkshire Combined Authority Climate Change, Energy and Environment Committee, that approved the scheme said,\n“Back in February 2022 a number of businesses down Albert Street and Queens Mill Road were flooded. I remember it well as I was on the scene at the time redirecting traffic away from flooded roads. Several businesses in the area were badly affected and some businesses were out of action for several months\nThe half million pound scheme funded by West Yorkshire Combined Authority will install 2 pipes to redirect flood water back into the River Holme further downstream and reduce the risk of flooding for 28 businesses.\nHeavy rainfall events are becoming more frequent due to the impacts of climate change. So we need to invest in schemes which make homes and businesses more resilient to climate change.\nReferences\nSee Page 64",

It's one of the things that got me involved in politics in the first place. The need to take on the pompous, the bullies and those who believe they have a right to the positions they hold or those who believe that no one has a legitimate democratic right to challenge them. When I was first elected and many years afterwards I inwardly winced when Council officers referred to me as 'Councillor' and I tried to steer them in the 'Call me Andrew' direction. Now I recognise that Council Officers referring to me as 'Councillor' is a way of them emphasising their professional detachment and being clear about our respective roles which is not the same as the deference I so despise. I live with the title, I guess I've earn't it.\nThe general populace has caught up and deference to politicians is not what it was in years gone by. This has got to be a good thing. It comes as a bit of a shock after 18 or so years on the Council to find that some people regard you as part of 'the establishment'. So one Saturday night a few weeks ago I'm wandering through Huddersfield Bus Station and this drunken guy shouts across at me \"Hey! you're Andrew Cooper, my MP. I could do your job but I bet you couldn't do mine!\", It was on the tip of my tongue to come out with some witty remark referencing what I thought his job might be but I decided instead to just give him a cheery wave and say 'Bye!'. Of course, and unfortunately, I wasn't his MP and a Councillor gets about a seventh of the salary of an MP. I also guess that he only had the faintest idea of what I actually did as a Councillor (or what an MP did come to that) and that to him it would be something along the lines of just saying whatever came into my head in a meeting and who can't do that for goodness sake?\nJust as a drink or two can make people bold so can social media and I often read, whimsically, the inaccurate comments made about me, or my role, on the Huddersfield Examiner Facebook page. The latest was someone who asserted that I could claim back my energy bills in expenses from the Council ' I'm afraid not matey!' I didn't bother trying to correct him. Maybe I should have done.\nSo has the lack of deference to politicians gone too far? I don't think so and politicians can worry too much about what some guy posts (it usually is a guy) on social media about them. We've just got to a certain extent 'suck it up'. Every now and again someone will cross a line but generally we've got to live with it or take them on as you see fit. A bit of a thick skin can be helpful to people in the public eye.\nDeference and the love of positions for their own sake is not dead. For some politicians the title as opposed the role, and the deference/respect that comes with those positions, remains a prime motivator. It concerns me greatly because a desire for a position is not generally a good measure of someone's suitability for that position. If that position is achieved by patronage to secure the deference of colleagues then that concerns me even more. So though some regard me as part of 'the establishment' these days I will continue to challenge those in power and those who seek it for the wrong reasons.\nSo has the lack of deference to politicians gone too far?

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2018_09_reaping-wild-wind_html/content_860.html": "I've always admired the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. They are one of the largest membership organisations in the country. Over the years they will have had plenty of pressure on them to oppose planning applications for wind turbine and wind farm developments but they have taken a pretty robust line saying from the start that,\n\"Climate Change poses the single greatest threat to birds and other wildlife and the RSPB recognises the essential role of renewable energy in addressing this problem\"\nIts a bold opening statement but they do follow through and only object to about 6% of wind applications and that was when the UK Government hadn't to all intents and purposes practically outlawed onshore wind farms and turbines. They are still strong defenders of avians and are not shy to say where there are inappropriate wind developments but not as many as misinformed Mail readers and retired Colonels would like I'm more than sure. They speak of the need for wind farms to be sited away from major migration routes and breeding/roosting areas and point to examples of poor sitings of wind farms but generally not in the UK.\nSo why this interest? Well tomorrow I'm speaking at an event in Brussels looking at the impact on biodiversity of renewable energy and how to minimise it. What I've been encouraged by through reading the literature is the desire from both perspectives to seek common ground and a real expectation that it can be found.\nKent Wildlife Trust have produced some good principles by which sustainable (as opposed to just renewable energy) can be measured. These 6 principles are good ones to assess any renewable energy development. They are to :-\n- Commit to ensuring overall positive outcomes for wildlife from the outset, aiming for a ‘net biodiversity gain’.\n- Avoid sites that are designated for nature conservation.\n- Identify potential negative impacts on wildlife and avoid these impacts wherever possible.\n- When all possible options have negative impacts, seek the least environmentally damaging option.\n- Recognise that there may be unknown impacts on wildlife that development needs to consider and mitigate, employing the ‘precautionary principle’.\n- Achieve this by consulting experts and relevant stakeholders early on ecological aspects of sites and routes.\nNow my role in this debate is to assess from a UK perspective how renewable energy developments interact and match EU Nature Legislation. To be fair the EU legislation is pretty good in this regard and has at its heart a desire to balance the needs of humanity with the natural world. The question I have is will that same balanced approach be one that we will realise with our current government? As they have made it practically impossible to install wind technology on our island I think balance is the last thing they are seeking. They don't seek to harness the wind but to simply bend in the wind to a vocal minority most likely from their own potential supporters. Far from 'taking back control' from the EU we will be passing it on to narrow perspectives with no appreciation of the real issues. A triumph for the ill informed opinions of the guy in the pub over anyone who actually knows what they're talking about.\nSo here's 'Reap the wild wind' by Ultravox\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2017_02_reflections-on-2017-kirklees-budget_html/content_598.html": "Last Wednesday's Budget Council meeting was a fairly bad tempered one. There was the usual bearpit stuff that I'm used to. It's a bit of theatre a lot of the time and the absurd and occasionally the insightful are on display. What marked this one out was the rude and sometimes quite offensive comments made by certain members. I like the interplay between Cllrs, the ribbing and people expressing their opinions based on their beliefs. If you've got different views of the world you are going to clash. There were a lot of things at the meeting that didn't bother me. My old sparring partner Cllr Andrew Palfreeman claiming (wrongly as it happened) that the Green Party amendment was unconstitutional. It wasn't but it saw the Council adjourned for 15 minutes while the Mayor, Chief Executive and the Councils Head of Legal Services considered the dubious points made. Cllr Palfreeman had dramatically explained how our amendment was so calamitous that it could see Kirklees in the Supreme Court. Once the amendment was cleared for debate Cllr Palfreeman went to argue how our legally dangerous amendment was now insignificant and unimportant. Did this bother me? Not particularly. I found the whole thing just part of the entertaining absurdity of what happens at Full Council. Pointless you could argue and it could irritate you if you let it, but not offensive.\nFor me the annoying thing about the meeting was when certain Tory members started asking what 'bungs' the Green Group had taken in the past for voting for Labour's budget. The reason Greens have voted for Labour, Liberal Democrat and yes even Conservative Budgets over the last 17 years is because of the amendments we have put to Council being accepted. This is transparent, in full view and in no way can be described as a 'bung'. One bug bear they have is that the Chair of Overview and Scrutiny is a Green Party Councillor and that they believe that as the largest opposition group they should have that role. This may be what they regard as 'a bung'. The fact is that Scrutiny is supposed to be a non political role and shouldn't be used as a tool of opposition to the administration but instead be a non partisan 'critical friend' to the Adminstration. Sometimes Scrutiny will be challenging to decisions made by the Cabinet and offer alternatives. It isn't however another route for expressing the politics of opposition. The fact that certain Conservatives fundamentally misunderstand the role means that they really shouldn't be in that position. My colleague Julie Stewart-Turner is both hardworking and scrupulous in ensuring the independence of the Scrutiny function from Party politics and I can't think of anyone better for the role. As someone who is not a member of any of the larger political groups, and isn't seen as combative in Council meetings, Julie has a particular advantage in not being perceived as having any axe to grind.\nBack to the meeting itself. I proposed the amendment because I wanted to see some real hope injected into a very depressing Council Budget. There was rightfully some discussion over the appalling financial settlement we have received from central government that offers us a real challenge with £14million dropping out of our budget next year on top of the millions we have already lost from central govt. The Conservatives were in full denial mode which any objective observer would regard as an untenable position. They said that the Council would not be in the financial situation if we had followed their advice in previous budgets but then offered no substantial evidence to back up this claim. It was simply an assertion. The fact that they were part of the All Party delegation to the Communities Minister to ask for our £14 million back rather implies they knew the reality of the situation. The fact they also put no amendment was also very telling. They argued the budget was 'unamendable'. The reality was at it was only unamendable for their more right wing members who illogically would vote against any Council Tax rise while wanting at the same time to not see any services cut. Their Government had made the rules of the game but they didn't want to play. Easier for them not to play! So they voted against our amendment, the budget and everything. It was a denial of reality and denial of their Party's responsibility for the mess Local Government is in.\nConservative Councillor Andrew Palfreeman was 'spot on' in saying that we need more trust between Councillors across Party and the people referring to 'bungs' whichever Party they were from was not going to encourage that trust. Wise words from an old hand but there are other old hands in their group and they appear to hold the sway and some (not all) of the newer members seem to take their lead from them. The Labour group have also not been short of their own problems, the factions, the suspensions and on the positive side some committed Cabinet members and the Leader David Sheard, soldiering on. I don't demean them by saying they are 'soldiering on' and goodness knows we need that at the moment! We also need more. We need ideas and political direction that shows we are not simply managing decline but reshaping and redefining what Kirklees Councils role is. Our proposal for a Local Housing Development Company is part of that but it is only one idea from one Party on the Council. We need people across Party to demonstrate some goodwill to each other and towards the future of the Council. If we can develop a Party of Goodwill on the Council we would achieve much and give real meaning to the Kirklees motto 'Together we serve'.\nFighting talk, Andrew, much needed as local government is being seriously undermined by lack of funding. Govt took away the grants but has not replaced them with the 100pc business rates as they should have done. Having got almost all councils to sign up to accept the poorest settlement in years, on the basis it was little but at least a degree of certainty. Only their next step was to remove some more by reducing the New Homes Bonus money that we were counting on!\nReplyDeleteI agree I wonder when the much vaunted localism that was all the rage a few years ago will actually arrive.\nReplyDelete",

The time for amendments to the Kirklees Budget has passed. We will go the budget meeting next Wednesday with a Labour budget based on the financial constraints forced on us by this Government following their mismanangement of the economy. There are 3 amendments, the Conservatives, the Green Party's and the the Lib Dems. We have gained some things out of the budget process. In our amendment we have the extension of the free insulation scheme Kirklees Warm Zone for another 3 years. I tried to get them to rebrand it 'Green Zone' to avoid confusion with the Governments 'Warm Zone' scheme but also to annoy the Lib Dems (see previous posts!). Of course they weren't having it but the issue of confusion between the 2 schemes is genuine and will have to be addressed at some point soon. Not least because 'Warm Zone' is a brand that we have to pay for. There are also opportunities to bring new measures to the scheme free draughtproofing for vulnerable households, electricity saving measures such as Real Time Displays and Powerdown and deliver them on an area by area basis.\nOther things we acheived were in the 'side agreement'.\nWe have a commitment to continue to support the core funding costs of 'Build' the body which provides training in skills for the building trade for brickies, plumbers and decorators until these are picked up thorugh supportive contracts such as Building Schools for the Future further down the line. This is exactly the sort of project we should be supporting at these times.\nWe also have a commitment to develop support for projects promoting local food producers in the area. This has been a strong theme for Julie Stewart-Turner our first Green Party Mayor during her year in civic office.\nThere is a commitment to come up with proposals for a free bus link from Huddersfield Town to the Galpharm Stadium possibly electrically powered. This would provide a link to all the sports and leisure facilities in the area and reduce the need for car travel at a venue which isn't directly served by Public Transport and where the car parks are often full at peak times.\nOur big hope is that we will be able to establish a free solar panel scheme for private householders with the capital costs for the Council being met by the new Clean Energy Cashback being introduced this April. We are due a report in June on whether or not it is a goer. The Lib Dems don't like the idea of this scheme and didn't believe it was much worth pursuing. No doubt if we make it work it will be appearing in a Lib Dem leaflet as one of their initiatives. Bitter? Moi? You bet I am!\nWe have already established the principal of self funding capital for solar projects with the £5million agreed for solar panels for council buildings last year. Providing free solar panels at no net cost to the Council for private householders is more difficult but I don't think impossible.\nSo what of the Lib Dems Budget amendment? Well surprise surprise we have £2 million to upgrade the insulation of Council Tenants. But I hear you say 'Didn't they claim they had already acheived this in that scurrilous leaflet they posted in Almondbury in December?' (see December post 'Dem Fibs from the Lib Dems') Well yes they did. So they lied, it's what they do. More energy stuff from them £300k for Solar PV for community buildings, some additional monies linked to the boiler scrappage scheme and an energy advice project for the elderly. All good but there is nothing else! If you didn't know better you would think they were desperately trying to win back lost ground on the energy agenda. No matter, if that's the case then the Green Party has acheived more in this budget than simply getting our own initiatives passed we've pushed the other parties on or agenda and got gains for local people.\nThe Conservatives submitted an amendment it means their Council Tax is a 1% increase instead of a 2% increase. To do that they have further decimated jobs, services and cancelled anti recession measures, but they have the cynical 'We're cheaper' headline for their leaflets.\nI'm definitely getting grumpier as I get older.\nLabels:\nConservatives,\nEnergy,\nInsulation,\nKirklees,\nLib Dems,\nLocal Food,\nrenewables,\nsolar\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nGood work Andrew, although I'm not sure why they make these concessions to you (other than you being right).

Why do some memories stay in your head and others go. I remember as a child reading 'The Trigan Empire' that was a comic strip featuring the history of a civilization on the planet Elektron. It was serialised in the now defunct 'Look and Learn' comics with brilliant illustrations and imaginative stories. These words from the comic popped into my head recently \"the engines of death ride the sky\". A bit of a search on Interweb and I found the actual quote on the actual page of that mammoth comic series.\nSo why did those words pop into my head? I was at the West Yorkshire Combined Authority Zero Emissions Transport Group last week. Consultants had brought us scenarios of how transport in the Leeds City Region could play its part in reaching our 2038 Zero Emissions target. They showed us all about 'modal shift', getting people out of cars and onto public transport, or into low emission vehicles, or bikes, or walking and how that might occur with different levels of policy commitment. They even mentioned our regional Leeds Bradford Airport and talked about the emissions being generated from all those planes BUT they only were obliged to measure domestic not international flights.\nThis is a global issue and has been sort of, but not convincingly addressed in the 2016 International Civil Aviation Organization agreement. This is a largely voluntary agreement whereby the carbon emissions for flights are supposedly offset by tree planting. This is a case of the aviation industry regulating itself. The scheme doesn't start till 2021 and it is voluntary till 2027. It doesn't comply with the Paris Climate Agreement targets and even if it works as described it will take till 2050 to reduce emissions by 50%. While all this aviation emissions reduction is not really going on, airports like Leeds Bradford have big expansion plans and West Yorkshire Combined Authority are assisting them.\nSo yes, truly, the engines of death do ride the skies unimpeded and assisted by public money.\nSo why did those words pop into my head?

Obviously the Tories abstaining at the Annual Council meeting on the Leadership and allowing Labour to run the Council presented him with a bit of a dilemma. Here's how he dealt with/rationalised it and my response below that.\n“Local people gave the Labour Party an increased number of\ncouncillors showing we’re in tune with residents,” were the resounding\nwords of Clr Mehboob Khan after his re-election as leader of our\ncouncil.\nI and others were unhappy that the Conservative councillors decided to abstain from the vote.\nThis is to a degree understandable when all they would face would be derision at failing to oust Clr Khan from his secure seat.\nIf the Conservatives had voted against Clr Khan it would have made\nno difference whatsoever. He is leader by the constitution for four\nyears even though he puts himself up for re-election each year it’s a\ncase of the winner of this year’s one horse race is. The Labour Group\nhas 32 members and the Conservatives have but 18.\nIf, however, Conservative Clr Robert Light had put up for council leader not one of the other groups would have supported him.\nThe Greens would not have voted for an alternative. It was the votes\nof the four greens three years ago which lost the Conservatives control\nof the council. The Lib Dems would not support the Conservatives nor\nwould the Independents.\nThe four independents – three of whom are now in with the Green\ngroup – voted against and the other independent voted for Clr Khan.\nThis year was the first time the Greens voted against Clr Khan and\nthe main reason being they did not get the chair of Scrutiny Panel or\nany chairs of major committees which they wanted.\nThey therefore voted as a matter of pique rather than policy.\nLabour is the largest party and so by the constitution has to form\nthe administration. All other minor groups would not support the\nConservatives running the council.\nPerhaps Clr Andrew Cooper and Clr Kath Pinnock would care to explain\nwhy they would not support the Conservatives in running the\nadministration as the major opposition party thus trying to break the\ncycle of negativity from the clueless Labour party.\nR J Bray\nShelley\nAnd my response\nR J Bray says in his letter (Examiner, May 28) “Perhaps Clr Andrew\nCooper and Clr Kath Pinnock would care to explain why they would not\nsupport the Conservatives in running the administration’’.\nThe fact of the matter is that they never sought support and never made a ‘pitch’ to other groups.\nI tried to get the non Labour groups round the table on a number of\noccasions to discuss how to address the leadership of the council and to\nput pressure on the Labour Party on issues of mutual concern, such as\nthe libraries, but to no avail.\nThere simply wasn’t the will for joint discussions from the Conservatives.\nPersonally I have no particular enthusiasm for either Labour or the\nConservatives running the council but my prime concern, in a hung\ncouncil, would be about the policies they were seeking to pursue and\ntheir willingness to involve other groups in decision making.\nThe Greens have supported (and opposed) all the other political\ngroups on the council at different times on different issues on the\nbasis of the policies and their impact on local people.\nAnother statement by Mr Bray in his letter was “the Greens voted\nagainst Clr Khan and the main reason being they did not get the chair of\nthe Scrutiny Panel or any of the chairs of major committees that they\nwanted”.\nThis maybe what he believes but it simply isn’t true.\nClr Khan threatened to remove the Green Party from chairing the\nResources Scrutiny Panel if we didn’t support him as Leader before we\nmade our decision.\nIt would be true however to say that these threats did inform our view of his character as a potential leader of the council.\nIn the end we didn’t support him because we couldn’t get a firm commitment on policy issues, including the libraries.\nAs a consequence of our decision at the annual council meeting\nLabour voted in favour of the Conservatives taking the Chair of the\nResources Scrutiny Panel from the Green Party and Valley Independent\nGroup as punishment to us and as a reward to the Conservatives, for\nabstaining on the vote on the leadership, thus allowing Mehboob Khan to\nbecome Leader of the Council.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper\nCo-Leader of the Green Party and Valley Independent Group\nA blog by Green Party Councillor Andrew Cooper about Green Politics, action on Climate Change, Kirklees Council and our activity to improve the local and global environment (and also anything that I fancy talking about) Promoted and published by A Cooper, 76 Brockholes Lane, Holmfirth HD9 7EB\nShowing posts with label Conservatives.

The direction of travel indicated, in the consultation, is for more volunteer run and assisted libraries. So this was the main area where we could get some joint action if we could agree a common approach to the Labour Party. I talked to all the other Party Leaders in the run up to the Annual Meeting but to get the Conservatives to sit down for 3 Group talks with ourselves and the Lib Dems proved very difficult and I didn't detect a lot of enthusiasm from them in any case. Labour were quite keen to talk to all the groups seperately to get the best deal they could or 'divide and rule' if you prefer. Given we weren't getting anywhere with the Conservatives both ourselves and the Lib Dems declared publicly on Monday that we would vote against Labour on the Libraries issue to try to get the Tories to declare their intentions. On Sunday Eveening Mehboob Khan indicated that if we were to vote against them leading the Council they would remove us from Chairing the Resources Scrutiny Panel this along with the fact that they had told the Lib Dems we had already made a deal with us convinced me, if it were necessary, of the character of the Labour leadership.\nOn Wednesday I went into the Annual Council Meeting not knowing which way the Conservatives were going to vote on the Leadership of the Council. In the end they abstained. If they had voted against Mehboob Khan he wouldn't have been Leader and we may then have been able to exercise some leverage on the libraries issue at the very least. So I guess the big question is why the Tories did what they did? There is the 'foaming mouth' wing of the Tories who won't talk to the Greens in a civilised way at the best of times so I can imagine Robert Light had his work cut out with those characters in any case. Then of course if Labour weren't going to vote for the Green Party and Valley Independent Group to have any Committee Chairs who were they going to support? The Tories of course. Instead of our Cllr Terry Lyons chairing the Planning and Highways Committee you have the delightful Conservative Cllr Christine Smith instead of Green Cllr Julie Stewart-Turner chairing the Resources Scrutiny Panel you have Tory Cllr Donald Firth. Loyalty to the 'strong leader' obviously brings its rewards (and punishments to those who defy him).\nSo where does this leave the new 'Strong Leader' of Kirklees, 'Mehboob the Merciless'. A bit embarrassed I think. It doesn't do his dubious 'left credentials' much good having to do a deal with the Tories who are as we know the 'bad guys'. We had quite an amusing exchange of tweets where he rather illogically accused me of wanting the Tories to run Kirklees instead of him. The only question put to us was \"do you want Mehboob Khan to be leader of the Council?\" there wasn't a mutiple choice question. If there was \"None of the above\" would probably have been my answer.\nMonday, 14 May 2012\nSilent Running - Twitter and Local Elections\nYou may think social media and elections were made for each other and conventional wisdom is that it is. We hear about Facebook campaigns which helped propel Obama to the Whitehouse and you’d be forgiven for thinking Kirklees politicians, myself included have learnt very little from this but as with many things there’s a lot more to it than that.\nAs local election campaigns were beginning to take off in Kirklees I noticed the Labour Candidate for Newsome had set up a Twitter account. I was naturally going to follow her. She had a few initial followers already including prominent Labour Cllrs. Very soon I discovered I’d been blocked as a follower and after a few initial tweets from her all went very quiet. Twitter is a good way of letting everybody know what you are doing and thinking and during an election campaign. If you are targeting a seat you don’t particularly want your opponent to know what you’re up to and what streets you’ve been on . Fortunately for me the oldest form of social media ‘the community jungle drums' pretty much kept me abreast of what’s was going on, who was on the streets, where they were and what they were saying on the doorstep – ‘Street Twitter’. ‘ Electronic Twitter’ went into ‘silent running’ mode like submarines keeping a strict silence lest they be discovered by the enemy above.\nMy own twitter traffic during the election lost a bit of spontaneity. Things I wanted to say about the election would have been unwise to say. I started making ‘Non Election News’ Tweets such as “I extracted 2 pints of worm wee from my wormery this morning. Useful as a liquid fertiliser. Back out on the stomp!” I was definitely ‘extracting the urine’ with that tweet! Another tweet was “my sweetcorn, leek and tomato seedlings are coming through. Rain makes canvassing tough but the patch gets watered!” Now I know twitter is supposed to express your trivial musings in less than 140 characters but didn’t I realise there was an election on?! I certainly did but even saying where I’d canvassed and what response I’d received could be giving information to an opponent who didn’t have my best interests at heart in the slightest. I thought the best thing I could do was let them know how my allotment was progressing!\nI did break this rule on one occasion. When I was reliably informed by locals that a prominent Conservative Cllr had been spotted canvassing in Newsome I wanted the world to know that I knew what was going on and that she’d been spotted. She then had the option of carrying on canvassing in Newsome and be accused of abandoning her own backyard or go back campaigning in her own patch. By my reckoning and given her particular style of canvassing I couldn’t lose either way but the quandary over what to do was not mine, it was hers and I’d got more than enough to deal with at the time.\nHere’s a couple of songs by Joan Baez 'Rejoice in the Sun' and 'Silent Running' from Silent Running starring Bruce Dern in the 70’s Sci Fi masterpiece and ecological thinkpiece. In order to protect the last earth trees Bruce's character takes his forest carrying spaceship 'offline' and goes 'silent running'.

Thousands of leaflets were delivered in heavy rain. One morning 6 of us delivered the whole of Shelley in wet weather gear through a relentless downpour, Special campaign honours to those people.\nWe also had a more aggressive Labour Party Campaign in Newsome than usual that needed addressing and handling. It was a bit of a 'surprise attack' and soon we were seeing Labour Councillors from all over Huddersfield canvassing in Newsome. We also had our Labour MP Barry Sheerman and a Coronation Street Actress pressing the flesh for Labour in Newsome. We closely followed the literature being produced by Labour and there was a lot of it, some personalised letters and several full colour glossy leaflets. I bumped into Cllr Mehboob Khan leafleting in Lockwood who insisted to me that Labour were not targeting Newsome but the evidence and information that had come my way seemed to indicate the opposite. I was getting calls from constituents from all over the Newsome Ward telling me what this or that Labour Councillor had said to them on the doorstep in pursuit of their votes. Apparently I spent all my time running Kirkburton Parish Council and was neglecting the Newsome Ward which I didn't even live in! Actually I attend about 2 Parish Council meetings a month and there are plenty of other Kirkburton Parish Cllrs to do the important stuff without me interfering. As for not living in the ward I've never tried to make a secret of this and have put my home address prominently on several leaflets over the years. It was strange to get this sort of attack from the Labour and Conservative Candidates who also didn't live in the ward themselves but of course they didn't put this particular fact on their leaflets. There were 2 full colour leaflets that went out in the last couple of days as well as a full colour Polling Day reminder card. There's plenty more I could say on the Labour campaign but it can wait for another day. Interestingly the Tories put a bit more effort than usual into Newsome but the messaging was all about not voting Green rather than reasons to vote Conservative. It almost seemed like a two pronged attack from 2 Parties working together to unseat me. When Kirkburton Cllr Christine Smith was sighted canvassing in Newsome trying out her own particular brand of invective with the locals I knew the knives were out. The feeling and support on the doorstep towards the Green Party remained good throughout which was comforting.\nThe outcome of all this was an increase in the Green Party share of the vote from just over 51% to just under 53%. Anyway here's a clip from Star Trek 2 - The Wrath of Khan. Khan has just carried out a surprise attack on the USS Enterprise and believes he has the upper hand.\nLabels:\nConservatives,\nHuddersfield,\nKirkburton,\nKirklees,\nLabour,\nNewsome\nMonday, 23 April 2012\nA Cut too Far? by Cllr Graham Simpson\n| Today's Guest Post by Cllr Graham Simpson |\nMany people do not realize the scale of the\nreforms that the Tory – Lib Dem government are making.\nCuts to local authority funding mean that\nevery family in Kirklees will see essential services cut, or become more\nexpensive. From school transport, library services, dog wardens, home care,\nroad maintenance and a whole range of other services provided by local\nauthorities government funding is being reduced.\nCuts to the police service already mean\nthat there are 5,000 fewer police officers available to answer 999 calls than\nwhen this government came to power, with more cuts to follow.\nChanges proposed for the legal aid system\nmean that no help will be available for medical negligence or domestic violence\nclaims. Or to fight the withdrawal of benefits or refusal of invalidity claims\n(which currently have an appeal success rate of 70%)\nMany people wrongly believe that the\nsweeping changes to the welfare benefit system in place already or shortly to\nbecome law, will only affect the unemployed.\nWhile the cuts will affect those seeking\nwork, they will also affect people with severe medical conditions who will find\nit harder to qualify for invalidity benefit. It will also affect those on low\nincomes that receive help with their rents, as well as\nthose receiving council tax discounts and exemptions.\n·\nFrom April 2013, national\ncouncil tax benefits will be abolished and replaced with a raft of local schemes.\n·\nThe age at which single people\nwill only be allowed housing benefit for shared accommodation is to be raised\nfrom 25 to 35.\n·\nWorking tax credit will now\nonly be available for people working a minimum of 24 hours a week rather than\n16.\n·\nUnder occupancy rules mean that\nHousing Benefit will not be paid towards bedrooms deemed to be unneeded. (A son or daughter at University will be\nclassed as living there, rather than at their parents address, and same sex\nchildren of any age will be expected to share a bedroom.\n·\nHousing Benefit for rented\naccommodation will be capped at the bottom 30% of the market rate and any extra\nwill have to be found by the claimant.\nIt is unlikely that any resident will be\nimmune from the cuts, either personally or through the experiences of family or\nfriends.

The flower which gives it's name to the street where I used live with 'Huddersfield Conservative' Bernard McGuin |\nCost of ‘green’ policies\nTHE true cost of renewable means of producing power are now being exposed.\nAs I have said in the past, the power companies pay four times the value of any electricity produced by wind and solar means. The cost is passed on to the consumer in hidden subsidies. It is effectively an extra tax on already heavily burdened ordinary hard working individuals.\nThe fact that energy prices themselves are screaming ahead of inflation means that effectively we are putting a brake on economic growth and ultimately economic recovery.#\nTo all those people who voted Green in the last local elections, the message should be, do you really support policies that harm the British economy?\nTo the coalition government I would ask – do we really have to follow every edict from Europe on cutting carbon emissions and do you think all our competitors put so-called climate change policies ahead of economic growth?\nBernard McGuin\nHuddersfield Conservative\nBlaming the wrong folk\nA RATHER bizarre letter from Conservative Bernard McGuin blames the Green Party for taxes on energy bills.Last time I checked it was the Conservatives who were running the country with their Lib Dem helpers, not the Green Party.\nHe says these taxes support renewable energy. Yes they do – but nuclear energy is very heavily subsidised too.\nIt is also worth noting that half of the £20m budget for Kirklees Warm Zones free insulation scheme came from these sources, which is saving energy and money for Kirklees householders to the tune of about £4m each year.Mr McGuin would be quite correct in blaming the Green Party for the free insulation scheme which was the result of an amendment we made to the Kirklees Budget in 2007.\nClr Andrew Cooper\nLeader, Green Party, Kirklees Council\nEnergy subsidies\nIN REPLY to the Clr Andrew Cooper, (Mailbag, June 17) who thinks I wrote a bizarre letter regarding renewable forms of energy, may I just remind him that on his website that he acknowledged that the Feed In Tariffs, that rewards producers of such energy with a 41p per unit payment as opposed to the market price of 11p per unit, is a form of indirect taxation?\nI was careful in my letter to say that it was a subsidy which was being paid by us in our electricity bills.\nOn average we are each paying £200 plus a year to pay for this and other forms of ‘green taxes’ in our annual expenditure on energy.\nThe coalition has been saddled with the last government’s zeal to expand wind and solar power.\nThose that can afford the cost of solar panelling, the comparatively rich, will make a good return on their investment, around 10-12%. Paid by us poor folk who can’t afford it.\nIf you want to rent out your roof for solar panels, beware! You must have room for 16 panels and those in terraced housing, most of us in Huddersfield, won’t qualify.\nAlthough insulating one’s house is a good thing, the cost is again taken by the taxpayer.The warming Kirklees scheme was undertaken by a Conservative administration. I have heard all four political groups take credit for this scheme. Of course it is possible the three green councillors outvoted the other 66.\nThe main thrust of my letter was to ask whether the ‘taxing’ of energy would put a brake on economic growth. It is only that which will get us out of the debt that the country faces. In the General Election 2010, there was a move towards a rejection of tax and spend policies. Do the people who voted for Green councillors in Newsome and Kirkburton want a return to that?\nBernard McGuin\nHuddersfield Conservative\nResponse to Bernard McGuin\nConservative Bernard McGuin states the impact on energy bills of policies to tackle fuel poverty and reduce carbon emissions (or ‘green taxes’ as he puts it) is £200. The figure he gives is one from a right wing newspaper parroting a dubious report from a right wing policy group. The actual figure given by the Department of Energy Climate Change on behalf of the right wing Conservative Government is £42 per year. I can direct Mr McGuin to the appropriate part of his government’s website if he wants.\nHe says the coalition has been ‘saddled with the last government’s zeal to expand wind and solar power’. Actually there was consensus among the Westminister parties about the need for a feed in tariff for renewable energy before the General Election. If he can show me anything at all which contradicts my view I’d be interested to see it.\nMr McGuin also attempts to take credit away from the Greens for gaining free insulation for households in Kirklees through the Warm Zone scheme. The Green Party amendment to the 2007 Council budget which made the scheme free is a matter of public record. The emails I have between myself and the then Conservative leader and the official notes of discussions of meetings on the budget further confirm free insulation as a Green Party initiative. I’m more than happy to show Mr McGuin the evidence.\nHe asks whether the taxing of energy would ‘put a brake on economic growth’. As much of the money goes towards schemes that help reduce peoples fuel bills and projects which create employment and economic activity that is highly unlikely.\nIt is easy for Mr McGuin to write letters to the paper repeating misinformation he may have read in the national tabloids but he would do better to direct his concerns regarding fuel prices to the government which is lead by the Conservative Party, which for reasons best known to himself, he supports.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper\nLeader of the Green Party group\nSaturday, 7 May 2011\nThe politics of posterboards\n| Nailed! |\nThere are of course rules that Kirklees make which are often ignored by certain parties such as don't put them on lamp posts with other signs attached which they could obscure if they slip. Another is that they should not be nailed into trees or telegraph poles. All these rules were ignored by the Conservatives in the Kirkburton Campaign. Another irritating thing was that we were given permission to put up our boards on land around Farnley Tyas by the landowner and so were the Conservatives. One morning our boards had disappeared and were replaced with Conservatives ones. Now I'm not implying anything, well maybe I am.\nThere are benefits to getting your posterboards up first but the downside is that the opposition can come by afterwards and turn your boards sideways while they're putting there's above yours. We've always prided ourselves on getting ours down early and usually Derek Hardcastle is getting them down in Kirkburton the next morning. One year we were a bit slow at getting them down and found some of ours pushed higher up the lamp posts presumably by the oppostion while taking there's down. Nice!\nThursday, 28 April 2011\nGreenbelt letters\n| Also available in pork! |\nGreen view of Lib Dems - Examiner - 26/4/11\nI SEE the Lib Dems’ claim to aim to protect the green belt in their manifesto.\nThis at odds with Lib Dem and Conservative Policy in government where brownfield quotas for building land are being abolished, putting more pressure on the green belt.\nThey also claim to want to protect services for the vulnerable, having voted with the Conservatives for huge cuts to these services in Kirklees.\nPeople are not stupid and the Lib Dems and Conservatives should not only be careful in their public statements, but should also aim to be credible in their stated policies and not try to mislead people. Otherwise the view many people have of them following the tuition fees fiasco will be reinforced and politics as a whole will be further devalued in the minds of the general public.\nClr Andrew Cooper\nLeader, Green Party Kirklees Council\nWe protect green belt - Examiner - 27/4 /11\nI SEE that Clr Andrew Cooper is once again castigating the Lib Dems and Conservatives over green belt policies (Examiner Mailbag, Tuesday April 26).\nOne of the most effective ways of protecting the green belt is by sitting on Huddersfield Planning Committee or the Heavy Woollen Planning Sub-Committee where decisions about green belt and brownfield sites are made. Yet no Green Party councillor will sit on any planning committee.\nSo, when Clr Cooper talks about responsibilities, policies and green belt, he needs to look to his own party first, particularly here in Kirklees.\nPerhaps the electorate, whom he purports to represent, should start to ask questions as to why the Greens will not sit on any planning committees where decisions concerning green belt are made.\nClr Christine Smith\nChair of Planning and Highways Committee, Kirklees Council\nAnd my response...............\nCouncillor Christine Smith , Conservative , criticises the Green Party for not having a Councillor on Planning Committee. As she well knows despite not being a member of Planning Committee I have been a regular attender of it, referring applications for decision and representing views of constituents. I was the only Councillor who was not a member of Planning Committee to make representations regarding the Tesco’s Development and the proposed replacement Hotel on Castle Hill. The real scandal here is that the larger parties rarely send anyone to Planning Committee to represent the views of constituents. As Cllr Christine Smith also knows being a member of Planning Committee restricts the ability of its members to represent local people effectively as they are bound by planning protocols. Ironically you can be a much more effective at protecting your local green spaces by not being a member of the Planning Committee and she knows this as someone who has voted for development on Lindley Moor.\nI do notice however that in her criticism of me and the Green Party she does not contradict my view, and the Campaign for the Preservation of Rural England’s view, that the latest Coalition Planning Policy statement made during the budget is a significant threat to our green belt and greenfield sites. I would be really interested in her role as Chair of the Planning Committee how she responds to CPRE’s and my concerns.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper\nGreen Party Leader – Kirklees Council\nFriday, 1 April 2011\nThreat to green field sites from Conservatives\nThe Green Party today highlighted new threats to our greenbelt and greenfield land announced in the Budget\nWe have significant threats to the green spaces around our villages due to housing targets being proposed by Kirklees Local Development Framework. Kirklees Planners have made clear that Greenbelt and Greenfield land could be designated for development but recent announcements by the Government have made this situation much worse.\nKirklees Green Party Leader Councillor Andrew Cooper said,\n“The targets that have been indicated by Kirklees Planning are already proving to be unachievable due to the downturn in the housing market. The market may pick up again but it is more helpful to developers and communities if there is certainty over a priority being given for development on previously developed brownfield land. The Government has now removed quotas for building on brownfield land.\"\nThe announcement in the budget from the Government has made matters much worse. In the recent budget the Conservatives announced a liberalisation of the Planning System to make it easier for developers to get around the planning process. CPRE – the Campaign to Protect Rural England said of the Conservatives Governments proposals, “The triple whammy of scrapping national brownfield targets, introducing a default yes to development, and pursuing half-baked proposals for land auctions could be devastating to treasured countryside”\nNeil Sinden CPRE’s Director of Policy said,\n\"The planning measures present a potentially devastating threat to the countryside and are unlikely to boost long-term economic growth. To suggest, as successive Governments have done, that planning is a key impediment to growth is just wrong. It is disappointing that George Osborne is repeating the mistaken assertions made by Gordon Brown\". “The planning system exists to prevent unsustainable, unwanted and environmentally damaging development. Today’s Budget is likely to undermine its ability to do this.”\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper, \" How can the Conservatives locally speak with any legitimacy about wanting to preserve green space from development when their government is doing everything it can to do the opposite of that.\"\nCPRE PRESS RELEASE\nhttp://www.cpre.org.uk/news/view/736\nMonday, 13 December 2010\nThank Goodness it's not too bad in Surrey!\nToday the Government revealed the impact of it's cuts on Local Government across the Country. As you can imagine I've been concerned about how leafy Tory Surrey might fare under a leafy Tory Government. I needn't have worried just a 0.3% decrease. Naturally I also was wondering what might happen to Dorset fortunately the Government saw sense and actually raised their funding by 0.25%. The good news just kept coming with Hampshire, West Sussex, Buckingham and Richmond Upon Thames all escaping the worst of the cuts.\nYou can imagine what would have happened if these Councils had received the same level of funding cut as Kirklees or Leeds or Bradford with all the job losses, cuts in services and closed libraries and facilities that these Councils are likely to face. Fortunately for us Northern types there is an answer for the jobless provided by David Shakespeare Conservative Leader of the Local Government Association. David suggests we could all come down south and pick fruit on their farms. This would have the added benefit of taking jobs away from Romanians. Smart eh! David is also the Leader of Buckinghamshire County Council with a very reasonable 0.6% cut so naturally he's fairly pleased and feeling generous enough to let us help out on their farms.\nSo are the Conservatives and their Lib Dem 'pets' out of touch? Well we are 'all in it together' but in the North we are up to our necks in it while in the south it barely reaches beyond the soles of their green wellies.\nYou can imagine what would have happened if these Councils had received the same level of funding cut as Kirklees or Leeds or Bradford with all the job losses, cuts in services and closed libraries and facilities that these Councils are likely to face.

Was there a value in it? Yes I think so. You could certainly get an insight into our meetings you wouldn't have had otherwise. Take for instance the Lib Dem amendment on opposing the cuts to provision for Schools Sports Partnerships. The Greens supported their amendment. When I tweeted to this effect the twitterfeed from Kath Pinnock rather churlishly said 'Shame that 50% Green Group absent from Council'. For those of you who don't know there are only 4 us. One of our 4, Cllr Julie Stewart-Turner had to leave the meeting as she was a Governor for Newsome High School, a Specialist Sports College and had an interest in the motion, and Cllr Graham Simpson was late because he was attending a Tenants Association meeting. So a rather unpleasant attack on the Greens who were actually supporting a Lib Dem Amendment. I thought they could do with all the support they could get at present.\nAnother Lib Dem Amendment we supported was one on Planning Protocols. The amendment insisted that Cllrs on the Planning Committee attend training on Planning (what else). The Conservaties were opposed to this as many of them hadn't gone to training and were quite happy to spout away in an uninformed fashion at Planning meetings potentially leaving the Council open to challenge during an appeal process. My contribution to the debate was to point out that decisions backed up by knowledge should be more important than simple opinion on planning matters. This provoked a rather unpleasant verbal barrage on me by Conservative Councillor Mrs Christine Smith which I found fairly amusing to be honest. I'm not on her Christmas Card list!\nDuring questions I asked the Labour Cabinet Member Councillor Mr Ken Smith what his opinion was of the impact of the rise in Tuition fees on young people in Kirklees. He gave his view that it was potentially disastrous and agreed to my request to write to the Government to express this view. This provoked much comment from Lib Dem Cllrs who defended the tuition fees policy. This directly contradicted the expressed opinions of Lib Dem Candidates during the General Election which I pointed out (and they ignored). I also asked Cllr Peter O Neill what his views were on 'The Big Society'. He gave me a very full response. So much so that I was unable to get my supplementary question in before time was up unfortunately.\nOver 600 people watched the Council meeting on the Web but according to Kath Pinnock webcasting of Council meetings 'doesn't work'. Yes there have been some technical issues that some people have encountered but generally it has gone pretty well. I think the problem for Kath is that it was a Green Party proposal and that gives her a rather jaundiced view on the subject. Cest la vie.\nAfter the meeting I collected a large sealed envelope with the papers for the 'Star Chamber' meeting on Friday and Monday to discuss the Kirklees Budget for the next year. In the envelope are the officers views of how we will acheive the Lib Dem/Con Governments spending cuts. This will not make pleasant reading.\nSaturday, 27 November 2010\nSupermarket Sweep?\n| Dale Winton of Supermarket Sweep fame. |\nWe need to understand how 'the Golden Rule' will work, which says that any savings made will greater than the cost for paying back the measures. With so many different house types, with different usage patterns, different heating requirements this is going to be a tall order and if the golden rule isn't convincing for all householders whatever their circumstances then confidence in the Green Deal will be severely shaken. The other good news is that Private Landlords could be fined if they don't improve the energy efficiency of their dwellings, with Local Councils being able to penalise them up to £5000 for non compliance.\nThis is all good stuff and credit where its due. I don't however believe that Greg's yet given up on his supermarkets as a major deliverer. Lets hope its not a clean (supermarket) sweep when it comes to who actually does the Green Deal and Local Authorities that demonstrate the capability to deliver also get the opportunity.\nSaturday, 20 November 2010\nFeed In Frenzy?\n| A solar farm under construction |\nThe Feed In Tariff for renewable electricity is working and working well. So well, that the Con Dems are already contemplating cutting back on it. When the scheme comes up for review in 2012 they are planning on ‘reducing projected costs by £40 million by 2014-15’. You have to wonder why though. Government does not pay for the Feed In Tariff through taxation, we all do through our energy bills so why is government so concerned? They would have been right to be concerned about ensuring that lower income customers benefit from the FIT through solar installations on their properties but fairrness doesn’t seem to be a priority for this government.\nThough 2014-15 sounds a long way off DECC Minister Greg Barker has said that,\n“in the event of deployment running ahead of published projections would we bring forward that review. But, to reassure the industry further, we will announce the trigger for such an early review shortly”.\nSo there we have it if the policy is working too well the FIT will be cut and soon we will know the limit of the government’s ambition for FIT funded renewables.\nAnother aspect for concern is the Government’s desire to limit large scale ‘solar PV farms’. This statement by Greg Barker in the House of Commons last week sent shivers through the solar industry,\n“we inherited a system that simply failed to anticipate industrial-scale, stand-alone, greenfield solar, and, although we will not act retrospectively, large field-based developments should not be allowed to distort the available funding for roof-based PV, other PV and other types of renewables.”\nThis is clearly nonsense. The Conservatives supported the Feed In Tariff in opposition and were fully aware of the 5MW limit on installations. What is described by Greg Barker as ‘greenfield’ developments could equally be large installations on derelict, brownfield land with little agricultural or amenity value. Far from distorting the market for microgeneration these large PV developments could help drive down the costs of renewables for householders by growing the solar industry and creating large economies of scale.\nThe Government, and particularly the Lib Dems, have made great play of the fact that they will now allow Councils to keep the revenue they make from renewables through the FIT. A prime example is Cornwall Council which is soon to install a 5MW array and this will be a real money spinner for the Council at a difficult time. One of the greatest opportunities for Councils to make back some of the money taken from jobs and vital services in the cuts could be from large scale PV arrays on land that otherwise would have no value to them or to the communities they serve. It now appears that the Government are effectively removing that solar silver lining from their cloud of cuts.\nTuesday, 5 October 2010\nWho is going to clean your house George?\nThis is actually part of a confused theme running through this government of moving people on low incomes around the country. It was only a few months ago that we had Iain Duncan- Smith telling us that he wanted families in council houses in deprived areas to move to council houses in affluent areas so they could get work - see link. There were many echoes of Norman Tebbit's 'On yer bike' speech from the 80s. Of course as we know it was a non policy as there are huge waiting lists for limited numbers of council houses,(Conservative /Labour 'Right to Buy' policies) and this is more pronounced in more affluent areas. So where would these job seekers go if they want to clean George Osbourne's floor? That's right, to the private rented sector but haven't we capped the benefits making it more difficult for them to live near George. Yes we have. Of course the real answer is to put a cap on the rents not on the benefits but that would put a cap on the earnings of private landlords which may not go down too well with some Conservatives who may have interests in this area of the economy. The only crumb of comfort is the unlikely vision of George Osborne having to clean his own house.\n| A blue feather duster |\nGeorge Osborne's announcement that there is to be a new cap placed on Housing Benefit for people in areas with higher rents is going to make it less likely that we have mixed communities with a range of incomes.\nFar from being workless many households on very low incomes have family members carrying out low paid jobs such as cleaning streets, homes and offices. Of course many can, and do, contribute to the rents to the tenant of the property, usually the parents. The tenant could be retired or unable to work due to illness or disability. All this new cut will mean to the tenants or occupants of these homes is a reduction in their income and possibly further pricing them out of the communities that they may have lived in for many years.\nSunday, 3 October 2010\nThe pickled politics behind local government budget cuts\n| Jabba the Hut - Intergalactic Gangster |\n\"Instead of demanding that councils report back to me on everything they do, it means expecting that they become much more accountable to local residents instead\"\nSo lets get this right, the Coalition Government cuts funding to local authorities and then Councillors have to be accountable for the 'choices' they make. Of course there's very little choice in reality. This week has been redundancy/retirement week at Kirklees Council. The numbers of staff leaving the Council is huge, around 500 are gone with around another 1000 to go over the next few months but even this will not be enough services will have to be cut further to satisfy government demands or as Eric puts it,\n\"For the first time, councils will have real power and a real say over how money gets spent. \"\nanother particularly irritating quote,\n\"We've cut the apron strings which have tied (Councils) to Whitehall for too long, giving them freedom to act on behalf of their residents,\"\nThis is just utter tosh and a degree of spin that would make Mandelson blush (OK maybe not). People are being 'freed' of local facilities, services and income. He makes a virtue of getting rid of reporting such as that needed for the Comprehensive Performance Assessment and more reporting to citizens on how ther money is spent. OK but we do need to report on the impact on public services, the jobs lost, the impact on the wider economy, the health and social impact of cuts, the loss of public facilities. The Conservatives and their Lib Dem henchmen should not be allowed off the hook for their actions.\nThey are accountable too!\n,\nLabels:\nConservatives,\nemployment,\nKirklees,\nLib Dems,\nrecession\nSaturday, 25 September 2010\n\"We're all in it together\" - if you use Public Transport\n| Huddersfield's Free Town bus |\n\"Cllr Andrew Cooper is playing party politics as it is not the government that is choosing to cut this service. The decision is a local one!\"\nYou have to ask yourself what cuts passed down by national government could the West Yorkshire Integrated Transport Authortity make that aren't to public transport! It is what they do after all. If the government gets off the hook as easily with the chap who said this they can cut us to oblivion with impunity.\nThen of course there are the environmental implications of a diminished public transport sector but then this is \"the Greenest Government ever\".\nLabels:\nConservatives,\nHuddersfield,\nLib Dems,\nTransport\nSunday, 19 September 2010\nThere's the no such thing as (the BIG) society\nMargaret Thatcher famously informed us that that there was no such thing as 'Society' now her latest Conservative successor David Cameron not only believes Society exists but he wants it to be 'big' as well. This comes as surprise to many of us who were sure David Cameron believed in society but only 'High Society'. OK that's got the Posh Tory jibes out of my system and onto the subject of the 'Big Society'.\nA central belief of 'The Big Society' is that services are better delivered by individuals, community groups and charities rather than public bodies and a belief that we need to 'turn government completely on it's head'. There is also a belief that somehow people's natural desire to improve their communities is being stifled by local or central government and that barriers need to be removed to enable the Big Society to flourish. As David Cameron said in July \"stop us from stopping you do things for your area\".\nWhat comes to mind is a conversation the Newsome Green Party Team had in a pub in the late 90s where we believed we were no longer just community activists but the providers of services. In fact as I remember it we went as far as to say we had become not merely Councillors but an alternative to Council Services. We started to list all the things we did or did with volunteers in the area. When buses were removed from service over the Christmas holiday period we brought in a free volunteer bus service, when areas got heavily littered we organised skips and clean up teams to clear rubbish, when no recycling services existed Councillor Graham Simpson did a waste paper collection round to many households around the Newsome area. I even stretched the point to the limit and suggested that at its height our casework gathering in Council estates was estate management. Like all conversations after a few beers the case may have been overstressed but there was a still a lot of truth there. While believing in voluntarism there was still a strong element of campaigning (and shaming) of the public sector to pick up the slack of inadequate provision in the Newsome area. So the waste paper collections played their part in encouraging Kirklees to put more effort into household recycling, the Christmas Buses pushed Metro into provision of services on Boxing Day at least. So if anything much as we believed in the power of people doing things for themselves we also believed that the public sector could do more than it was doing not less..\nThe role of the 'Big Society' should not be to replace the management and provision of publicly funded services but to enhance them to provide additionality to what is provided already. The classic example in Newsome is 'Growing Newsome'. Volunteers working together on local food projects doing the level of detailed work that would never be provided by the Council nor should it be. This is individuals coming together with passion and commitment on a project which should be more fun than worthy. If the Big Society is not about additionality it is by definition about changing the management of local services from the public sector to charities or community groups. There may be some limited value in this. For instance I can imagine a strong role for the Fuel Poverty Charity, National Energy Action in taking on the role of managing and monitoring progress on action to improve energy efficiency taking powers away from DECC and possibly local authorities. I just wonder whether taking powers from central government is what Dave actually meant. It would be interesting to test this.\nA real test of the Government's commitment to the Big Society would be to actually public fund it rather than doing a one off trawl of dormant bank accounts. If it really believes it will deliver better more efficient and cost effective services it would be worth it, wouldn't it?\n| Newsome's 'Big Society' Clean Up Gang. |\nMargaret Thatcher famously informed us that that there was no such thing as 'Society' now her latest Conservative successor David Cameron not only believes Society exists but he wants it to be 'big' as well.

I just wonder whether taking powers from central government is what Dave actually meant. It would be interesting to test this.\nCapacity and enthusiasm are the keys to successful volunteer action. A lot of people are simply not interested. Why support local food projects when there's so much quality Reality TV to watch. Those who are interested may have lots of different commitments limiting their capacity and eventually people will get bored of growing marrows for the community (or whatever) and want to move onto something else. This is one reason why we need to think very carefully before core services are moved from the Public Sector for the sake of those people who rely on them.\nA classic example of the 'Big Society' gone bad is the concept of 'Free Schools' where parents or charities can get together to run and manage a local school. This will undoubtably unfairly skew financial provision from publicly funded schools to once run by religious organisations or discontented parents who can't justify a school in their area under normal circumstances. Again this would not be additional provision it would be a dubious way of creating yet more inequality in our stupid 'choice' based education system.

I'd be interested. Be interested in the PDFs.<br /><br />There's lots at play in communities except just facilities and I think the work of the Newsome Community Forum and its sub groups is a useful counter to the negative impact of loss of facilities.

These are the foundations to the sense of 'attachment' we have to a place. But at what spatial level is this provided?

Councillor Cooper made the proposal at a September meeting of the EU Committee of the Regions, the body that represents local government and devolved administrations across the European Union. It was originally agreed in September but right wing groups the European Peoples Party and the European Conservatives & Reformists (which includes the UK Conservative Party) bizarrely backed out of supporting a joint statement they had originally agreed to following a unanimous vote. The statement on the vehicle emissions scandal was put to the vote again but this time was passed by a majority vote but this time with the open opposition of the right wing groups including the UK Conservative Party.\nCouncillor Cooper said,\n\"I am delighted that the EU Committee of the Regions has finally come out in favour of a 'polluter pays' principle on vehicle manufacturers who have falsified their emissions tests. The impact of them flouting the law on exhaust fumes has a direct impact on peoples health. The effect on respiratory illnesses is real and we need car manufacturers fines to be invested in cleaner transport alternatives in our communities to help repair the damage they have done.\nI simply can't understand why anyone would back car manufacturers who have been forced to admit they cheated on emissions tests against the people who's health could have been adversely affected by this additional pollution.\nWe now know that car makers have falsified emissions tests on carbon emissions as well. So the issue has become a climate chamge issue as well as a public health matter.\nThe EU Committee of the Regions has made a strong statement on the scandal we need to push harder on national governments, the European Parliament and European Commission to back this principled stand.\"\nDetails of the September EU Committee of the Regions ENVE Commissions meeting\nhttp://www.greeningkirklees.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/eu-committee-of-regions-enve-commission.html\nLink to official EU Committee of Regions Pres Statement\nhttp://www.cor.europa.eu/en/news/Pages/ENVE-declaration-car-emission-test-scandal.aspx\nContact - Councillor Andrew Cooper - 07721 348619 andrew.cooper@kirklees.gov.uk\nStatement below\nA statement from the ENVE Commission of the Committee of the Regions on\nthe automotive emission tests' scandal\nThe ongoing scandal of certain car manufactures cheating on vehicles (diesel and petrol powered cars) emissions' tests is a matter of great concern for local and regional authorities, as those most affected by these situation are the people living in our towns and cities who breathe in these emissions with serious impact on their health. It has also become clear that similarly misleading information on C02 emissions has been provided by certain manufacturers, which risks undermining our efforts at combatting climate change.\nThe ENVE commission members welcome\nthe fact that new test cycles which are based on real-world driving conditions\nwill finally be introduced at the EU level, but they wish to express their deep\ndisappointment that national governments in the Council of Ministers have\ndecided to still allow car manufacturers to exceed more than two times the\nemission limits required by EU law as of 2017, when testing will have to be\nmoved from laboratories to roads. The ENVE members believe this relaxation of\nrules should not be accepted, as the CoR has previously underlined the crucial\nimportance of addressing air quality problems at source.\nPoor air quality is responsible for\napproximately 400,000 premature deaths in the EU ever year and has a\ndisproportionately severe impact on the health of people with respiratory or\ncardiovascular conditions, the very young and elderly people.\nAs representatives of local\ncommunities and regions, ENVE members strive to ensure public health of our\ncitizens and we expect national governments and the EU level to do the same and\nnot tolerate fraudulent practises which cause serious harm to our citizens. We also\nbelieve that appropriate forms of compensation must be paid by companies found\nto be responsible and that local authorities should receive a fair share of\nsuch compensation for the damages their citizens suffer, and to enable cities\nand regions to better implement clean-air programmes.",

If humanity is to avoid simply becoming fossils ourselves then fossil fuels have to stay in the ground. Real security for future generations will only be achieved through serious investment in energy efficiency and a massive scaling up of our renewable energy resources. The emission commitments that have been made so far in preparation for Paris simply are not fit for purpose. They will not keep global temperatures below 2 degrees and the consequences of that lack of resolve must be understood.\nIt is not enough however to simply make those energy resources clean and sustainable. For real security we need to ensure that energy is owned by individuals, communities and local authorities and devolved administration such as the ones we all represent. The political power wielded by large energy corporations will ultimately get in the way of action on climate change. EU citizens should not simply be energy consumers they should be energy producers & generators in their own right. We need an Energy Generating Democracy.\nAnd finally if the people of Europe are to have Energy Security then their heat and power must be affordable. Energy or fuel poverty must be eradicated across Europe. No one should have to choose between eating of heating their home. I would like you to come to England to see some of the work Kirklees Council is doing to tackle fuel poverty not because of the policies of the UK Govt but because of our own local priorities.\nNational policies too often act as a limiting ceiling on local ambitions on energy security we need them to be a floor that we can build upon.\nWe need an Energy Union for now but also for future generations.\nWe need an Energy Union for the people.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

By establishing a ‘Huddersfield Jobs’ Youtube Channel employers will be able to look for potential employees and get additional information about them that they wouldn’t get from a simple CV. People looking for work will also be able to email a link to their Youtube Interview to local companies so they can get themselves, their character and their skills noticed. In this way we can help people get back into employment quicker.”\nAndrew has identified some funding to support this project through the Huddersfield Area Committee and is working with council officers to get it up and running and off the ground. He said,\n“I think this initiative has real potential. We have got to come up with fresh ways to use the new media to help get people into work. If we get this right I believe this idea could be taken up by other Councils and have national significance.”\nWhat an excellent idea\nReplyDeleteWell this is a good idea.

Of course nobody really 'welcomes' bad news but in UN diplomacy terms this means acknowledging its legitimacy which is the starting point for taking radical action to address the problem. Disappointing doesn't cover it really. Instead they have decided to 'note' the report. 'Note' is diplomatic code for \"I saw it but I'm not going to necessarily do anything about it\". So why do these oil rich nations run by despots behave so poorly? Well the clue is in the question I guess. My hope is that when Government Representatives from these countries arrive tomorrow that they move their position swiftly to one which is compatible with the survival of civilization.\nHow should the UK respond? Well ignoring our own Government's failings for just a second perhaps we should react in the same way as we would to a Novichok attack or the murdering of a journalist in a Government building. Acts of barbarism by Governments are not all as obvious as these examples but the contempt shown for science and the billions who will suffer is truly horrific and mind bogglingly self serving.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

So well, that the Con Dems are already contemplating cutting back on it. When the scheme comes up for review in 2012 they are planning on ‘reducing projected costs by £40 million by 2014-15’. You have to wonder why though. Government does not pay for the Feed In Tariff through taxation, we all do through our energy bills so why is government so concerned? They would have been right to be concerned about ensuring that lower income customers benefit from the FIT through solar installations on their properties but fairrness doesn’t seem to be a priority for this government.\nThough 2014-15 sounds a long way off DECC Minister Greg Barker has said that,\n“in the event of deployment running ahead of published projections would we bring forward that review. But, to reassure the industry further, we will announce the trigger for such an early review shortly”.\nSo there we have it if the policy is working too well the FIT will be cut and soon we will know the limit of the government’s ambition for FIT funded renewables.\nAnother aspect for concern is the Government’s desire to limit large scale ‘solar PV farms’. This statement by Greg Barker in the House of Commons last week sent shivers through the solar industry,\n“we inherited a system that simply failed to anticipate industrial-scale, stand-alone, greenfield solar, and, although we will not act retrospectively, large field-based developments should not be allowed to distort the available funding for roof-based PV, other PV and other types of renewables.”\nThis is clearly nonsense. The Conservatives supported the Feed In Tariff in opposition and were fully aware of the 5MW limit on installations. What is described by Greg Barker as ‘greenfield’ developments could equally be large installations on derelict, brownfield land with little agricultural or amenity value. Far from distorting the market for microgeneration these large PV developments could help drive down the costs of renewables for householders by growing the solar industry and creating large economies of scale.\nThe Government, and particularly the Lib Dems, have made great play of the fact that they will now allow Councils to keep the revenue they make from renewables through the FIT. A prime example is Cornwall Council which is soon to install a 5MW array and this will be a real money spinner for the Council at a difficult time. One of the greatest opportunities for Councils to make back some of the money taken from jobs and vital services in the cuts could be from large scale PV arrays on land that otherwise would have no value to them or to the communities they serve. It now appears that the Government are effectively removing that solar silver lining from their cloud of cuts.\n\"It now appears that the Government are effectively removing that solar silver lining from their cloud of cuts.\"\nReplyDeleteYes, AFTER Cornwall gets its money spinning array. Am I wrong in thinking Cornwall has a lot of Lib Dem councillors and MPs (for now!), or am I being too cynical?\nI think you could be being too cynical Adrian. The administration is shared.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2021_05_if-you-come-down-to-woods-today_html/content_94.html": "Longley Woods is a sprawling area of 63 acres of mixed woodland and is a quiet haven surrounded by housing. It is a great place to walk, collect your thoughts, to appreciate nature and maybe gather a bit of wild garlic. There's lots of exploring to do along the woodland trails and part of it arches round Longley Park golf course. I first became aware of the woods about 20 years ago through the work of Stephen Preest, who is sadly no longer with us. He was one of the founders of the Friends of Longley Woods that represented the community interest in the woods and acts as its eyes and ears coordinating volunteer activity there. Stephen is sadly no longer with us but in recent years Louise Galvin and now Julia Clark have taken up his mantle as the community custodian of the woods, providing the focus for the Friends group and coordinating clean ups. Each of them showed/show a real passion for this area and care what happens there.\nIn recent years the main issues have been noisy trail bikes illegally using the woods, heavy littering especially on the boundaries and just a general impression that the woods has no institution that cared what happened there. Many would have no way of knowing that Kirklees Council actually owns it. So using our small ward budgets Newsome Councillors have been doing what we can to invest in the woods. Councillor Karen Allison has lead on a project to make it as awkward as possible for trail bikes to access the woods with new stiles and fencing placed strategically atpossible access points. This has enabled me to write such great headlines as 'Karen causes a fence' on our newsletters. I lead on a project to put new signage at the access points telling people what the expectations are for people using the woods. Karen, Sue Lee-Richards and I have all helped out with community clean ups which is an ongoing task unfortunately but it makes a real difference when it's done.\nFor the future I'd like to see more activity in the woods helping the community to appreciate this natural beauty and learn more about the ecology of our local area. As Green Councillors showing we and the wider community care for this valued woodland is the best way to secure its long term future.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2012_02_press-release-greens-and-independents_html/content_378.html": "The Green Party and the Holme Valley Independent Councillors have called for a radical change to the way Kirklees Council goes about its budget setting process to give local communities greater say over how and where money is spent.\nThe Greens and Independents proposal entitled ‘Kirklees Budget 2.0’ would see the establishment of a separate budget pot to be allocated by Village Associations, Community Forums and Parish and Town Councils on priorities that are set by local communities.\nLeader of the Green Group Councillor Andrew Cooper said,\n“The funds that would be directed to these plans would not be mainstream Council funds from the Council Tax or the Revenue Support Grant provided by central government. Instead they would be from a variety of public funds and money made available to communities that Councils themselves cannot easily access.”\n“Let’s make no mistake I don’t agree with the Governments Budget cuts and how they seem to be targeted at the most vulnerable. What we do need to do is find practical ways we can help to direct more support and involve people in deciding where funds are best directed. In this way we can help ensure that the things people care about and that make up the fabric of community life have a secure future and are more resilient against the annual cull of local services and facilities”.\nLeader of the Independent Group Terry Lyons said,\n“To make this work we are going to need to establish local plans and get more people involved and interested in carrying out worthwhile projects to improve and enhance their local communities and the environment. There is already a lot of good work going on out there with better directed support from Kirklees we can help communities access more funds from an array of sources”\nENDS\nKirklees Budget 2.0 – Community led budgets to protect facilities and services\nThis is not a proposition to create a new Kirklees Council led budget but one which directs a proportion of funding to devolved groups such as Ward Community Forums and Parish Councils which are demonstrably ‘community led’ organisations with their own locally determined priorities.\nRationale\nThe overall rationale for this proposition is:\n• Council resources are increasingly stretched and focussed rightly on maintaining essential public services\n• We need to establish new ways of funding local priorities that take into account the wishes of people in all our communities across Kirklees\n• Supporting communities to do more through cooperation and to take more responsibility for themselves is central to the councils vision; and vital if we are to reduce dependency on public services to deliver more sustainable communities and reduce future demands on the public purse.\n• A proactive approach is needed to ensure we make best use of combined resources to deliver outcomes in local areas.\nCommunity directed resources and decision making\nIncreasingly government is directing limited resources and decision making directly to community organisations and parish councils, bypassing principal councils such as Kirklees. This has included one-off funding pots, such as Community First, but as new legislation and government policy comes into force, this effect will increase and become more systemic.\nIn addition to resources, a range of formal decision making powers are being focused at the parish/community level, a significant example being the ‘neighbourhood planning’ aspects of the Localism Act. Other provisions in the Localism Act (those relating to ‘assets of community value’ and the ‘community right to challenge’, for example) signal a clear desire for communities to be more actively engaged and involved in developing new locally-based solutions for delivering local priorities and outcomes. Further, more radical devolution of neighbourhood level services to parish level has also been mooted in the Open Public Services White Paper.\nNone of the above is inconsistent with the aspirations we have already agreed in Kirklees Council’s 2014 vision, but we need to be proactive in how we shape and guide these changes. The danger is that there is not the capacity, or in some cases the will, in local areas to take advantage of these funds or decision making powers, meaning that more disadvantaged communities could lose out, as more articulate and wealthier communities take the lions share of the cash and new opportunities. This could lead to further marginalisation of disadvantaged communities, increasing inequalities and widening gaps; resulting in poorer outcomes and escalating costs for the principal council.\nKirklees Council’s role must be to remove barriers and enable communities to realise their own aims and ambitions. This could make up for the deficiencies in the Government’s ‘Big Society’ model and actually make it work.\nTaking the opportunity offered by Neighbourhood Planning\nAs mentioned above, the Localism Act provides a strong incentive for why we need to support the development of capacity in communities at a local level. The option for areas to produce Neighbourhood Development Plans is both a threat and an opportunity, it is quite right to be cynical about them as being a charter to ‘build as much as you like but not as little as you would wish’ so long as they don’t contradict the numbers in the Local Development Framework. But equally they provide a real opportunity for local dialogue and ownership, not just focused on development and new houses, but around communities’ broader aspirations for their local areas.\nWe need to ensure that communities have equal chance to develop Neighbourhood Development Plans that are properly resourced, not in conflict with each other and that are not hijacked by developers or other organisations with dubious motives. It would be inefficient to support a locally led Neighbourhood Development Plan Process and then not use to that work to help consolidate that capacity to ensure there is ongoing community based approaches to direct resources and actions on local priorities. As such the establishment of ward based community forums where they don’t exist (and don’t conflict with parish boundaries) should be a priority for Kirklees as should the consolidation of support for them where they do exist. We should also lend our support to enable Town and Parish Councils to realise their potential as bodies to coordinate the delivery of services in their communities.\nPotential sources of funding\nThere are a variety of sources of funding and capacity which could be better aligned to support local community capacity building and the delivery of local priorities and service solutions under the model proposed through this budget amendment. Potential funding sources include:\n• Funding which can be accessed by community organisations, but which is not available directly to principal councils – including:\no Parish/Town Council precepts – this is an existing funding stream which has been used to successfully lever in funds from other third sector sources, e.g. Kirkburton Parish Council/East Peak Innovation Partnership.\no Community First and similar initiatives\no Support for capacity building\no Support for the development of community led cooperatives and mutuals\no Funding for community-led energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives, e.g. the Local Energy Assessment Fund\no Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) - Localism Act reforms to the CIL will require a ‘meaningful proportion’ of the levy to be handed over to the local neighbourhoods where the development takes place)\no Big Lottery Funding\no Landfill Tax funding\no Big Society Capital (formerly referred to as the Big Society Bank) - will not make direct grants but will instead act as a wholesaler of capital, attracting funding from foundations, institutional investors, companies and private individuals, to invest in intermediary organisations. Applicants, from all parts of the UK, could approach the intermediary organisations and access capital at a more competitive rate than through a normal bank.\n• Kirklees Sources:\no New Homes Bonus – the intention behind the New Homes Bonus which sees the government match the council tax on any new properties for the first six years, was to incentivise communities to ‘go for growth’. It is arguably wrong for the council to rely on such funds for core funding and can lead to accusations, fair or not, that the Council seeks development to fund core services at the detriment of the local environment. If instead this funding was directed towards local communities to resource their priorities there would at least be a logical symmetry in that communities have taken the ‘pain’ of new development but have access to benefits and could direct funding to locally determined priorities\no Land and assets – could be made available, for example through Community Land Trusts to support local priorities and new service solutions (a similar rationale could apply to Parish/Town Council assets).\no Green Deal Partnership funding - the Governments ‘Green Deal’ is introduced this year and partnerships between Councils and Green Deal providers offer real opportunities to raise significant funds based on access to Council, Parish and Community endorsement. This will be new funding that is available and unaccounted for in current Kirklees Budgets\no Community Infrastructure Levy – we could go further than the minimum requirements under the Localism Act and direct a greater proportion of S106/CIL monies to community forums or parish councils\no Kirklees Community Development support and support to local area governance (funding and staff capacity)\no Proportion of planning officer resource\no Proportion of devolved Area Committee budgets\no Other, mainstream Kirklees Council resources, which relate to the delivery of neighbourhood level services, provided they could be disaggregated to a more local level without losing economies of scale or strategic coherence.\nClearly, the arrangements proposed here will take time to develop and embed – it would not be necessary or even desirable to take a ‘big bang’ approach to consolidate the above capacity and funding. What is required, though, is a meaningful enough initial investment to give a clear sense of commitment and provide sufficient leverage to engage parishes and communities, which could then be built up incrementally.\nGovernance\nIf we are serious about building local community capacity and maximising the impact of increasingly limited but very disparate funding sources, we need to create a new solution to oversight and governance of community level resources. A key principle behind this budget proposal is the need to bring together currently fragmented resources and capacity to enable community-led solutions to emerge and flourish. We have to accept that the traditional ‘top down’ forms of area based governance cannot fulfil this role alone, given that an increasing level of resources are outside of the direct control of the council or local councillors.\nThe overall thrust of the government’s localism proposals arguably presents a real challenge to local democracy and local community leadership. The approach outlined here, provides a potentially powerful response to that challenge and an opportunity to stimulate a much more dynamic and entrepreneurial role for Kirklees ward councillors.\nIn addition, it creates an environment where community activity, enterprise and capacity can be combined with public, private and philanthropic resources to stimulate innovation and create added value.\nA mechanism needs to be created whereby these resources and funding streams can be collectivised and fairly allocated. We propose establishing an overarching not-for-profit body, independent of Kirklees Council, established with a clear public interest purpose. (Membership of the body could include senior Kirklees councillors, parish chairs, third sector leaders, community representatives, partner agencies, business leaders and others. This would be the primary vehicle to which relevant public sector staff, capacity and resources would be transferred. Similar Community Interest Companies could be established at lower levels of geography, such as Parish/Town Council boundaries, to create, lead and administer community-led programmes and activities, pooling resources available at these lower geographies, such as the parish precept, Area Committee monies, CIL, New Homes bonus etc.. Kirklees ward councillors, working alongside parish councillors and others, would have a key leadership role using the more locally focused CIC’s as a vehicle to pool resources and develop local initiatives based on local priorities and aspirations.\nThe local CIC’s would draw on the expertise, staff, resources and capacity of the Kirklees-wide body who would provide overarching support, community development capacity, capacity to help support the development of Neighbourhood Development Plans, funding expertise and administrative / back-office support.\nLike the fist!!\nReplyDeleteOh, and the prose.\nNice little touch I thought.\nReplyDeleteI agree that Localism's agenda is anti-democratic and is effectively reducing local democracy, and I'm interested in your idea of a CIC that would apparently work in parallel to Kirklees Council and try and pick up the services that it's forced to abandon as a result of public spending cuts. But don't you always come back to the problem of lack of democratic accountability? So while the CIC might manage to continue to provide public services that would otherwise have been lost, you've still in a sense accepted and worked within the anti-democratic Localism agenda. I find that very worrying.\nReplyDeleteThanks for the comment Jenny. I understand your concerns. I guess Parish Councils have a degree of democratic accountability especially where there are contested elections. The Neighbourhood Development Plans, which we are seeking to link this too, would need a local vote to be approved so that would be another democratic element. Having said that. My issue with the localism agenda is probably the same as yours in that funds seem to being diverted from Councils and made available in a fairly unfair and unstructured ways to communities. In our proposal we hope to redress the balance and provide more support to communities where need may be great but where they may need more help to access funding. Govt commitment to localism doesn't bear a lot of examination. Lots of evidence here, the National Planning Policy Framework, Govt control and threats over Council Tax setting by Councils.\nReplyDelete",

I should get a good book you might say, but my reason for reading this was because I'd been informed that it would prevent small community organisations installing solar PV panels benefitting from the Feed In Tariff if they had received public money. This was particularly important in Kirklees due to the Community Buildings Energy Grants which had appeared due to a Lib Dem amendment to the council budget last year (for details see this blogpost from Feb 2010). Ironically the Con/Lib Dem Government now threatened to pull the rug from under the scheme taking all the lasting benefits and making the 'Big Society' somewhat more difficult to acheive. Schemes like the solar panels for Newsome South Methodist Church were under threat.\nI spent a good hour or so reading, and re-reading the document to make sure I was right but could see that according to the 'Amendment to article 8' on page 4, that if grants were paid to community organisations before the end of June and the solar panels fitted before October then the Feed In Tariff would remain intact for those churches, sports clubs and community groups seeking funds from the Community Buildings Energy Grant. I made the relevant officers and the Leader of the Council aware and soon the Chief Exec was geting involved finding ways to fast track the grants. Hopefully many schemes which were under threat will now proceed but this is a one off loophole which will soon close. With further reviews of feed in tariffs on the cards confidence among the renewables industry is not exactly at an all time high.\nA blog by Green Party Councillor Andrew Cooper about Green Politics, action on Climate Change, Kirklees Council and our activity to improve the local and global environment (and also anything that I fancy talking about) Promoted and published by A Cooper, 76 Brockholes Lane, Holmfirth HD9 7EB\nMonday, 20 June 2011\nSunday, 19 June 2011\n'Huddersfield Conservative' attacks the Green Party\n| Syringa . The flower which gives it's name to the street where I used live with 'Huddersfield Conservative' Bernard McGuin |\nCost of ‘green’ policies\nTHE true cost of renewable means of producing power are now being exposed.\nAs I have said in the past, the power companies pay four times the value of any electricity produced by wind and solar means. The cost is passed on to the consumer in hidden subsidies. It is effectively an extra tax on already heavily burdened ordinary hard working individuals.\nThe fact that energy prices themselves are screaming ahead of inflation means that effectively we are putting a brake on economic growth and ultimately economic recovery.#\nTo all those people who voted Green in the last local elections, the message should be, do you really support policies that harm the British economy?\nTo the coalition government I would ask – do we really have to follow every edict from Europe on cutting carbon emissions and do you think all our competitors put so-called climate change policies ahead of economic growth?\nBernard McGuin\nHuddersfield Conservative\nBlaming the wrong folk\nA RATHER bizarre letter from Conservative Bernard McGuin blames the Green Party for taxes on energy bills.Last time I checked it was the Conservatives who were running the country with their Lib Dem helpers, not the Green Party.\nHe says these taxes support renewable energy. Yes they do – but nuclear energy is very heavily subsidised too.\nIt is also worth noting that half of the £20m budget for Kirklees Warm Zones free insulation scheme came from these sources, which is saving energy and money for Kirklees householders to the tune of about £4m each year.Mr McGuin would be quite correct in blaming the Green Party for the free insulation scheme which was the result of an amendment we made to the Kirklees Budget in 2007.\nClr Andrew Cooper\nLeader, Green Party, Kirklees Council\nEnergy subsidies\nIN REPLY to the Clr Andrew Cooper, (Mailbag, June 17) who thinks I wrote a bizarre letter regarding renewable forms of energy, may I just remind him that on his website that he acknowledged that the Feed In Tariffs, that rewards producers of such energy with a 41p per unit payment as opposed to the market price of 11p per unit, is a form of indirect taxation?\nI was careful in my letter to say that it was a subsidy which was being paid by us in our electricity bills.\nOn average we are each paying £200 plus a year to pay for this and other forms of ‘green taxes’ in our annual expenditure on energy.\nThe coalition has been saddled with the last government’s zeal to expand wind and solar power.\nThose that can afford the cost of solar panelling, the comparatively rich, will make a good return on their investment, around 10-12%. Paid by us poor folk who can’t afford it.\nIf you want to rent out your roof for solar panels, beware! You must have room for 16 panels and those in terraced housing, most of us in Huddersfield, won’t qualify.\nAlthough insulating one’s house is a good thing, the cost is again taken by the taxpayer.The warming Kirklees scheme was undertaken by a Conservative administration. I have heard all four political groups take credit for this scheme. Of course it is possible the three green councillors outvoted the other 66.\nThe main thrust of my letter was to ask whether the ‘taxing’ of energy would put a brake on economic growth. It is only that which will get us out of the debt that the country faces. In the General Election 2010, there was a move towards a rejection of tax and spend policies. Do the people who voted for Green councillors in Newsome and Kirkburton want a return to that?\nBernard McGuin\nHuddersfield Conservative\nResponse to Bernard McGuin\nConservative Bernard McGuin states the impact on energy bills of policies to tackle fuel poverty and reduce carbon emissions (or ‘green taxes’ as he puts it) is £200. The figure he gives is one from a right wing newspaper parroting a dubious report from a right wing policy group. The actual figure given by the Department of Energy Climate Change on behalf of the right wing Conservative Government is £42 per year. I can direct Mr McGuin to the appropriate part of his government’s website if he wants.\nHe says the coalition has been ‘saddled with the last government’s zeal to expand wind and solar power’. Actually there was consensus among the Westminister parties about the need for a feed in tariff for renewable energy before the General Election. If he can show me anything at all which contradicts my view I’d be interested to see it.\nMr McGuin also attempts to take credit away from the Greens for gaining free insulation for households in Kirklees through the Warm Zone scheme. The Green Party amendment to the 2007 Council budget which made the scheme free is a matter of public record. The emails I have between myself and the then Conservative leader and the official notes of discussions of meetings on the budget further confirm free insulation as a Green Party initiative. I’m more than happy to show Mr McGuin the evidence.\nHe asks whether the taxing of energy would ‘put a brake on economic growth’. As much of the money goes towards schemes that help reduce peoples fuel bills and projects which create employment and economic activity that is highly unlikely.\nIt is easy for Mr McGuin to write letters to the paper repeating misinformation he may have read in the national tabloids but he would do better to direct his concerns regarding fuel prices to the government which is lead by the Conservative Party, which for reasons best known to himself, he supports.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper\nLeader of the Green Party group\nSaturday, 18 June 2011\nMore Solar for Newsome\nCouncil bungalows on Ing Lane and Hart Street are to get solar panels in August.

It's on the weekend of 23rd and 24th July and like The Monkey Club, Hall Bower Athletic Club is community owned and managed so well worth supporting. The bar staff are all volunteers on a rota and the club is open every night from 8.30pm onwards. The great thing, of course, is the setting in Hall Bower village surrounded by fields with Castle Hill in the background and its a nice walk from my home in Brockholes.\nSaturday, 4 June 2011\nMonkeyFest!\nThe Armitage Bridge MonkeyFest is due again on the 2nd/3rd July and I'm going to miss it! Little did I know when I put myself forward to be the Chair of the Association of Green Councillors last year that the next Conference would clash with one of the best weekend events of the year. The Monkey Club in Armitage Bridge is a great community owned and managed club officially known as the Armitage Bridge Working Mens Club. It is much loved by it's members (of which I am one) and each year holds a beer festival with a barbecue and music.\nCould there be anything better than sitting beside the stream on Dean Brook Road, Armitage Bridge drinking fine ales listening to music and tucking into a burger?

Long past its sell by date it still haunts our streets - the zombie posterboard! All around, the lamp posts are bare now, but it clings onto existence, you could hardly call it a life. What is its purpose? To mock the one that bears its name? To remind us that in life it failed in its task? Now it is forgotten by those who put it up. They have long gone back to whatever accursed place they came - Birkby I think.\nIt was doomed from the start.

As the train came into the station the guard beckoned us all to the front 3 carraiges. We got on the train and were informed that as there was only one guard on the train that to ensure passengers could be properly monitored only half the train would be in use. We were then informed that the threat level was 'critical'. People on the train started looking around, checking each other out. Playing 'Spot the Terrorist' I guess. I tried to avoid looking at the young Asian man opposite me. He was probably going shopping, seeing a relative, going to play football. It didn't matter really but I felt for him and anyone who might be assumed to be a Muslim on that train.\nMI5 Threat levels on the likelihood of a Terrorist Attack are as follows\nMI5 Threat levels on the likelihood of a Terrorist Attack are as follows\n- LOW means an attack is unlikely.\n- MODERATE means an attack is possible, but not likely\n- SUBSTANTIAL means an attack is a strong possibility\n- SEVERE means an attack is highly likely\n- CRITICAL means an attack is expected imminently\nSo right now 'something horrific' somewhere could happen. To me substantial, severe, critical all just tell us all to be scared, To watch out, to stay at home and to look at other people a bit more closely than you would normally. Of course the likelihood of being bombed compared with being knocked down on the road in a traffic accident, having a medical emergency etc are not easily comaparble. If they were we could perhaps make some sort of meaningful comparison about how shit scared we should be, but then that just feeds all the paranoia that is out there anyway. The threat level alerts seem to be the very antithesis of the stoic, revived (and much revised) WW2 'Keep Calm and Carry On' motto that now graces many a coffee mug and tea towel. Are threat levels consistent with British culture and values. Well maybe not. They don't feel very 'stiff upper lip' at all really.\nWe are not given any information about why the threat of a terrorist attack is 'critical' rather than 'severe' or 'substantial' or where it might occur. Its not like a weather forecast but you can imagine someone standing up pointing at a map of the UK saying \"the likelihood of a terrorist attack in Cornwall or the Outer Hebrides is quite low but if you're in a major conurbation like London or Manchester perhaps you should stay at home and watch a movie or the entire box set of ' Game of Thrones' from beginning to end. When we move down from 'Critical' to 'Severe' or a more comforting 'Substantial'. then you shoudl feel safer to venture outside into the sunshine (or more likely rain)\nWe are not given any information about why the threat of a terrorist attack is 'critical' rather than 'severe' or 'substantial' or where it might occur.

The threat levels are so similar to each other that all that most of them mean is to be wary, be vigilant,be very afraid.\n\"Alright Cooper what do you suggest we do then?\" - There should be tailored announcements when MI5 knows something, with a Spokesperson making a statement. Obviously not compromising anybody or anything but giving more of a narrative than the all encompassing ' Be Afraid' threat levels. The danger is that people become unfazed by them and ignore them\nHas anyone even considered that some of the very few maniacs who are sitting in their sad flats waiting to commit these sort of atrocities may consider that one of their objectives may have been acheived if we are at a 'critical' state of alert. No bombs need to go off now, no vehicle needs to plough into a shopping centre today as 'terror' has already been acheived and has the Government approved label authenticating that fact. They can bide their time to when we are in the comfort of a 'substantial' level of threat before they act. All Government has really acheived is a delay.\nI want to live in an optimistic country, where we are not told to be afraid. Where life, love and the pursuit of happiness makes us look with hope to the future. We need to regain innocence, expectation and positivity. So here's 'Sunny' by Boney M from a less complicated time. \"What about the IRA?\" - Sigh!\nHas anyone even considered that some of the very few maniacs who are sitting in their sad flats waiting to commit these sort of atrocities may consider that one of their objectives may have been acheived if we are at a 'critical' state of alert.

People saw what happened to their posters and we'd probably have come across as unpleasant if we had revelled in their misfortune.

I'm hoping the next few weeks are going to be mine. In early December I will be in Katowice, Poland for a week as part of EU Committee of the Regions Delegation to the COP24 United Nations Climate Change talks. To get to this point has been a three year journey.\nMy first Climate Change Talks experience was COP21. In the delegates area they were negotiating the historic agreement to limit Greenhouse emissions to 2 degrees above global norms and hopefully 1.5 degrees. I was outside the delegate area in Paris speaking in a room somewhere to probably less than a dozen people. As part of my talk to the folks there I reflected on the fact that UK Local Authorities had received no communications from central Government about helping them reduce emissions to achieve the Paris Climate Goals. Sadly 3 years later this is still the case.This got me thinking, especially when it became clear that the carbon savings identified by national Governments, the 'Nationally Determined Contributions' were not going to be enough to limit emissions to the targets agreed at COP21 in Paris. So why not empower Regional and Local Authorities to play their part in achieving the Paris Climate goals? Why not encourage them to produce their own action plans to reduce emissions? So the concept of Locally Determined Contributions was born. This lead to it being referenced in 3 opinions (policy statements) of the EU Committee of the Regions and also 1 in the European Parliament.\nLast year at COP23 in Bonn an agreement to develop Locally Determined Contributions was agreed at the Global Local and Regional Leaders summit. This was not the same as the UNFCCC agreeing it but was without doubt a significant moment and gave LDCs a global stage.\nAt COP24 in Katovice, for me, it is an opportunity to make a real difference. It is the Climate Summit that agrees the Rulebook for achieving the Paris Climate Goals. How we will actually do it. I am part of the EU Delegation and so Brexit means it could be my last chance to influence global climate change agreements. So its a big deal. There are loads of positives. The European Parliament have referenced and backed Locally Determined Contributions in their position statement going into COP24. In addition the statement from 'Non State Actors' the global groups representing Local Government, Trade Unions, Agriculture and other organisations have also backed LDCs. I am receiving great support from talented and committed staff at the EU Committee of the Regions and from global bodies such as Climate Alliance and ICLEI. All things seem possible at the moment. My diary is filling up for the week and I feel hopeful.\nThe ambition/hope is that Locally Determined Contributions fill the gap in emissions savings that we need to make to prevent runaway climate change. That 'Think Global Act Local' becomes a tangible reality fostering an enthusiastic international movement focused on creating not just a stable environment but a sustainable better world.\nSo wish me well. I have a sense of mission and an understanding that this could be a key moment. Like the emissions contributions I mean to achieve I remain determined.

The Conservatives had kicked this project back when they were in power but I took up the case with the new Labour administration and who knows I may have helped get them back on track. One additional benefit is that it is in the Newsome Ward helping us keep our status as the UK's biggest user of microgeneration technologies. We also find out next week (I hope) what will be going on with the government's Clean Energy Cashback so hopefully they will get a good return for the solar electricity they generate and use within the building.\nGood News on the Biomass front and bad news on hydro side. 7 Kirklees Council owned buildings either have wood chip or wood pellet boilers installed or they have it planned in the next couple of years. In the Newsome Ward there is the Blagden Farm sheltered housing complex on Edale Avenue which once installed will save 45 tonnes of carbon each year. I wonder if they've made use of CERT funding from utilities on his one? Could save the Council a few pennies. The disappointments are Huddersfield Town Hall which apparently doesn't have the storage capacity for the wood pellets and the Deighton Centre who's uncertain long term future has delayed the investment. But the hydro plant proposed for Aspley has been cancelled due to additional costs that British Waterways would have imposed for use of the weir. The Renewable Energy Fund that was allocated to this project has been diverted to support the Hillhouse Low Carbon Communities project.\nA tale of two housing developments is also on the agenda. 36 Council homes in Batley will be built to Code for Sustainable Homes Level 4 which will have to incorporate some form of renewable energy to acheive that standard. In Newsome Ward on the Poplar/Gelder Estate site 35 homes will be built by Yorkshire Housing on former Council land but this will only be built to Code for Sustainable Homes level 3. I did question this and suggested that the new Clean Energy Cashback could make the installation of solar panels which would raise the standard to 4 possible but that appears to be ignored.\nOther good stuff on the agenda include voltage optimisation and the councils preparation for the Carbon Reduction Commitment.",

Left Bank is successful conversion of a church into a community cafe, event space and music venue. We were really interested to see how it operated as we are hoping to do something similar in St John's Church in Newsome through the new Community Benefit Society, we have set up called 'The Newsome Centre'.\nIt has been in operation for 20 years so seeing what they do, learning from their successes and avoiding pitfalls was a good use of our time.\nA big chunk of their income comes from weddings, not the ceremonies (as former churches can't be used for that purpose), but the receptions where families come together to celebrate marriages. These are some of the most important days of many people's lives so really important that these are done right and professionally.\nLeft Bank and its cafe are open 7 days a week and when we went it was full of young people, mainly students, using the Wi-Fi, having a coffee and doing coursework. Through the week a variety of different groups use the space such as Knit and Natter groups, life drawing classes, older persons art groups, pottery classes, break dancers. It is a vibrant hub for the community, and they have a rich programme of events including Beer Festivals, Arts Festivals, 70s nights, Christmas Parties and indoor 'car boot' sales.\nThere is a mix of seating from comfy settees, desk space and a few pews. There's a recognition of their heritage as a church with a pulpit, the old organ and a number of other features remaining in place. You can buy a house plant or two there, a birthday card and paintings from local artists.\nThe look of the place is quite funky with attractive lighting installations and bright colourful murals. You would be quite happy to spend a few relaxing hours hanging out there with a coffee and a nice piece of cake.\nOne key bit of advice we had was \"be generous\" to organisations with time and space. There should be space for income generating activity but also free space to organisations which have a lot to give to the community and add to the activity and vibrancy of the place.\nA big thanks to Sue Jennings from Left Bank who gave us a real insight into the sort of things we need to be looking at in The Newsome Centre's Business Plan.",

It says that we have already passed the peak of oil discovery and that production of oil and gas from fossil sources will inevitably decline. Given much of our civilisation is based on fossil fuels this is disturbing reading. The concept of peak oil is well established and has moved from a concern of environmentalists to well informed former oil company insiders. The oil companies themselves play down the peak oil debate and their own brand of denial pushes the issue down the political agenda. But it is coming.\nDr Campbell outlines a future where oil goes up to 100 dollars a barrel and where the world population falls by billions to a level half what it is today in 40 years. All pretty apocalyptic stuff. Modern food production is highly dependent on oil and therefore food production and prices are highly sensitive to the cost and availabity of oil. It seems crazy that we are actually using oil to produce plastic bags and useless plastic rubbish from mainly China when oil should be used carefully and sparingly. It gives an additional push for renewable energy in a post oil world.\nToday I've been in a Council briefing on the Kirklees budget issues we face and quite rightly we are looking at how we deal with the cuts being passed down by central government and it is truly horrendous. We are as we know 'in a deficit situation' a financial deficit and the Tories (and Lib Dems) tells us we are living way beyond our needs. Whereas money is an artificial construct, oil is a very real commodity and a limited resource which we have been using at an alarming rate. We are effectively in an 'oil and gas deficit' with consequences which affect our very civilisation. We have to really understand and accept there's a problem before it can be addressed. We have a long way to go in a short time.\nWe have been here before of course back in the 70s with the OPEC crisis which prompted a flurry of concern about oil depletion and apocalpyptic films which the deniers point to as 'proof' that the peak oilers are crying 'wolf'. The other charge of course is that there is some sort of hankering to live in the past and that talk of a transition to a low oil (and carbon) economy is anti - progress. This sort of talk is just dodging the issue, the problem exists and we have to find ways of dealing with it some of this will be using technology to take us to a low carbon future and yes there will probably be some old skills that we have to employ to boost local food production. Anyway to reinforce a few prejudices about peak oilers here's 'Heavy Horses' by Jethro Tull from 1978 about a time when the 'Oil Barons have run dry' and when we will be using horses again to work the land.",

I've simply got to do one to break my record of 78 blogposts last year!\nIts almost ironic that 2012 ends as much of it has been. Wet and raining with flood risk in many places across the country. It has been the year of floods (and the Olympics) and government has seemed 'all at sea' on how to respond. When many homes are becoming increasingly uninsurable it failed to come to an agreement with the Association of British Insurers to address the situation. As floods affected roads and infrastructure councils, which were already cash strapped , found themselves further out of pocket . In terms of flood prevention (or at least not making things any worse than they are at the moment) the government delayed the introduction of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems on new developments, seemingly as part of their 'roll over and tickle my tummy' approach when dealing with the Home Builders Federation.\nGreen Party wise 2012 has been a very successful year locally.

Wet and raining with flood risk in many places across the country. It has been the year of floods (and the Olympics) and government has seemed 'all at sea' on how to respond. When many homes are becoming increasingly uninsurable it failed to come to an agreement with the Association of British Insurers to address the situation. As floods affected roads and infrastructure councils, which were already cash strapped , found themselves further out of pocket . In terms of flood prevention (or at least not making things any worse than they are at the moment) the government delayed the introduction of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems on new developments, seemingly as part of their 'roll over and tickle my tummy' approach when dealing with the Home Builders Federation.\nGreen Party wise 2012 has been a very successful year locally.

Housing is a crucial issue for all of us - if we don't get well insulated housing to Passivhaus standard as an everyday standard for all our houses, nobody is going to be able to pay their heating bills, and that is from now. For that reason alone, the government should be funding councils all over the UK to make insulation schemes available. A pilot project of 6 houses will not go very far towards solving the problems of people or the planet we live on. Anonymoushttps://www.blogger.com/profile/14854356666444298565noreply@blogger.com",

COP26 still stinks |\nAt COP26 yesterday I went to the UN Environment Programme's Press Conference to watch them present the findings of their 2021 Emissions Gap report. This is where UN scientists get their chance to number crunch the pledges that countries have made to reduce their carbon emissions and see if they have any significant impact on helping achieve the Paris Climate goals. The short answer is a big NO.\nThe panel were pretty scathing. \" There's a leadership gap not an emissions gap\" was damning of the world's political leaders. One particular point they made was countries that were making Net Zero by 2050 statements with no convincing plan to achieve them. Australia being the most obvious example.\nIf (and it is a very big if) we believe all the countries statements produce the emissions then we are still heading to miss both the 1.5 and 2 degree C Paris Climate goals. The UNEP report says we need a 4 fold increase in ambition to reach 4 degrees temperature rise and a 7 fold increase to achieve 1.5 degrees. It is that stark. That is all if they keep to their promises. 7 of the G20 countries are currently 'off track' with their carbon savings so that is to say the least unhelpful.\nWhat now? We have 3 days left. Apparently Boris is coming back to the COP summit. Given a large part of this process is about keeping commitments and trust why does that not fill me with confidence?\nHere's Juice Media's from Australia's take\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1FqXTCvDLeo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2010_03_monbiot-rejects-energy-generating_html/content_511.html": "A blog by Green Party Councillor Andrew Cooper about Green Politics, action on Climate Change, Kirklees Council and our activity to improve the local and global environment (and also anything that I fancy talking about) Promoted and published by A Cooper, 76 Brockholes Lane, Holmfirth HD9 7EB\nWednesday, 3 March 2010\nMonbiot rejects 'Energy Generating Democracy'\nGeorge Monbiot in The Guardian describes Solar Photovoltaic panels as ‘comically inefficient’\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/mar/01/solar-panel-feed-in-tariff\nThis is an uncharacteristically simplistic and wrong view of the technology from him. An average 2kWp PV system will produce around 1600 kWh of electricity per year which is around a half or a third of a households annual electricity use. In the south of England this could increase to 2000kWh/year. Hardly insignificant and not a cause for amusement.\nCosts of solar panels are directly related to the current small size of the market. The aim of the feed in tariff/clean energy cashback policy is to develop a mass market for solar panels which will reduce the unit cost and therefore the cost of saving carbon. New technologies such as thin film solar PV which use a fraction the amount of silicon should also help reduce the capital cost significantly as will higher volumes.\nGeorge refers to Solar PV contributing only 0.4% to Germany’s electricity supply but this rather misses the application of the technology at the micro level. At the domestic and small scale level microgeneration technologies such as PV are not feeding into the grid but are being used within the buildings they serve and displacing the need for grid generated dirty electricity. So the impact for the householder installing may be a reduction in 30 to 50% of their electricity use. PV on this scale should be regarded as demand reduction technology as opposed to a mass generation option.\nAnother point he makes is that it is a technology option is only one that the rich will be able to take advantage of. However this is simply not the case. In Kirklees we now have hundreds of council tenants, many of who are pensioners on low incomes taking advantage of solar PV. Because the Clean Energy Cashback can be ‘assigned’ to the installer or social landlord who is installing the solar panels, the capital costs for installation could be met in their entirety by the revenue gained. The tenant/householder will still get the benefit of the electricity generated in their own home. With many people on low incomes being retired, or unable to work due to illness, their peak demand will more reflect the peak generation times of the solar panels during the day. So it is arguably a technology best applied to low/fixed income households. Having said that, with more affluent households working from home these days it is increasingly likely that people with solar panels will make use of the electricity generated on site rather than exporting it to the grid.\nWhat George Monbiot completely fails to realise is the wider potential of microgeneration to change the way people regard themselves. They are no longer simply consumers of energy they can be generators and producers of their own heat and power. While that is literally ‘empowering’ it also means that householders have more of incentive to reduce their own consumption, to be more efficient in their use of energy, because now there is a ‘balance sheet’ of incoming and outgoing energy. If they are sufficiently responsible in their energy consumption they might even come out ‘in profit’ on their fuel bills. We have needed some real tangible incentives for saving energy in the home for a long time beyond the usual exhortations. Microgeneration provides that incentive.\nWe have the possibility of an ‘energy generating democracy’ in the UK with benefits to society and the environment inmeasurably greater than the narrow ‘property owning democracy’ that drove policy in the eighties. I find it bizarre to say this to someone with such well established green credentials but George Monbiot really should see the bigger picture here!\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nHi Andy\nReplyDeleteThis is a really useful reminder that we can make every house a power station and that the future of electricity and energy production really is small scale. We must put power (generation) in the hands of the many.\nI was dismayed after reading the Monbiot article. Have you commented on it on the Guardian website? Or why not approach the Guardian for a right to reply. I think this side of the debate needs a wider public.\nSteve Barnard\nsee also Good Energy's campaign for a fair deal for renewable energy pioneers.\nReplyDeletehttp://www.goodenergy.co.uk/?page_id=6286\nI feel re-heartened by your blog having just read Monbiot and felt very dismayed. Your view deserves a Guardian 'responder' slot.\nReplyDeleteOn the subject of small scale power production, what happened to the idea of CHP - combined heat and power units that would replace the usual combi boilers and in their place a similar sized unit would produce hot water, central heating and electricity. They were successfully developed over 10 years ago but I've never heard of one being installed...have you??\nThese was a bit of false start with micro CHP units a few years ago and a commercial unit never quite got off the ground. There is however the new Baxi Ecogen Unit which shows a lot of promise and seems to be being brought to the market having gone through some rigorous field trials. I've been to the factory where they are being produced and they are scaling up for a mass market product. Currently it retails at around £5000 but I would expect that to come down significantly over the next 18 moonths or so. It will also qualify for the Clean Energy Cashback.\nReplyDeleteTry to get this on CiF as a free-standing article, Andy!\nReplyDeleteI'm just reading \"Heat\" by Monbiot and he\nReplyDeletementions all these things: CHP, the energy internet and he shows the same views about solar in the UK. Having just read his article, he's saying the same things.\nHe may be right about the relatively low return on investments (i.e. actual cost per kWh) and he's certainly right that investing in insulation will make a bigger difference, but you're already doing that!\nEven in the cloudy north of the UK, over the long term, the panels will save more CO2 than is used in their production and are worth installing. Also, increased sales should reduce costs and improve efficiency: over around ten years while installation of PV solar panels was subsidised in Japan, the price of the panels halved. After they stopped the subsidies, prices leveled. Now they have reintroduced subsidies.\nThe main point, as you say, seems to be the energy generating democracy and the effect on energy awareness.\nDavid Mackay, (according to www.withouthotair.com) found the biggest impact on reducing his energy bill was recording how much energy he was using!",

Are politicians supposed to admit they enjoy things? Well one of the things that I particularly like doing is getting to understand political institutions and seeing how they work and using them to get some positive change. So I understand that is not everybody's cup of tea but it is mine.\nIt was 4 years ago when I was offered a place on the EU Committee of the Regions by Councillor Marianne Overton, Leader of the Independent Group on the Local Government Association I was part of the 24 strong UK delegation giving a voice from the local level into EU policy making. As a representative of the European Alliance group I have participated in 4 United Nations COP Climate Talks, lead on 2 policy documents (opinions) and seen best practice on mainly environmental initiatives across the EU. By it's very existence it demonstrates the lie that we have no influence over EU policy.\nIt has been a part of my working life for the last 4 years and I've reported on my activity fairly regularly on my Blog. The last few years, for have been blighted by the Brexit vote in 2016 for me. Just as UK MEPs have continued to go to the European Parliament I have continued to go to the Committee of the Regions and provide my views from a Green and UK perspective on EU policy.\nToday I made my last contribution. We heard from Jacob Werksman, Principal Adviser for International Aspects of EU Climate Policy, European Commission, who is the EU's chief climate negotiator to the UNFCCC COP25. He explained how he was working on something called the 'Climate Pact' a process by which National Governments would make agreements with local authorities on how they could work together on climate action. My suggestion was that the EU Committee of the Regions, as the body representing Local and Regional Authorities, should be involved in the design of the Climate Pacts. This seemed to go down well and I'm hopeful that we will get a better document as a result. Depending on the outcome of the UK General Election, UK Councils may or may not be involved in climate pacts with National Governments to address the climate emergency we face.\nSo farewell talented employees of the EU Committee of the Regions who guided us through EU policy and helped me achieve some of my policy ambitions, farewell colleagues and now friends who I worked with and some who I'll continue to work with.\nIs it the end? Who knows what the next few weeks will bring.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

The M Card is the West Yorkshire version of London's Oyster Card and I thought it would be ideal to solve some travel problems I have.\nThe train journey from Brockholes to Huddersfield on our' heritage' Northern Rail trains is great but sometimes the ticket machines are either not working or the collector doesn't get round to you. This means queuing at Huddersfield station to get a ticket which sometimes takes longer than the journey itself. Then when you get the tickets they are just stupidly long and unwieldy. The ticket collectors hate them so do the passengers. Progress apparently.\nSo for all these reasons I thought the M Card was the solution to my problems because 'it's like a London Oyster Card' . So I've just been over to Huddersfield Bus Station to get one. The woman was very helpful and asked me if I wanted a weekly or monthly M Card. I told her I didn't travel by public transport everyday as sometimes I walk in to Huddersfield or use the car when I need it and occasionally need a ticket to be able to claim back work expenses. So the M Card unfortunately is not geared up for that like an Oyster Card is. In an average week I might use the train for two return journeys and 2 single journeys and use the car one day. If I had a weekly or monthly M Card I would end up more out of pocket than in. If I travelled by bus I would be able to one the pay as you go M Card but train travel (when it works) is cheaper and more convenient.\n| Daft new long tickets next to old usual ones |\nI'm definitely glad M Card exists and this is a real positive but I hope it can be the equivalent of the Oyster in the not too distant future.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

A simple choice. |\nWhen I asked the Kirklees Cabinet Member Councillor Naheed Mather a question about how Kirklees might address the issue of single use plastic at a recent Council meeting she talked vaguely about the possibility of influencing the use of single use plastics by Take Aways using licensing conditions. If this is possible it would be welcome but when Kirklees hasn't got its own house in order it is very difficult to ask anyone else to.improve their green credentials. The Council needs to 'walk the walk' on cutting back on plastic waste and needs to start providing tap water for events. So far all we have had is talk and no action at all.\nSo what would an alternative to the refreshment arrangements at Kirklees meetings look like? We could have polycarbonate plastic cups which are reusable and aren't a danger if dropped like glass. Reusable mugs and metal teaspoons could be used. Using milk from milk bottles which are still being used would be a positive move. Tap water could be provided in jugs or in reusable bottles like many organisations already do.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2017_09_locally-determined-contributions-new_html/content_13.html": "A briefing note on Locally Determined Contributuion by Councillor Andrew\nCooper – Green Party Councillor on Kirklees Council , Member of the UK\nDelegation to the EU Committee of the Regions and Green Party of England Wales\nEnergy Spokesperson.\nThere is an\nopportunity at the COP23 Climate Talks in November to bring action on climate\nchange closer to Local and Regional Governments around the world and closer to\nthe communities that they serve.\nAt COP21 in\nParis 2 years ago National Governments expressed their efforts to achieve\ncarbon emission reduction targets as ‘Nationally Determined Contributions’ -\nNDCs. In the case of the UK our NDC made no reference to the work being\nundertaken by Local Authorities to reduce emissions. Efforts at the local level\nto improve building standards beyond building regulation, install LED street\nlights, plant trees to sequester carbon etc were simply not measured or taken\ninto account in those national contributions.\nAt the\nInternational level it is acknowledged that there is a shortfall between the\nagreed NDCs and the savings required to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\ndegrees C. This reality requires fresh ideas to address this gap.\nThe growing momentum for Locally\nDetermined Contributions to address Climate Change\nThere is a\ngrowing momentum behind the concept of Locally Determined Contributions where\nLocal and Regional Government can set out their own plans to reduce carbon\nemissions. The idea was originally conceived by Cllr Andrew Cooper from the UK\nin his role as a member of the UK Delegation to the EU Committee of the\nRegions. There is a strong reference in the Opinion he is Rapporteur for on the\nEU’s Environmental Implementation Review. Another Opinion on Climate Finance by\nItalian member Marco Dus also makes reference to LDC’s. Both these Opinions\nwill be going forward for approval at the EU Committee of the Regions Session\non the 10th and 11th of October. In addition LDC’s are\nnow included in a European Parliament Opinion being led by the Rapporteur French\nMEP Gilles Pargeneaux on ‘The Role of Regions and Cities in the implementation\nof the Climate Change Agreement’. His Opinion calls for,\n\"the\ncreation of a system of Locally Determined Contributions to be implemented in direct\nand complementary to Nationally Determined Contributions\"\nValuing action on Climate Change at\nthe local level\nEstablishing\na system of Locally Determined Contributions, to complement those that are\ndetermined by National Governments, could spur action at a local level. We are\noften asked to ‘Think Global and Act Local’ and by mirroring the terminology of\n‘Nationally Determined Contributions’ this helps stress the importance of\naction at the local level.\nIt is said\nof many things that if something isn’t measured it isn’t valued. An\nInternational system of Locally Determined Contributions would provide a\nplatform for the valuable and vital action by Local and Regional actors to\nreduce carbon emissions and thereby be a spur to greater action to reduce carbon\nemissions.\nFostering International Cooperation\non Climate Change at the local level\nLocally\nDetermined Contributions could help foster international cooperation between\nLocal and Regional Authorities whereby best practice could be shared and peer\nsupport provided to those areas needing assistance where it may not be available\nwithin their country or from their National Government.\nEnsuring the additionality of local\naction on Climate Change is recognised\nEnsuring\nadditionality should be a key feature of Locally Determined Contributions. Some\ncountries are good at linking their NDCs with local action others are not. Being\nclear about which LDCs are additional and which are contributing to NDCs is\nimportant. Both should be measured to ensure local action is valued but it is\nimportant to be clear about what is additional, and what is not.\nExisting\nmechanisms such as the Global Covenant of Mayors should be recognised as approved\nmethods of demonstrating compliance as a Locally Determined Contribution. Robust\nexisting methods of demonstrating carbon reductions should not have to go\nthrough additional hoops.\nProviding a valid platform for local\nand State Government involvement in climate action in the USA\nWith the\nannouncement by the current US President of their intention to pull out of the\nParis Climate Agreement this puts greater emphasis on action in the US at the\nlevel of individual State and lower levels of Governments. The US Conference of\nMayors has indicated its intention to honour the COP21 Paris Agreement and\nLDC’s can provide a new structure that enables this involvement on action at\nthe state level.\nAccessibility for both large and\nsmall municipalities\nLocal and\nRegional Government can range from areas representing millions of people to just\na few hundred. It is important that Locally Determined Contributions enable\nparticipation from Local and Regional Governments from the very small to the\nthose Regional bodies that are larger than some nation states\nBringing COP and Climate Change action\ncloser to local people and communities\nThe\nintroduction of LDCs/RDCs at the lowest tier of Government will give a new\nopportunity for engagement with communities and non-governmental organisations.\nThe strong links Local and Regional Authorities have with Community Leaders and\nkey local agencies makes them ideally placed to drive local action on climate\nchange. Establishing Local Partnerships to deliver LDCs and RDCs could provide\na new impetus and focus for climate mitigation actions on the ground. LDC’s\ncould provide the same basis for global community involvement at a local level\nthat Local Agenda 21 provided.\nLocally Determined Contributions and\nBrexit\nThe UK has\nstated that it will honour its current Nationally Determined Contributions\nwhich were part of the EU negotiated total. Though LDCs/RDCs have come out of\nEU Institutions if they are agreed at COP23 they will become part of an\nInternational Agreement and the UK will still be able to engage with them\nwhen/if Brexit finally comes into effect.\nContact\nCouncillor\nAndrew Cooper\nMoble - +\n44 (0) 7721 348619\nTwitter\n@clrandrewcooper\nEvery little helps to coin a phrase - why so few comments here?\nReplyDelete",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2012_05_silent-running-twitter-and-local_html/content_920.html": "You may think social media and elections were made for each other and conventional wisdom is that it is. We hear about Facebook campaigns which helped propel Obama to the Whitehouse and you’d be forgiven for thinking Kirklees politicians, myself included have learnt very little from this but as with many things there’s a lot more to it than that.\nAs local election campaigns were beginning to take off in Kirklees I noticed the Labour Candidate for Newsome had set up a Twitter account. I was naturally going to follow her. She had a few initial followers already including prominent Labour Cllrs. Very soon I discovered I’d been blocked as a follower and after a few initial tweets from her all went very quiet. Twitter is a good way of letting everybody know what you are doing and thinking and during an election campaign. If you are targeting a seat you don’t particularly want your opponent to know what you’re up to and what streets you’ve been on . Fortunately for me the oldest form of social media ‘the community jungle drums' pretty much kept me abreast of what’s was going on, who was on the streets, where they were and what they were saying on the doorstep – ‘Street Twitter’. ‘ Electronic Twitter’ went into ‘silent running’ mode like submarines keeping a strict silence lest they be discovered by the enemy above.\nMy own twitter traffic during the election lost a bit of spontaneity. Things I wanted to say about the election would have been unwise to say. I started making ‘Non Election News’ Tweets such as “I extracted 2 pints of worm wee from my wormery this morning. Useful as a liquid fertiliser. Back out on the stomp!” I was definitely ‘extracting the urine’ with that tweet! Another tweet was “my sweetcorn, leek and tomato seedlings are coming through. Rain makes canvassing tough but the patch gets watered!” Now I know twitter is supposed to express your trivial musings in less than 140 characters but didn’t I realise there was an election on?! I certainly did but even saying where I’d canvassed and what response I’d received could be giving information to an opponent who didn’t have my best interests at heart in the slightest. I thought the best thing I could do was let them know how my allotment was progressing!\nI did break this rule on one occasion. When I was reliably informed by locals that a prominent Conservative Cllr had been spotted canvassing in Newsome I wanted the world to know that I knew what was going on and that she’d been spotted. She then had the option of carrying on canvassing in Newsome and be accused of abandoning her own backyard or go back campaigning in her own patch. By my reckoning and given her particular style of canvassing I couldn’t lose either way but the quandary over what to do was not mine, it was hers and I’d got more than enough to deal with at the time.\nHere’s a couple of songs by Joan Baez 'Rejoice in the Sun' and 'Silent Running' from Silent Running starring Bruce Dern in the 70’s Sci Fi masterpiece and ecological thinkpiece. In order to protect the last earth trees Bruce's character takes his forest carrying spaceship 'offline' and goes 'silent running'. It doesn't get much more 'hippy sci-fi' than this!\nWould the Greens here raise allotment fees by 67% to £110 per year as they have in Brighton?\nReplyDeleteAbsolutely unfuckingbelievable\nI thought £110 sounded a lot for an allotment. I checked the Brighton Argus and they say a Brighton Allotment following the increases will cost £55 so I guess you have 2 plots. I don't know the detailed factors behind this particular decision but ultimtely huge cuts in central government funding are what is driving this and other hikes in allotment and other fees around the country.\nReplyDeleteNo.\nReplyDeleteI pay £30 per year and that's steep. It's been that for five years. And it aint going up. £110 for god's sake? It's okay if you're a well-to-do Green voter who's seen Fearnley-Whittingstall's programme and fancies growing asparagus for a year, and then getting bored with all the work an allotment requires. Growing your own food is as green as it gets, hell you could make a case for it being subsidised due to health benefits and people spending their saved money into the greater economy.\nPrecisely NOT what a green council should be doing.\nI'm totally confused now. Do you live in Brighton or Kirklees or somewhere else? Brighton fees aren't £110 they're £55. If you pay £30 then I think that's about the Kirklees rate which I pay for my allotment.\nReplyDelete",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2018_06/content_205.html": "·\nThank you Chair ,\nMembers\nof the ENVI committee, Let me first thank you for giving me the opportunity to\npresent the Committee of the Regions opinion.\nWe\nwelcome the ENVI draft motion for resolution on COP 24 as well as the adopted report\non the role of EU regions and cities in implementing the Paris Agreement as\nthey highlight the key role of local and regional authorities in the fight\nagainst climate change\n·\nLocal and regional authorities are responsible\nfor the implementation of 70% of climate change reduction measures and up to\n90% of climate change adaptation measures. When national governments struggle\nto deliver, cities and regions take the lead.\n· Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement, we\nhave seen a rising status for local and regional governments. This was evident\nlast year in Bonn with the launch of the Talanoa Dialogue and the Bonn Fiji\ncommitment of Local and Regional leaders' from around the world. It's\nnow time this form of multilevel governance is acknowledged and the role of LRAs\nformalised in global climate governance.\n· Nationally Determined Contributions fall short\nin reaching Paris Agreement goals, of limiting global temperature increases to\nwell below 2 degrees, let alone 1,5 degrees. In\norder to bridge the emissions gap, we need a system of locally and regionally\ndetermined contributions (LDCs) that would complement \"Nationally\nDetermined Contributions.\n·\nA wealth of action to mitigate climate change\nhappens at the local level and we know that action that is not measured is not\nacknowledged nor encouraged or valued. Yet, these local actions can be the most\nimportant actions of all. Making the difference between success and failure. That's\nwhy we call for the transparency framework to include, in national inventory reports\na dedicated section on mitigation actions undertaken at subnational levels of\ngovernment as a way to help track the progress towards achieving NDCs.\n· The Talanoa dialogue is of great importance for\nlocal and regional authorities as it allows them to make their ambitions,\npositions and intentions heard. It is also of vital importance to the UNFCCC\nand national Governments as the feedback we provide from the coalface of action\non climate change will help them shape future policy initiatives. A dialogue\nis not a monologue. We need genuine 2 way communications. Yes we need to be\nheard but we also need to be responded to as well. We\nneed to integrate the outcomes of the Talanoa Dialogue into the COP negotiating\ntext. And it must also continue beyond COP24.\nMembers,\nCooperation\nand inclusivity are part of the solution to address climate challenges. It is\nessential that the EU and its Member States engage directly with democratically\nelected regions and other non-party stakeholders, civil society and the private\nsector. And it\nis crucial that we speak with a strong single voice at COP24. As elected members at the closest level to the\ncitizens we are ready to partner with you and contribute to make the world a\nbetter place.\nAs a UK member of the Committee of the Regions\nI am clear that Brexit or (I still hope) no Brexit we should continue to work\ntogether to achieve the carbon reductions we need and to be frank this may help\nthe UK Government to not slip further behind in our actions. If the UK is in a\nLeague of its own it will have no meaningful way of comparing its progress. Together\nwith you we have a much better chance.\nThank\nyou for your attention",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2010_11_supermarket-sweep_html/content_713.html": "| Dale Winton of Supermarket Sweep fame. |\nWe need to understand how 'the Golden Rule' will work, which says that any savings made will greater than the cost for paying back the measures. With so many different house types, with different usage patterns, different heating requirements this is going to be a tall order and if the golden rule isn't convincing for all householders whatever their circumstances then confidence in the Green Deal will be severely shaken. The other good news is that Private Landlords could be fined if they don't improve the energy efficiency of their dwellings, with Local Councils being able to penalise them up to £5000 for non compliance.\nThis is all good stuff and credit where its due. I don't however believe that Greg's yet given up on his supermarkets as a major deliverer. Lets hope its not a clean (supermarket) sweep when it comes to who actually does the Green Deal and Local Authorities that demonstrate the capability to deliver also get the opportunity.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2011_12_councillor-andrew-cooper-annual-report_html/content_257.html": "Councillor Andrew Cooper –Annual Report 2011\nThis has been my twelfth year as one of your local Councillors and almost certainly one of the busiest I can remember. Much of the beginning of 2011 was dedicated to the Kirklees Council budget as we grappled with the £80 million of cuts imposed on Kirklees by the Coalition Government. I spent hours in budget meetings going over proposals to come up with a solution which did not result in huge cuts to adult social care. In the end I and my Green Party colleagues were not prepared to vote for the Kirklees budget as a matter of conscience and principle. We could not vote for a budget which saw care for older people reduced from £52 million to around £40 million over the next 4 years and Day Care Services to drop from £5.3 million to £1.5 million and all this at a time when the demand for these services is likely to rise. All this is happening at a time when the banks are seemingly unscathed, benefits are being cut and services are disappearing all around us.\nPlanning was also a major item for me in this Council year. I was the only Councillor, not on the Planning Committee to speak against the proposed Tesco development to be built on the site of the current Sports Centre. Bizarrely many of the Councillors on the Planning Committee had huge reservations but ended up voting for it. Could it have been anything to do with the ‘bung’ Kirklees were getting from Tesco to build a new Sports Centre at Springwood? Also last month I attended and spoke at the Public Enquiry into the Tesco Planning Decision along with Barry Sheerman MP who spoke in favour of the Planning Decision being overturned.\nAnother key big issue this year was changes to planning policy both at the national and local level. The Coalition Government has introduced a new National Planning Policy Framework which in a nutshell makes it easier for developers to build on greenfield sites. I have spoke out regarding this issue at a number of meetings including a well attended one at Hall Bower Chapel. I have also used links with the Local Government Association to get some direct input into the Conservative Minister responsible Eric Pickles MP. As things stand I don’t anticipate much change. At the Kirklees level we have the Local Development Framework which will contain the policies which guide where housing will and will not be developed working with Julie and Graham we are continuing to press hard on the Labour led Council not to allocate greenfield land for development we have particularly mentioned land adjacent to New Laithe Hill and Jackroyd Lane on a number of occasions. We’ll keep people updated with developments.\nI was particularly pleased this year to welcome Green Party leader Caroline Lucas MP to Huddersfield. She spoke at a meeting in February in the Hudawi Centre about her work as an MP and the impact of government cuts.\nThe Newsome Ward continues to be a national beacon for renewable energy and I was able to help Newsome South Methodist Church with sourcing funding to get solar panels installed on their roof. The Church did a lot of fund raising itself and the panels will help them save electricity costs and provide funds to keep this well used community building going.\nWhen I first started knocking on doors in Newsome in 1993 I took up the issue of traffic calming on Hangingstone Road Berry Brow. This year we finally got the funding sorted out. I asked the Highways Engineer leading the project how old he was in 1993 and he told me he was just 5! In the end the real success of this was local people getting together to put their case strongly to Kirklees with me as local councillor providing help and guidance.\nI continue to be a strong supporter of the Growing Newsome project and I share an allotment in Primrose Hill where I’ve grown food now for the last couple of years. I‘m especially pleased that the Stirley Farm project is up and running to support local food initiatives and it now has its own cattle in addition to its vegetable and fruit growing activities. It is important that the green land around the area is worked and useful to protect it from those would see it as ripe development land but it is also a great project in its own right and lots of local people are getting involved.\nOne issue which has affected a great number of people in the Ward has been Labour’s proposed £30 charge for permit parking. Many people in Aspley, Highfields and Springwood are on low or fixed incomes and even though many don’t have, or can’t afford, a car they are able to offer visitors, carers and relatives a car parking space. This proposed charge is effectively a £30 increase on the Council Tax for people who are generally on lower incomes. I have been very vocal on this issue in Council and have asked for an equalities impact assessment to be carried out on this decision.\nI was originally a sceptic but now have a ‘blog’ www.greeningkirklees.blogspot.com which is basically an online diary of my views and opinions on things affecting the Newsome Ward and Kirklees in general. Again I was sceptical about Twitter but now I am an avid user of it. If you want to ‘follow’ me I’m at @clrandrewcooper\nMy New Year will begin as it did last year driving Newsome’s New Years Day Bus Service. This is now in it’s 19th year and thanks to everyone who helps with and uses this service.\nI wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.\nAndrew Cooper\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Then the Labour campaign was misleading, unpleasant and went down badly with electors. The new Labour candidate decided to focus his whole campaign on saving Huddersfield Royal Infirmary and made no mention was made of other more local issues at all. A lot of the Labour literature was unintelligible to anyone other than a committed Health Campaigner and even then it vastly overstated the influence a Council has over NHS decisions. The headline on their leaflet said \"Hands of HRI\" I think they meant \"Hands Off HRI\"\nWe again had the intervention in the election from the local developer who dug up the Newsome Bowling Green and said he was supporting Labour this year because he had been \"victimised\" by Green Councillors and me in particular. Lots I could say about this but think I'll give it a miss on this occasion.\nThe day before the election a large number of Green Party posterboards were removed from lamp posts overnight and taken away by persons unknown. Though Labour boards were left untouched I'm confident the Labour Party didn't remove them.\nDuring our campaign we focused on issues of concern to local people and promoted our strong record of action in the community. Sue won BIG with our largest majority for 19 years with 2455 votes.\nWe never assume in elections that we will win and always contest them vigorously and were really pleased with the enthusiastic support and encouragement we received from local people.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2016_06_andrew-cooper-another-europe-is_html/content_972.html": "I’m Andrew Cooper. I’ve been a\nGreen Party Councillor in Kirklees, in West Yorkshire for the last 17 years..\nOne of my more recent roles is as a member of the EU Committee of the Regions.\nThis little known body informs the EU about the impact of its policies at a\nlocal level. I was appointed to the politically balanced 24 member UK\ndelegation last year as the nominee of the Independent Group of Cllrs on the Local\nGovernment Association. As such I represent Independent, Green and UKIP Cllrs. I\nguess that makes me Nigel Farage’s Spokesperson in Europe on Local Government.\nFortunately I don’t think he knows this.\nThe Referendum Campaign has been\neventful. The bit I found most amusing was when the Vote Leave Campaign Bus\nvisited Harrogate and parked illegally. They were duly ticketed by the local\nCouncil. Vote Leave rejected the ticket saying that as they were part of the\nReferendum Campaign and therefore were exempt. Now my brother is the\nConservative Leader of Harrogate Borough Council and he tweeted the following “Let's see if they pay like everyone else has\nto. It's day one and counting #votepayup”- so the Brexitters don’t just\nhave a problem with EU Laws but seemingly some UK ones as well!\nIn the last European Parliament\nElections the Green Party took a 3 yeses approach to the EU.\nYes to Reform\nYes to Remaining\nYes to a Referendum\nYes Yes Yes! The last time I heard\n3 yeses in the same sentence was in the film ‘When Harry met Sally’ Somehow our 3 yeses never reached the same\nlevel of enthusiasm.\nYes to Reform because we know that the\nEU is by no means a perfect institution, the undue influence of big business\nover decision making, there’s TTIP that puts the interests of big business\nbefore democracy, there was the heavy\nhanded authoritarian austerity driven approach that was taken by the EU with\nthe Greek Government. These are just 3\nexamples that we could spend an entire conference talking about.\nBut if an institution needs\nreforming I’d start with one where a Government can get elected by 24% of the\nelectorate yet wield 100% of the power. I’d start with one where an unelected\nHouse of Lords wields power with the support of religious clerics – just like\nthey do in Iran. I’d start with the UK Government. At least in the EU MEPs are\nelected by a form of Proportional Representation, those who aren’t elected in\nthe European Commission need the support of the democratically elected European\nParliament to be appointed. So\npersonally (and this isn’t Green Party policy) I’d like a referendum on whether\nYorkshire should remain part of the UK or in fact become part of Scotland\nbecause I don’t know about you but I feel more affinity with Scotland than with\na Government led by Etonian Toffs.\nYes to Remaining\nBecause fundamentally I believe\nthat people forget that the binding together of our nations is more than simply\nan economic union but one that demonstrates the old Churchillian truism that “Jaw Jaw is better than War War”.\nIf we break those bonds of cooperation and friendship where that unravelling\nwill end doesn’t bear thinking about.\nYes to remaining because we live in\na globalised world with the impacts of big issues such as climate change, tax\navoidance and crime not stopping at political boundaries. They require action\nby nations across borders.\nRenewable Energy is a classic\nexample. The UK has an EU target of achieving 13% of our total energy from\nRenewable Sources by 2020. Other nations are already exceeding their much\nhigher targets, while we in the UK slip behind. This is due to a lack of UK\nGovt support for renewable energy. In the EU only Malta and Luxembourg are\nproducing less of their energy from Renewable sources than the UK. The point of\nthe EU target is that it makes the UK accountable, it compares us with others,\nand unfortunately it shames us and if there’s one thing this lousy Government\nneeds it is shaming.\nWhen the Paris agreement on Climate\nChange was signed the agreed EU Carbon reduction targets came as an\namalgamation of different countries contributions. I regarded this as a huge\npositive but the negative fly in the ointment was again our own Government NOT\nthe EU. At no point did they ask for the input of local Councils or Devolved\nAdministrations on how to reach this target, nor for our assistance or ideas on\nhow targets might be achieved. It’s almost as though we were irrelevant. UK\nGovernment was behaving remotely as if we didn’t exist in pretty much the same\nway that the Brexiteers regard the European Union treating the UK and its\ninterests.\nIf another Europe is to be possible I would\nwant it to be one where achieving EU targets is more strongly linked to action\non the ground. So where the EU has a target for improving energy efficiency I want\nthat to relate directly to warmer, healthier homes and working together to end\nthe misery of fuel poverty. This would be an example of a Europe that is\nrelevant to be peoples everyday lives. A Europe that has a common sense of\npurpose for Social and Environmental Good. This is why I believe a better\nEurope is not only possible but would be hugely popular.\nWe also said ‘Yes to A Referendum’\nand that is the big uncertainty. There are those who say we shouldn’t have done\nit. Why are our nations being used to try to solve an internal dispute in the\nConservative Party? Thats not going to work!\nOf\ncourse there are risks. With the EU Referendum we do not\nknow the outcome, peoples votes may be influenced by negative feelings or\ncherry picked facts but we will have our shot at getting our message across\nwith a positive vision of a sustainable and progressive Europe. In my\nexperience what wins votes is passion, belief and shoe leather. So between now\nand June 23rd let us use all these to get the result we need.\nIt is possible. Another Europe is\npossible!\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

We have two grown up children and one new grandson. I have been\nChairman of the local NFU Branch and served on the NFU County Executive\nincluding through the Foot and Mouth crisis. I am passionate about promoting\nlocally produced food and have managed projects to promote it across the\nregion. I have served on Kirkburton Parish Council for Farnley Tyas,\nThurstonland and Stocksmoor Ward since 2007, have been re-elected twice. I was\nelected as Parish Chairman for the 2010/11 Municipal year.\nHow long have you\nlived in the area?\nI have lived and worked in Farnley Tyas all my life, and was,\nuntil my retirement from farming, a third generation farmer in the village. My\ngrandfather first moved into the village to become landlord of the “Golden Cock”\npublic house, moving away, to return in the 1930’s to take on Beech Farm. My\nfather succeeded him and took on the tenancy until his death in 1981. I then\ntook on the farm at 32 years of age and ran a successful dairy and mixed farm\nuntil 2003.\nWhy the Green Party?\nI’ve always worked close to nature being a farmer and I have\nwatched the seasons and weather patterns change. I feel that the Green Party\nstarts from a different place and isn’t left, right or even centre. There are\npeople who wrongly see the Green Party as ‘sandal\nwearers’ or politicians who would take us to living back in caves. I\ncertainly don’t fit that stereotype! I’ve seen that Greens can work\nsuccessfully alongside business and innovators on practical and worthwhile\nventures that make the world a better place.\nHow did you feel when you were\nfirst elected as a Councillor in 2011?\nBemused! I’d worked alongside local Councils and been a\nParish Cllr for 5 years but it was a big step up and a steep learning curve at\nfirst on Kirklees. However I quickly got up to speed with how you make things\nwork on Kirklees and what is and what is not possible. I’m not afraid of hard\nwork and I enjoy a challenge so it has been and continues to be, a rewarding\nand enjoyable journey.\nWhat is your proudest acheivement in your time as a Kirklees Councillor?\nGetting the trust of local residents across a wide range of political\npersuasions and widely differing backgrounds. I know a lot of my personal\nsupport doesn’t come from people who traditionally vote Green but people who\nknow I will try my best and give a straight answer to a straight question.\nKirklees , like many\nCouncils, is in a difficult financial position what can you do to help?\nHaving been self-employed\nfor almost all my working life I know the value of a Pound and I am acutely\naware of the need to get best value whilst protecting essential services. I can\nwork constructively with Councillors from all political parties and council officers\nto try and limit the damage resulting from cuts and communicate these changes\nto residents in a politically unbiased way.\nWhat do you think\npeople want from the person they elect as their local Councillor?\nFirst and foremost people want their local Councillor to be\nhonest and approachable. They want someone who has an ability to get things\ndone but to be realistic about what can be achieved. People don’t want\npoliticians to make false promises and not to play party political games that\ninsult peoples intelligence.\nWhat difference does\na Green Party Councillor make?\nI don’t feel I am constrained by a national political agenda,\nnor am I asked to tow the party line. We have a small, but influential, group\nof Councillors who are committed to working locally to protect local services in\na time of government cuts. We try to think ‘outside the box’ and to innovatively\nsolve problems. The easy thing to do is just to oppose all cuts and not offer\nany real solutions but Greens are prepared to work across all political groups\nand engage with whoever is running the Council at the time. If you don’t take\nthis approach you can find yourself in a powerless position and just shouting\nfrom the sidelines.\nWhen you aren’t\nworking in the community or attending Council meetings how do you relax.\nI’ve still got my tractors and some equipment and it’s a\nreal pleasure to get out ploughing and driving for one of my fellow farmers\nduring the Summer months. I’ve always read a lot and in any spare time and\nlately taken to political autobiographies of ‘all political flavours’. I walk\nfor exercise and Maureen and I have a list of local Ward walks so we regularly\nwalk the villages in the Ward",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2015_09_right-to-buy-wrong-to-sell_html/content_1378.html": "One of the principal problems is the Government commitment that houses lost through the Right to Buy will be replaced with an 'affordable' home. So for a start an 'affordable' home is not a council house. It could be a house provided by a Housing Association where the rents are usually higher than Council properties or it could be a starter home or a house which is just a little cheaper to buy than the average price in that area. So it may be an 'affordable' home for a few but certainly not for everyone and definitely not for people on the lowest of incomes. What we need if housing is to be replaced is at the very least a'like for like' replacement. A council house for a council house.\nMy view would be that the huge discounts given to householders to purchase what was a public asset is a loss to us all. Council housing is a common good. It offers an alternative to ownership. It provides a wider choice of tenure and as such, if properly supported and expanded, could offer a restraining force on ever rising house prices. One of the real problems of Right to Buy is the sale of properties ending up as private rented properties at extortionate rents. On Elm Manor Estate in Newsome there are ex Council houses that are now student rented accommodation. Students need homes like everyone else but for private landlords to make a killing largely at the public expense is just plain wrong.\nUltimately government need to recognise that having a mixed tenure of housing, with a strong and growing social rented sector is a good thing and that ownership of property is not always positive or desirable. I guess that makes me a dangerous communist and a threat to national security. I'll go and hand myself into the nearest police station immediately.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Ancient woodland, by definition, has been in existence since at least\n1600. New planting could not replicate the rich biodiversity which has grown up\nover centuries in places such as Smithy Wood, Sheffield, Bowden Housteads at Handsworth, nor the sites threatened\nby HS2, Water Haigh Woodland Park near Leeds and Woodhouse Washlands, near\nSheffield.\nAndrew Cooper, lead candidate for\nthe Green Party in Yorkshire and the Humber at this year's Euro elections said:\n\"The Government obsession\nwith HS2 and with woodland selloffs cannot be permitted to destroy nature's\nsurviving crown jewels.

The Conservatives had kicked this project back when they were in power but I took up the case with the new Labour administration and who knows I may have helped get them back on track. One additional benefit is that it is in the Newsome Ward helping us keep our status as the UK's biggest user of microgeneration technologies. We also find out next week (I hope) what will be going on with the government's Clean Energy Cashback so hopefully they will get a good return for the solar electricity they generate and use within the building.\nGood News on the Biomass front and bad news on hydro side. 7 Kirklees Council owned buildings either have wood chip or wood pellet boilers installed or they have it planned in the next couple of years. In the Newsome Ward there is the Blagden Farm sheltered housing complex on Edale Avenue which once installed will save 45 tonnes of carbon each year. I wonder if they've made use of CERT funding from utilities on his one? Could save the Council a few pennies. The disappointments are Huddersfield Town Hall which apparently doesn't have the storage capacity for the wood pellets and the Deighton Centre who's uncertain long term future has delayed the investment. But the hydro plant proposed for Aspley has been cancelled due to additional costs that British Waterways would have imposed for use of the weir. The Renewable Energy Fund that was allocated to this project has been diverted to support the Hillhouse Low Carbon Communities project.\nA tale of two housing developments is also on the agenda. 36 Council homes in Batley will be built to Code for Sustainable Homes Level 4 which will have to incorporate some form of renewable energy to acheive that standard. In Newsome Ward on the Poplar/Gelder Estate site 35 homes will be built by Yorkshire Housing on former Council land but this will only be built to Code for Sustainable Homes level 3. I did question this and suggested that the new Clean Energy Cashback could make the installation of solar panels which would raise the standard to 4 possible but that appears to be ignored.\nOther good stuff on the agenda include voltage optimisation and the councils preparation for the Carbon Reduction Commitment.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

There is no funding from West Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority nor Kirklees for this part of the scheme and there is no plan to take it forward. So \"shelved\" or even \"cancelled\" seems much more accurate a description.\nIt has been a long campaign to save these trees along what is regarded as an iconic and beautiful tree lined route through Edgerton into Huddersfield. I am full of admiration for the determination of the campaigners. They lobbied Councillors in the rain outside Huddersfield Town Hall, put questions to the Labour Cabinet members in Full Council meetings and staged \"Banners at the Junction\" protests on numerous Saturday mornings. At times it seemed that success was unlikely but now it is clear that they have succeeded.\nThe success is not an admission of error by either WYCMA or Kirklees. The reason given is funding constraints and overprogramming. Basically, due to inflation and other factors they haven't got the budget they need to do everything they want to do. The campaigners' victory is down to them making so clear that this is such an unpopular scheme that it was top of the list to be cut. So unfortunately, no revelatory moment from the Labour Cabinet or the West Yorkshire Mayor.\nThe arguments against the widening and tree felling were very clear. The carbon emissions calculations were dubious, the impact on heritage ignored as was the effect on local biodiversity. These arguments were amplified by the Council's own Tree Officer, the Kirklees Climate Commission and the Woodland Trust. Their arguments against were never properly addressed by the Labour Cabinet member. Instead of addressing their arguments he decided to accuse me of making up my own facts when all I was doing was repeating their facts. Got to say I wasn't impressed.\nSo, what next? People's lives have been affected. Some homes and parts of gardens would have been lost along the route. Saying the scheme is \"paused\" does not give them the closure they need. Kirklees owes it to the householders who have been disrupted for the last few years to have the certainty they need to get on with their lives.\nAs a reminder of the reasons that we needed to save these trees here's the campaign video\nUnfortunately they have also “paused” the cycling, walking and public transport improvements in phase 4 of the A629 scheme as well.\nReplyDeleteGiven phase 1-3 of the road building part of the scheme have already or are about to go ahead at least some of phase 4 should still happen.\nGetting people to use active travel for short journeys and making the buses more attractive for longer ones would completely undermine the arguments for bringing back the phase 5 road widening in the future by reducing congestion without increasing the number of cars journeys.",

These often split into two categories. The reasons they give and then there are the real reasons . So what reasons can the Conservatives give for failing to produce on of the expectations of a functioning political group on the Council. The last time they didn't produce an amendment they said it was because the Labour budget was \"unamendable\". They went on to say that if the Labour Party had taken account of their previous amendments then it would have been amendable but as they hadn't it isn't. This is clearly nonsense. Other groups can find funding for priorities, projects and schemes as the Green Party Group and the Liberal Democrats have but the Conservatives are not presenting the Council with any priorities, projects or schemes.\nThe real reason I believe they aren't submitting an amendment is because it would mean having to admit that their own Government has given them very little room to manouvre from a Conservative perspective. To attempt to maintain maintain services requires that you raise Council Tax to the maximum limit that their own Government will allow given the reduction in funding the Council receives from central Government. Their Government. There is no dodgy Council Tax freeze grant from the Government any more and efficiencies are harder and harder to find.\nWill this mean that the Conservatives will be exhibiting an uncritical dignified silence in the Council's Budget meeting next Wednesday to reflect their non statement on the Councils finances. I doubt it.

As part of this declaration the LGA established a Climate Emergency Task and Finish group to examine the issues and make recommendations. I am one of five Councillors from around the UK on this group.\nHere's some thoughts in advance about some of the the recommendations we could make\n- establish a National Climate Taskforce including Ministry of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Ministry of Communities, Housing & Local Government and the Local Government Association representatives to drive action on climate change at the local level, addressing barriers to action and making good practice examples the mainstream\n- Councils to produce Climate Action Plans on how they can cut emissions quickly and what actions they could take with greater support from central Government.\n- Councils to lead local Climate Action Partnerships to drive deeper action on carbon emission reductions. This would draw in support from business, the wider public sector, the voluntary sector and the wider community\n- Government to give a clear steer to local Councils that they are expected to insist on higher energy efficiency standards in new buildings up to (and preferably) the Passivhaus Standard. This to be followed as swiftly as possible by strengthening of the energy efficiency standards in Building Regulations.\n- Reregulate and strengthen the Building Control function to ensure strict adherence to energy efficiency standards.\n- Councils to produce a plan (with a timetable) for a complete electrification of their vehicle fleets and to work with other large fleet operators on similar plans.\n- Revive the Home Energy Conservation Act powers of Local Government and ask for new plans to be established within a year for costed plans to improve the energy efficiency of homes in line with the emissions savings we need to achieve the Paris Climate goals within a ten year timeframe.",

The Huddersfield branch of the Halfax Bank are making their Branch Manager Jonathan Wales available for a morning at Hillside Primary School and Newsome Methodist Church to offer free impartial advice to local people whatever their circumstances and whoever they bank with. This is all part of their support for 'Business in the Community'. It may be difficult to get bankers out from behind their desks but if you take the banker with their desks out to where people are then they may feel more comfortable about asking for help and advice. So to promote this event myself and Jonathan went up to Castle Hill to take this picture for the local paper. Jonathan will be at Hillside Primary School on Wednesday 10th July from 9.00 till 10.30 and Newsome South Methodist Church from 10.45 till Midday. Come along he might be able to save you a few quid. A few years ago I went to my bank and got some good advice and got my money under control so maybe you could too.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

The headline figures to date are Loft insulation – 41387 homes and Cavity wall insulation 20357 homes. It has been the largest insulation scheme of it's kind ever in the UK. This will rise by a few hundred but we're pretty much at the end of it. We have acheived the previous Labour Government's target of insulating every avalable loft and cavity by 2015 a whole five years early! (Incidentally no plan was ever produced by the last government to acheive this national target)\nOne particularly gratifying things is to see the parliamentary debate on energy efficiency today to see the Kirklees scheme feature strongly with references to the strong community links by Energy and Climate Change Minister Greg Barker and our own Caroline Lucas MP. The new focus under the Carbon Emissions Reduction Targets legislation is to have a greater a focus on insulation measures what is key is whether the insulation can be installed for free or at the very least with no upfront costs. We have shown in Kirklees that you get 3 times more installations with a free area based insulation scheme than you get with able to pay offers. If you are going to the trouble of knocking on every door in your council areas, as we did with Kirklees Warm Zone, then you want as much take up as possible therefore a free scheme makes perfect sense. Officers have calculated for every £1 that the Council has spent on the scheme a further £4 has been generated in the local economy. An anti-recessionary policy? You bet it is!\nIt's not quite the end. The Warm Zone may end but the offer of free insulation to Kirklees households continues so those who have somehow been missed will still be able to get their homes insulated. We now have to move onward and carry on driving down carbon emissions with other schemes\nSunday, 27 June 2010\nSpot the Non-Policies no 1 - On your bike!\nToday Iain Duncan(Donuts)Smith announced a Tory non-policy with echoes of Norman Tebbit' famous 'my dad got on his bike and looked for work' speech.\nIt will never happen, never had a chance of happening and the government has no real plans of making it happen. I am of course talking about the 'policy' to move households in council houses in deprived areas to council houses in areas with plenty of jobs. Since the Tories started selling off council houses in the 80's there are now much less available council houses anyway. You also have to ask yourself how much available council housing there will be in 'well to do' areas with lots of jobs - not many if any. So maybe they could build some more Council houses with all the money we haven't got. In any case even if they did have the money they have abolished the house building targets which throws all housebuilding plans into disarray. Of course you have to question the wisdom and morality of a government accepting that some communities should be allowed to sink into further decline as its more mobile working age (young?) people move away. This so called 'policy' is utterly meaningless and I am completely bemused how Duncan-Smith has got some status as a Tory welfare guru when he appears to be so devoid of ideas and initiative. Hence this latest nonsense.\nHere's another 'non-policy',David Cameron talking about troops coming out of Afghanistan in 5 years. No plans to do it, no real plan to create a stable Afghanistan, no recognition that British Troops are not part of the solution in Afghanistan but part of the problem. Why 5 years, why not 4, why not 2, why not tomorrow?\nWhy do journalists give this sort of non-policy, non-story any credence whatsoever?\nIt will never happen, never had a chance of happening and the government has no real plans of making it happen.

Why 5 years, why not 4, why not 2, why not tomorrow?\nWhy do journalists give this sort of non-policy, non-story any credence whatsoever?\nSaturday, 19 June 2010\nThe Culture, Tourism and Sport Report\nLast year the Independent Group on the Local Government Association appointed me to the position of Deputy Chair of the Culture, Tourism and Sport Board. They obviously recognised my cultured demeanor, sporty physique and failed to notice my lack of air miles. The work covered has been very varied covering everything from the Olympics, to Library Policy to facilities for disabled tourists in our towns and cities. I have participated in all meetings of the Board and will only miss the last one for this cycle due to being on the interview panel for our new Chief Executive as our last one has been moved to Doncaster. I attended and chaired a Seminar session at the LGA’s Culture Tourism and Sport Conference in Newcastle earlier this year and was very impressed with their new library facilities (and not just the impressive solar water heating facility and display. Though it must be said I did ask more questions about it than about the books or the PCs or anything else at all really!).\nIt has been hugely valuable to come from a smaller Political Party and to have an input into policy formulation at a national level. The delivery of most government policy happens at the local level so the role of the LGA is vital to ensure national government gets an informed ‘reality check’ on policy implementation. As an example Government has proposed reducing administration cost for the National Lottery which on the face of it does appear to be a good idea. However the unintended consequence of this may be to reduce the likelihood of lottery outlets in rural locations (such as is being threatened at Grange Moor) and thereby further reducing the viability of local shops. This was a point I made during the Board meetings which will be fed into LGAs communications with national government.\nThe Tourism Working Group which I have attended had an item on the agenda regarding ‘Open Britain’ a new guide available on the web for the disabled traveller with information on where to stay, how to get there and what to do when you get there. With about 11 million disabled people in the UK this could be a very valuable resource. Promotional stickers will be available for establishments that are easily accessible for wheelchair users and people with a range of disabilities. It occured to me that certain campaign groups might establish a ‘Closed Britain’ sticker for particularly inaccessible venues!\nThere has been discussion about the loss of analogue radio for established stations by 2015. There was general agreement that the move to digital was a good idea but concern over the higher energy use associated with the new digital boxes and the impact of millions of analogue radios being effectively useless and being presented to Councils for recycling. It is estimated that there will be around 100 million such radio sets. Shropshire District Council has called on the government to review the decision to use the 2015 date and to address the financial hardship of poorer households who will have to replace their radio sets and the impact of dealing with the disposal of millions of radio sets.\nDCMS has conducted a ‘Libraries Modernisation Review’ which LGA has input to. This focussed on Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council where DCMS conducted an inquiry into their proposals to cut 11 or 12 of their current libraries to see if it is consistent with their statutory duty to provide a comprehensive and efficient library service. I did not get the impression that they will be intervening much into any Councils proposals to close libraries. Much of the justification for closures is about the move to mixed use buildings not simply libraries and the increasing use of the internet to access information and entertainment. This does not bode well in the current climate and if Councils decide to go down the line of significant cuts in the Library service to achieve savings then there appears to be very little central government will do in terms of intervention.\nSo to prove I have some cultural leanings and for your entertainment here's Buffy Saint Marie who is 70, a native american and first woman to breastfeed on Sesame Street singing about environmental destruction. It doesn't get any more 'right on' than this. It was a toss up between this and Holiday in Cambodia by the Dead Kennedys.\nWednesday, 16 June 2010\nSolar - Do we have a million pounds more than we thought we had?\nRegular readers of this blog will recall that the Greens on Kirklees have successfully argued the case for £5 million worth of photovoltaic solar panels on Council buildings. We were able to do this by demonstrating that the Clean Energy Cashback/Feed In Tarrif will pay for the capital borrowing costs of the investment. That is however only part of the picture. What hasn't been taken into account, to my knowledge, is the value of the solar elecricity used in the buildings. So let's do some sums\nAssume - £5million buys 1000kWp of solar panels (actually that is a conservative figure)\nAssume a 1000kWp produced 800000 kWh at 12p/kWh(don't know what KMC pay for electricity but it will be in this ballpark) Therefore we may have £96000 that we weren't accounting for.\nThat £96000 will finance the borrowing of around £1million in Capital to help fund essential Council projects. Of course the Council may decide to simply take the revenue saving to save jobs or support services. The key point is that if solar is self funding and generates the Council vital revenue why are we just planning to restrict this project to £5million? Why not £50million (£1million revenue OR £10million capital) or a £100million(£2million revenue OR £20million capital). Imagine what that could do to help turnaround the Council's financial woes.\nMonday, 14 June 2010\nKirklees Leadership - You can have any colour so long as its red!\nKirklees Council’s Annual Meeting, following the last local elections were in many ways business as usual and in some ways very different. As usual no Party had an overall majority on the Council. In fact no single Party had even a third of the seats. Labour were the largest Party following the election with 24 out of 69 Councillors and they put their leader forward to lead the Council for the next four years. The Conservatives with 19 Councillors did not put a candidate before the Council to lead Kirklees and instead, and bizarrely nominated the Leader of the Liberal Democrats with 20 Councillors forward. What was bizarre about this was they hadn’t even asked her before the meeting whether she was willing to be put forward and of course she wasn’t. It was just some strange political game being played out.\nSo the Labour leader Mehboob Khan was the only one put forward. His term is supposedly for 4 years but local elections and votes of no confidence could conceivably bring that date forward as could Cllr Khan’s promise to submit himself for re-election before the Council each year despite their no longer being any legal requirement for him to do so.\nSo the only option put before the Councils was a Labour leader. The four Greens on the Council backed the Labour leader on the basis that we would work together on protecting the local economy as much as we could from the effects of the recession.\n(The picture is from Star Wars and is Garven Dreis who narrowly missed blowing up the Death Star and was shortly after killed by Darth Vader. And the relevance is? His callsign is 'Red Leader'. I guess I could have just put a picture of Mehboob Khan up there but where would be the fun in that?)\nWednesday, 9 June 2010\nSunny Views in the Local Paper\nReader Letters Examiner letters, June 9\nSOME months ago I wrote to Kirklees Council leader Clr Mehboob Khan regarding solar panels for my home. His answer was that the council would give me an interest-free loan.\nThanks, I said, but I can’t afford an interest-free loan and the energy bills are getting more costly. Can I have one of those panels that I am paying for out of my council tax that you are fitting free to council houses?\nAll went quiet on the western front.\nFairness never comes into it. It is all about party appeasement at the cost to the taxpayer. So, Mike Warren-Madden, do not hold your breath. Suffocation is final. They can talk the talk about saving energy but cannot walk the walk when it comes to handing it out.\nR J Bray\nShelley\nHere comes the sun\nMIKE Warren-Madden (I want a solar panel too, Mailbag, June 4) can certainly ‘Talk the talk.’\nIn fact, I doubt if there’s a donkey with a full set of legs within 10 miles of Brockholes.\nBut when it comes to ‘walking the walk,’ he clearly prefers to let others put the effort in. With that in mind, might I ask him a question about his latest letter?\nMike, you asked about who might get solar panels. Have you done anything to try to find out? Have you tried to contact Clr Andrew Cooper about it? Have you written, phoned, or left an email for him?\nMy guess is that you haven’t.\nR A Vant\nHolmfirth\nCost of ‘free’ energy\nMIKE Warren-Madden wrote regarding the Green Party’s proposalŠ to pursue a free solar panel installation scheme for householders in Kirklees.\nHe asks if it will just be for council house tenants and if council taxpayers will end up paying the bill. The answer to both these questions is No.\nThe scheme we are proposing will be paid for through the Clean Energy Cashback introduced in May this year. This is a tariff available to anyone who installs solar panels from their energy companies.\nSo, very roughly, if you were to install solar electricity panels at a cost between £8,000 to £10,000 on your home it would give you about £25,000 back over the 25 years that the tariff would be available for.\nOf course, a lot of people haven’t got access to that sort of money, particularly at the moment. The role of the council would be to install the panels for free but to take a proportion of the Clean Energy Cashback to pay for the full costs of the installation and any interest.\nHouseholds would still get the benefit of the electricity from the solar panels in their home, saving them between £150 and £200 a year.ŠThe solar panels wouldn’t replace your grid-supplied electricity but mean you will need less of it.\nThe proposal stacks up financially. The next issue we have to address is ensuring that the legal issues of signing over the Clean Energy Cashback are dealt with and then going through a tender process to get qualified installers.\nOnce this is done I envisage it would be delivered in much the same way as the free insulation scheme that the Green Party proposed. Assessors would go door-to-door to assess the suitability of the property for the solar panels and, if all is OK, then a few weeks later the panels would be installed.\nSo this scheme would save money, save energy, reduce carbon emissions, create skilled jobs and not cost the council taxpayer an additional penny.\nMike asks if we can install one at his house as soon as possible. Well, I’m not saying it’s going to be tomorrow but we’re on with it. If he, or anyone else, has any more questions, either contact me directly or through the Examiner letters column if that’s what you prefer.\nClr Andrew Cooper\nGreen Party Councillor, Newsome Ward\nSunday, 6 June 2010\nTwo Years On - A Postcard from the Age of Plenty\nThis video was produced for Kirklees Greens by the national Green Party for the May 2008 Local elections. Looking back it was produced in a different age. We were in the times of relative plenty before the public purse would have to pay for the private banking sectors excesses. We were quite chuffed about it at the time, having our own local election 'broadcast' and we promoted it on our literature. It took a couple of days to put together with an all 'star' cast including me, Councillors Graham Simpson, Julie Stewart-Turner, Derek Hardastle and Kirkburton Parish Councillor Michelle Atkinson.\nIt's interesting to look back on it to see just how much has changed (or not) over the last couple of years. The free insulation offer in Kirklees Warm Zone had just got into its stride having been kicked off just over a year previously and was a runaway success. Our allotment initiave hadn't started but we had been successful in obtaining the funding to get sites restored and improved so, at the time, we had no idea how popular it would become and how it would give a timely boost to the local food movement. The RE-Charge scheme which helped people get solar panels and other renewable technologies installed with no upfront costs was just an idea when the video was produced and now its has won the 2009 British Renewable Energy Awards as Best Advocate for the renewables sector and hundreds of homes have benefited. What doesn't seem to be coming off though is the recycling of the funding I mentioned. The Feed In Tarrif has changed the economics of solar panels reducing the need for second charge type arrangements. Pool cars have become a reality in Kirklees Council linked to changes to terms and conditions of service. We also now have City Car Club which now has 7 vehicles being used by Council staff and other local businesses and individuals.\nOther things in the video have come to pass such as the end of Christmas Parties for Party Groups paid for by Council Tax payers see previous posts on how this came to pass and\nIt hasn't all come true though. The can crushers initiative never actually happened or the free reusable nappies for new parents. These would have been great initiatives but seemed to end up as too difficult to acheive. One we'll have to look at again in less financially constrained times. If we were to do another one of these what policies would we promote in these days where recession seems to be government policy. If anything the policies we were advocating 2 years ago are even more relevant on the national scale today when we need to generate new jobs and industries to tackle fuel poverty and climate change. Lets see what happens and be hopeful.\nFriday, 4 June 2010\nGrowing Newsome Grows\nHere it is my first video link to my blog. This is from the Growing Newsome Seed Swap event taken by local food guru and organiser Diane Sims. Its really inspiring stuff. Yes the basic ingredients are tea, coffee, cake and seedlings but ultimately it's about people taking a bit more control of their own lives and becoming less dependent on supermarkets. People are also using their own local environment to do this and with their neighbours who become friends. Its so positive I think it should be the cornerstone of a lot of action to build successful and happy communities.\nWell allotmenting tomorrow for me to plant my stuff.\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",

The aim would be to provide free insulation\nto 4000 properties as a showcase to other local authorities and national\ngovernment. Within this project we would also expect 25% of the funding to be\nallocated to properties in fuel poverty and that they benefit from a whole\nhouse approach aimed at achieving the ‘Enerphit’ standard.\nThis project will demonstrate to national government the\nbenefits and practicalities of applying ‘HS2’ levels of funding to domestic\nenergy efficiency to achieve our Paris Climate goals, address fuel poverty,\ncreate skilled jobs and regenerate local economies.\nKirklees\nNeighbourhood Housing Carbon Reduction Fund\nFollowing years of energy saving initiatives this Fund will\nbe used to carry out pathfinding work to demonstrate how we will drive down\nemissions still further to levels consistent with a 2030 zero carbon target.\nThe aim will be to achieve as close to the Enerphit standard as is practical.\nWe are also calling on Kirklees Neighbourhood Housing to transfer homes to a\nlow cost green energy provider when they become void.\nCommunity\nClimate Action projects – Place based working\nWe propose that the\nnext round of Place based working funding is to be allocated for community lead\nclimate action projects.

Thousands of leaflets were delivered in heavy rain. One morning 6 of us delivered the whole of Shelley in wet weather gear through a relentless downpour, Special campaign honours to those people.\nWe also had a more aggressive Labour Party Campaign in Newsome than usual that needed addressing and handling. It was a bit of a 'surprise attack' and soon we were seeing Labour Councillors from all over Huddersfield canvassing in Newsome. We also had our Labour MP Barry Sheerman and a Coronation Street Actress pressing the flesh for Labour in Newsome. We closely followed the literature being produced by Labour and there was a lot of it, some personalised letters and several full colour glossy leaflets. I bumped into Cllr Mehboob Khan leafleting in Lockwood who insisted to me that Labour were not targeting Newsome but the evidence and information that had come my way seemed to indicate the opposite. I was getting calls from constituents from all over the Newsome Ward telling me what this or that Labour Councillor had said to them on the doorstep in pursuit of their votes. Apparently I spent all my time running Kirkburton Parish Council and was neglecting the Newsome Ward which I didn't even live in! Actually I attend about 2 Parish Council meetings a month and there are plenty of other Kirkburton Parish Cllrs to do the important stuff without me interfering. As for not living in the ward I've never tried to make a secret of this and have put my home address prominently on several leaflets over the years. It was strange to get this sort of attack from the Labour and Conservative Candidates who also didn't live in the ward themselves but of course they didn't put this particular fact on their leaflets. There were 2 full colour leaflets that went out in the last couple of days as well as a full colour Polling Day reminder card. There's plenty more I could say on the Labour campaign but it can wait for another day. Interestingly the Tories put a bit more effort than usual into Newsome but the messaging was all about not voting Green rather than reasons to vote Conservative. It almost seemed like a two pronged attack from 2 Parties working together to unseat me. When Kirkburton Cllr Christine Smith was sighted canvassing in Newsome trying out her own particular brand of invective with the locals I knew the knives were out. The feeling and support on the doorstep towards the Green Party remained good throughout which was comforting.\nThe outcome of all this was an increase in the Green Party share of the vote from just over 51% to just under 53%. Anyway here's a clip from Star Trek 2 - The Wrath of Khan. Khan has just carried out a surprise attack on the USS Enterprise and believes he has the upper hand.\nNice clip! Loving what he's doing with his hair these days...\nReplyDeleteAs for you spending all your time running Kirkburton Parish Council? I thought that 25 of us and two staff did that? But then if one is used to following a dictatorial model, I guess that a free-thinking democratic method of achieving things is rather difficult to understand. I think the results speak for themselves... well done Green Party! Sharon.\nI have to say, if they had spent more time running the council better in the first place, they would have more time at home.\nReplyDeleteNice work Andrew and Robert.....\nWell done on seeing off a two-pronged attack. It neither surprises me that you were a target for both sides, nor that your constituents returned you to office with a resounding vote of confidence. Keep up the great work!\nReplyDeleteWell done to Robert,we both voted for him. It is so refreshing to meet someone who talks the talk and walks the walk.\nReplyDelete",

It was only 3 weeks after the first 2 cases were discovered and quickly isolated in York. The first clusters of cases had started appearing in Northern Italy and I got a really bad feeling about its ability to travel so far so fast.\nReading it back the email I sent to the Council's Chief Executive and other Party Leaders seems rather prescient sadly:-\n\"Are we developing/have a plan for a possible serious\noutbreak in Kirklees/West Yorkshire?\nThat was on 22nd of February. A week later the first Covid infection for someone who had not come from abroad was detected. A week after that the first death in the UK was announced. The following week 250,000 attended the Cheltenham Festival and 52,000 attended the Liverpool V Athetico Madrid match with 5000 Spanish spectators. By the 23rd of March we entered the first national lockdown.\nMy main reflection is that National Government acted far too slowly and that cost lives, thousands of them. At some point they must be held to account for what they did and didn't do. If they are allowed to portray the vaccine roll out as some form of victory then democracy will have failed us again. The seriousness of this crisis required an all Party approach and not a partisan one. The Conservatives should have sought talents from all parties to come together to address the crisis and sadly it never did. Coming from a Party that must make best use of its often limited influence I am annoyed beyond words when politicians in power waste their opportunities to act. That is as true of the Conservative Government in Westminster as it is of Labour Administration in Kirklees.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2011_01_windmill-madness_html/content_165.html": "| An Industrial scale wind turbine ! |\nMisinformation is rife from the foaming mouth brigade when it comes to wind turbines. They give people epilepsy, make bats explode, decapitate people, explode, don't work and on and on it goes. These same 'issues' with sometimes a small grain of truth don't tend to arise in Europe where most countries get more renewable energy installed where the laws of physics obviously work differently. Here's one such letter from Dr David Hill who's standing as an Independent at the next election. Interestingly he's anti nuclear as well. My response follows (but it's not quite as long)\nWindmill madness\nI HOPE that Clr Andrew Cooper and all those who believe in wind power took notice of Look North’s recent exposé which showed that over the past two months wind turbines have provided virtually no electricity.\nAdded to this, international studies have determined over the years that, on average, these monstrosities at their maximum only work 23% of the time.\nWhen we consider that international research also determined that these white elephants need completely replacing in less than 20 years from being built (wear-out of components is high), we the taxpayers will have to pay out billions again over the next 20 years to simply keep them going.\nThis strategy devised by the former Labour government and continued now by the present coalition government is sheer madness.\nIt is also remarkable that the so-called wise men of Whitehall, who advise government, are proposing to commit £10bn to the construction of a single nuclear power station.\nThis new station will have major nuclear waste problems in the years to come, most probably costing the taxpayers again another £10bn to get rid of it, and will only provide at the best, 5% of our future electricity needs.\nFor in this respect, a scheme put forward to government for a hydro-electric scheme that would cut shipping costs substantially, has the same cost but will provide the UK with 10% of its electricity needs in perpetuity.\nThis would have been clean energy with no toxic waste and would have lasted forever once built with very little maintenance at all.\nAre we crazy in this country and just like throwing taxpayers’ money away as though it was going out of fashion?\nIt certainly seems that way to me or is it there are some very powerful lobby groups doing very nicely indeed out of this old codswallop?\nThe Green Party should be backing this hydro scheme, not stupid wind turbines that have a bottomless pit and appetite for continual finance.\nOur town planners and Kirklees councillors should take note of all these facts when giving the ‘green’ light to these schemes, as they invariably do!\nBut I have to say that I was happy to see that at least David Brown’s is getting some work out of this stupidity (Examiner, January 8).\nFor if politicians are so stupid to see wind as the Holy Grail, at least Huddersfield is getting something out of it.\nA sane world? I think not when it comes to spending our hard-earned tax.\nIt’s about time our central and local government politicians started to do a bit of their own research for all our long-term sakes.\nDr David Hill\nProspective Independent candidate, Golcar\nDr Hill goes on to say that the Green Party should be supporting hydro power schemes. Actually the Green Party does support large scale hydro and I don’t know why he believes we don’t. Hydro projects can store energy to be released at times of high demand. The truth is that we need a mix of energy sources renewable and non renewable hopefully using the developing carbon capture and storage technologies. Crucially though we need to be wasting less energy and using it more efficiently in the first place.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper\nPlease read my letter it did not say this.\nReplyDeleteI worked on the scheme that you cite in North Wales with McAlpines when I was a trainee engineer. This scheme is not typical of hydro electic power stations. If you respectfully read a book you will see.\nDr David Hill\nDavid - As you can see I've copied your letter in full so I'm hardly misrepresenting you. My comments at the begining of this piece are on some of the objections I have heard about wind turbines very recently from anti-wind campaigners. I don't cite any particular hydro scheme in my blog.\nReplyDeleteYes, Andrew but you did not say all that I did. This is a very shortend versin that I sent you? Why was this. If you send me a reply I do not cut stuff out just because I don't like it.\nReplyDeleteBest, David\nDr David Hill\nIt was cut and pasted directly from the Examiner website in its entirety. If your letter was slimmed down it was not by me.\nReplyDelete",

The Planning Committee on Thursday deciding on the application included both myself and Councillor D Firth. Planning Officers presented the application and the Chair then asked if there were any questions from Councillors. My question was \"Is it made of mud?\" The officer looked confused and said \"No\" I then expressed my own confusion as Cllr Firth had carried out \"research\" saying they were made of mud.

The all consuming, news dominating B word 'Brexit' has been replaced with the C-word 'Corona' or 'Covid19'. The physical places where we once came together as a society, where we met, collaborated, planned and had a darned good time on occasion, are all closed. Workplaces, cafes, restaurants, pubs, churches, mosques, temples, schools are all empty. The treadmill of everyday life has stopped for the first time in generations. The machine has stopped. We can't simply start it again without asking some serious questions about what is important to us.\nIt is a time to reflect, to think about the things that we value and all that we want to see changed for the better.\nWe have relied on the Public and voluntary sectors like never before. They are valued like never before and so is what they can do to protect us and provide for our everyday needs. This is something the private sector simply cannot and would never match.\nThe NHS's future has to be secured, but it has got to go way beyond the warm words that all politicians say. Those who supported a market of NHS services need to reflect on whether the likes of Richard Branson have any place making a profit from our health services.\nA positive out of this awful situation is the benefit to our local and global environment.

The all consuming, news dominating B word 'Brexit' has been replaced with the C-word 'Corona' or 'Covid19'. The physical places where we once came together as a society, where we met, collaborated, planned and had a darned good time on occasion, are all closed. Workplaces, cafes, restaurants, pubs, churches, mosques, temples, schools are all empty. The treadmill of everyday life has stopped for the first time in generations. The machine has stopped. We can't simply start it again without asking some serious questions about what is important to us.\nIt is a time to reflect, to think about the things that we value and all that we want to see changed for the better.\nWe have relied on the Public and voluntary sectors like never before. They are valued like never before and so is what they can do to protect us and provide for our everyday needs. This is something the private sector simply cannot and would never match.\nThe NHS's future has to be secured, but it has got to go way beyond the warm words that all politicians say. Those who supported a market of NHS services need to reflect on whether the likes of Richard Branson have any place making a profit from our health services.\nA positive out of this awful situation is the benefit to our local and global environment.

We heard of the founders producing leaflets on hand cranked gestener copiers before offset lithos and photocopiers. The Green Parties that now span the world all came from these initial few dedicated people. In Kirklees we are particularly honoured to have Clive Lord one of the founding members. He first stood for election as the 'People' candidate in one of the 1974 General Elections. Before it was the Green Party it was the Ecology Party and before that simply 'People'. Clive started being joined by others in Leeds around 1980 and had to wait till around till 1985 for the founding of the Green Party in Huddersfield to have other Kirklees based members to work with. Clive is an evangilist for the Citizens Income scheme as an alternative to the Welfare Benefits system. I'm not going to explain it here and anyway Clive has his own Blog here so read that.!\nThe word 'stalwart' is often used in the context of Clive and every opportunity he gets he is eulogising about the Citizens Income, sometimes at inappropriate times. I strongly suspects he knows this but then he is a man on a mission who is proposing a system which undoubtedly has its benefits. I have no doubt that in a few years time people will develop Clive's pathfinding work and recognise the contribution he has made when the dreadful so called ' Welfare Reformer' Iain Duncan Smith is justly reviled for pushing those on benefits further into misery and destitution.\n| Clive Lord today |",

A cameraman was on hand from Lancashire TV after a short walk out of Longridge we were walking across fields, got lost in the wrong field for a bit then carried on till we came to a footbridge over the M6. Very soon we were on the muddiest canal bank you can possibly imagine. Almost impossible to walk on in some parts but we did. We were greeted to the sight of a heron tackling an eel on the canal bank which held us up for a bit of a natural history display, then we carried on. Leaving the canal we headed towards the penultimate village before our destination: Kirkham.\nIn Kirkham we met at the pre arranged Pub with up to a hundred people there to walk with us for the last 5 miles to Preston New Road. Among them was Natalie Bennett, former Green Party Leader who had come to join us on the last leg. We set off and the drumming and chanting from our long line of fellow walkers. I just felt carried over those last few miles. The Core Group were subsumed within the mass of walkers as we headed by road to our destination. Then we arrived. As destinations go it was not in itself particularly inspiring. A Heras security fence with a row of dayglo guards behind it The chanting continued from us all on the opposite side of road \"No Fracking in Yorkshire, No Fracking in Lancashire, No Fracking Anywhere\". The 8 of us from the Core Group crossed the road with a banner standing in front of the fence for the photo opportunity. It was a lovely moment. To have actually made it the whole 120 miles and to be there with those who had shared the experience, the joy and the pain of walking all those miles.\nWe left the site and walked a short distance to a nearby Garden Centre that had allowed the local Anti Fracking Activists to use a huge polytunnel as their HQ. Lined up in a row at one end were 8 chairs with bowls of warm soapy water in front of them. we were handed red and white roses to hold to symbolise our 2 historic counties unity in the campaign against fracking. I addressed the crowd while standing in a bowl of water. I've got to say that is a first for me. The things I remember talking about was that the struggle we face against fracking being as much a global as well as a local issue. When I talked about the kindness shown to us on our journey I did start to feel a bit emotional as I it had really touched me but held it together as any repressed 52 year old Yorkshireman would. Then I reached into my rucksack and pulled out the Harrogate toffee tin filled with 'holy Yorkshire soil' from Kirby Misperton Protection Camp and we went outside and planted a Yorkshire Oak tree in Lancashire soil and symbolically mixed the soils of our 2 counties around it. Duncan from Blackpool Green Party said a few words and a poem. There were hand shakes and hugs and it was over. Simon Duffy from Huddersfield Green Party was on hand to take me and Louise home to Huddersfield and back to what passes for normal every day life for me. Some time to heal, sit on the sofa and watch crap telly. Heaven!\n\"So did you save the world from the Frackers then?\" was one mildly sarcastic question I have been asked. No unfortunately we didn't that day. If anything it is the people who go to Preston New Road and Kirby Misperton nearly every day to protest who deserve the most credit and will hopefully save the UK from the Frackers I believe. The aim of the No Fracking Way walk was to show that Fracking is not simply a NIMBY issue but that an attack on the environment in one place was an attack on us all. A sort of NATO pact for the Environment. For those places to be in Lancashire and in Yorkshire with all the historical connotations of supposed rivalry gave it additional significance. Walking a 120 miles in 5 days on roads is hard but then we know that if it had been easy it wouldn't have been newsworthy or drawn as much attention and support from people across the North of England as it did. Division is everywhere in the UK. North and South, Lancashire and Yorkshire, Leavers and Remainers and so all actions which reach out and bring people together across divides are intrinsically a good thing to do. So as a proud Yorkshireman I'm also now the proud owner of a Frack Free Lancashire t-shirt. I hope to be wearing it at Preston New Road again very soon.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

He's not a big fan of equality laws and would rather we just managed to do the right thing without them. It doesn't take a genius to work out the pretty dire state we would be without the protection from unscrupulous employers that equality laws have provided.\nThe portion of the interview that took me by surprise was that a woman in one part of the world has apparently married a dog. I just took this to be a dubious and bizarre skateboarding duck type story and treated it accordingly. Tom however saw this as a seriously moral issue and cited the Bible. I did wonder whether there was a negative subtext from Tom here about recent changes in the law allowing gay marraige. I hope not. He really needs to lighten up a bit.\nOverall I enjoyed the experience despite feeling a bit ropey but more opportunity for debate between different viewpoints would make these interviews more interesting to potential viewers.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Don't get me wrong I think it is important that work by some of Kirklees Council's excellent staff is recognised but it would be interesting to see the ratio of awards applied for, how many were shortlisted and how many resulted in winners. Among other things Kirklees Council has recently won Catering Business of the Year which I'm sure is well deserved but if there is a push to chase awards for their own sake that would be worrying\nAnother Council that has received recognition this week is the Green Party /Lib Dem Administration in York. It has been named by the United Nations as a Global Centre of Excellence for high performance buildings - one of 26 around the world to mark COP26 including New York, Pittsburgh and Renfewshire in Scotland. This has been lead by Green Party Councillor Denise Craghill the Cabinet Member responsible for housing and is a recognition of the Councils plans to build an impressive 600 houses to the Passivhaus standard There has been a big push in the Green Party to get action the Passivhaus Standard more widely adopted and I wrote a Passivhaus Flatpack Campaign Pack back in 2016 and around the same time I chaired an All-Party Policy Group at Kirklees Council which in It's final report recommended the following to Kirklees Labour Cabinet:-\nRepeated question on how the Cabinet would respond to the recommendations were met with silence or misinformed myths about the Passivhaus standard.

The Green\nCouncillor from Farnley Tyas has come out against calls by Farnley Estates to\nrelease more Green Belt for Housing Development to support their proposed\nCountry Park.\nCouncillor Barraclough said\n“As the Draft Kirklees Local Plan consultation ends it is\nnow time to reflect and consider the responses many local people have made\nthrough this process. I have spoken to a lot of local people as individuals,\nresponded to emails and phone calls, attended community meetings and have put\ninformation about the Local Plan through many local letterboxes. I have got a\nvery clear picture of local feelings and concerns.\nOne of the main concerns has been the proposal by Farnley\nEstates to release of Greenbelt land to the Farnley Country Park. Farnley\nEstates have been actively promoting the concept and this has led to a wide\nranging and often heated debate. At this point and looking at the\ncorrespondence I have received I feel that there needs to to be much more\ndetail in the proposal before it can be assessed thoroughly.\nThe proposal requires the release of sensitive areas of\nGreen Belt for housing which I would not be able to support especially as in\nthe draft plan almost all of the proposed sites have been rejected.\nIn fact the strength of response brings into question\nwhether or not the Green Belt allocation for this proposal should appear in the\nplan at all. The wording in the Draft Local Plan could be\nreinterpreted over the course of the plan and this is a genuine concern. I will\nbe asking Officers to review this inclusion with a view to removal or\nsubstantially tighter drafting.\nSince the start of the consultation period I have\nconsistently recommended to concerned residents that the best course of action\nwas to support the rejected sites option, this is what many have done and a\ncourse of action that I still agree with.”\nContact –Cllr Robert Barraclough Email - robertw.barraclough@kirklees.gov.uk\nMobile - 07778 315577\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

There is certainly a lot of heritage to talk about with the original Brookes Mill business beginning in 1541 in the reign of Henry 8th, though not on the current site. As such Mark Brooke can justifiably claim to have the oldest family run business in Britain. The Spinning Mill on the Armitage Bridge site was established in 1828 and by 1846 they were were making woollen cloth right from the woollen bale right through to the finished cloth. Manufacturing ceased on the site in 1987 but as they say a 'phoenix has risen from the ashes'. The mills now are used as refurbished office space with a diverse range of businesses including an independent film studios, art gallery, conference facilities and cafe. They are also refurbishing one of the original forms of power on the site to generate electricity from hydro using an archimedes screw. This is due to be up and running next year and will mean that we will be utilising every microgeneration technology in some form or other in the Newsome Ward.\nHuddersfield University students have played an important role in researching the information for the exhibition and it really is worth a look at followed by cake and coffee in the cafe! One of the great things about this new exhibition is the opportunity it provides to bring alive local history for education of young people and the interest of the wider public and promotion of this new attraction and the Mills offer as a whole is something we need to get out there in the wider community so they know the facilities and the history that is on their doorstep.\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

So this was very much a public health issue as much as it was an environmental one.\nThe Labour Deputy Leader who was leading on the Kirklees Budget had indicated\nthat the electric vehicles part of the Green Party amendment would be\nacceptable should Labour not get their budget passed in the Council’s Budget\nmeeting and should they need Green Councillors support to get their budget through.\nWe are aware that the Labour Councillor for Dalton and\nCabinet Member Mus Khan is involved in the Newsome Labour Candidate's campaign and we believe she has been poorly advised.\nLabour Cabinet members should be well informed\nabout the realities of the Council finances and so we can only assume that this\nattack is a deliberate attempt to mislead electors.\nIt is disappointing when these sort of tactics are used.

I saw the community rally round really quickly as St Johns Church\nand Newsome Scout Hut opened their doors to residents. They got the tea and\ncoffee going and breakfast for those people who were temporarily moved from\ntheir homes. Newsome Village Store donated food for evacuated residents and the\nFire Service and Police were caring and professional helping some particularly\nvulnerable residents who lived nearby. Kirklees Emergency Planning and Building\nControl were on the scene early on dealing with their responsibilities for the\ncommunity and the building itself. The local response to the immediate crisis\nhas shown the community and local services at their very best.\nThe question is what happens next. The structure of the\nMills itself is severely compromised and as I write this it is expected that\nthe Mill Building may have to be demolished. Hopefully the iconic clock tower will remain. There have\nbeen 2 controversial Planning matters associated with the site. The private\nowners of Newsome Mills itself have been reluctant to develop on the site due\nto the costs of converting the mill which is/was a listed building. The private\nowners of the land at Hart Street near the Mills have sought to develop the\nsite on a number of occasions. The fact that the land is part of the historic\nsetting of Newsome Mills has been one of a number of reasons that local people have opposed development there. With\nthe suspected arson of the Newsome Mills site we will have to see what happens\nnext.\nFor now we need to take stock and let the investigation into\nthe blaze be carried out by the appropriate services. This has been a truly\nawful year for the people of Newsome with the Hunters Waste site going up in\nflames, the vandalism and burning of Newsome Community Bowling Club's buildings\nand now Newsome Mills itself going up in flames. If, as I expect, Newsome Mills\nturns out to be arson then all these fires will be the result of the actions of\npeople who have no regard for the local community or the people who live there.\nLet’s hope for a better 2017.\nI wondered what the owners were waiting for.

The MoU was one where the 2 bodies were supposed to share intelligence and information on current policy developments and work together on action to tackle climate change. One bone of contention was the illegal cuts in the Feed In Tariff for solar PV which had been pursued with no reference to the LGA and had cost Councils many thousands in preparing for large scale solar projects which were now defunct. Clearly the MoU had been disregarded by DECC here. There were other examples which brought into question DECCs real commitment to buy into the MoU. There was general agreement that we needed to secure more assurances from DECC before renewing the MoU. One suggestion I made which was well received and accepted was for the LGA to establish another MoU but this time with industry. The interests of the microgeneration and energy efficiency sectors and local government coincide in a number of areas. We both want to see action on the ground and our principle common constraint is the policies of central government. Approaching DECC with a common message could give more weight to both organisations. I’ll let you know how it progresses.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Obviously the Tories abstaining at the Annual Council meeting on the Leadership and allowing Labour to run the Council presented him with a bit of a dilemma. Here's how he dealt with/rationalised it and my response below that.\n“Local people gave the Labour Party an increased number of\ncouncillors showing we’re in tune with residents,” were the resounding\nwords of Clr Mehboob Khan after his re-election as leader of our\ncouncil.\nI and others were unhappy that the Conservative councillors decided to abstain from the vote.\nThis is to a degree understandable when all they would face would be derision at failing to oust Clr Khan from his secure seat.\nIf the Conservatives had voted against Clr Khan it would have made\nno difference whatsoever. He is leader by the constitution for four\nyears even though he puts himself up for re-election each year it’s a\ncase of the winner of this year’s one horse race is. The Labour Group\nhas 32 members and the Conservatives have but 18.\nIf, however, Conservative Clr Robert Light had put up for council leader not one of the other groups would have supported him.\nThe Greens would not have voted for an alternative. It was the votes\nof the four greens three years ago which lost the Conservatives control\nof the council. The Lib Dems would not support the Conservatives nor\nwould the Independents.\nThe four independents – three of whom are now in with the Green\ngroup – voted against and the other independent voted for Clr Khan.\nThis year was the first time the Greens voted against Clr Khan and\nthe main reason being they did not get the chair of Scrutiny Panel or\nany chairs of major committees which they wanted.\nThey therefore voted as a matter of pique rather than policy.\nLabour is the largest party and so by the constitution has to form\nthe administration. All other minor groups would not support the\nConservatives running the council.\nPerhaps Clr Andrew Cooper and Clr Kath Pinnock would care to explain\nwhy they would not support the Conservatives in running the\nadministration as the major opposition party thus trying to break the\ncycle of negativity from the clueless Labour party.\nR J Bray\nShelley\nAnd my response\nR J Bray says in his letter (Examiner, May 28) “Perhaps Clr Andrew\nCooper and Clr Kath Pinnock would care to explain why they would not\nsupport the Conservatives in running the administration’’.\nThe fact of the matter is that they never sought support and never made a ‘pitch’ to other groups.\nI tried to get the non Labour groups round the table on a number of\noccasions to discuss how to address the leadership of the council and to\nput pressure on the Labour Party on issues of mutual concern, such as\nthe libraries, but to no avail.\nThere simply wasn’t the will for joint discussions from the Conservatives.\nPersonally I have no particular enthusiasm for either Labour or the\nConservatives running the council but my prime concern, in a hung\ncouncil, would be about the policies they were seeking to pursue and\ntheir willingness to involve other groups in decision making.\nThe Greens have supported (and opposed) all the other political\ngroups on the council at different times on different issues on the\nbasis of the policies and their impact on local people.\nAnother statement by Mr Bray in his letter was “the Greens voted\nagainst Clr Khan and the main reason being they did not get the chair of\nthe Scrutiny Panel or any of the chairs of major committees that they\nwanted”.\nThis maybe what he believes but it simply isn’t true.\nClr Khan threatened to remove the Green Party from chairing the\nResources Scrutiny Panel if we didn’t support him as Leader before we\nmade our decision.\nIt would be true however to say that these threats did inform our view of his character as a potential leader of the council.\nIn the end we didn’t support him because we couldn’t get a firm commitment on policy issues, including the libraries.\nAs a consequence of our decision at the annual council meeting\nLabour voted in favour of the Conservatives taking the Chair of the\nResources Scrutiny Panel from the Green Party and Valley Independent\nGroup as punishment to us and as a reward to the Conservatives, for\nabstaining on the vote on the leadership, thus allowing Mehboob Khan to\nbecome Leader of the Council.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper\nCo-Leader of the Green Party and Valley Independent Group\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

It says that we have already passed the peak of oil discovery and that production of oil and gas from fossil sources will inevitably decline. Given much of our civilisation is based on fossil fuels this is disturbing reading. The concept of peak oil is well established and has moved from a concern of environmentalists to well informed former oil company insiders. The oil companies themselves play down the peak oil debate and their own brand of denial pushes the issue down the political agenda. But it is coming.\nDr Campbell outlines a future where oil goes up to 100 dollars a barrel and where the world population falls by billions to a level half what it is today in 40 years. All pretty apocalyptic stuff. Modern food production is highly dependent on oil and therefore food production and prices are highly sensitive to the cost and availabity of oil. It seems crazy that we are actually using oil to produce plastic bags and useless plastic rubbish from mainly China when oil should be used carefully and sparingly. It gives an additional push for renewable energy in a post oil world.\nToday I've been in a Council briefing on the Kirklees budget issues we face and quite rightly we are looking at how we deal with the cuts being passed down by central government and it is truly horrendous. We are as we know 'in a deficit situation' a financial deficit and the Tories (and Lib Dems) tells us we are living way beyond our needs. Whereas money is an artificial construct, oil is a very real commodity and a limited resource which we have been using at an alarming rate. We are effectively in an 'oil and gas deficit' with consequences which affect our very civilisation. We have to really understand and accept there's a problem before it can be addressed. We have a long way to go in a short time.\nWe have been here before of course back in the 70s with the OPEC crisis which prompted a flurry of concern about oil depletion and apocalpyptic films which the deniers point to as 'proof' that the peak oilers are crying 'wolf'. The other charge of course is that there is some sort of hankering to live in the past and that talk of a transition to a low oil (and carbon) economy is anti - progress. This sort of talk is just dodging the issue, the problem exists and we have to find ways of dealing with it some of this will be using technology to take us to a low carbon future and yes there will probably be some old skills that we have to employ to boost local food production. Anyway to reinforce a few prejudices about peak oilers here's 'Heavy Horses' by Jethro Tull from 1978 about a time when the 'Oil Barons have run dry' and when we will be using horses again to work the land.\nA blog by Green Party Councillor Andrew Cooper about Green Politics, action on Climate Change, Kirklees Council and our activity to improve the local and global environment (and also anything that I fancy talking about) Promoted and published by A Cooper, 76 Brockholes Lane, Holmfirth HD9 7EB\nFriday, 29 October 2010\nThursday, 21 October 2010\nLib Dems - They don't like it up em!\nSeeing a Lib Dem motion to Kirklees congratulating the Coalition Govt on it's commitment to tackling climate change was somewhat annoying having seen cut after cut in energy programmes and broken promises associated with the new feed in tariff. So the Green Party Amendment listed many of these and annoyed the Lib Dems because of the length of the amendment but then there were a lot of cuts and broken promises. They also claimed the amendment was inaccurate but never really identified exactly what was inaccurate about it. There was an inaccuracy in the amendment. It said that funding for the Green Investment Bank had been scaled down from £6Billion to £2 Billion. Following the Spending Review yesterday this figure went down to £1Billion. Our apologies!\nThe focus of the Lib Dem motion was the new right for Councils to sell renewable electricity they generate back to the grid and this is indeed welcome but there are a few 'howevers'. One particular 'however' is the fact that a promise to extend the Feed In Tariff to early adopters of renewable technologies such as pioneers like Kirklees has now been dropped by the Coalition government. This means that thousands of pounds worth of funds that could have come to Kirklees now will not. The Lib Dems called for a Green Energy Action Plan to take advantage of the Feed In Tariffs. At no point in the debate did they mention the programmes already being planned such as the £650k worth of PV for Council Buildings or the £12 million for Council buildings, probably because they've had nothing to do with it. You can imagine however that a few months down the line a Lib Dem leaflet will appear somehow linking themselves with these developments. They do have some form in this regard. They poured scorn on the Green Party amendments for a free area based solar photovoltaic programme across Kirklees saying it was 'unaffordable' and a 'fantasy'. They are clearly not following developments in the capital financing of PV projects across the country where all the capital costs and more of the projects are being met by the feed in tariff. Indeed businesses are being set up seemingly weekly offering free PV. A Council led scheme could offer value for money and spread the benefit to households beyond those which are dead on due south with large roofs.\nAnyway for your delectation here is the Lib Dem Motion and the Green Amendment. For the record the Green amendment was defeated by the Cons and Lib Dems but was supported by many Labour Cllrs. The Lib Dem motion was passed.\nLib Dem motion\nCoalition Government's Commitment to Tackling Climate Change\nThis Council congratulates the Coalition Government for their positive commitment to tackling climate change.\nCouncil welcomes the decision by the Climate Change Secretary Chris Huhne to allow local councils to sell renewable energy to the grid, overturning a ban on this activity by the previous Government.\nCouncil recognises that we have a vital role to play in the switch to a new low carbon economy. This decision will allow us to take full advantage of the feed-in tariff and deliver long term benefits to support services delivered by this council.\nThe availability of feed in tariffs will provide this council with an opportunity to generate a significant income and reduce our energy bills via increased micro generation.\nThis Council therefore calls upon the Cabinet to urgently develop a “Green Energy Action Plan” to maximise the benefits and identify potential savings that can be delivered via the use of feed-in tariffs.\nGreen Party Amendment\nDelete all after ‘This Council’ insert\n‘questions the Coalition Government’s commitment to tackling climate change based on:-\n• the breaking of a promise by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats prior to the election to include early adopters of solar panels such as Kirklees in the Feed In Tariff\n• the abolition of the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Spatial Strategy which would have provided strong policies to encourage microgeneration in new buildings.\n• the breaking of a commitment by the Liberal Democrats not to support new nuclear power stations the cost of which will now be borne by the public.\n• the end of a commitment by the previous government to insulate all lofts and cavity walls where technically possible to 2020.\n• the abolition of the Sustainable Development Commission which actually saved the Government money.\n• Cuts of £12.6m from The Carbon Trust's grant for low carbon technology and business support funding from DECC\n• Cuts of £4.7m by cancelling final rounds of Bio-Energy Capital Grants Scheme and Bio-Energy Infrastructure Scheme\n• Cuts of £3m by reducing the scope of the Offshore Wind Capital Grants Scheme\n• Cuts of £3m from closing the Low Carbon Buildings Programme early\n• £2.9m cuts by reducing the scope of the government's Low Carbon Technology Programme\n• £1m cut to funding for development of deep geothermal energy generation\n• £700,000 cut by the closing of renewable technology trials early\n• The damage caused to the solar thermal, biomass and heat pump industry by the long period of speculation over the future of the Renewable Heat Incentive\n• The damage caused to the solar PV and small wind industry by long speculation over the future of the Feed In Tariff\n• The reported reduction in the Feed In Tariff by 10%\n• The halving in funding for Carbon Capture and Storage Projects\n• The reduction in funding from the proposed £6Billion to £2 Billion for the Green Investment Bank\n• The proposed abolition of the Warm Front scheme for Low Income households\n• The 10% increase in funding for nuclear decommissioning\n• The cancelling of the Severn Barrage which could have provided 5% of the UK's electricity needs\nThis Council has the following concerns about the Coalition Government’s ‘Green Deal’\n• An over emphasis on supermarkets as the deliverer of the Green Deal when clearly Council schemes such as the free insulation provided by Kirklees Council demonstrably deliver high numbers of measures while schemes lead by supermarkets have performed poorly.\n• The reported omission of microgeneration from the Green Deal finance package\n• A loan mechanism will not be the most cost effective way of funding low cost measures such as loft and cavity wall insulation.\nThis Council calls on the Coalition Government to ensure the Green Deal\n• makes Councils a key partner and/or deliverer of the programme.\n• enables area based approaches for the delivery of insulation and microgeneration measures\n• has a cost effective way of delivering low cost measures such as insulation measures\nThis Council calls on the Cabinet to\n• develop a free area based solar photovoltaic programme to be made available to all households where technically possible and where there is no impact on Council budgets.\n• Add carbon reduction as a 5th Council Priority\n• Develop a comprehensive action plan to reduce carbon which based including energy conservation, energy efficiency, behavioral change and green energy.\nSunday, 17 October 2010\nBlooming Bonkers\nThursday this week I returned to my old sixth form Greenhead College for a Green Question Time session. No Labour or Conservative representatives were available but the 'Greenest Government Ever' was represented by Liberal Democrat Cllr Ann Denham and we had the treat of a UKIP representative in the form of Godfrey Bloom MEP. He's a fully paid up climate change denier and believes its all part of a conspiracy to make lots of money. I of course got stuck into him and defended his right to believe manmade climate chamge didn't exist, I also said I would defend his right to believe in Pixies if he so wished. All good fun but it was the students who really impressed me. After Godfrey told them not to accept anything they were told at face value they took him at his word and relentlessly challenged him on the rather dodgy 'evidence' he presented. Godfrey's the chap who has referred to Greenpeace as terrorists and defended the action of the French when they blew up the Rainbow Warrior killing one of the crew. He also has some rather 'traditional' some may say old fashioned views about the role of women. He had a young familiar in the audience who blamed Greenpeace for the deaths of thousands from malaria in Africa due to their opposition to the widespread use of DDT. You could spot him he was the only one in a suit. The Greenhead Students rounded on him too.\nGodfrey represents a constituency of opinion, not one of knowledge, not of logic, just opinion. There is a foaming mouth tendency among certain folk which is reflected by groups like the Taxpayers Alliance, the Daily Mail and of course UKIP. They recognise cost but not value, they would rather be wrong than be seen as 'politically correct' and they don't just deny climate change but change and reality in general. The problem is with people like Godfrey being simple folk is they give simplistic explanations of the world around them, that linked with his cut price Boris Johnson characteristics means that he can be a hit with a not too discriminating audience. This definitely wasn't the case at Greenhead College however.\nThursday, 14 October 2010\nThe Denby Dale Passivhaus\nHere's a film about the Denby Dale Passivhaus completed this year. I saw it during construction an at its opening and I'm incredibly impressed by the work the groundbreaking work the Green Building Company have done on this project. The estimated heating costs are around £75/year and around £100 for the hot water (though the solar thermal system may reduce that cost). It is of national significance as it uses cavity construction and so could by replicated by the building industry across the UK. The commitment to reducing energy demand through airtightness, super insulation standards and heat recovery ventilation is impressive. Great to see such an important project in the Huddersfield area.\nFriday, 8 October 2010\nFlocking to Grange Moor as the Eco Childrens Centre opens\n| Sheepswool insulation ready to be rolled out. |\n| Parish Cllr Michelle Atkinson with the wool |\nTuesday, 5 October 2010\nWho is going to clean your house George?\nThis is actually part of a confused theme running through this government of moving people on low incomes around the country. It was only a few months ago that we had Iain Duncan- Smith telling us that he wanted families in council houses in deprived areas to move to council houses in affluent areas so they could get work - see link. There were many echoes of Norman Tebbit's 'On yer bike' speech from the 80s. Of course as we know it was a non policy as there are huge waiting lists for limited numbers of council houses,(Conservative /Labour 'Right to Buy' policies) and this is more pronounced in more affluent areas. So where would these job seekers go if they want to clean George Osbourne's floor? That's right, to the private rented sector but haven't we capped the benefits making it more difficult for them to live near George. Yes we have. Of course the real answer is to put a cap on the rents not on the benefits but that would put a cap on the earnings of private landlords which may not go down too well with some Conservatives who may have interests in this area of the economy. The only crumb of comfort is the unlikely vision of George Osborne having to clean his own house.\n| A blue feather duster |\nGeorge Osborne's announcement that there is to be a new cap placed on Housing Benefit for people in areas with higher rents is going to make it less likely that we have mixed communities with a range of incomes.\nFar from being workless many households on very low incomes have family members carrying out low paid jobs such as cleaning streets, homes and offices. Of course many can, and do, contribute to the rents to the tenant of the property, usually the parents. The tenant could be retired or unable to work due to illness or disability. All this new cut will mean to the tenants or occupants of these homes is a reduction in their income and possibly further pricing them out of the communities that they may have lived in for many years.\nSunday, 3 October 2010\nThe pickled politics behind local government budget cuts\n| Jabba the Hut - Intergalactic Gangster |\n\"Instead of demanding that councils report back to me on everything they do, it means expecting that they become much more accountable to local residents instead\"\nSo lets get this right, the Coalition Government cuts funding to local authorities and then Councillors have to be accountable for the 'choices' they make. Of course there's very little choice in reality. This week has been redundancy/retirement week at Kirklees Council. The numbers of staff leaving the Council is huge, around 500 are gone with around another 1000 to go over the next few months but even this will not be enough services will have to be cut further to satisfy government demands or as Eric puts it,\n\"For the first time, councils will have real power and a real say over how money gets spent. \"\nanother particularly irritating quote,\n\"We've cut the apron strings which have tied (Councils) to Whitehall for too long, giving them freedom to act on behalf of their residents,\"\nThis is just utter tosh and a degree of spin that would make Mandelson blush (OK maybe not). People are being 'freed' of local facilities, services and income. He makes a virtue of getting rid of reporting such as that needed for the Comprehensive Performance Assessment and more reporting to citizens on how ther money is spent. OK but we do need to report on the impact on public services, the jobs lost, the impact on the wider economy, the health and social impact of cuts, the loss of public facilities. The Conservatives and their Lib Dem henchmen should not be allowed off the hook for their actions.\nThey are accountable too!\n,\nLabels:\nConservatives,\nemployment,\nKirklees,\nLib Dems,\nrecession\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",

Huge\ncuts in budgets, totalling £152million, redundancies of over a thousand already\nmade and at least the same again to come. The governance of the Council remains\nwith a minority administration in this instance the Labour Party. It was against this backdrop that I proposed\nat the last Full Council meeting an All Party Shared Adminstration with a\nCabinet composed of leading members from all political groups to work together\nto tackle the problems facing the Council. It is fair to say that it\ndidn’t go down well.\nIf you want to watch the debate starts at 2.44.50 here\nIf you want to watch the debate starts at 2.44.50 here\nCllr Nicola Turner, the new Lib Dem Leader’s line is that\nshe doesn’t have to be on the Cabinet to influence the Council. This is of\ncourse true and is true of every Councillor of every Party but it is a bogus\nargument. The Council’s power lies in the Cabinet as that is where decisions\nare made. To be part of the Cabinet\ngives real power and real responsibility just as the Lib Dems claim they have\nin Government. Maybe they are not so keen on power as they used to be.\nThe real vitriol came from the Conservatives. The\nConservatives usually deploy Cllr Andrew Palfreeman during the budget debates\nto attack the Greens and they rolled him out to address our motion. He often\nuses humour to good effect but not on this occasion. Andrew accused me of being\n‘naïve’ and claimed we had, ‘kept Labour in power’. In reality no other group put themselves\nforward to run the Council following the last local elections and Andrew was\nconveniently forgetting that the Conservatives actually put Labour in charge of\nthe Council in 2012 in return for a disproportionate number of Committee\nplaces. He’s also forgetting that the Greens have supported both Conservative\nand Lib Dem minority administrations over the past 15 years when we have felt\nthere was a benefit to Kirklees in doing so. He referred to the ‘incompetence’\nof the Labour administration which rather begged the question as to why they\ndidn’t want to be part of the administration to deal with it if he really felt their 'imcompetence' was\nsuch a problem. He went on to say that the Greens should, ‘get to the back of\nthe queue where they belong’ and that we needed to be ‘put in our place’. Well\nI guess that was exactly what I was proposing. As the smallest group on the\nCouncil we would have a proportionately smaller voice in a Cabinet formed from\nmembers of all political groups. If anything I was asking the Conservatives to\nactually ‘get in the queue’ and take some responsibility but alas to no avail. Cllr Palfreeman used a quote by George R R Martin the writer of Game of Thrones in his speech saying I was denying a 'hard truth' that the Greens had put Labour in power. Of course the most famous, and oft repeated quote from his book/hit TV series 'Game of Thrones' is ' Winter is coming' meaning there are hard times ahead. Hard times are coming for Kirklees and the Tories want no part in managing the depleted finances that their Government have given us.\nThe meeting ended in shambles. The Mayor didn’t allow me to\nsum up at the end of the meeting and no vote was taken on the motion which\nprobably suited a lot of people in the room who weren’t over keen on being\ncounted on this issue. Cock up? Conspiracy? Who can say? What the debate did\nmanage to do was to shine a spotlight on the fact that running Kirklees Council\nis not a particularly attractive prospect. In hard times the sidelines is a\nvery comfortable place for some parties to be. There are Parties who say a Green\nvote is a wasted vote. Voting for Parties who won’t take responsibility sounds\nlike a wasted vote to me.",

I couldn't stay too long unfortunately but I did make the mistake of telling Cllr Khan it was my birthday. Apparently after the video finishes they sang me a rendition of Happy Birthday. I wish I'd had time to see it. Thanks Mehboob - I think!\nWhat I think was a real game changer for this March was that it wasn't just the usual suspects in the crowd. The crowd for one thing was a lot bigger which reflects the fact that the concern is more deeply routed than those who are permanently politically aware and motivated. It also recognises the links between large scale public sector cuts and the assault on public pensions. If this is the way things are now what are they going to be like in another 12 months, 2 years or the 6 months of pain we are told we have. The government haven't a mandate for these policies and their therefore legitimacy is highly questionable. I don't think I've ever see a government in this country that is more divisive than this. Thank goodness we've got the Lib Dems using their restraining influence - Ok that was a joke!\nSunday, 20 November 2011\nGreens join with Holme Valley Independents on Local Development Framework\nThe 16200 figure presented in the Green Party/Independent amendment has a strong\nevidence base supported by economic projections, past performance on housing completions, the impact of Coalition Government policies on the construction and housing sectors and the Communities and Local Government Paper, 'Estimating Housing Need' (2010).\nCurrent economic projections for growth show 1.5% this year and 2.5% next year according to the government's own Office for Budget Responsibility. Historically these figures have been highly optimistic. This projection compares to the an annual growth rates averaging 2.68% between 1992–2007 according to the IMF. The British Chambers of Commerce Economic Forecast in March this year said:\n“Further forceful cuts in the budget deficit, the unresolved problems in the banking sector, and the financial fragility in the household sector will delay a return to pre‐crisis growth rates. Over the next 4‐5 years, growth of UK GDP is likely to average just over 2% per annum, considerably less than the 3.0% average growth recorded in the 15‐year period 1993‐2007”\nCoalition Government cuts of 60% in the Homes and Communities Agency is going to significantly reduce the levels of social housing and shared ownership housing available. The viability of younger people being able to enter the housing market will be increasingly stifled due to the impact of tuition fees which will mean that when students leave college and start receiving the sort of salaries they would need to consider the purchase of a property they will start having to repay those fees.\nWhile we recognise that there is an increasing social need for more housing, the mere projection of house building figures in the absence of interventionist social and economic policies will not create the construction of needed housing units. Rather it will give greater licence to the speculative builder of executive properties on green field sites. Without changes in government policy which will support the development of social housing, an open supply‐side private housing market cannot solve this problem, but only create distortions of excessive building on green field sites whilst leaving the overall stock of needed housing low.\nSimply making land available in its own terms will not deliver new housing so the LDF’s own targets are not realisable due to the underlying economic conditions the UK is in and the lack of policies to stimulate an economic revival and develop social housing.\nPast performance on housing completions does not support the targets given in the LDF document. The average number of completions between 2000 and 2010 was 1248 per year and even this level is skewed due to particularly high years. Expectations of mainly 1500 completions per year across the plan are clearly unattainable.\nIf our figures were to be adopted this would require no housing development on land that is currently in the greenbelt. We wish to see development in Grimescar, Honley, Meltham and Brockholes taken out of the plan. Just as the Local Development Framework has proposed to remove greenbelt status from nominated areas we would add land below Castle Hill bordered by High Lane and New Laithe Hill which is directly adjacent to greenbelt land and part of the backdrop to the historic and iconic Victoria Tower on Castle Hill.\nLike the Government asserts we also believe in Localism and support the concept of Neighbourhood Development Plans where communities establish what land they would like to see developed in their area above and beyond those targets set in the LDF. Our fear is that the Government's belief in localism is only skin deep and that the Government through the Planning Inspectorate would favour developers rather than communities.\nWe believe that where previously undeveloped land is to be developed that this should be constructed to a higher environmental standard than those proposed in building regulations in terms of energy performance and sustainable urban drainage.\nWe recognise that there is value in the juxtaposition of new design and new technology with heritage assets such as modern glass atriums on church buildings and solar panels being utilised on older properties and we would expect the LDF to include policies that support that approach.\nOverall the Kirklees Local Plan should not only consider the urban settlements on a quantitative basis, but qualitatively take into account their unique features of these different communities taking into account their urban, rural and environmental factors .

Not highly publicised they held it out of town in the Hudawi Centre this week. Just to recap Kirklees Council sells Huddersfield Sports Centre and surrounding area to Tescos for millions to allow them to build a huge store at the edge of the Town Centre to help suck more money out of the local economy. The money from Tesco's is then going to used to build a new Sports Centre on Springwood Car Park. The Planning Committee decision was highly dubious given the background and expressed reservations of Counciilors who then went on to vote for it. Barry Sheerman Huddersfield's MP (he managed to beat me in the General Election as did a couple of others) successfully called for a Public Enquiry.

To any informed outside observer this must have been nonsense. Up and down the country Councils had been pursuing schemes to install panels on their own buildings and council houses having done the maths and concluded their proposals were self financing. Possibly Winchester knew something the rest of us didn’t about the FIT cuts that were coming over the horizon.\nThe implications of the Governments rushed review of the Feed In Tariff rates for solar photovoltaics are significant and in many ways tragic. In Leeds the City Council had innovative plans to use the Feed In Tariff incomes from installations on Council houses to help finance free insulation for private homes. That great idea would now appear to be a total dead duck. In Kirklees we have/had a thousand house solar PV programme some of which are in the Newsome Ward. I’ve asked the Council’s Leader Councillor Khan and the Chief Executive to see what can be done to accelerate installations ahead of the cut. It’s going to be difficult and I anticipate a lot of weekend working to get PV systems commissioned and working ahead of the deadline.\nSo why are government making this cut? Well the first thing to say is that this is not public money we are talking about so this is not saving you and me tax. We do however all pay for the feed in tariff through a levy on our fuel bills along with a number of charges which subsidise nuclear and renewable programmes. The FIT element of this is reckoned to cost the average household around 30 pence per year or less than 1 penny/week. As the FIT is the result of public policy however it is counted in the governments Public Sector Borrowing Requirement and so Treasury has put a cap on it OR as Climate Change Minister Greg Barker refers to it ‘a budget’. Given the very low cost of the tariff the cap is obviously set very low demonstrating a very limited ambition by government for the solar sector. Government’s argument is that the capital costs for installing PV have dropped dramatically and therefore the FIT should drop. While this is true it is only half the story. Government are ignoring the fact that demand for PV has been generated by the level of FIT that has in turn helped generate the economies of scale that have enabled prices to come down. So if you reduce the FIT rate then capital costs are likely to start rising significantly. There is probably a reasoned argument for a limited FIT reduction but not one of over 50% that will put companies out of business and make thousands unemployed.\nThe cuts to the FIT rates take effect on the 12th of December yet the consultation on the review of feed in tariffs is due to close on the 23rd of December. So Merry Christmas everybody! This is just one of the reasons that solar companies are pursuing legal routes to challenge government over this abomination of a consultation. The other reason is that right now there will be many millions of pounds worth of solar panels and inverters on the high seas already bought and paid for by British companies on the understanding of a return based on current FIT rates. Some of these solar panels will have been destined for Council projects such as those planned for Kirklees, Leeds and York but NOT Hampshire.\n| Many council and free solar schemes have checked into the Sundown Motel |\nA few weeks ago, and somewhat inexplicably,Winchester City Council in Hampshire cancelled its plans to install solar panels on their municipal buildings as they said that they did not stack up financially and that the prices they got back from their tender were not what they were expecting.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2013_12_never-mind-baubles_html/content_999.html": "I've just seen 'Never mind the baubles' a documentary about the Sex Pistols last ever UK gig on Christmas Day 1977 in Huddersfield at Ivanhoes (the facade is to the rear of Lidl on Manchester Road). The gig was a benefit in aid of the hard pressed families of firemen ( they were all men then ) who had been on strike for weeks. I'd love to be able to say I was there but the truth is that I would have been half a mile up the road in Edgerton at the family home at Imperial Road being 13 and all. What I do remember about punk was that it was a part of growing up for me and others around me a few years later. I was in a band called the Criminal Minds in 1981. There was a lot of gratuitous swearing involved and we did a few gigs, a barn in Sowood, the Venn Street Arts Centre and once at our school spring to mind. All good fun and I still have a cassette of our 'music'. Punk is anti establishment and our song 'F***the Government' was.definitely on message.\nThere was a good punk scene in Huddersfield which carried on a good few years after the Pistols departed. I always remember Punk as not just anti establishment but also pro people and anti fascist. (There were exceptions such as the Neo Nazi band Screwdriver' who were offensive but they were the exception not the rule). This pro people aspect came across listening to Johnny Rotten speaking about the Huddersfield gig and their motivations for doing it. It wasn't a big prestigious gig but doing it was right for the band that was finding it difficult to get gigs due to a hysterical media and for the striking firefighters who were going through hard times. It was authentic and demonstrated the humanity of the Pistols in choosing to do this benefit gig.\nSomething I take from the punk years is a healthy disrespect for authority and institutions and a dislike of deference to people, titles and positions. Is this contradictory as I've been elected to Kirklees Council five times now? Maybe a little, but I still feel slightly uncomfortable when people address me as 'Councillor' and recognise that power and authority is something that should be used carefully and sparingly.\nGood post Andrew... thanks for blogging this\nReplyDelete",

I do find it rather bizarre then that he voted for these\npolicies as did the Liberal Democrats and the Independents.

The only\npeople I ever remember as bringing ‘party politics’ into the Parish Council\nwere in fact the Conservatives. We generally worked well together across\npolitical parties and independents.

Today was going to be a manageable 25 miles but because we had fell short yesterday we had to add another couple of miles to take us into Colne. It was a nice morning and the walk into Colne was an easy start down country roads. Psychologicaly we were in the home straight now. One more sleep before Preston New Road Fracking site near Blackpool, tomorrow was a theoretically easier 19 miles.We were well past half way. This morning it felt possible\nAs we reached Colne we were joined by Diane Green from Marsden who was to be with us for the rest of the day. Then it was a long trog towards Barrowford along the side of a busy A road. I was just glad it wasn't going to be like this all the way. Then we turned off to a deserted back road with hardly any traffic with a great view of Pendle Hill. It was eerily quiet and for no apparent reason as I was wandering along I saw a small tree done up with baubles. All quite magical really.\nIn Whalley we stopped for lunch and met up as pre-arranged with 3 Lancashire Greens who were going to be joining us for the rest of the day to Longridge and act as our native guides. As we left Whalley in the far distance a long ridge of land was pointed out to me. At the top of the ridge was the aptly named village of Longridge. It became clear that our day was going to end with a very steep climb. Oh joy! Colin was now comfortably positioned in the passenger seat of Ann's car. Comfort for Colin I guess was anything that didn't involve standing up and walking.\nAs we came to the bridge at Ribchester to pose for a photo a Police van stopped to 'have a word'. All very pleasant but I could hear over the radio someone in another vehicle or a control centre somewhere saying the words 'Fracking' and 'Green Party'. clearly we were being kept an eye on and this was not necessarily a chance encounter. I wondered whether as we got closer to the Preston New Road site tomorrow that we might have our way impeded. Still we had got a plan for that! Some more locals joined us at Ribchester for the last haul up to Longridge and it really was a haul just like the previous day. Another hill that rose for several miles. Our group was stretched out again as we each plowed on at paces we were each 'comfortable' with. In retrospect we should have stuck more together as it wasn't always clear to us all which roads we should take.\nThe light was fading as we reached the Longridge pub where we had agreed to met a great crowd of Lancashire Anti frackers and Green Party members. We sat down exhausted and were gratefully to be plied with sandwiches, chips and beer. From there we were whisked off quite a way to Burnley for a Public meeting at the Methodist Church in the Town Centre. We had a good Lancashire audience and I explained the thinking behind our walk, showed the audience the 'holy soil of Yorkshire' in my Harrogate toffee tin. I could sense other members of the Core Group had heard the same 'jokes' now for 4 nights on the trot. Well I say 'sense' they had actually told me.\nWhat was really lovely was that on our last evening all the Core Group were going to be all together. Burnley Green Party members Jai Redman and Andy Fewster had a huge Victorian house and served us a beautiful meal as we talked about the last few days and looked forward to tomorrow. They really looked after us.\nOne thing I was acutely aware of was that I was now sore, very sore! It was a great house that we were in and I was on a comfortable blow up bed on the very top floor. I made my way up the stairs gingerly and wondered about tomorrow. The idea of walking 19 miles in this sort of pain was not appealing yet it had to be done.

When I was first elected and many years afterwards I inwardly winced when Council officers referred to me as 'Councillor' and I tried to steer them in the 'Call me Andrew' direction. Now I recognise that Council Officers referring to me as 'Councillor' is a way of them emphasising their professional detachment and being clear about our respective roles which is not the same as the deference I so despise. I live with the title, I guess I've earn't it.\nThe general populace has caught up and deference to politicians is not what it was in years gone by. This has got to be a good thing. It comes as a bit of a shock after 18 or so years on the Council to find that some people regard you as part of 'the establishment'. So one Saturday night a few weeks ago I'm wandering through Huddersfield Bus Station and this drunken guy shouts across at me \"Hey! you're Andrew Cooper, my MP. I could do your job but I bet you couldn't do mine!\", It was on the tip of my tongue to come out with some witty remark referencing what I thought his job might be but I decided instead to just give him a cheery wave and say 'Bye!'. Of course, and unfortunately, I wasn't his MP and a Councillor gets about a seventh of the salary of an MP. I also guess that he only had the faintest idea of what I actually did as a Councillor (or what an MP did come to that) and that to him it would be something along the lines of just saying whatever came into my head in a meeting and who can't do that for goodness sake?\nJust as a drink or two can make people bold so can social media and I often read, whimsically, the inaccurate comments made about me, or my role, on the Huddersfield Examiner Facebook page. The latest was someone who asserted that I could claim back my energy bills in expenses from the Council ' I'm afraid not matey!' I didn't bother trying to correct him. Maybe I should have done.\nSo has the lack of deference to politicians gone too far? I don't think so and politicians can worry too much about what some guy posts (it usually is a guy) on social media about them. We've just got to a certain extent 'suck it up'. Every now and again someone will cross a line but generally we've got to live with it or take them on as you see fit. A bit of a thick skin can be helpful to people in the public eye.\nDeference and the love of positions for their own sake is not dead. For some politicians the title as opposed the role, and the deference/respect that comes with those positions, remains a prime motivator. It concerns me greatly because a desire for a position is not generally a good measure of someone's suitability for that position. If that position is achieved by patronage to secure the deference of colleagues then that concerns me even more. So though some regard me as part of 'the establishment' these days I will continue to challenge those in power and those who seek it for the wrong reasons.\nSo has the lack of deference to politicians gone too far?

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2019_09/content_2.html": "At\nlast weeks Kirklees Full Council meeting I attempted to submit a Green Party\nmotion on the £100 million of regional funding from West Yorkshire Combined\nAuthority that is being used to support the expansion of Leeds Bradford\nAirport. The Combined Authority is Labour Controlled and Kirklees Labour Leader\nShabir Pandor sits on the Authority. There is a clear conflict with the\nstatements by Leaders supposedly supporting the calls for a Climate Emergency.\nIn the meeting I requested that a Green Party motion that was the first motion on the agenda\nbe substituted for our motion on Leeds Bradford Airport that was much later on\nthe agenda. I made the point that we have declared a climate emergency and as\nsuch this was an important issue that we ought to debate and as we were simply\nsubstituting one Green motion for another there was no detriment. The Labour\nParty Councillors voted down this change in the agenda. They clearly did not\nwant to debate it. In the end no motions were debated at all as Council was guillotined at 9.00pm.\nThis has been the month when millions of children and adults\nfrom around the world have been demonstrating to show the need for urgent\naction given our deteriorating climate. Only days ago Greta Thunberg in the\nUnited Nations has berated those politicians who have failed to act in the face\nof undeniable evidence from climate scientists saying that the need for action\nis urgently required. Commendably Leeds\nCity Region has stated how it aims to be carbon neutral by 2038 however a study\nby researchers at the University of Leeds has shown that Leeds City Region Carbon Targets could be blown completely by Leeds Bradford Airports expansion\nplans.\n| My reading matter this week. |\nIn the next few weeks Kirklees Climate Emergency Working\nParty, of which I am a member, will be reporting on its recommendations for\naction by the Kirklees Labour Cabinet. We have heard a lot of evidence from\nCouncil officers and some input from relevant local businesses. I hope the\nrecommendations from the Working Party will be challenging but realistic. Of\ncourse realistic can be radical, realistic can be cutting edge and realistic\ncan be pioneering but it requires political will and being prepared to take\nrisks. Mediocrity on climate action is not acceptable and is completely\nineffective. I have been concerned to\nhear leading Labour politicians talking of being ‘realistic’ when what they really\nmean is doing the bare minimum. I feel that the voices of the Labour Old Guard\nhold sway. Those who at worst don’t really understand the threat of climate change and at best don’t\nrecognise the opportunities we have to make significant change. A change that\ncould really show the way for other\nLocal Authorities across the country. If we are led by dinosaurs we will simply go\nthe way of the dinosaurs.\nHearing the Labour Cabinet Member with responsibility for\nClimate Change speak at the Climate Strike Demonstration in St Georges Square\non Friday claiming, hopefully through ignorance, that we were the first Council\nin the country to declare a climate emergency was particularly concerning. We\nwere actually about the hundredth in the UK. We weren’t even the first in\nYorkshire. It’s not that it was Green Councillors who successfully proposed the\nfirst climate emergencies that concerns me ( in Bristol, Nationally and\nScarborough, Regionally) but that Kirklees Leaders have such a lack of self\nawareness as a Council that we don’t recognise\nthat we are no longer one of the Leading Authorities on action on Climate\nChange. There’s no shame in that if we have positive plans to improve but not\nrecognising reality is not a good place to start from.\nThere is an urgent need for politicians in Kirklees to ‘step\nup’ and provide a radical and inspiring plan showing how we can be local\nleaders on climate action and not simply take the easy path that is destined to\nachieve very little. I remain hopeful and I will do my best to advise Kirklees\non what action it should take but I believe that perhaps the most useful thing would\nbe to play Greta Thunberg’s speech to the United Nations before the next\nKirklees Full Council meeting. That should help focus Councillors minds.",

In other words, what you're advocating, is forcing officers to comply with what you believe is the majority view. That's wrong and very naive of you. You've also ignored my other points about future relationships with the NHS. Imagine having to undertake sensitive and life-changing work between the two organisations in the future after officers had been compelled to contradict the views of the NHS during the consultation.

I don't believe this is undemocratic as the views expressed in the posters would represent the settled and unanimous view of the council in a democratic vote.

It was the creator of the concept of GDP who said that\n'Distinctions should be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth' GDP takes no account of consumption of non renewable resources or degradation of the environment. So just as the road to hell is paved with good intentions so the road to catastrophic damage to our climate could be made up of an ever rising GDP. The UK Government and your Governments measure their 'success' or failure in terms of GDP which has no relation to quality of life or our environment.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2019_06_islands-at-forefront-of-energy_html/content_946.html": "I’m going to show you a model island community, with well\ninsulated homes, that are heated by renewable energy and where all the food is\nsourced locally complete with composting toilets\nThis is Skara Brae on the Island of Orkneyl in Scotland last\noccupied around 4500 years ago and by all accounts this Neolithic village must\nhave had a pretty good lifestyle with easy access to the sea for fishing, and cosy\nearth sheltered homes that probably have better thermal properties that some\nhomes that people live in in Europe today. Now I am not for a second suggesting\nthat an energy transition means going back to some mythical prehistoric golden\nage but that the same issues which islanders of millennia gone by faced are\nstill relevant to the energy transition we are seeking today, the wealth of\nnatural resources, the independence of spirit and a desire to be separate from the\nmainland make them often enthusiastic partners in renewable energy and energy\nefficiency projects.\nToday’s\nOrkney is still a leading Island in the renewable energy\nrevolution but it is\nwind turbines and wave and tidal power that are the fuel and they now produce\n120% of their electricity needs from\nthe environment around them.\nThe EU has funded the Clean Energy for Islands Initiative to\nsupport energy transition in islands and to use them as testbeds for the Clean\nEnergy Transition more generally.\nWhy islands? – Fossil fuels can be expensive to transport\nand energy connections to the mainland can also be prohibitively pricey. Using\nlocally sourced renewable energy reduces dependency on fossil fuel imports.\nIslands by their nature are close to the sea and could take advantage of wave\nand tidal power and of course wind and solar energy just like anywhere else.\nSpecialist skills in maintenance and management may not be\neasily available but large scale renewable energy installations can give new\nopportunities for locals not just in installation but also in the repairs and\nongoing maintenance that all energy systems require. So the same boats which\nmay be used for local fishing and providing support to oil platforms may be the\nsame ones that provide maintenance to offshore wind turbine installations and\neven tourist trips to see these massive wonders of engineering close up.\nClean energy transition in small/medium island is a complex\nissue due to geographical boundaries, the condition of the energy network, the\ncost of the fuels to be imported, the difficulty in reaching critical mass and\neconomies of scale.\nWe have to recognise that the size of some islands make\neconomies of scale for significant capital intensive energy generation prohibitive which is where EU funding can help\nand be deployed appropriately to pump-prime renewables that provide a sustainable\nfuture for the communities they serve\nThese factors need taking into account and we need to make\nthe most out of the strong sense of\nbelonging that can characterise many island communities so community ownership\nand community share offers for renewable energy technologies fit well with the\npsyche of islanders who have the means to participate but also offer\nopportunities for publicly owned energy generation by the Local Authorities and\nCouncils responsible for public services.\nThe quadruple helix approach is critical where public\nservices, industry, academia and crucially citizens are directly involved in\nreaching solutions that fit best with an islands approach that can be tailor\nmade to meet their energy needs that also utilises the abundant resources\naround them.\nIt is of course a good thing to help islands achieve a\ndecarbonised economy but what we learn in the process will inform how we\napproach decarbonising mainland communities more widely on the mainland as well\nbecause ultimately we all live on an island.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

This amendment aims to take Kirklees on to\nthe next stage of our journey to become a Net Zero Carbon Local Authority in line\nwith the 2038 target set for us through our membership of the Leeds City\nRegion. We also need to ensure that regional funding is not used to provide\ntacit support to Leeds Bradford Airport expansion plans that threaten the\nviability of our emission reduction targets.\nKirklees\nNew Build Passivhaus support fund\nCurrent informed estimates\nsuggest a 5% - 7% uplift in the capital\ncost for buildings built to Passivhaus standards when part of a consistent policy.\nThis fund would ensure that all projects commenced on Kirklees owned land were\nproperly resourced to achieve that higher energy efficiency standard, be they\nlead by the Council or part of a partnership arrangement using council owned\nland.\nKirklees\nGreen New Deal Demonstrator\nFollowing the Kirklees Warm Zone\nprogramme the next significant energy efficiency goal would be to carry out\nsignificant work on hard to treat properties particularly those with cavities\nthat can only be filled using polyurethane foam. There is also a need for a\nroom in the roof insulation project for homes that cannot receive mineral fibre\nwool insulation due to attic rooms. The aim would be to provide free insulation\nto 4000 properties as a showcase to other local authorities and national\ngovernment. Within this project we would also expect 25% of the funding to be\nallocated to properties in fuel poverty and that they benefit from a whole\nhouse approach aimed at achieving the ‘Enerphit’ standard.\nThis project will demonstrate to national government the\nbenefits and practicalities of applying ‘HS2’ levels of funding to domestic\nenergy efficiency to achieve our Paris Climate goals, address fuel poverty,\ncreate skilled jobs and regenerate local economies.\nKirklees\nNeighbourhood Housing Carbon Reduction Fund\nFollowing years of energy saving initiatives this Fund will\nbe used to carry out pathfinding work to demonstrate how we will drive down\nemissions still further to levels consistent with a 2030 zero carbon target.\nThe aim will be to achieve as close to the Enerphit standard as is practical.\nWe are also calling on Kirklees Neighbourhood Housing to transfer homes to a\nlow cost green energy provider when they become void.\nCommunity\nClimate Action projects – Place based working\nWe propose that the\nnext round of Place based working funding is to be allocated for community lead\nclimate action projects.

The evidence is plentiful. The debacle over the Council breaking it's promise to host the National Rugby League Museum in The George Hotel, the A629 road widening project which will see the felling of 126 trees on an iconic entrance way to Huddersfield, Labour Councillors backing the building of a modern hotel on Castle Hill, the site of an Iron Age hill fort and the Leader of the Council proclaiming he had encouraged the environmentally disastrous Amazon Warehouse development near Cleckheaton then denying later he had any view on the planning application. Leadership on Kirklees Council has been sadly lacking and the Labour Group seem unable or unwilling to address the problem.\nOn Climate Change, Labour in Kirklees are a pretty average Council but talk as if they are national leaders. They just aren't. Climate Emergency UK who independently assess councils responses to Climate Change gave Kirklees a humiliating 0% due to their lack of a Climate Action Plan to address the problem. This was confirmed this week when a report by the University of Leeds identified the lack of a Climate Action Plan. As the report is published on the Council's website and has the support of the Kirklees Climate Commission it is pretty clear it's accepted by Kirklees. The fact is that many other Councils have got Climate Action Plans and have done much more than Kirklees on Climate Change.\nThe Labour Administration of course wouldn't accept they are poor and would point to some of their activity which you will find on the Kirklees Website. One such example is the pilot project retrofitting 8 council properties on Abbey Road in Fartown. Labour Cabinet members trooped up there for a photocall with Labour Leader Keir Starmer. It looks like some good work has been carried out there but it is a one off pilot project with no plan to be replicated and no funds to do it again. In the Green Group Budget Amendment we proposed using the Energiesprong approach used by among others Nottingham City Council. With no funding coming from central Govt this offered a self funding and economically sustainable model. Labour rejected it. There are other examples 6 years on from the All Party Passivhaus report that recommended making the Passivhaus Standard the norm for Kirklees new build housing projects, Labour are finally doing a 6 house pilot project. We have no idea really what will be learned from the pilot that can't be gleaned from just asking more forward thinking Councils like Exeter City Council that started on the Passivhaus approach 15 years ago. It is another example of timidity and tokenism when we need real leadership.\nSo the possibility of a Labour Council with a majority doesn't exactly fill me with hope and joy just potential disappointment. Don't get me wrong there are plenty of good people in the Labour Party and I would much rather have a Labour Party that I could work with than what we have in Kirklees at present. So on May 5th vote Green, elect more Green Councillors and let's play our proper part in tackling climate change and the cost of living crisis.",

You can tell its election time because it is full of half truths and untruths in pursuit of votes.\nThey refer to a motion on the siting of wind turbines they put to the Council in January where they state that my colleagues Councillors Derek Hardcastle and Julie Stewart-Turner abstained on the motion.They did in fact vote for the motion. They correctly state that my other colleague Councillor Graham Simpson voted against. In the Green Group we are comfortable with people having differing views unlike the other political groups. They then go on to make great play of my non attendance during their motion. The fact is that there was a large public meeting in Newsome that evening regarding the possibility of greenfield land below Castle Hill being allocated for building under the Local Development Framework and at least one local councillor needed to attend, which I did. They went on to imply that because I work for a company that promotes energy efficiency that I have some sort of interest in the promotion of wind turbines. The company I work for does not sell or install wind turbines and never has.\nAlso in their leaflet is a very dodgy montage of a wind turbine on Ben Booth Lane near Grange Moor with the implication that the Green Party would support incorrectly sited wind turbines. What the Conservatives fail to mention in their leaflet is that Derek Hardcastle represented the views of residents opposing the siting of the wind turbine when it came to the Planning Committee earlier in the year.\nAnother misleading statement is about Councillor Derek Hardcastle’s attendance at Neighbourhood Management meetings. Leaving aside the fact that these are not actual meetings of the Council, Derek has asked if these can be moved to a time when he can attend but the 2 Conservative Councillors are quite happy with the times as they are. Much of the information from the police at these meetings is repeated, anyway, at Parish Council meetings of which Derek is a regular attender at, as he is for Area Committee, Licensing Panel, Standards Committee and Full Council meetings. There is no mention of Kirkburton Parish Council in the Conservative leaflet. Perhaps this is because of the 8 Conservative Parish Councillors elected 4 years ago only 2 remain, many of whom resigned or lost their seats due to non attendance. It is also noticeable that the Conservatives have been unable to find people to stand for them in all the Parish seats in the Kirkburton Ward unlike the Green Party.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

The direction of travel indicated, in the consultation, is for more volunteer run and assisted libraries. So this was the main area where we could get some joint action if we could agree a common approach to the Labour Party. I talked to all the other Party Leaders in the run up to the Annual Meeting but to get the Conservatives to sit down for 3 Group talks with ourselves and the Lib Dems proved very difficult and I didn't detect a lot of enthusiasm from them in any case. Labour were quite keen to talk to all the groups seperately to get the best deal they could or 'divide and rule' if you prefer. Given we weren't getting anywhere with the Conservatives both ourselves and the Lib Dems declared publicly on Monday that we would vote against Labour on the Libraries issue to try to get the Tories to declare their intentions. On Sunday Eveening Mehboob Khan indicated that if we were to vote against them leading the Council they would remove us from Chairing the Resources Scrutiny Panel this along with the fact that they had told the Lib Dems we had already made a deal with us convinced me, if it were necessary, of the character of the Labour leadership.\nOn Wednesday I went into the Annual Council Meeting not knowing which way the Conservatives were going to vote on the Leadership of the Council. In the end they abstained. If they had voted against Mehboob Khan he wouldn't have been Leader and we may then have been able to exercise some leverage on the libraries issue at the very least. So I guess the big question is why the Tories did what they did? There is the 'foaming mouth' wing of the Tories who won't talk to the Greens in a civilised way at the best of times so I can imagine Robert Light had his work cut out with those characters in any case. Then of course if Labour weren't going to vote for the Green Party and Valley Independent Group to have any Committee Chairs who were they going to support? The Tories of course. Instead of our Cllr Terry Lyons chairing the Planning and Highways Committee you have the delightful Conservative Cllr Christine Smith instead of Green Cllr Julie Stewart-Turner chairing the Resources Scrutiny Panel you have Tory Cllr Donald Firth. Loyalty to the 'strong leader' obviously brings its rewards (and punishments to those who defy him).\nSo where does this leave the new 'Strong Leader' of Kirklees, 'Mehboob the Merciless'. A bit embarrassed I think. It doesn't do his dubious 'left credentials' much good having to do a deal with the Tories who are as we know the 'bad guys'. We had quite an amusing exchange of tweets where he rather illogically accused me of wanting the Tories to run Kirklees instead of him. The only question put to us was \"do you want Mehboob Khan to be leader of the Council?\" there wasn't a mutiple choice question. If there was \"None of the above\" would probably have been my answer.",

All of the larger parties have talked about it and said what an important issue the poor state of the roads are but there has always been precious little difference in the amount of funding put into the roads. That was true before austerity hit and if more Kirklees money went into social care and good works then all well and good. Now we are up against the wall of massive cuts in local funding, the poor state of our roads is becoming ever more evident and they will get worse as each winter goes by. It is not for nothing that the Councils pothole budget has been used up well before the year end.\nIn Newsome Ward we've had similar issues and 2 local roads, Birch Road and Templar Drive,\nwhich are in a very poor condition have just been resurfaced using the 'retread' method. Under this technique the old surface is broken up and crushed, mixed with tar and a layer of gravel put over the top. This is significantly cheaper than conventional resurfacing and can last up to 10 years dependent on usage and conditions. We have had to use up the small amount of local ward funds to ensure Templar Drive was completed and we are keen to find funding for the adjacent Broadgate Crescent which is also in a poor state.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Huddersfield could certainly do with a new look and re-imagining for the rest of the 21st Century. But what about the detail? What are the things that will help make the Town Centre a destination for people both from our area and further afield? How will we attract people of all ages and interests to spend time there and also some money perhaps?\nHere's some ideas.\nPromote locally owned and managed shops as a priority - The future is local. The demise of big town centre stores, the loss of places like Marks and Spencer and BHS owes a lot to the rise of internet shopping. Town Centre retail in the future should be more about unique, quality, local products with shops and services that are owned and managed by local people and are not readily available on the internet. Quite apart from anything else this means that more money will circulate in the local economy with shops being a key part of a local supply chain. A key question Kirklees need to ask themselves again and again is \"How do our proposals help locally owned and managed businesses?\". Too much emphasis can be placed on pursuing big national anchor retailers when their precarious future is best protected by having a diverse offer which brings a variety of people into the Town Centre looking for a mix of offers.\n| A Bilbao drinking water fountain |\nMore pedestrianisation - the most successful Town and City Centres are the ones with lots of pedestrianised areas. There is always resistance to pedestrianisation from people who claim that it will diminish trade by making the town centre not car- friendly but all the evidence actually points in the other direction.\nHuddersfield Town Centre Clean Air Zone - Parts of Huddersfield Town Centre are already Air Quality Management Areas due to polluting vehicles. Leeds and Bradford have plans for Clean Air Zones where they will charge the most polluting vehicles to enter their City Centres. This will undoubtedly mean that the most polluting buses will be operating in towns like Huddersfield and the clean low emission ones will be in Leeds and Bradford. Establishing a clean air zone within Huddersfield Town Centre will send a message that this is a cleaner, safer and healthy environment for people to bring their families. It will also help accelerate the adoption of lower emission taxi vehicles and delivery vehicles coming into the Town Centre.\nMore Electric vehicle charging points - The electric car, van and truck are coming and the number of electric vehicles is growing quickly. The council needs a much greater number of electric charging points than the few that are currently planned. As electric vehicles become more common the Council could offer free parking for electric vehicles but charge for charging them up. Any new parking facilities planned like the one next to St Georges Warehouse should all have electric charging points\nChildrens Play Areas - Other than the Childrens Library\nwhat is there for kids in Huddersfield Town Centre? The Huddersfield Blueprint says it wants the town to be \"family friendly\" but no play areas in the visuals. I have seen numerous European city centres where there are lots of play areas and the places are alive and are welcoming to families. For many years Greens and particularly ex-Cllr Julie Stewart-Turner have pushed hard for more play areas in Huddersfield\n| Giant spider sculpture - Bilbao |\nEmbrace the night-time economy and make it safer for young people - Young people and students love a night out in Huddersfield with clubs and bars staying open till the early hours of the morning. Its great and it's all part of the experience of being young but we need to do much more to ensure they feel safe and better resourced policing and Kirklees licensing officers would all help.\nFree WiFi - Free Wifi in Huddersfield Town Centre would be hugely attractive and definitely make the Town a destination for many. Many coffee shops and some pubs offer it now but to make it free across the whole town centre and particularly in public spaces would be hugely attractive\n| An outdoor gym in the Civic Quarter |\nA more democratic plan - If this is a plan that is to have the 'buy in' we so desperately need for something of this importance we need a broad range of involvement in its formulation and implementation. It needs other Huddersfield voices and interests involved other than one or two Cabinet members who happen to be members of one particular political party. We need broader political representation but also more involvement from bodies like the Huddersfield Civic Society and local businesses. They need to be the driving force behind the plan, the 'Huddersfield Blueprint Board' and not just recipients of information or consultees.\nPersonally I'm more than happy to back a plan that has a clear vision for the future of Huddersfield Town Centre but it is vital that it is a Peoples Plan formed by many and not just the few.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

I wandered into the local petrol station and the woman next to me in the checkout turned to me and said 'I bet you're laughing at all this aren't you?' She was pointing at the Green Party badge on my lapel. I was a bit flummoxed. 'Well no not really' I said. I didn't get chance to talk about how fragile our whole western civilisation is and how our reliance on fossil fuels makes us less resilient to price rises and the threat of its withdrawal or rationing becomes a matter of immediate concern. Renewable energies, electric cars and public transport all come into their own at times when fossil fuels are under threat. During the last fuel crisis a number of years ago people were running out of fuel and public transport use rose with a number of people using it for the first time. The immediate crisis ended and people went back to their old routines. It reminded me of the old story of putting the frog in the boiling water where it immediately jumps out or slowly raising the temperature of the water to boiling point so the frog doesn't realise whats happening till its too late. Stick with me on this one! We have a 'boiling crisis' which we have been thrown into and people have reacted by running to the forecourts to fill up their vehicles but the real crisis is happening all the time with ever rising fuel prices eating away at peoples disposable income. Ultimately price rises will be related more and more to geology and the increasing expense of finding oil reserves will continue to work its way through to the prices on petrol pumps. This is the everyday crisis, the ever rising temperature.\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Greens would abolish league tables as they are currently devised and\nused.\n“These targets are nationally set and take no account of\nlocal issues – it is telling that many of the schools identified are in areas\nof social deprivation which have been especially badly affected by the\nGovernment’s austerity drive. Using league tables, which by default rank\nschools above or below others, is a crude mechanism for determining real\neducational needs and outcomes. It is not helpful and simply stigmatises\nschools where teachers, parents and pupils are often working incredibly hard in\nspite of frequently lacking resources or having to keep adjusting to changing\ndiktats from central Government.”\nCllr Cooper went on to say, ”This comes in the same week we\nhave heard that the Coalition’s flagship policy on free schools is running three\ntimes over budget and failing to meet need in areas with oversubscribed places.\nIt is dreadful for the Government to now compound this assault on education by\nusing a one dimensional process to assess our primary schools.”\nCllr Cooper added, “Greens want a very different approach to\neducation. We support a model where needs are determined more locally but on a\ncommunity basis rather than in the way free schools are allowed to operate, and\nin particular we want the education process to be one that is geared to\nindividual children’s needs rather than Michael Gove’s latest idea.”\nHe said that Greens support primary children starting\nacademic schooling at 6 rather than 5, which would be in line with successful\neducation systems such as those in several European countries. Prior to that,\nbuilding on the Surestart programme, a system of free nursery education should\nbe available with an emphasis on learning through play. Greens would also adopt\nthe Scandinavian model of “all through schools” where pupils would remain in\nthe same school throughout their education but the schools themselves would\nbecome more local in their nature and smaller than some of the super-sized\nestablishments found across the UK today.\n“We want schools that are linked to the local community, not\nWhitehall, and that are central to the local area and focus on the varying\nneeds of children,” said Cllr Cooper. “The Government has a two-faced approach\nof encouraging elitist free schools which drift off in their own direction but\nthen imposes a one-size-fits-all assessment which simply tarnishes the\nreputation of less well resouced schools and even their local area. “\nCllr Cooper concluded, ”Like any parent, I want my children\nto have an education that meets their needs, not some national target. Schools\nshould not be exam factories; pupils are children, not widgets.”\nENDS\nGreen Party youth and education policy: http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/ed#Youth\nLeague tables story: http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/main-topics/education/primaries-struggle-to-hit-new-tougher-standards-1-6313206\nFree schools costs: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-25304382\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

When unexpected events happen the Council together with the Emergency Services will stand ready to react and as the lights go out across Huddersfield the Civic Centre will stand as a shining beacon of hope. Council Officers will be stoically working to reestablish Western Civilization/'start again' while surrounded by confused citizens wanting answers and reassurance. We will then see what happens next after the meteor/nuclear strike on Heckmondwike or a catastrophic flood, or extraterrestrial invasion or zombie apocalypse.\nDisasters and social collapse are mostly of the serious but often mundane, day to day nature like the 'boiled frog' of climate change. The slow but perceptible nature of the change leads the wilfully uniformed/misleading to question whether it is actiually happening at all, but if we don't act it surely will.\nThe new 'resilient' Civic Centre is all about preparing for the reaction to a crisis. To prevent climate change we need to make all buildings resilient through insulation/ energy efficiency measures and making best use of onsite renewable energy (usually solar). That's not just good for the homes that have such measures but for wider society that is less reliant on dirty and generally imported fuels such such as natural gas and uranium. It puts more money in peoples pockets who have less to fork out for energy bills. This would be a good aim of public policy in so many ways but also ensures that when disaster does strike that half a million people don't turn up at Civic Centre 3 to try to get their phones and electric toothbrushes recharged.\nHere's 'Its The End of The World as we know it' by R.E.M.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

The idea of a mass campaign to get people, particularly low water users to install meters such as people living alone was well received and I'll be taking an interest in what actions may follow as a result. A low water user could save up to £200/ year so worth having. Here's the link to the relevant page of the Yorkshire Water\n://www.yorkshirewater.com/your-water-services/water-meters/water-meter-calculator.aspx\nOf course it is not just Council Tenants who could benefit but single private householders and people who actively seek to conserve water as well. To follow up installation with a water conservation campaign with advice on saving water could also help reduce risk of standpipes during times of drought and help limit the need to invest in new water capacity.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

We need to value the people who work on the ground to make our Target to Win Strategy a reality. We also need to celebrate good practice and electoral success much more in the Party to build a culture of contesting elections professionally and to' demonstrate that we can win to a wider proportion of the electorate. Andrew has organised successful election campaigns in Kirklees for over 20 years. As a Target to Win Pioneer he will be a strong and informed advocate for those needing support for their election campaigns.\nGiving a voice to the Regions\nSome good progress has been made through the appointment of Regional Campaigns Coordinators to help build the capacity and capability of the Green Party at the local and Regional level. The Party needs a perspective in the Leadership Team that can speak with experience and authority from outside London and the South East. As a Councillor From Yorkshire with 17 years experience as a Local Cllr, Andrew is ideally placed to fulfil that role.\nInvolving members\nAn active political party needs to be able to respond quickly to changing events. We should also ensure we involve our Party bodies and members in strategic decisions as much as possible. The Green Party needs to avoid situations where our position on key issues are made by pronouncement. One very practical issue Andrew would pursue if elected as Deputy Leader is to initiate a consultation with local parties on 'Progressive Alliances' asking for views and opinions to feedback to relevant Party bodies so your views are taken into account.\nWidening our reach.\nThe Green Party's support is often perceived as being white and middle class. There are some good examples around the UK where that stereotype is challenged due to dedicated work by local Parties but we need to do more. Andrew is already working closely with groups like Muslim Engagement and Development MEND to challenge Islamaphobia and the Governments ill conceived 'Prevent Strategy'. As someone who has been elected to an ethnically diverse area of Huddersfield Andrew has strong links to community organisations representing BME communities at the local and national level. We also need to show how we are relevant to the many communities who are suffering most from our deteriorating services. We need to demonstrate that Green policies provide workable solutions addressing the need for secure affordable housing, worthwhile rewarding employment and ensuring the people with the greatest needs have good support and good services.\nThe benefits of a Councillor as our Deputy Leader\nThe Leadership of the Green Party is likely to have a strong Parliamentary focus. As Deputy Leader and an experienced Local Councillor Andrew would provide knowledge of the impact of Government policy on the ground. Andrew will provide practical input based on the real life experience of implementing policy at the local level. Elected politicians bring an additional degree of credibility to our Leadership Team whether they are an MP or a Councillor.\nWorking with others to address Climate Change\nDeveloping workable plans and policies to address climate change should be a top priority for the Green Party. As Deputy Leader Andrew would forge stronger relations with NGOs and businesses that share our objectives to build our credibility and provide a robust challenge to Government and other Parliamentary parties on practical action to achieve the Paris Climate targets and beyond. Andrew has worked for over 20 years in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sector and has strong connections with key organisations.\n'Progressive Alliances'\nThe idea of a Progressive Alliances is on the Green Party's agenda as a Strategy being considered in the run up to the next General Election, whether that is in 2020 or possibly much sooner. To be successful a Progressive Alliance will need to have a popular programme that can draw support across a large proportion of the population. It will need to have more broadly based policies than being simply about achieving Electoral Reform. If it is to have wide appeal we will need to demonstrate that Green policies can provide jobs, tackle climate change address poverty and provide secure and affordable homes. Acheiving policies which reflect Green Party values will need to be a key part of any deal. Andrew is a skilled and experienced negotiator who has delivered Green policies on the ground on a Council that has been hung for 17 years.",

The service is run by volunteer drivers and stewards and was the brainchild of David Taylor a Green Party member from Linthwaite. 17 years ago Bus Services had been cut back with the removal of services on Boxing Day and New Years Day with reduced services on New Years Eve and Christmas Eve. People without a car were forced to either get an expensive taxi or stay at home if they needed to get around. Plenty of people did need to go places, shopping in the sales, going to the football, visiting family and friends in hospital or simply going to work. The service itself started as a protest, to shame the bus companies and Metro to reinstate withdrawn services but as years went by it became a commitment. The service linked Berry Brow, Newsome, Huddersfield and the hospital and was free to users with only donations being requested. An amendment to the Council budget around 8 years ago enabled the hire of buses for a range of voluntary organisations and now there are several services operating. 3 years ago Metro had a rethink and Boxing Day bus services were reinstated but unfortunately not on New Years Day so the volunteer service goes on. There are still areas not served by the Boxing Day service and this year we will be running a service linking Flockton, Grange Moor and Huddersfield for the first time with Green Party members Derek Hardcastle (pictured) and Michelle Atkinson taking the wheel.\nComplaining about services being withdrawn is important but if we have learnt anything from this it is not enough to simply protest, real empowerment comes when you take action.\nWhat a fantastic inititive and 17 years worth! Well done you all deserve a break. The bus companies should take over now and do their job!\nReplyDelete",

Kirklees was particularly hard hit but I don't want to focus on who was to blame for the lack of grit. Whichever party happened to be the administration at the time would have been faced with the same situation and had to make similar choices. My concern was how the politicians handled it and how it came across to the public. Take Mehboob Khan's appearance on Look North. It was a down the line interview from Westminister which can be tricky if you're not used to them, but the fact that the leader of the Council was in the capital while people were sliding around in Kirklees doesn't look good at all. Mehboob was very defensive, he was having to defend some pretty direct questions from Harry Gration but he could have spent more time talking about Kirklees Councils response to the problem and praising his staff (which to be fair he has done elsewhere). The real masterclass on how to do the PR properly came from Martyn Pritchard Chief Executive of West Yorkshire Ambulance Service. Martyn was interviewed in a hospital corridor, wearing an Ambulance Drivers fluorescent jacket (did he borrow it?) and was constantly praising the work his staff were doing in difficult conditions. This was in complete contrast to Cllr Ken Smith, Deputy Leader of Kirklees Councils appearance on Look North a few days later. Ken appeared to be in his living room in a nice warm arran jumber probably about to dip his hobnob in his cocoa. He was definitely in his comfort zone, finished work for the day about to toast his toes by the fire. He should have got his coat on and dragged the cameraman out into the snowy street or done his interview by the entrance to a gritting depot. Anything but sitting in his armchair as if he's about to do Jackanory.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

This could play a vital role in finding some of the additonal emissions reductions we need to make to ensure we keep global temperatures below 1.5 degrees C and maintain a reasonably stable climate.\nThere have been 2 exciting developments.\nThe first was a meeting last week of the ‘Non Party\nStakeholders’ constituency in Krakow in advance of Katovice COP24 Climate Summit in\nDecember where they produced a statement about what they want out of the COP\ntalks. Non Party Stakeholders covers global organisations representing farmers,\nwomen and gender NGOs, environmental NGOs, cities and regions, workers and\ntheir unions, as well as children and youth. The ‘Parties’ are national Governments. They have produced a joint statement\nwithin which it states\nThe\nLocal Governments and Municipal Authorities (LGMA) constituency underscores the\nneed\nfor collaboration among all levels of government and the importance of\npositioning\nintegrated,\nsustainable urban and territorial development as an important tool to accelerate\nthe\nimplementation of NDCs. We look forward to having our engagement strengthened\nthrough\nthe Paris Agreement Work Programme. In 2018, cities and regions invited national\ngovernments\nto fix and list NDCs under the Cities and Regions Talanoa Dialogues Initiative,\nalso\nthrough the formal recognition of the Locally Determined Contribution.\nThe\nLGMA is the global body representing Local Government interests. The concept of\nLocally Determined Contribution (LDCs)s to address carbon emissions is something I’ve\ndeveloped at the EU Committee of the Regions where it is now firmly adopted via\nan opinion on Climate Governance for which I was the Rapporteur. So I’ll\nbe using this to push for LDCs to be included in the UNFCCC Declaration coming\nout of COP24 to provide a defined role for Local and Regional Government\ninternationally to address the gap in the carbon savings we need to make to\nachieve a minimum of 1.5 degrees rise in global temperatures.\nThe second piece of good news is from the European Parliament where in their resolution in advance of COP24 they make the following statement last week.\nCalls on the Commission to further\nintensify its relations with local and regional authorities, to enhance\nthematic and sectoral cooperation between cities and regions both within and\noutside the EU, to develop adaptation and resilience initiatives, and to\nstrengthen sustainable development models and emission reduction plans in key\nsectors such as energy, industry, technology, agriculture and transport in both\nurban and rural areas, e.g. through twinning programmes, through the\nInternational Urban Cooperation programme, through support for platforms such\nas the Covenant of Mayors and by building new fora for exchanging best\npractice; calls on the EU and the Member States to support efforts by\nregional and local actors to introduce regionally and locally determined\ncontributions (similar to NDCs) where climate ambition can be increased through\nthis process;\nAll exciting stuff, there’s clearly a growing\nmomentum for LDCs for COP24\nFor a\nprimer on what LDCs is all about here is a link to the subject on my blog click here\nThere’s\nlots more on my blog on LDCs just click on the tabs section on the right of my page on 'Locally Determined Contributions' of course!\nHere's the COP24 Conference site in Katovice where I'll be seeking to get LDCs adopted by the UNFCCC in December.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Taxis can go in bus lanes and I remember arguing against this at the time when it came up at Council. The reasoning being that taxis aren’t mass public transport they are usually just one or two people being driven around in a car and as such should experience the full joy of being in a car on Lockwood Road, or wherever, at rush hour. Though I lost the vote on that one it did open the Pandora’s Box of what else might go in the bus lane? When I say ambulances I don’t mean emergency ambulances with blue flashing lights. There would be furore if they got a ticket while rushing someone to hospital for life saving equipment. What I’m talking about is the ambulances that regularly ferry people to and from hospital and home for medical treatment. Though many of the people using these services are not in immediate medical need they may be in some discomfort, may need toilet facilities or be held up for an appointment which may then have a knock on effect on other patients appointments. I am told that currently ambulances without flashing lights can be fined for going in bus lanes. These ambulances are effectively being used as taxis the only difference being that the passengers are not in as healthy a condition and may not be able to afford a taxi.\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2019_02/content_276.html": "| Councillors Cooper, Allison and Stewart-Turner examine the Local Plan |\nFor us as Newsome Ward Councillors we have had some real successes. The land below Castle Hill at New Laithe Hill has been added to the Green Belt protecting the aspect of Huddersfield's most iconic feature, the back gardens of householders at Taylor Hill Road that the Council had allocated for development in a draft of the Local Plan were dropped and Highfields Community Orchard, a source of some disagreement between myself and the former Council Leader Mehboob Khan, was allocated Urban Greenspace status. We have also been keen to promote development where appropriate, at the Newsome Mill site for example. There are still areas where we disagree with development both in the ward we represent and in other parts of Kirklees and the housing numbers indicated in the plan far exceed what has ever been built in past years. Government has set the rules of the game and we have to provide housing on sites we wouldn't wish to develop. So I'm sure the Tories will refer to this as Labour's Local Plan but really its Labour's Local Plan using rules provided for it by the then Lib Dem/Conservative Government.\nThis is a plan that does not really address housing need. It will not provide the secure, social rented homes so many people need. When I hear people talk about the local plan as a way of addressing homelessness or giving people on low income a home, this plan falls short. Developers make money on 3 or 4 bedroom properties for owner occupation. Developers donate millions to the Conservative Party. This plan and every other plan around the country is for developers not for the people of Kirklees and its needs.\nIn this plan we are pleased that our amendment, that ensures that any fracking company would have to demonstrate how it has net zero impact on climate change has been adopted in the plan. Now I know Councillor Donald Firth will say that you can't do Fracking in Kirklees due to the extent of the Bowland shale but there are some places (in former coal mining areas) where unconventional gas extraction such as fracking and coal bed methane extraction are still possible so we still need a policy to protect ourselves from fracking and other forms of fossil fuel extraction. We should be proud this policy has national significance and sets a useful precedent for other Councils and is consistent with our Declaration of a Climate Emergency.\nSo what to do. I'm genuinely conflicted and because we don't operate a Party Whip I'm free to be conflicted. Nethertheless its a dilemma.\nWe need a Local Plan. If we don't have one then rapacious developers will have free rein to build where they will. There will be limited protection for all green spaces without a designation like green belt\nIn many ways this is not our choice the rules of the game were set in the National Planning Policy Framework. Thanks to the Coalition Government. Thanks former Lib Dem MP Andrew Stunnell in the a Minister in DCLG. As a result many areas which should not be developed on because they are valued green space are in this plan.\nWe don't have the ability or freedom to produce a plan that we want and the Conservatives and the Lib Dems would be in exactly the same position as the Labour Party is now if they were running the Council. It is important to be honest about that.\nSo what next. Once the Plan is adopted we have the opportunity to introduce Supplementary Planning Guidance to set our own energy efficiency standards in new build properties. It should be where feasible to Passivhaus standards not simply because it will reduce carbon emissions, or even because householders will have energy bills 75% less than a standard new build but because of the high standard of building delivered through a quality assurance process. Sadly we would not be the first Council to be pushing strongly on the Passivhaus standard. We need to catch up.\nSo we have reached the end of a 10 year + epoch with the Kirklees Local Plan. I get the feeling that we are reaching the end of a number of epochs. Brexit, the Local Plan, the end of another Municipal Year. We need to recognise that things are in flux and that opportunities to shape the future are in our hands if we choose to take those opportunities.\nLets be bold, lets be positive, lets ensure that homes are built to the very best energy efficiency standards in Kirklees over the next 15 years. Let's show the rest of the country how things could be.",

When mayoral models\nhave been put before local people in referenda before they have rejected.

If it is good\nenough for London why not West Yorkshire?\nThe 3 additional constituent council members on the Mayoral\nCombined Authority appointed for political balance should be referred to as\n“Second Class Members” as their support is not required to pass the Mayor’s\nSpatial Development Strategy, the designation of land for a Mayoral Combined\nAuthority Area, the compulsory purchase of land, decisions that could incur a\nfinancial liability on a constituent council or any matter pertaining to the\nMayoral Combined Authority’s Constitution. Using the same logic the 5 members\nappointed by each constituent Council should be referred to as “Premier Class\nMembers” as their support is required to approve the above matters.\nAll Councillors need\nto be represented on the Mayoral Combined Authority\nOver 8% of elected Councillors in West Yorkshire are from\nparties other than Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats. All these\nCouncillors are members of the LGA Independent Group. Current proposals would\nmean that these Councillors and the communities they represent would have no\nrepresentation at all on the Mayoral Combined Authority. Provision should be\nmade on the board to represent all groupings represented by LGA Political\nGroups including the LGA Independent Group which consists of Independent and\nGreen Party Councillors. We propose an additional member for political balance\nto ensure Councillors who are members of the LGA Independent Group, and\ntherefore the people who vote for them, are represented.\nThe proposals for 2\nDeputy Mayors are undemocratic\nThe proposal for the Mayor to be able to simply appoint a 2\nPaid Deputies is undemocratic and will most likely be given to ‘Party worthies’\nas a form of patronage. If it follows the model of the West Yorkshire Police\nand Crime Commissioner the Deputy Mayors positions will attract an allowance of\nat least £50’000/year with no democratic mandate. The Leader of Kirklees\nCouncil has stated at a Kirklees Scrutiny meeting that a Deputy Mayor position\nwill be taken by a Leader of one of the Constituent Councils. There is no\nreference to this in the Governance Review.\nMayoral Compulsory\nPurchase and Development Area powers should need approval of a meeting of the\nconstituent Full Council\nThe Mayor will have the power to compulsory purchase land\nwithin each Combined Authority area and set up Mayoral Development areas.\nBefore any of these powers are put into effect they should require the approval\nof a vote in Full Council in the constituent Council affected.\nAs with the Compulsory Purchase powers we strongly believe\nthat proposals to establish a Mayoral Development area should also require Full\nCouncil approval.\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer transport functions and new transport related\nfunctions to a West Yorkshire Mayor and mayoral combined authority?\nDisagree\nAdditional Transport\nfunding should simply be passed down to each Constitutent Council\nGovernment should simply devolve the additional funding for\ntransport related functions to Local Authorities anyway without requiring the\nestablishment of a new undemocratic Mayoral Authority.\nTransport funding\nshould not be used to support higher carbon emissions\nThe West Yorkshire Combined Authority is currently proposing\nthe use of funding for transport functions to support the expansion of Leeds\nBradford Airport. This is inconsistent with the Zero Carbon Agenda the\nAuthority is currently signed up to. We would need a commitment from the\nMayoral Combined Authority to not fund transport projects that increase carbon\nemissions when we should be reducing them.\nThe Key Route Network proposed could involve the\nestablishment of new roads encouraging car use and destroying valued green\ncorridors. This would also be inconsistent with WYCA’s commitment to have a zero\ncarbon economy by 2038.\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer skills and employment functions to a West\nYorkshire mayoral combined authority?\nNeither agree nor\ndisagree\nThe important thing to recognise here is that this is not\nnew money and the Mayoral Combined Authority will have no control over the\namount of money invested in West Yorkshire for skills and employment functions.\nWe strongly believe that the funding that is passed down\nfrom central government should play a key role in supporting the skills needed\nfor the Zero Carbon Economy Agenda.\nQuestion 4\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer housing and planning functions to a West\nYorkshire Mayor and mayoral combined authority?\nDisagree\nPlanning decisions\nshould be taken at a local level\nWe believe that planning decisions are best taken at a local\nlevel not by a remote Mayoral Combined Authority and as such we would want any\nplanning decisions to require the support of the Planning Authority of the\nrelevant constituent Council and be put before them for debate and decision.\nThe Mayoral Combined\nAuthority should be able to suspend the ‘Right to Buy’\nOne function we would like devolved to a local level is the\npower to suspend the Right to Buy scheme. We have seen a massive reduction in\nCouncil Housing at a time of high demand for income particularly for the\nmillions left behind in the policy push over the last 40 years towards home\nownership. Not everybody can own a home and we need a secure affordable option\nfor the millions who cannot. Suspending\nor preferably abolishing the Right to Buy would boost the business case for\nCouncils wanting to build new affordable homes.\nThe power we need is\nto insist on higher energy efficiency standards for buildings\nThe Mayor will not have powers to insist on higher building\nstandards in the region such as Passivhaus for all new build. This would be\ncompatible with WYCA’s stated commitment to a Zero Carbon Economy by 2038 but\nis a power that we won’t have.\nWe need a 2030 Target\nfor the West Yorkshire Zero Carbon Economy\nWe strongly believe that the Mayoral Combined Authority\nshould set a new, more ambitious target for a Zero Carbon Economy by 2030 in\nline with report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange Repor . This would help support our argument for stronger housing and\nplanning policies either at the local or regional level.\nQuestion 5\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer Police and Crime Commissioner functions to a\nWest Yorkshire Mayor?\nStrongly oppose\nPolice and Crime\nfunctions are even more unaccountable under the Mayoral Combined Authority.\nThe abolition of the Police and Crime Commissioner role is a\npositive in that it is a role that has not excited interested the electorate\nand takes away from rather than adds to local democratic accountability of the\nPolice. The appointment of a highly paid unelected Deputy Mayor to lead on the\nPolicing function however just makes matters worse and will undoubtedly put an\nunelected politician in a role where the people scrutinising them will have a\ndemocratic mandate (albeit through FPTP) but they will not.\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer additional finance functions on a West Yorkshire\nMayor and mayoral combined authority?\nStrongly oppose\nNo taxation without\nadequate representation and scrutiny.\nOur opposition to these additional powers is due to the lack\nof a suitable democratic mandate as we have detailed in our answer to question\n1 and the lack of suitable scrutiny and powers to limit the powers of the Mayor\nby a democratically elected Assembly.\nThe power to charge a precept for policing would mean that\nthe funding gained could be the responsibility of an unelected functionary.\nQuestion 7\nAre there any\ncomments you would like to make that you do not feel you have addressed in your\nresponse?\nWhat about the\nchallenge of Climate Change?\nThe West Yorkshire Authorities Governance Review document\nhighlights the major challenges to the sub region. It includes growth,\nproductivity, diversity, innovation and trade but Climate Change is not\nidentified as a challenge bizarrely. The self-declared target of having a Zero\nCarbon Economy in just 18 years time is a significant challenge but it is\nconcerning that it has not been included here. For the record the Green Party\nbelieves that our target should be 2030 not 2038 in line with the evidence from\nclimate scientists.\nWhat about a\nresilient economy?\nAnother significant challenge highlighted by the COVID19\ncrisis is the need for a resilient economy that is less affected by global\nfactors such as international trade, the money markets and financial speculation.\nA more resilient economy would have an emphasis on local\nproduction for local need, more locally owned and managed businesses trading with\neach other ensuring money remains within the regional economy. This is not\nidentified as a significant challenge and therefore cannot be regarded as a\npriority by the Mayoral Combined Authority. This is a major weakness in the\nGovernance Review Document\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Across the member states different policies have been established to achieve these targets. In the UK much of the funding to help us reach our share of the target comes from energy companies so we all effectively pay for it through our fuel bills. Policies in the UK such as the Energy Company Obligation and the Feed In Tariff are paid for through a levy on our fuel bills. though the vast majority of rises in energy bills are nothing to do with 'green taxes'. This still doesn't stop climate change deniers and the Daily Mail (as if they were different in some way!) attributing energy bill price hikes seemingly exclusively as a result of 'green taxes'. Nethertheless it is important to ensure those on the lowest incomes are the ones who benefit most from environmental taxes to ensure fairness is a fundamental consideration when seeking to address environmental concerns. This is where the concept of a Social Energy Target came from.\nSo what is an EU Social Energy Target? The EU is currently considering the 2030 successors to the 2020 renewables, carbon and energy efficiency targets. There is now an opportunity to develop a complementary target which not only seeks to reduce fuel poverty but also encourages this aim to work in harmony with environmental targets. If this can be achieved the assertion that environmental and social targets are incompatible can be not only challenged but also demonstrably disproved.\nWhat might a target look like and how might it operate? The UK did have a target of eradicating fuel poverty completely by 2016. With rises in fuel prices, cuts in income and frankly utterly inadequate policies to address the energy efficiency of homes this is simply not going to be achieved. There is a clear need to develop a realisable plan to ensure affordable warmth and an end to fuel poverty. This may result in policies that encourage the installation of solar panels, such as the feed in tariff being directed to those on lower incomes OR incentivise government to direct more of the £1.3 billion/year Energy Company Obligation funding to be directed to people in fuel poverty.\nThe other benefits of the Social Energy Target could be less cold related illnesses, more jobs in the energy efficiency sector. This has got to be worth pursuing and progressing. I'll keep you posted!",

It coincided with the gathering of 2000ish Greens from all over the world who came together in Liverpool to meet, share ideas, successes, failures, fighting against the odds, celebrating our victories, recognising our common cause. We realised that we are not alone that we are a connected family that can draw strength from each other.\nI chaired a session on Green action against Fracking from around the world. Green MPs from Victoria in Australia and Bulgaria explained how they had successfully achieved Fracking bans in their own countries. Our own Tina Louise Rothery inspired us with her stories of the ongoing struggle against Cuadrilla at Preston New Road near Blackpool, the UK fracking frontline. The overall feeling from the panel and in the room was one of hope, optimism, positivity with the knowledge that right is on our side. The Government are backing the Corporations and the Greens are backing the community. Tina mused why we in the UK were going the wrong way on Fracking while countries all round the world are banning it. I suggested we need to frame the struggle for a UK audience and that if we were going to 'take back control' from Third Energy, Ineos, Cuadrilla et al we should probably call the campaign 'Fraxit'.\nThat was just one session there were lots more and stories of our great gains in the Netherlands while the extreme right wingers withered away, the first Green President of Austria and our new role in the Government of Sweden. The real story was that the best way to combat the negativity of right wing populism was to provide a positive, optimistic, radical and compelling vision of the future.\nI am both tired, happy and re-energised. In Liverpool I feel like we have come together from around the world with different parts of a map to a better future. We now know the way. We just have to put one foot in front of another.

It is great to know we have so much local support.\nWhether it\nis standing up against sky high rises in burial fees or standing up to those\npeople who seek to profit from the destruction of community assets such as Newsome\nBowling Green, it is Green Party Councillors who stand up for and by local\npeople.\nI have lived\nin Newsome for over 20 years & I work with a wide range of groups in the\nCommunity such as Worth Unlimited in Lowerhouses, Newsome Ward Community Forum,\nNewsome Scouts & I am also a School Governor at Hillside Primary School. In\nmy role as a local Councillor I have taken up hundreds of individual concerns\non behalf of local people.\nKirklees is\na hung Council with no Party having an overall majority. This means Green\nCouncillors can use our influence on Kirklees more effectively on behalf of\nlocal people. If Labour get a majority on the Council then local people will\nhave less leverage over decision makers on issues such as development on our\nlocal green field sites.\nOther\nparties may claim to ‘work all the year round’ but only the Green Party Team\nlocally really does, with our regular newsletters, advice surgeries & New\nYear’s Day Bus Services.\nPlease use\nyour vote to re-elect me to Kirklees Council on Thursday May 3rd.\nYours\nsincerely\nKaren\nAllison\nP.S. – It is the votes of local people that ensure we can work effectively on your behalf.

But why? Was it for the continued lack of regulation for the financial sector?, wasting billions on the Trident missile system?, the ongoing tragic farce of Iraq and Afghanistan? or even the Government's pitiful action to address climate change? No it was none of these things it was because the electorate don't 'love' him. 'Sherlock is not going to the toilet' as they say!\nIn the Huddersfield Examiner he is quoted thus,\n\"I think over the last two-and-a-half years he hasn't shown that he can engage with the electorate. I think they respect him to a large degree but they have failed to fall in love with him. You need that mixture of love and respect.\"\nIf the policies were right, if the economy wasn't in such a mess, if we weren't involved in dubious international conflicts I am sure 'the love and respect' would be easier to come by than it is for Labour. Barry is the archetypal loyalist usually. Blairite before Blair. In policy terms Gordon Brown and Tony Blair couldn't have a better ally but it seems that Labour have had a bit of a foul up in the PR department and Gordon doesn't smile convincingly enough so Barry is getting the knife out Of course in the run up to a General Election it is very convenient for Barry to distance himself from a very unpopular Prime Minister. Given his lack of policy differences with Gordon Brown it is also a wee bit cynical.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2009_10_reflections-on-together_html/content_741.html": "'Together' is Kirklees Council's free magazine that goes out to all households every couple of months or so. I was a bit surprised in the last one to see Cllr Mehboob Khan make reference to the support his administration have from the Green Party and the Lib Dems. I'm a wee bit more philosophical about who we cooperate with on the Council. If your starting point is that there isn't really a lot of political difference between any of the larger parties then your chief considerations are the personalities involved, whether or not you can trust them and what you can get out of them to help further the Green Party's objectives of protecting our local and global environment.\nOur story of cooperating with the larger parties began with the 2000 budget in the February of that year when Labour needed 2 votes to get their budget through and we had 3 Councillors. That was the year we established the Renewable Energy Fund which since it was created has levered in millions of external funding. These were the dying days of a Labour administration that had been in a majority position for many years. Relations between the Greens and Labour were not good. It was due to the three seats we took off them that they lost their majority but the deal we secured was a good one and they were keen to demonstrate they were acting in good faith. You could be certain that their word would be kept.\nFollowing the local elections in 2ooo we ended up with an all party administration with all groups represented and with the Green Party responsible for Housing Policy. It didn't last long with Labour and the Conservatives falling out with the Liberal Democrat leadership who they accused of taking credit for the things that went well and sharing the blame for what went wrong. They walked away and we stayed put in a Lib Dem/Green Shared Administration. Graham Simpson was our Cabinet Member for the first couple of years and he helped steer Kirklees Council into putting its housing into an Arms Length Management Company. I followed on from Graham and we managed to get some significant initiatives up and running such as free insulation for the over 60s, planning notice signs, support for vountary Christmas Bus services etc . As time went on it became more difficult working with the Lib Dems and they were obviously running out of steam and were cracking under the strain of relentless pressure from Labour and the Tories in Council meetings. We had also had enough and felt we were getting little real progress from working with them by this point and trust was breaking down. If they had survived the 2006 election we decided the price for staying in the shared Lib Dem administration would be high in terms of our policy demands and if they weren't met we would more than happily walk away.\nWhen the Tories came to power our approach was pretty much the same as it would have been for the Lib Dems- the conditions for our support would be pretty high. We are a party of the progressive left and the idea of the Tories running the council did not really appeal to me or our party members. We ended up asking for, among other things, a £21million free insulation scheme to make the rather underpowered Lib Dem inspired Warm Zone scheme actually work. The Tories agreed ( the reasons how and why are another story) but they were as good as their word and our proposal became the properly funded Kirklees Warm Zone. Its been a combination of annoying and amusing since then to watch every Party on the council claim it was down to them. The Tories actually turned out to be not as rabid as they were in opposition and for their first couple of years did a pretty good job before they tore themselves apart trying to make the Building Schools for the future programme build a Birkenshaw High School, against evidence from officers on the educational benefits and additional costs (again another story).\nSo we come back to where this short tale began with a Labour administration. They were however brought in essentially because the Tories had to be removed. 'Trust' was an issue for us with Labour at the start but so far so good.\nIf I've learnt anything from the last ten years it is being clear about what you want from politics and make sure your proposals are significant enough to warrant you putting your support behind whichever Party is prepared to put themselves in the Kirklees Cabinet. Not knowing what you want is fatal for politicians they lose direction, focus and become vulnerable to circumstance and crisis. I've seen a Party try to run the Council with no clear programme and you start wondering why they went to all that effort of trying to get elected in the first place.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

At the next Council meeting we will be putting a motion proposing an end to the Party Groups Hospitality Allowance. It has to be a bizarre anachronism that political parties can spend up to £2000 on booze and food for Christmas Parties usually inviting key party activists.\nWhenever I bring this up with other Party Leaders they mutter about 'posturing' or say it's a small amount compared wth the Councils overall budget. They miss the point and the principle. Why should political groups be able to buy booze on the Council Tax? I can't imagine many people supporting it particularly in the current political climate and a time we are supposed to be looking for efficiencies and putting services under increasing pressure.\nI have proposed in every Green Party budget amendment for the last few years to abolish the Hospitality Allowance. While the Greens have managed to get millions for insulation and renewable energy we have been singularly unsuccessful with our attempts to stop the Xmas Booze Tax. Perhaps in my more charitable (and naive) moments I could say it was because this particular proposal was wrapped up in a budget amendment with lots of other proposals that it made it difficult for the other Parties to support it. So now I've made it really easy for them. At the next Full Council meeting we will have a single motion on the subject. So what will happen next Wednesday? I honestly don't know!\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2017_01/content_45.html": "A couple of things recently have been driving me towards getting an M-Card for travel between Brockholes and Huddersfield. The M Card is the West Yorkshire version of London's Oyster Card and I thought it would be ideal to solve some travel problems I have.\nThe train journey from Brockholes to Huddersfield on our' heritage' Northern Rail trains is great but sometimes the ticket machines are either not working or the collector doesn't get round to you. This means queuing at Huddersfield station to get a ticket which sometimes takes longer than the journey itself. Then when you get the tickets they are just stupidly long and unwieldy. The ticket collectors hate them so do the passengers. Progress apparently.\nSo for all these reasons I thought the M Card was the solution to my problems because 'it's like a London Oyster Card' . So I've just been over to Huddersfield Bus Station to get one. The woman was very helpful and asked me if I wanted a weekly or monthly M Card. I told her I didn't travel by public transport everyday as sometimes I walk in to Huddersfield or use the car when I need it and occasionally need a ticket to be able to claim back work expenses. So the M Card unfortunately is not geared up for that like an Oyster Card is. In an average week I might use the train for two return journeys and 2 single journeys and use the car one day. If I had a weekly or monthly M Card I would end up more out of pocket than in. If I travelled by bus I would be able to one the pay as you go M Card but train travel (when it works) is cheaper and more convenient.\n| Daft new long tickets next to old usual ones |\nI'm definitely glad M Card exists and this is a real positive but I hope it can be the equivalent of the Oyster in the not too distant future.",

Also I generally don't use it as I either walk to Huddersfield or use the train or very occasionally the car if I need to go somewhere where I'd need a car or to trasport something heavier than I could carry any distance. I also use City Car Club if I need a car but my better half needs ours.\nMy advice to Cllr Blanchard would not to necessarily believe everything Cllr Khan says nor to repeat it without checking it out first. He could also have a look at Cllr Khan's car. Very nice and flashy with a personalised number plate.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

We never suggested it would be a panacea or a silver bullet but we now have from Kirklees their assessment of the proposals impact. It would save £3.6million and preserve 122 jobs. With the Council considering cuts of 1500 it is by no means a solution but it is part of the answer. It needs proper consideration and thought with sensitive discussions with unions on the preservation of jobs and services in our area.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

It had solar thermal and solar pv panels and was very much a 'one off'. It shows how far Kirklees has come that we can give tours of whole estates using solar energy and Sheffield has just one. They made the same error I made in my first solar project of putting a solar thermal panel on a small property with very limited hot water demands. I'm not having too much of a go at Sheffield though.

Our discussions today cover the Energy Union, the Paris COP21 talks & the importance of Ocean Energy lead by a Rapporteur from my own group Rhodri Glyn Thomas. This is high on our agenda because to us 'Think Global Act Local' is not simply a slogan , it reflects reality and Local Governments are in the front line when it comes to addressing and adapting to climate change.\nThe Paris COP21 talks will soon be upon us. For me I'm always pleased to see progress but the Intended National Determining Contributions from the Individual States falls well short of what is required to ensure global temperature increases remain below the critical 2 degrees Centigrade limit. We are in serious danger of coming to an agreement which risks all our futures. In the UK, in my local council, Kirklees, the 6th largest council in the UK we have had no contact from our own national Government regarding the carbon savings they submitted to the Paris COP21 talks. No request for ideas or even simply asking us what we are doing already to reduce emissions. The message is clear. For the UK at least there is a disconnect between those who make pronouncements on carbon savings and those of us in local Councils who to a large extent will have a role in delivering them.This is the UK experience and I wonder how common this experience is in other countries represented in this chamber.\nTrust is going to be key to delivering the carbon savings we have agreed, let alone the savings we really need. That brings me to the powerful but unelected, the influential but too often unaccountable. I am of course referring to corporate power, to big business, multinational corporations. We need to be able to trust that when they say they have reduced emissions that they really have. The VW emissions scandal has shown how reality can be obscured by greed. It remains however reality and affects not just our local environment but the health of our citizens particularly the frail, the very young and the elderly. There are the very real financial costs of chronic Ill health on local health services and lost work time. I'm sure the Commissioner would agree with me that when fines are levied on VW and other vehicle manufacturers that those funds should be used to repair the damage they have done by improving our air quality, investing in in local projects to reduce emissions from transport through investment in public transport, electric vehicle and cycle infrastructure. The polluter should pay but devolved administrations like our own should deliver.\nIn the Committee of the Regions we should be able to look beyond narrow national interests and those of corporate power and put the interests of the citizen and their well being first. I'm sure no one in this chamber would disagree with that! Addressing climate change is the ultimate in terms of addressing well being as it doesn't just apply to current generations but also all those to come.\nI finish with 3 asks for the Commissioner\n1. please approach all EU member states and ask them to consult all their local and devolved administrations on what we can do to help help increase the ambition of their Intended National Contributing Savings for COP21 in Paris.\n2. please work with us to ensure that any fines imposed on VW and other manufacturers are passed down to local and devolved administrations so we can repair the damage.\n3. please seriously address the trust issue with large corporations more widely.\nClimate Change is real. It cannot be hidden on a spreadsheet or disappear by falsifying an emissions test. If we cheat we only cheat ourselves but we cannot cheat nature.",

Growing Newsome!\nGrowing Newsome is very literally a grassroots organisation, or maybe more appropriately a root vegetable organisation because they aim to grow quite a lot of them this year. They are an offshoot of Newsome Ward Community Forum and over the last year they have done stacks of useful stuff including seed swapping, establishing community allotments on Occupation Road and at the Ashenhurst Allotment site, providing timely advice about planting and mutual support. Yesterday was taking on the bramble patch that time forgot in a back garden. The deal was that we help a householder bring her garden under control and use the land for growing vegetables for the community. When I arrived there were about 20 or so students from Leeds being informed about the work of Growing Newsome by Diane Sims, one of the Growing Newsome Gurus. Pretty soon some of them were helping local volunteers and getting stuck in with secateurs(spell check that one some time). Soon we were uncovering Mayan ruins and lost japaneses soldiers, actually the odd tennis ball and a kids croquet set. There is more to come on the local food front with our first tranche of the 1000 fruit tree project about to come to fruition (the puns are flowing well today!).\nSo what are the big lessons so far from this for the Council. The Council talks a lot about the need for community cohesion and rightly so, even if 'community cohesion' is not a very engaging phrase. Growing Newsome is a real catalyst for greater community cohesion. It empowers people, brings them together on positive local projects, improves the local environment, provides food for the wider community, reduces carbon emissions, reduces food miles, combats the impact of peak oil, reduces reliance on supermarkets and makes you feel really darn good and positive! Lets face it having gone through the Council's latest budget process I need a bit of positive. Lessons for Green Party Councillors? Well I think I can say we have succeeded in putting sustainable energy high up on the Council agenda, local food and supporting community projects like Growing Newsome is already our new focus. The local food agenda will literally grow and grow (puntastic!)\nFor more details of 'Growing Newsome' check out their website at:-\nhttp://growingnewsome.wordpress.com/\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Tories lack a majority of votes but get a majority of MPs |\nTo consider the following Motion in the names of Councillors\nCooper, Lee-Richards and Allison;\nThis Council notes that;\nThe electoral system used for local elections in England and\nWales, First Past the Post (FPTP), is not a fair system, because it\nmeans that votes do not have equal weight and many votes are\nwasted. This leads to voter apathy and a feeling of disconnection\nfrom local democracy. Certain parties are over-represented, the most\nextreme example in May 2019 being Havant, where the Conservative\nParty\ntook all of the seats up for election on Havant Council with\njust 43.9% of the vote.\nThe alternative to FPTP is a system of proportional\nrepresentation (PR), where votes cast for parties translates more or less\ndirectly into seats won. There are many variants of PR. The Single Transferable Vote system (STV) variant of PR is already in\nuse for local elections in Scotland and Northern Ireland. With this\nsystem, voters rank candidates and those who receive the most\nbacking\n(including second and subsequent choices) are elected to\nserve in multi-member wards.\nKirklees Council (in common with most other Metropolitan councils) already has multi-member wards and thus the transfer to a similar system would be easier than if the wards were single-member.\nThe introduction of PR for local elections in Scotland has\nled to an increase in turnout, which was 47% at the last elections,\nheld in 2017. In contrast turnout in Kirklees in 2019 was 33%.\nA move to a system of PR for local elections would\nnecessitate moving to all-out elections every four years, rather than\nthe current one-third system. This would benefit the council and\nKirklees residents too, since it would mean more time for\ndecision-making.\nThis Council believes that a move to the use of proportional representation for local elections would boost turn-out,\nmake the council more representative of the political make-up of its\nresidents,\nand improve the quality of its decision-making, thereby\nbenefiting all Kirklees residents.\nThis Council resolves to;\n- write to the Minister responsible for Housing, Communities and Local Government requesting that Kirklees be allowed to pilot a system of Proportional Representation on the\nScottish model at the earliest possible election\n- signal our interest to be a pilot area for Proportional Representation to the Electoral Commission\n- work through the Local Government Association to promote Proportional Representation more widely in English and Welsh Local Authorities.",

Sometimes it's inconvenient but we work our way around generally. I've been needing an incentive to get fitter for some time now, delivering 1000s of leaflets helps but I clearly need to do more. When my employer tadea decided to have a 4 day charity bike ride on the 'coast to coast' route to support the Great North Air Ambulance that was the trigger I needed to get the bike out of the cellar after a good number of years. I've dropped it off at Wheelspin at Lockwood for a service. I'm already getting more acutely aware of potholes on the road and concern about colliding with cars is ever present. I have got a long way to go however to match the tremendous cycling achievements of our Mayor Councillor Martyn Bolt (not that I'm trying to as I would fail!) . Martyn Bolt who will be cycling 1400km between London and Edinburgh. He starts on July 28th. Support him! Please support my charity bike ride as well though at 140miles over 4 days its just over a tenth Martyn's goal but it'll be tough enough for me I assure you!\nA blog by Green Party Councillor Andrew Cooper about Green Politics, action on Climate Change, Kirklees Council and our activity to improve the local and global environment (and also anything that I fancy talking about) Promoted and published by A Cooper, 76 Brockholes Lane, Holmfirth HD9 7EB\nFriday, 19 July 2013\nSaturday, 13 July 2013\nWater way of saving money\nPeople on benefits and other low incomes are now finding things even tighter with the crackdown on disability benefits, the bedroom tax and the upcoming Universal Credit. It's a war on the poor which will transfer some national debt onto personal debt as millions of rent arrears accrue on he rent accounts of people who demonstrably can't afford to pay. We've got to find new ways to help people to get by in ever more difficult times.\nIn conversation with Kirklees Neighbourhood Housing officers last week it occurred to me that many single householders will still be paying water rates in the conventional way when transferring to a water meter could save them hundreds each year and even possibly make up a significant part of the income gap left by the Bedroom Tax. The idea of a mass campaign to get people, particularly low water users to install meters such as people living alone was well received and I'll be taking an interest in what actions may follow as a result. A low water user could save up to £200/ year so worth having. Here's the link to the relevant page of the Yorkshire Water\n://www.yorkshirewater.com/your-water-services/water-meters/water-meter-calculator.aspx\nOf course it is not just Council Tenants who could benefit but single private householders and people who actively seek to conserve water as well. To follow up installation with a water conservation campaign with advice on saving water could also help reduce risk of standpipes during times of drought and help limit the need to invest in new water capacity.\nFriday, 5 July 2013\nNewsome Money Management Day - Wednesday 10th July\nBanks get a bad press, due to certain events in recent history, but then there's the people who work at your local banks (whichever they may be) who like many people just want to help and get a buzz out of doing so. The Huddersfield branch of the Halfax Bank are making their Branch Manager Jonathan Wales available for a morning at Hillside Primary School and Newsome Methodist Church to offer free impartial advice to local people whatever their circumstances and whoever they bank with. This is all part of their support for 'Business in the Community'. It may be difficult to get bankers out from behind their desks but if you take the banker with their desks out to where people are then they may feel more comfortable about asking for help and advice. So to promote this event myself and Jonathan went up to Castle Hill to take this picture for the local paper. Jonathan will be at Hillside Primary School on Wednesday 10th July from 9.00 till 10.30 and Newsome South Methodist Church from 10.45 till Midday. Come along he might be able to save you a few quid. A few years ago I went to my bank and got some good advice and got my money under control so maybe you could too.\nWednesday, 3 July 2013\nPRESS RELEASE - Green Party selects strong team for 2014 Euro Elections in Yorkshire and the Humber\n| From Right to Left - Councillor Andrew Cooper (Lead Candidate), Shan Oakes, Dr Vicky Dunn, Denise Craghill, Martin Hemingway and Councillor Kevin Warnes |\nThe Green Party has completed its selection of\nthe 6 Candidates to go on the ballot paper for next May's European elections.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper who is the Lead Candidate on the Greens European List\nsaid,\n\"We have a strong and experienced team,\nwith 2 Councillors, a former senior Local Authority Officer, an experienced\nfundraiser with a degree in European studies, a Teacher and former Leeds\nCouncillor and the ManA ger of an Environmental Charity. It is encouraging to\nhave such a committed team from right across the Yorkshire and Humber region.\nWhat is particularly pleasing is that we have 3 men and 3 women represented on\nour list.\"\nIn the last European Elections the Green Party\nwere just 1.3% short of electing their first MEP losing out narrowly to he BNP\nwho took the 6th seat.\n\"A lot has changed since 2009 which should\nwork in the Green Party's favour\" said Councillor Cooper,\n\"the BNP as an electoral force has\ncollapsed and there is increasing cynicism about the 3 larger Westminster\nparties particularly the Liberal Democrats. Though UKIP has grown in support\nthis will mainly be to the detriment of the Conservatives. UKIP are also not as\nstrong in the North of England as the South and in Yorkshire and Humber they\nhave only a couple of Councillors in North Yorkshire while the Greens have\nelected Councillors in Kirklees, Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield, York and\nScarborough. As the European Elections are run on a list system this gives the\nGreen Party a much better chance than a traditional 'First Past The Post'\nelection\".\n\"If elected I want to use the position of\nMEP as more than simply a one\noff protest against the old Westminister parties. I am keen to use this\nposition to draw in more resources from the European Union to create worthwhile\nskilled jobs in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sector to give young\npeople in particular a career they can build a life upon. In this way we can\nimprove the insulation and heating standards of thousands of homes in our\nregion. This will not just save people money but give them more to spend in the\nlocal economy and less to BIG energy companies. Our region is home to many manufacturing and export jobs. We have the significant ports of Hull, Grimsby and Immingham which depend on European trade. Greens believe passionately in supporting sustainable local economies but some trade will always move internationally. It is scandalous that the UK Government has recently diverted\nfunding of over £200 Million of European funding away from the Yorkshire and\nHumber region to spend elsewhere. This come on to top of other funding cuts to\nLocal Government. This is no way to rebuild an economy \".\nENDS\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper – Annual Report - 2012-13\nAt the beginning of each Municipal Year Kirklees Councillors produce a report to go onto the Council website with highlights of their previous year. Here's mine.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper – Annual Report - 2012-13\nAnother busy year in my role as a local Councillor. What has\ndominated Kirklees is the impact of the draconian and disproportionate cuts being\nimposed on us by central government. There are no easy answers to dealing with\nthese cuts without some serious impacts on local jobs and services.\nI was again a volunteer driver on the Green Party’s Boxing\nDay Bus Service now in its 21st year. Thanks to Mr Andy Storey who\nalso drove the minibus and Karen Allison who stewarded and helped put up the\ntimetables on bus stops and also helped deliver thousands of bus timetables to\nlocal residents.\nWe have had another big push on the local clean ups of grot\nspots and this year have removed 3 skiploads of rubbish all with voluntary\neffort. We are also involving community payback in clean ups of some areas\nwhich is a positive thing.\nI muck in and help with the community lead Growing Newsome\nevents. I’m really impressed with the commitment of volunteers who obviously\nget a real buzz out of working together growing their own food and making new\nfriends. The Potato Day and Seed Swaps were well attended with hundreds of\npeople getting involved.\nI have been a regular attender and contributor to Newsome\nWard Community Forum which continues to go from strength to strength with well\nattended, informative and happy meetings.\nCasework is the principal role for any busy Councillor and\nthough I am not able to solve every persons problem it is often the fact that\npeople have had their best shot at resolving an issue with their Councillors\nsupport which matters most to people.\nI continue to enjoy Planning Committee meetings and have\nplayed a full part in the meetings and attended the site visits to enable me to\nmake informed views on the decisions we take.\nIn Armitage Bridge we have been able to help community\nefforts to build a flood barrier with funding from the Area Committee. This was\nan initiative that came out of the community which I am really pleased we have\nbeen able to contribute to.\nIn Springwood the traffic calming finally went in which was\na relief after many years of trying to get this project off the ground.\nSorting out the parking issues on Dawson Road in Newsome was\nparticularly satisfying with new parking bays on what was a constricted\ncul-de-sac. This issue had been hanging around for years and we needed to get 3\npots of funding together to get it sorted out. Thanks to Julie Stewart-Turner for\nher help with that.\nI was re-elected in 2012 for the 4th time and I\nam grateful to the electorate of the Newsome Ward for their continuing support\nfor me and my colleagues. Elections are of course necessary and important for\nlocal democracy but can be unnerving when you have particularly well funded\nopponents. So when you’re talking to someone on the doorstep and they give you\na pat on the arm saying ‘You’ll be alright lad’ it’s very reassuring. Our\nshare of the vote went up in the election and given the nature of the campaign\nagainst us this was particularly satisfying.\nI am fortunate to be part of a good team in Newsome and\nKirkburton Wards and my thanks as always goes to my colleagues in the Green\nParty team.\nI continue to blog regularly on www.greeningkirklees.blogspot.com\nand tweet at @clrandrewcooper where I now have over 1200 followers\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2019_09_climate-emergency-will-kirklees-take-it_html/content_76.html": "At\nlast weeks Kirklees Full Council meeting I attempted to submit a Green Party\nmotion on the £100 million of regional funding from West Yorkshire Combined\nAuthority that is being used to support the expansion of Leeds Bradford\nAirport. The Combined Authority is Labour Controlled and Kirklees Labour Leader\nShabir Pandor sits on the Authority. There is a clear conflict with the\nstatements by Leaders supposedly supporting the calls for a Climate Emergency.\nIn the meeting I requested that a Green Party motion that was the first motion on the agenda\nbe substituted for our motion on Leeds Bradford Airport that was much later on\nthe agenda. I made the point that we have declared a climate emergency and as\nsuch this was an important issue that we ought to debate and as we were simply\nsubstituting one Green motion for another there was no detriment. The Labour\nParty Councillors voted down this change in the agenda. They clearly did not\nwant to debate it. In the end no motions were debated at all as Council was guillotined at 9.00pm.\nThis has been the month when millions of children and adults\nfrom around the world have been demonstrating to show the need for urgent\naction given our deteriorating climate. Only days ago Greta Thunberg in the\nUnited Nations has berated those politicians who have failed to act in the face\nof undeniable evidence from climate scientists saying that the need for action\nis urgently required. Commendably Leeds\nCity Region has stated how it aims to be carbon neutral by 2038 however a study\nby researchers at the University of Leeds has shown that Leeds City Region Carbon Targets could be blown completely by Leeds Bradford Airports expansion\nplans.\n| My reading matter this week. |\nIn the next few weeks Kirklees Climate Emergency Working\nParty, of which I am a member, will be reporting on its recommendations for\naction by the Kirklees Labour Cabinet. We have heard a lot of evidence from\nCouncil officers and some input from relevant local businesses. I hope the\nrecommendations from the Working Party will be challenging but realistic. Of\ncourse realistic can be radical, realistic can be cutting edge and realistic\ncan be pioneering but it requires political will and being prepared to take\nrisks. Mediocrity on climate action is not acceptable and is completely\nineffective. I have been concerned to\nhear leading Labour politicians talking of being ‘realistic’ when what they really\nmean is doing the bare minimum. I feel that the voices of the Labour Old Guard\nhold sway. Those who at worst don’t really understand the threat of climate change and at best don’t\nrecognise the opportunities we have to make significant change. A change that\ncould really show the way for other\nLocal Authorities across the country. If we are led by dinosaurs we will simply go\nthe way of the dinosaurs.\nHearing the Labour Cabinet Member with responsibility for\nClimate Change speak at the Climate Strike Demonstration in St Georges Square\non Friday claiming, hopefully through ignorance, that we were the first Council\nin the country to declare a climate emergency was particularly concerning. We\nwere actually about the hundredth in the UK. We weren’t even the first in\nYorkshire. It’s not that it was Green Councillors who successfully proposed the\nfirst climate emergencies that concerns me ( in Bristol, Nationally and\nScarborough, Regionally) but that Kirklees Leaders have such a lack of self\nawareness as a Council that we don’t recognise\nthat we are no longer one of the Leading Authorities on action on Climate\nChange. There’s no shame in that if we have positive plans to improve but not\nrecognising reality is not a good place to start from.\nThere is an urgent need for politicians in Kirklees to ‘step\nup’ and provide a radical and inspiring plan showing how we can be local\nleaders on climate action and not simply take the easy path that is destined to\nachieve very little. I remain hopeful and I will do my best to advise Kirklees\non what action it should take but I believe that perhaps the most useful thing would\nbe to play Greta Thunberg’s speech to the United Nations before the next\nKirklees Full Council meeting. That should help focus Councillors minds.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

What really made the scheme fly was the Green Party amendment to the 2007 Council Budget that made the scheme free for all applicants. This is what we should be doing with this scheme.”\n“With the cost of capital borrowing so low at present the Council can use its financial leverage to top up the Government proposal ensuring people don’t have to dip into their pockets during a time of recession and job losses. Really the Government should make the scheme free but in the absence of that Councils like Kirklees and across the Country could fill the gap and make the difference. Existing funding via Regional Sources such as the West Yorkshire Combined Authority could also play a big role in financing such a scheme ”\n“For householders the hundreds they will save oon their energy bills means more money in their pockets at a time of huge financial uncertainty. The impact on reducing our carbon emissions will also be significant,”\n“The involvement of local councils in the scheme will help with local promotion and also provide local accountability helping ensure quality of work”\n“ This level of funding could allow us to carry out insulation work on hard to treat cavity walls, provide external wall insulation, attic room and under floor insulation. It is a huge opportunity if done properly wih a focus on quality work.”\n“ Kirklees has the opportunity once again to be a national Leader in action on Climate Change and show through example what can be achieved with imagination and political commitment. If other Councils follow our lead we could make the scheme free for millions across the UK. “",

There are also a number of well documented instances of water courses being polluted. The process uses millions of gallons of water and toxic chemicals.\nGovernment has backed environmentally damaging shale gas\nextraction just as it has scaled back support for people to insulate their\nhomes through the Energy Company Obligation.\nWhat the government really needs to do is properly invest in\nenergy efficiency measures for households so they can permanently reduce their\nenergy needs. The Coalitions Green Deal is a dismal failure and they have\ndrastically cut the Energy Company Obligation to improve the insulation of\nhomes. Government clearly has no interest in helping householders control their\nenergy demand they simply want to\nIt is significant that there is no claim by the PM any more that\nfracked gas will reduce fuel bills for householders and it is clear that it\nwill have no benefit for those households in fuel poverty.\nIt is also significant that this policy is not being applied to\nrenewable energy installations demonstrating the governments growing lack of\ncommitment to the green economic sector.\nThe Government supposedly believes in ‘localism’ and allowing\nCouncils to make their own decisions. When Council funding is drastically cut\nby central government and they are then offered money to accept fracking on\ntheir land it is clearly nothing less than ‘bribery’. Councils should simply\nhave access to 100% of the business rates collected in their area with no\ncoercion from central government on how they spend it.\nWe are likely to see huge local opposition to fracking , and the\nGovernment knows it.

Hundreds of thousands of jobs are under threat. It will be the next dip in the recession within 12 months. If the choice is cut jobs or cut hours my vote goes for hours. To have potentially thousands of breadwinners becoming unemployed is unacceptable. The question for Kirklees Councillors will they take the 'we are a service not an employer approach' (yes someone has said that) and put thousands of families on the dole OR can we find another way. A 35 hour week would save the Council millions yet preserve jobs. It would also drive efficiencies in the way Kirklees operates.\nIs it possible, politically, to acheive a 35 hour week? We'll see.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2021_07/content_25.html": "The unholy seemingly transactional relationship between the big house builders (donors) and the Conservative Party (recipient) does not serve us well in this country.\nPlanning laws are weakened to make it much easier for developers and therefore harder on our local environment, Building Control is not a public sector function but one developers buy in themselves. So they pay someone to tell them if they have built to a high standard. or not. We also have the issue of the 'performance gap' where the expected energy efficiency standards of new build homes rarely match what is expected under building regulations. The Grenfell Enquiry has uncovered all sorts of weaknesses in the building sector not least of which the developers responsible for poor construction simply winding themselves up leaving no one legally liable for their actions. We are not well served.\nKirklees, like all local councils, has limited powers to tackle these issues. We can ask for higher energy efficiency standards but developers have the right to challenge this request to government on financial viability grounds. However dubious and questionable their case is they are likely to come out on top.\nI was pleased when I was asked by the Labour Administration to provide input into the new 'Climate Change: Guidance Note for Planning Applications (June 2021)' a document which provides local guidance to developers and also a questionnaire to complete. One suggestion I made, which was, accepted was to put a sentence in explaining that the Kirklees Planning guidance was in accordance with the direction of travel indicated by Government,\n\"The UK Government has announced that it will be seeking to cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035 so this guidance is in accordance with the direction of travel indicated at a national level\".\nIf the Government is true to its word (yes I know!) then we should expect developers to have to achieve higher energy efficiency standards in their developments. No harm pointing this out to them.\nAnother proposal I made was about ensuring that if Solar PV and solar Thermal systems are installed that people could see when they are generating heat or electricity so they could make best use of the energy generated by installing,\n\"a visual display showing when hot water and electricity is being produced should be provided in a convenient part of the house, such as the kitchen, to encourage householders to make use of the free energy in the home when it is available.\"\nA key part of the proposals was for all developers to be required to complete a climate change statement in the original document it asked the question,\n\"What measures have been/will be taken to reduce the energy demand associated with your proposed development?\"\nmy addition were the words,\n\"beyond the minimum required in Building Regulations\"\nI could have imagined developers simply cutting and pasting from Part L of the Building Regulations as relates to energy efficiency saying,\n\"We have complied with Part L of the Building Regulations\"\nIf they have done the bare minimum I wanted them to say so. I wanted them to say that they don't care about climate change or conversely that they do and that they have gone above and beyond our the rather meagre Government requirements on Building Regulations.\nRecognition and praise are motivators, but failing that, so is shame, for taking no heed of our obligations to the environment. Here's a great parody of the Cersei's Walk of shame to illustrate the point.\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VXFQor_3hEA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

Limiting the amount of meat we eat has to be a good thing for all sorts of reasons and the Meat Free Mondays campaign is a start.

Very few people seem to be prepared to face up to this, and gradually change our farming to NON chemical dependency and LOW animal foods This is the MOST inconvenient truth that most people are afraid to talk about. Animal farming is , after transport, the largest producer of global warming gases, and the wastage in land, food and water is unbelievably high, But FEW, except vegetarians & vegans are prepared to even CONSIDER that diets have to change to a VERY low animal intake. We have to grow food for humans not cattle and birds. there will be no other way to feed the world. Organic farming will be a necessity, not a high priced way of living for the better off.<br />Apart from the fact you more or less passed this by, your blog is GREATPhilcovershttps://www.blogger.com/profile/07042915999519092870noreply@blogger.com",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2012_06_green-travels-on-plane-shock_html/content_12.html": "I love flying on\nplanes. It’s the whole thing. The airport and anticipation of the flight, the\nflight itself and the feeling when you realise you have left the ground somehow\ndefeating (if not exactly defying) gravity and coming into land at somewhere\nstrange and exotic. Part of this fascination I’m sure comes from the fact that\nI travel on a plane once in a blue moon and then it is related to work. So for the first time in 5 years I hurtled into the wild blue yonder from Manchester Airport on my way to a\nseminar in Dusseldorf for UK Trade and Industry. As a kid I was an avid watcher\nof all the Gerry Anderson stuff, Thunderbirds, Space 1999 all that sort of\nthing so all the hardware, the planes, the technology hits all those futuristic\nbuttons that I like. Funnily enough my (would have been)\nFather in Law, who is sadly no longer with us, worked with Gerry Anderson as a\ncameraman on UFO and Captain Scarlet. He told me, in what was sadly our only\nconversation, about his bemusement at all the strange Sci-Fi geeks who used to\ngo through the bins at Century 21 studios in the 70s looking for cast off\nmodels of spacecraft. “Did they get anything good?” I remember asking\nenthusiastically and rather giving the game away regarding my own geekiness.\nThe environmental\nimpact of air travel is now well known and completely disastrous as far as\ncarbon emissions are concerned. I don’t believe air travel should be completely\nbanned but it should have to play its part in reducing global carbon emissions\nand not be allowed to expand unchecked. Of course I checked out the rail\nalternative to Dusseldorf and it added another couple of days onto the travel\narrangements and so I had to give it a miss. If it was a regular thing I’d\nprobably work it into my work schedule.\nManchester Airport seemed\nkeen to display its environmental credentials. Top of the range hybrid diesel\nbuses to transport you to and from the car parks (I got the train there), interactive environmental\ndisplays greet you on arrival from the train station and there are prominent\nrecycling points and information. This is of course just scratching the surface\nof the environmental impact of air travel and flights can quickly negate a lot\nof positive work done to reduce carbon emissions through conservation and use\nof renewable energy. This is why we have\ncharacters like Richard Branson trying to find ‘techno fixes’ such as bio fuels\nto power his planes. These are very\nunlikely to be a realistic resource given the many pulls there will be on truly\nsustainable biofuels for road transport etc. Though I don’t share completely\nthe line of the ‘no bio-fuels at all’ lobby I think it would be wrong to plough\non with biofuel production without any fundamental changes in the amount of air\ntravel we need. It is not a form of ‘growth’ that can go into the stratosphere\nforever.\nHere's the first ever episode of UFO. Produced in 1970 set in the far off time of 1980 when we would all be wearing silver suits and living on the moon. Mike Rainer my wife's late father is credited on later episodes.\nGood blog, but where did you get that film of me at work?\nReplyDeleteAh you were interceptor pilot number 2 I guess.\nReplyDeleteOn a far more serious note, I believe Ed Bishop was a Green Party supporter. No one's puppet!\nReplyDeleteWell I never. I've just checked out his Daily Telegraph Obituary you are right and he was also the voice of Captain Blue in Captain Scarlet\nReplyDeletehttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1491788/Ed-Bishop.html\nGreen travels is a perfect way of recreation and improve your health both physical and mental. Moreover, it helps to discover traditions of other peoples. Green travel to Ukraine is an outstanding opportunity to discover Slavic soul and nature of Eastern Europe. Just see these green travel destinations. I bet you will be happy in case you decide to have a Ukraine vacation.\nReplyDelete",

Tories lack a majority of votes but get a majority of MPs |\nTo consider the following Motion in the names of Councillors\nCooper, Lee-Richards and Allison;\nThis Council notes that;\nThe electoral system used for local elections in England and\nWales, First Past the Post (FPTP), is not a fair system, because it\nmeans that votes do not have equal weight and many votes are\nwasted. This leads to voter apathy and a feeling of disconnection\nfrom local democracy. Certain parties are over-represented, the most\nextreme example in May 2019 being Havant, where the Conservative\nParty\ntook all of the seats up for election on Havant Council with\njust 43.9% of the vote.\nThe alternative to FPTP is a system of proportional\nrepresentation (PR), where votes cast for parties translates more or less\ndirectly into seats won. There are many variants of PR. The Single Transferable Vote system (STV) variant of PR is already in\nuse for local elections in Scotland and Northern Ireland. With this\nsystem, voters rank candidates and those who receive the most\nbacking\n(including second and subsequent choices) are elected to\nserve in multi-member wards.\nKirklees Council (in common with most other Metropolitan councils) already has multi-member wards and thus the transfer to a similar system would be easier than if the wards were single-member.\nThe introduction of PR for local elections in Scotland has\nled to an increase in turnout, which was 47% at the last elections,\nheld in 2017. In contrast turnout in Kirklees in 2019 was 33%.\nA move to a system of PR for local elections would\nnecessitate moving to all-out elections every four years, rather than\nthe current one-third system. This would benefit the council and\nKirklees residents too, since it would mean more time for\ndecision-making.\nThis Council believes that a move to the use of proportional representation for local elections would boost turn-out,\nmake the council more representative of the political make-up of its\nresidents,\nand improve the quality of its decision-making, thereby\nbenefiting all Kirklees residents.\nThis Council resolves to;\n- write to the Minister responsible for Housing, Communities and Local Government requesting that Kirklees be allowed to pilot a system of Proportional Representation on the\nScottish model at the earliest possible election\n- signal our interest to be a pilot area for Proportional Representation to the Electoral Commission\n- work through the Local Government Association to promote Proportional Representation more widely in English and Welsh Local Authorities.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2011_05_independents-on-council_html/content_612.html": "|\n| Should read 'Independents' |\nWe've had a number of Independents on Kirklees Council over the years. The first I remember were discontented members of the larger parties who either left or were ejected from the parties they were originally elected for. Rarely if ever were they ever re-elected with the 'Independent' badge. So when Terry Lyons got elected for Holme Valley North (my local Councillor) he was a fair bit of a rarity and it was down to good old fashioned graft and getting round meeting the people. So plenty of respect there for that. He's had a few fellow travellers with the Independent tag over the years. Jackie Grunsell was elected as a 'Save NHS Huddersfield' Candidate and rode the wave of discontent over maternity services being moved to Halifax. She was heavily plugged by the Huddersfield Examiner which gave a considerable boost to her campaign. Jackie was part of the Socialist Party/Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition/Trade Unionists against the cuts, so when her and Terry formed a group it did appear to be a marraige of convenience rather than a meeting of minds. Without a media backed campaign Jackie was always going to struggle and failed to be re-elected. Khizar Iqbal a Conservative Councillor fell out with his group following the selection of a posh barrister Tory for the Dewsbury Parliamentary Constituency rather than himself. He sat as an Independent for a while but didn't form a group with Terry and is now back in the Tory fold ( poor chap!). This May the second Independent Councillor was elected to Holme Valley North Edgar Holroyd -Doveton beating the Liberal Democrats. They sought to 'out' him as a 'socialist' (never been a scary word for me) but Edgar's campaign was built on the same lines as Terry's with his support and the necessary graft. So now as a group the Independent Two seem much more coherent than they have in the past. Kirklees hasn't quite got the idea that they are a group yet and Terry wasn't invited to join the Mayoral Party with other Party leaders at the Mayor making but I guess they'll catch up pretty soon.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

The claim made by the leaseholder of the former Newsome Working Mens Club (now The Newsome Tap) to the Bowling Green is highly suspect. The fact that his solicitor refuses to engage with the substantial arguments placed by the Newsome Community Sports and Bowling Club on their claim to the land lends strong credence to the legitimacy of their claim. The regaining of access by Newsome Bowlers was not trespass as portrayed by the self styled 'businessman' who is behind the faltering ' Newsome Tap' but simply regaining of access to the Green that they and their predecessors had bowled on since 1905.\nThe Covenant on the Bowling Green means that it can only be used as a Bowling Green! There is very little chance that this covenant will be released by Kirklees Council at least while the local Councillors like myself are so supportive of the bowlers claim. Mr Stuart Smith has no use in the short or long term for the Bowling Green but the community do and the sooner he recognises the fact the sooner we can move along to a satisfactory resolution to this issue.

I went to pick him up a few\nweeks ago and spotted a book with a plain blue cover with the embossed words\n‘Huddersfield – Official Handbook’. I had a scan\nthrough it and saw it was produced by Huddersfield Borough Council and on the\ninside cover was written “With the compliments of , Mayor\nof Huddersfield, 1960-61, Alderman Norman Day ”. I bought it on the spot for £39 but even a scan\nthrough told me it was a real find. It was published as the modern age was\nbeginning and the second world war was still a fairly recent memory for most\npeople. It was a very different place and every now and again someone of\ncertain age will say wistfully to me “why can’t we go back to the old\nHuddersfield Borough Council”. Well what I had purchased was a snapshot (as\nopposed to a moving picture) of that 'Nirvana'.\n.\nHuddersfield - Official Handbook' is a treasure trove\nfor Council geeks and particularly a Huddersfield Councillor. Inside there is a\nfairly detailed history of the Huddersfield area from pre-history to the\npresent day. There are maps showing the Huddersfield area and Town Centre prior\nto the ring road going in (it was being planned at the time). There are pages\nof information about the Huddersfield Borough Council and the\nservices they provided. Some things are different but much is the same. There\nare photographs of the recently completed Salendine Nook Secondary School\nlooking pristine before it deteriorated in the 70s when I attended and the\nconcrete started falling away from the metal window frames.\nWhat I found\nparticularly fascinating was all the adverts in it. Some from companies that\nsurvive to this day, some that I can remember and others that by most people are\nlong forgotten from over half a century ago. There are adverts about how to get\nyourself set up with gas heating and smokeless coal to comply with the Clean\nAir Act and where you can purchase radios with the new fangled stereo or ‘3D\nsound’. There is a photo of an unnamed Huddersfield’s oldest resident of 103.\nThis chap is sitting there with a smile looking healthy and hearty with a pint\nof bitter and holding his pipe and he must first have been born in Huddersfield\nI guess around the 1858 mark. There is a large section on the manufacturing and\ntextile industry of Huddersfield and interestingly it is also translated into\nGerman and French. I guess this was to stimulate trade with that place called\nEurope across the sea. There are the names and addresses of all the Councillors\nand key figures from the time most of whom I never knew or met with the odd\nexception such as Tom Cliffe who was a Councillor I came across in the distant\npast.\nYou really get a sense\nlooking through this time capsule of Huddersfield of the span of years and how it\ncontinues and has its own life beyond that of the lifetime of those of us who\nreside within it. We all experience change in the local environment around us\nand sometimes its for the better and sometimes definitely not. My own personal bug bear is how the Burns\nTavern with its long wooden bar got demolished to become Burger King.\n‘Huddersfield – Official Handbook’ is now a prized possession and it would be interesting to do something\nsimilar for someone else to discover 50 years hence. Things are however so very\ndifferent. The information in this book is probably not stored or accessed\neasily anywhere digitally. A lot of the same information today could be source\nfrom a number of websites. Huddersfield as an administrative area is gone and we\nhave the not very much loved Kirklees Council so the point of doing it might be\nlost. We can’t recreate the past nor should we attempt to do so. Like those\nbefore us we just have to do our best to make a better future and much as I\nenjoy having a ‘proper gander’ at ‘Huddersfield – Official Handbook’ it is in its own\nway propaganda showing our town 52 years ago in the best possible light.

The British people have lived with austerity for three years. Your sacrifices are making it possible for us to fix the economy. This is your recovery and you deserve to feel the benefits – without delay.\"\nThe message from Government is that we are now turning a corner and that 'growth' and a recovery is supposedly happening. The problem is for many that this 'good news' is not relevant to them. Many of the people who have suffered the most are those for whom a £100 tax cut is utterly meaningless. The people who have had a bedroom tax imposed or who have lost disability benefits due to the punitive ATOS regime. For many of these people a £100 tax cut will never have any relevance at all. The justification for cutting peoples benefits was supposedly not at all ideological or a 'war on the poor' but because 'we're all in it together'. If that situation has changed and the Lib Dems can offer goodies shouldn't it be the poorest who benefit first?\nOf course the right wing media would say its 'our taxes' that pay for these benefits but that ignores the fact that many people have worked and contributed taxes thoughout their lives and that many cannot find work because of their disability or because the work simply isn't there.\nWith thousands of public sector workers around the country about to become unemployed because of government cuts it seems crazy that the Lib Dems are floating the idea of tax reductions. It has all the hallmarks of a cynical gimmick and is not the behavior you would expect from a responsible party of government but then that is the Liberal Democrats for you.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

We had a good mixture of cherry, apple and plum trees with pear to go in early next week. We've found a good supplier for the initial trees so we are hopeful we should be able to complete the project well under budget. It is a win, win project that ticks many boxes. Growing local food, helping bee populations and wildlife generally, involving local people, helping local businesses all of these are helped by this project. It is a 4 year project to boldly plant fruit trees all across the Kirkburton Parish to leave a lasting and valued benefit to local people. Engaging community groups is a must with schemes such as this to make sure they are planted in the right places and that the community has stake in the project over time. There was talk of jam and wine making using the produce when the trees mature and start fruiting.

I originally proposed it to ensure small Independent businesses like retailers, pubs, cafe's and restaurants survive this crisis intact. We will need them to bring life back to our town centres and I am urging other Councils around the country to follow Kirklees lead\".\n\"There is now a challenge to commercial landlords of our Huddersfield town centre businesses. If Councils can do what is right to protect the long term interests of our local economy so should you. A 3 month rent holiday for your tenants now could well ensure they are your tenants in the future.\"\nKirklees has provided £30k for each of the Council's 23 Wards to help communities deal with issues related to the current Corona Virus Crisis. Kirklees Councillors were informed by email on Tuesday that the funding would be added to the Ward Budgets that they control for activity in the wards they represent. Kirklees Green Party Leader and Newsome Ward Councillor Andrew Cooper said, \"This funding provided by the Council at this most difficult of time is very welcome. What Newsome Councillors want to do is get people to give us their ideas. The sort of ideas we are looking for are things that help morale in the community, provide support to vulnerable people in the community and ensure that we come out of the crisis with local businesses intact. The funding is not limitless but I'm keen to harness the power of the community to help us through this public health emergency. I and my Newsome Ward colleagues have been impressed by the willingness of people to help their neighbours in this most unprecedented of circumstances. These are the people who can see the needs that may not be being met and the things that may make life a little better. \"\nWhere to begin. We are in uncharted territory. A country effectively in lockdown, no pubs, bars, cafes or restaurants open, the state supporting millions who were only a few days ago were in employment now out of work due to Covid 19, the Corona Virus. People living in fear of their lives, social contact prohibited and the deepest religious and social rituals no longer happening until who knows when. Some people are scared and understandably.\nThe territory is uncharted but not unimagined. Films and TV programmes have placed the social fabric under stress in any number of dystopian and post apocalyptic dramas. The BBC's Survivors about a pandemic in the 70s with devastating effects killing millions and spread by global air travel springs to mind. Whether its zombies, triffids or a pandemic the story is all about how society and individuals respond when placed under strain. Already we have seen the best and worst of human nature. People volunteering to help the vulnerable in their droves, council services reshaping themselves to deal with the current crisis and Government giving unprecedented support to seek to ensure we return to some sort of normality. We have to hope they succeed. And then there's the panic buying. I guess a lot of us wish we had shares in toilet roll manufacturers as toilet rolls appear to be like gold dust at present. The panic buying is because there is panic. Many people have not adjusted to the new 'normal'. because it isn't normal and we're only at the beginning.\nWhat is the role of local politicians in these times? More than ever we have to be visible, available and reassuring. Life goes on. There are potholes to fix, drains to be unblocked, traffic calming to be installed. As Newsome Ward Councillors we will be doing a street by street survey over the next few weeks. Most of the Council and community meetings we were scheduled to attend have been cancelled. We are not banned from walking the streets so why not. So if you're a Newsome Ward resident and you see one of us then please say \"hello\" (from 2 metres apart) and let us know your story. We'll get through this.\nRather than the chilling opening sequence from 1975 BBC's Survivors here's Curtis Mayfield's 'Move on up' It's a shot of optimism that's helped lift me when I needed it so maybe it will help you too.

In Kirklees we'll be aiming to win a third seat in the Kirkburton Ward with Cass Whittingham and we'll also be aiming to hold Newsome Ward with new Candidate Karen Allison. The Election is being held against a backdrop of £129 million of cuts imposed on Kirklees by the Lib Dem/Conservative govt and with a Council without a Local Plan leaving an open goal to developers. Honesty on these issues will be in short supply particularly in the Coalition parties literature as all the facts do not show them in a particularly good light.

The site is visible for miles around and is an iconic landmark of national importance and any development here would have a detrimental visual impact.\nWe support Historic England’s recognition that this hilltop fort is a rare and important asset of local, regional and national importance.\nThe majority of the community, who submitted comments were against the proposal and we as councillors instantly had emails and calls from residents questioning how and why the application was approved given the evidence provided. However, this was not reflected in the verbal submission by the officer and the report, while acknowledging the responses, somehow chose to focus on the few that met the recommendation’s view.\nThe Council and the Strategic Planning Committee (SPC) needs to be impartial when it comes to such highly sensitive applications that will affect the community for decades to come. This unfortunately didn’t appear to happen with one of the Councillors on the SPC reading from a prepared script (visible on the Teams virtual meeting and another stating that she was speaking for the silent majority who might want a development on Castle Hill. Where was the evidence for such a statement and what happened to SPC members being impartial when making decisions?\nWe believe the granting of the application fails to fulfil the requirements to allow the application to proceed.\nThis is an application to build a commercial restaurant/café/bar with six guest bedrooms in the middle of Green Belt within the curtilage of the Scheduled Ancient Monument and adjacent to a grade II listed building (Victoria Tower).\nWe believe the Kirklees planning process was flawed and the evidence fails the test of Green Belt and Heritage protection.\nThe document that was presented to the SPC (ref. 2018/93591) demonstrated there was clearly no robust evidence to support the approval and opinions given in support of approval of the application were thin and not evidenced.\nThe same document also demonstrated there was a) significant opposition to the application and b) could not demonstrate how the evidence supported an approval.\nThere are a number of concerns we have about the processes and procedures the planning team and Strategic Planning Committee carried out.\nWe aware of the Huddersfield Civic Society’s objections and concur with their evaluations.\nOur main concerns are as follows:\nNPPF Green Belt\nThis site is in Green Belt and the benefits proposed by the applicant have not been quantified or proven and as such, claims by the planning department in the Council that ‘very special circumstances’ (NPPF cl 1..) have been met and properly evidenced to make such claims.\nThe Council planning department are ignoring the Council Local Plan Policy requirements without clear and robust evidence of why such activities can be ignored. This particularly comes to the fore with Local Plan LP13 and LP16 which require a sequential test of any town centre uses outside of the defined centre boundaries. There was no evidence that such tests had been carried out and this was admitted in the officer’s verbal summary to the SPC. In SPC Agenda pack of the 28/10/2020 item 9 page 61 paragraph 10.15 confirms that LP13 and LP16 requirements to carry out sequential tests and an impact assessment were not carried out. Again what is the evidence that these requirements were unnecessary? Given the town centre and rural communities are already suffering economic harm from COVID-19, we can’t understand how such a test, had it been carried out, would have met such a test as to allow a town centre development at the heart of the site. There are already amenities in the town centre and rural communities offered in the application under-utilized, so how does this outweigh the harm caused in Green Belt.\nThe evidence submitted by the applicant was generic with little detail to make judgements against. The Council report clearly demonstrates that the NPPF conditions for very special circumstances had not been demonstrated and yet the officers highlighted a few selective clauses and statements to reinforce a predetermined recommendation to approve the application of an inappropriate development in the Green Belt.\nParagraph 145 of the NPPF states that the construction of new buildings is inappropriate in the Green Belt, and paragraph 143 states that inappropriate development is, by definition, harmful to the Green Belt and should not be approved except in ‘very special circumstances’. We do not believe that allowing the public limited access to use the toilets within a commercial venture meets this criteria.\nHeritage\nHistoric England as we understand maintain an objection to allowing construction on Castle Hill which will substantially harm a heritage asset of national importance. The size and nature of the proposed development makes clear that servicing heritage visitors is not its primary function.\nIn addition to the above issues raised re the Green Belt we would highlight similar serious concerns with regards to NPPF clauses 193, 194 and 196 which we believe have not shown the benefits outweighing the serious harm.\nKirklees Processes and Procedures\nWe believe that the written report determines that application should be rejected, however, a few statements made were selected to carry more weight than the evidence provides. The recommendation, in our view, flies in the face of the evidence.\nThe processes and procedures within the planning system appear to be biased towards accepting a recommendation that is not evidenced adequately. For instance, it was stated that this is a new application and yet it is an existing application, which has not been approved in the past and yet, with little additional information (except a new design, with even more impact on the heritage) has now been approved.\nThree of the SPC members recognised and stated that there was insufficient evidence to make a planning decision on and yet the recommendation and subsequent vote was to approve the application, without any consideration of the consequences of failure of such a business on the site. To date there has been no business plan submitted that we are aware of.\nThe reliance on planning conditions being set after approval for such a significant site demonstrates to our minds that the applicant’s documentation has not covered all the bases prior to approval. Significant issues such as drainage, transport and security issues, that all could have a detrimental effect on the public benefit are being left until after the approval is given and s106 conditions if not robust and fully fulfilled will leave the site in a significantly poor/damaged state.\nIt would appear that SPC members were coming to the meeting as if the decision had already been made, particularly evidenced with pre-written statements that were read out.\nThe information verbally summarising the report were heavily biased to the recommendation to the point that consultees views that were not in favour of approval were effectively ignored and a few that appeared favourable were given more weight.\nIn conclusion we believe the recommendation to approve this development flies in the face of the evidence or lack thereof and the strong public interest warrant the close examination and inspection of this application.\nYours sincerely\nCllr.

It is principally annoying because it presents information on how people and organisations react to exhortations to save energy as if they were startling revelations rather than things that are well known and widely understood in the energy sector. The other annoying element is the way the laudable 10% reduction in CO2 emissions is presented. It states (overstates?), \"The Government has led the way on showing that it is possible to reduce emissions rapidly and cost effectively\". OK its good but government has hardly 'led' on this. The very fact that it has been relatively easy to acheive shows that government must have ben fairly inefficient in the first place. This agenda has been led by local government, which at its best has made significant reductions based on a combination of belief in reducing emissions linked with financial necessity.\nAnother revealing aspect of the report is how it addresses reluctance to take up energy efficiency measures by householders. While praising the Green Deal mechanism they are creating (and which many are sceptical of) it goes on to say \"we also recognise that households may need additional prompts and encouragement in order to overcome their natural inertia\". It then goes on to reveal trials which include incentives such as B&Q and Homebase vouchers and loft clearance services etc. All these trials are based on the lower cost measures not the higher end measures such as solid wall insulation. There is a tacit acceptance that Green Deal on its own is not going to be enough of an attractive and compelling an offer. The other measure mentioned was the possibility of a month's Council Tax 'holiday' for people taking up energy efficiency measures. One question you always have to ask with this government, (which knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing) is 'where is the money coming from?'. The obvious one is the Energy Company Obligation. Its not taxation so will be recycled from our energy bills. That is not my principal concern (though we need to keep an eye on the impact on low income households) The ECO is an increasingly called upon pot in terms of supporting Green Deal with subsidised high cost measures and supporting those on low incomes so if it is to be used as an incentive mechanism then its impact must be transparent and understood. No mention is made in the document about area based approaches to insulation schemes such as Kirklees Warm Zone. It's proven, it works, therefore Government are ignoring it. Because it doesn't fit at all well with the Green Deal, an unproven mechanism requiring additional incentives?\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

The Budget has been reduced £300 million last year to £110 million this year and £100million in 2012/13. Of course it is bad enough that people on low incomes will have less opportunity to get their homes properly heated and insulated but the government have put some of their own special touches in that will make matters even worse.\nBenefit Entitlement Checks, which were part of the old scheme, have been cut. These helped people who were unaware of the benefits they could claim or perhaps were too proud to claim. This not only helped improve their incomes ( on average by £1850 in 2009/10) but also meant they could become eligible for a Warm Front installation that they previously didn’t qualify for (over 11,000 in 2009/10). It made the scheme a more holistic approach to tackling fuel poverty as it addressed both income and energy efficiency. The Government clearly are wanting to not only restrict the funding on warmfront but also on people who can legitimately claim benefits they are entitled to. Something the Government have done which I won’t argue with is cancelling the voucher scheme for reductions off the cost of central heating to pensioners. This never had any real validity wasn’t based on income and was never properly policied to ensure heating companies weren’t simply profiteering off it, but this is a small consolation compared to the decimation of a valued scheme like Warm Front\nOn occasions the costs of central heating jobs under Warm Front may not be covered by the grant maximum and so customers are asked to contribute towards the costs. So people in the direst circumstances could be asked to find £300, £500 or more. Sometimes this money can be found from a variety of pots, some local authority monies, though this is becoming limited, Royal British Legion or charities. What the government have done now is to limit the customer contributions ‘offer’ to 30 days meaning that many people may not be able to get the money together in time to arrange to pay for an installation and they will lose out.\nWhen the Warm Front scheme first started a few years ago now there were significant issues with quality of workmanship which I and others took up with DEFRA. Many householders suffered with substandard, dangerous and illegal gas installations. As a result a strong inspection regime was brought into place which helped raised standards. This was vital when many customers are vulnerable and may be reluctant to speak up for themselves. All gas jobs were inspected now only 10% will be inspected.\nLow Carbon technologies have been dropped from the scheme offer, though to be fair this was a bit of a shambles in the old Warm Front scheme with very little drive to make this a real offer\nThe big change is with the eligibility critera. Less people will now be eligible for Warm Front and there will be virtually no promotion of the scheme. This is supposed to demonstrate better targeting of the scheme. Only houses with an energy efficiency SAP rating of under 55 are supposed to be helped by the scheme which may sound reasonable but there will be no proper measurement of this it will be based on assumptions based on some basic questions. For all these reasons I‘ll stick my neck out and say they have restricted the Warm Front scheme so much that I believe it will underspend in 2011/12.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

They will not sell the Bowling Green with Buildings seperately from the former Working Mens Club.\nJacqui Sullivan on behalf of Newsome Community Sports and\nBowling Club said,\n“ There is a window of opportunity to make an offer to the\nLiquidators for both the Working Mens Club (which has planning permission to\nconvert to a 5 bedroom house) and the Bowling Green\nand its associated buildings (which has a legal covenant which says it can only\nbe used as a Bowling Green). The Working Mens Club and Bowling Green has been marketed for a figure of £250k.

In 6 minutes.\nWhat needs to change? In 6 minutes.\nThe short\npithy answer is of course lots and quickly. The IPCC Report told us that we have\nonly 12 years to get a grip on carbon emissions as if there wasn’t enough\nevidence already. What frustrates me is the lack of urgency from\npolicymakers on reducing emissions. It is like we have all the time in the\nworld and sadly we simply don’t. We are not treating this as the climateemergency that it clearly is.\nThe final\nstatement at COP24 in Katovice last December, which the UK Government signed up\nto, called for a much stronger relationship between national governments and\nLocal Government on achieving the Paris Climate goals. There now needs to be a\ngenuine and much deeper partnership between Local and National Government to\nwork together to reduce emissions. That simply isn’t there at the moment and we\nneed it. Used imaginatively Councils can be a swift and effective tool to deliver\nprogrammes to reduce emissions and engage citizens. We have Nationally Determined Contributions towards acheiving the Paris Climate goals why not Locally Determined Contributions or Regionally Determined Contributions.\nSo housing\nand specifically new build housing. In July Government told us that Councils\ncould set our own energy efficiency standards in our Local Plans for new\nhousing. That’s good and I am pushing for the Passivhaus Standard in\nSupplementary Planning Guidance to the Kirklees Local Plan. If Kirklees agrees\nit and government allows it and I\nsucceed then that will be one Local Authority out of hundreds. Why doesn’t\ngovernment just improve building regulations and actually properly enforce them\nwith an independent publicly managed Building Control system to ensure their quality of build and energy performance.\nRetrofit\nhousing. We all know that one of our biggest challenges is the existing housing\nstock and that we need to rapidly improve the energy efficiency of the existing\nhomes to reduce energy demand with all the health and income benefits that\nwould come with that. So we desperately need a mass retrofit programme. The\neasy stuff has largely been done in terms of loft and cavity wall insulation.\nIt is the solid wall properties with attic rooms that we need to address with\ninternal drylining, room in roof insulation and external cladding where\nappropriate and we need to aim for the Enerphit standard for retrofit. Yes it\nneeds paying for and a combination of ramping up the Energy Company Obligation\nand use of general taxation is what is required. We can spend countless billions\non HS2 and the expensive dangerous folly that is Hinckley C but wouldn’t it be\nbetter to invest those funds in a programme like this that would directly help\nmillions of people, with substantial additional benefits.\nWe need to\nreboot and re-energise the mass solar PV sector and give it a sustainable\nfuture with no chopping and changing of Government policy every 6 months. This\nwould enable it to be a mass market product again but this time with a strong\nfocus on community owned renewables and energy storage.\nThe\neffective ban on onshore wind projects needs to be lifted. It is ludicruous\nthat our cheapest form of renewable energy is basically a non starter and if we\ndo re-energise it we need to encourage more publicly owned and community owned\nrenewables.\nRenewable\nheat and Combined Heat and Power needs to have a much stronger focus from\ngovernment. I’m not a big fan of the incineration of waste but it’s not just the\nwaste that goes into these that I object to but the waste heat going up the\nchimneys. Some great work is going on in Leeds and other authorities but it is not the norm. It is not mainstream.\nWe need to stop\nsubsidising fossil fuels. We hear all this talk from some politicians about the\nrenewable sector having to stand on its own two feet in the energy market yet\nwe subsidise fossil fuels to the tune of £12 billion/year and renewables £8.3\nbillion/year. The balance is wrong and doesn’t reflect where Government support\nis needed. Local Government and wider public bodies need to divest from fossil\nfuels which if we are serious about addressing emissions will become worthless\nstranded assets (according to the Governor of the Bank of England). Some have\nalready done so, others need to like the West Yorkshire Pension Fund for\ninstance.\nI’d love to\nsee a mass tree planting project with large scale civic engagement and I hope the\nNorthern Forest proposal becomes that. Every school child in the UK should be\ngiven the chance to plant a tree.\nThe\nrevolution in electric vehicles needs to be accelerated and Councils and large\nfleet operators incentivised to act more swiftly with infrastructure and in\ntheir own procurement. Leeds is doing well with 200 electric vehicles. Kirklees\nhas 3. Come on Kirklees!\nFracking. We\nneed to keep it in the ground. Ban it like so many other civilised countries in\nthe world have and Scotland.\nWe need to\nensure we do these things but focus on those on the lowest incomes first. We\ndon’t just save the world we must create a better world.\nDo all this\nand it will be a good start",

Go on sue me! |\nYou'd be forgiven for not knowing about the Tesco Public Enquiry. Not highly publicised they held it out of town in the Hudawi Centre this week. Just to recap Kirklees Council sells Huddersfield Sports Centre and surrounding area to Tescos for millions to allow them to build a huge store at the edge of the Town Centre to help suck more money out of the local economy. The money from Tesco's is then going to used to build a new Sports Centre on Springwood Car Park.\nThe Planning Committee decision was highly dubious given the background and expressed reservations of Counciilors who then went on to vote for it. Barry Sheerman Huddersfield's MP (he managed to beat me in the General Election as did a couple of others) successfully called for a Public Enquiry. You should be up to date now.\n|\n| Here's the Tesco Enquiry I spoke at on Friday. On your left is the Tesco Legal team mob. At the far end is posh Barrister. The Planning Inspector in the middle and Barry Sheerman on the left. I followed on from our esteemed MP |\nI managed to get there for half an hour to present my evidence. I arrived as Barry Sheerman MP was having a set to with Tesco's rather plummy Barrister. It seemed I had entered just as class war was breaking out between Barry and the Barrister. Barry gamely slagged off supermarkets and how much money was being drawn out of the local economy while the 'Tescos Toff' said Barry was biased against supermarkets and wasn't giving any planning reasons to oppose the application. So when I took the stand following Barry I decided not to go off on a Tescopoly tirade but to stick to the unsound nature of the planning decision itself. I pointed out the deep reservations expressed by councillors in the planning meeting who then went on to promptly vote for the application. I told the Planning Inspector about the seven fold increase in traffic at the end of an air quality management area on Leeds Road, the lack of a commitment to social housing, the lack of natural stone in the development despite Councillors wishes. I went on to point out the extraordinarily long time, 9 years, that Kirklees had granted Tesco to build their barn and the lack of trees and biodiversity about the site as well as the impact on the Town Centre. I finished giving my evidence and awaited the onslaught of probing questions from Tescos Barrister. The Planning Inspector invited him to respond but 'No questions' 'Cmon!' I said, 'there must be some questions' I had focussed on the Planning Decision after all. 'I've no questions but that doesn't mean I agree with what has been said'. During my evidence 2 of Barrister Posh's staff rushed up to him with bits of paper and conferred with him but whatever they said it did not seem like he wanted to engage. I counted about 8 Tesco's people there either legal or company people so they are certainly throwing some money at this lets hope Kirklees Planning's deeply dodgy decision on this ( with the honorable exception of Cllr Christine Iredale) is overturned.\nHere's the video evidence for the next session of the inquiry;\nReplyDeletehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IevLaMPaxM\n:)\nAha but if you see my post on Tesco in February you'll see the full version\nReplyDeletehttp://greeningkirklees.blogspot.com/2011/02/tesco-gets-away-with-it.html",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2012_05_strange-bedfellows-kirklees-councils_html/content_1148.html": "| Ming the Merciless - a 'Strong Leader' |\nA common thread among non Labour Parties in the run up to the election was around retaining staffed provision in village libraries. The direction of travel indicated, in the consultation, is for more volunteer run and assisted libraries. So this was the main area where we could get some joint action if we could agree a common approach to the Labour Party. I talked to all the other Party Leaders in the run up to the Annual Meeting but to get the Conservatives to sit down for 3 Group talks with ourselves and the Lib Dems proved very difficult and I didn't detect a lot of enthusiasm from them in any case. Labour were quite keen to talk to all the groups seperately to get the best deal they could or 'divide and rule' if you prefer. Given we weren't getting anywhere with the Conservatives both ourselves and the Lib Dems declared publicly on Monday that we would vote against Labour on the Libraries issue to try to get the Tories to declare their intentions. On Sunday Eveening Mehboob Khan indicated that if we were to vote against them leading the Council they would remove us from Chairing the Resources Scrutiny Panel this along with the fact that they had told the Lib Dems we had already made a deal with us convinced me, if it were necessary, of the character of the Labour leadership.\nOn Wednesday I went into the Annual Council Meeting not knowing which way the Conservatives were going to vote on the Leadership of the Council. In the end they abstained. If they had voted against Mehboob Khan he wouldn't have been Leader and we may then have been able to exercise some leverage on the libraries issue at the very least. So I guess the big question is why the Tories did what they did? There is the 'foaming mouth' wing of the Tories who won't talk to the Greens in a civilised way at the best of times so I can imagine Robert Light had his work cut out with those characters in any case. Then of course if Labour weren't going to vote for the Green Party and Valley Independent Group to have any Committee Chairs who were they going to support? The Tories of course. Instead of our Cllr Terry Lyons chairing the Planning and Highways Committee you have the delightful Conservative Cllr Christine Smith instead of Green Cllr Julie Stewart-Turner chairing the Resources Scrutiny Panel you have Tory Cllr Donald Firth. Loyalty to the 'strong leader' obviously brings its rewards (and punishments to those who defy him).\nSo where does this leave the new 'Strong Leader' of Kirklees, 'Mehboob the Merciless'. A bit embarrassed I think. It doesn't do his dubious 'left credentials' much good having to do a deal with the Tories who are as we know the 'bad guys'. We had quite an amusing exchange of tweets where he rather illogically accused me of wanting the Tories to run Kirklees instead of him. The only question put to us was \"do you want Mehboob Khan to be leader of the Council?\" there wasn't a mutiple choice question. If there was \"None of the above\" would probably have been my answer.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

People are trying to make ends meet financially while local services and facilities diminish and disappear around them. We need a totally different philosophy in Westminister which values and cherishes locally delivered goods and services and where care for the most vulnerable in our society is not compromised. Our values as a society have to change. We need to move away from a confused and confrontational foreign policy to one of certainty where putting our armed forces in the firing line for the most dubious of reasons simply does not occur.Sustainability is a principle that drives Greens but it is at least as relevant to the economy as it is to the environment. Just as our natural resources are been squandered so our approach to finances has been one where greed has won out over good governance.For all these reasons i decided to stand for election as Huddersfield's first Green MP to ensure these principles and ideas that are shared by millions at last get a voice in our Parliament.\"\nToo right.

It says to them that they will be entering a work environment\nthat is under resourced, undervalued, where they will work long hours in hospitals\nwith not enough beds and a high demand for services. We need an NHS that is good\nfor those who use it but also those who work in it.\nI am\ndisappointed the Conservatives aren’t here today and that the Kirklees\nConservative Tory Leader Cllr Hall does not believe the NHS crisis is real.\nUnfortunately it is and successive Governments have got us to this place with\nthe marketization of a service that should always have been a public one.

We have an old Glow worm gas boiler fitted in 1981. On the national A to G scheme for measuring the efficiency of boilers it is a shameful SEDBUK 'G rated' and very inefficient. One of the features of the boiler is a gas pilot light that runs all the time and so I was keen to find out how much gas this uses over a week when it is not being used for heating and hot water. The result over the week was 5 units. Not a huge amount but over a year that would make 260 units at around 4.5p/unit or £11.70. This isn't a huge cost spread over an entire year and I've not taken into account the inherent inefficiency of the boiler in producing heat and hot water anyway. I wanted to know how much gas it used in 'standby mode' from basic curiosity but also to see whether it was worth turning the boiler off entirely at certain times of the year. I have other options for heating and hot water either by solar water heating or via my Dunsley Yorkshire wood boiler in the winter. From the figures it hardly seems worth the trouble of turning it off and I would probably have difficulty relighting the pilot light (I've had issues with this in the past). I'm keen to stick with this old gas boiler for a number of reasons. It may be grossly inefficient compared with modern boilers but it is largely maintenance free and only requires a gas safety check each year and the thermocouple changing every now and again. I have improved the energy and carbon efficiency of my heating and hot water system by having the options of solar thermal and wood burning which like my gas boiler feeds into a single thermal store. This was not a cheap option compared with simply changing the boiler but is practical for me as I have good supplies of wood fuel and got the solar financed through the Kirklees Re-charge scheme and also a Low Carbon Buildings Grant a couple of years ago.\nMy next thought on improving the efficiency of my heating system (while retaining my old boiler) is by fitting a flue gas heat recovery unit on the boiler and I'm researching potential systems that could save significant amount from my boiler. I will probably need to replace the asbestos flue which will add more cost to this option. One of the models claims a 7.5% fuel saving on a SEDBUK A rated boiler so I'm guessing it's potential for fuel savings on my G- Rated Glow Worm should be significantly greater. We will see.\n| My old G-Rated boiler providing an additional log and paper brick drying function |\nMy next thought on improving the efficiency of my heating system (while retaining my old boiler) is by fitting a flue gas heat recovery unit on the boiler and I'm researching potential systems that could save significant amount from my boiler.

To focus on the issue I had conceived and promoted for the last 2 years, 'Regionally and Locally Determined Contributions' - RLDC's. It's hard to make a subject with this title sound engaging. What exactly does it mean? The short explanation is that just as we have carbon emission savings identified for nations, Nationally Determined Contributions - NDCs, we also should have savings identified for Councils and other political bodies at the Local and Regional level - RLDCs. To engage the power of the local could\n| With CoR Vice President Markula at the EU Commission Briefing |\nSo I've been away from home for 10 days and frankly want to get back. At COP24 I've made a number presentations and press interviews as well as participating in briefings on progress of the talks. The key one for me was with EU Climate Change Commissioner Miguel Canete where I asked for strong support for RLDCs but also the ongoing involvement of Local and Regional Authorities in developing policies and strategies to address climate change. It's not going to be as easy an ask as you might think. COP stands for 'Conference of the Parties' and the Parties are Governments. Giving LRA's their own contributions is regarded by some as ignoring the agreed structure of global action on climate change.\n| Presenting on RLDCs in the EU Pavillion |\nWhat we do know is that there has been a growing pressure for action at the local and regional level to have greater recognition fro LRAs. Todays's statement from 'Non State Actors' through the Talanoa Dialogue Call for Action has piled on the pressure for greater emphasis on action by LRAs on mitigation and adaptation. Here's just some of the positive statements they made yesterday that were endorsed by the Presidents of COP23 and COP24 that indicate a greater role for LRAs\n\"Actors in all countries, including Parties and non-Party stakeholders at the national, regional and\n| Al Gore doing his impressive 'State of the Climate' talk |\n\"Multilateralism and cooperation will enable us to address problems together, find solutions, and build consensus for the common good. Only a global coalition of actors – including Parties, national and sub-national governments, private sector companies, the investment community, civil society and all non-Party stakeholders – can take us there.\"\n\"Together, Parties, working with non-Party stakeholders including sub-national governments, should pursue efforts to strengthen mitigation and adaptation commensurate with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. They must work together in the planning and pursuit of low emissions and climate-resilient development.\"\n\"We call upon civil society leaders to marshal the public and political will needed to drive action. We call upon them to engage political leadership, influence and challenge norms, enhance awareness, and mobilize action at the regional, state and local levels.\"\n| Andrew and the Andalucians (not a new band) |\nSo where are we with only a day to go before COP24 is supposed to end? Well nothing is guaranteed.

It is a huge issue and represents a significant proportion of the Councils carbon emissions. Early experiments were off grid solar streetlights on Malvern Rise, Primrose Hill. They worked, but they would never replace a standard streetlight in tems of illumination but ideal for places where an electrical connection is difficult. A hybrolight, combining wind and PV power for off grid locations is on a footpath between Close Hill Lane and Towngate is up and running and justified on the basis of the avoided costs of not connecting a long electrical connection. Our first grid connected solar streetlights were installed this year on Edale Avenue and they perform well and are comparable with a standard streetlight in terms of performance. There is an 'however' however and it is to question why have a streetlight connected to the grid which simply acts as a platform for a solar panel why not just stick a load of solar panels on top of a building instead of lots of little ones on top of individual streetlights. I guess the answer to this is to imagine them as part of a very intensively localised energy network utilising all available space to generate the maximum amount of electrical power. That is clearly not where we are at the moment but probably in my ideal scenario is where I would like us to be. Back to the 'here and now' we need to reduce the carbon emissions associated with streetlights quickly.\nThere is a whole agenda at the moment around dimming and turning off street lights in the early hours of the morning in isolated spots say between 2 and 6 in the morning. The other approach is to get streetlights which produce the same amount of light but use less power by utilising LED technology. We have trialled LED Streetlights with a Green Party initiative with 29 columns in the Highfields area of the ward and they are working fine (apart from the one pictured which was on during the day!).\nOur next, more low tech, solution is to put stickers on lighting columns telling people who to ring if the light is on during the day (dayburner) or isn't working at all. I have reported stacks of dayburners over the years to Kirklees Highways but the quicker they are noticed and reported the better and these stickers will help.\nOne last thought. Each year we go through a portion of space littered with dust particles sometimes resulting in spectacular meteor showers. Why not turn off streetlights for a few hours in the late evening/ early hours of the morning on that day, so we can have a free meteor show for the area without the distractions of light pollution.",

Instead they would be from a variety of public funds and money made available to communities that Councils themselves cannot easily access.”\n“Let’s make no mistake I don’t agree with the Governments Budget cuts and how they seem to be targeted at the most vulnerable. What we do need to do is find practical ways we can help to direct more support and involve people in deciding where funds are best directed. In this way we can help ensure that the things people care about and that make up the fabric of community life have a secure future and are more resilient against the annual cull of local services and facilities”.\nLeader of the Independent Group Terry Lyons said,\n“To make this work we are going to need to establish local plans and get more people involved and interested in carrying out worthwhile projects to improve and enhance their local communities and the environment. There is already a lot of good work going on out there with better directed support from Kirklees we can help communities access more funds from an array of sources”\nENDS\nKirklees Budget 2.0 – Community led budgets to protect facilities and services\nThis is not a proposition to create a new Kirklees Council led budget but one which directs a proportion of funding to devolved groups such as Ward Community Forums and Parish Councils which are demonstrably ‘community led’ organisations with their own locally determined priorities.\nRationale\nThe overall rationale for this proposition is:\n• Council resources are increasingly stretched and focussed rightly on maintaining essential public services\n• We need to establish new ways of funding local priorities that take into account the wishes of people in all our communities across Kirklees\n• Supporting communities to do more through cooperation and to take more responsibility for themselves is central to the councils vision; and vital if we are to reduce dependency on public services to deliver more sustainable communities and reduce future demands on the public purse.\n• A proactive approach is needed to ensure we make best use of combined resources to deliver outcomes in local areas.\nCommunity directed resources and decision making\nIncreasingly government is directing limited resources and decision making directly to community organisations and parish councils, bypassing principal councils such as Kirklees. This has included one-off funding pots, such as Community First, but as new legislation and government policy comes into force, this effect will increase and become more systemic.\nIn addition to resources, a range of formal decision making powers are being focused at the parish/community level, a significant example being the ‘neighbourhood planning’ aspects of the Localism Act. Other provisions in the Localism Act (those relating to ‘assets of community value’ and the ‘community right to challenge’, for example) signal a clear desire for communities to be more actively engaged and involved in developing new locally-based solutions for delivering local priorities and outcomes. Further, more radical devolution of neighbourhood level services to parish level has also been mooted in the Open Public Services White Paper.\nNone of the above is inconsistent with the aspirations we have already agreed in Kirklees Council’s 2014 vision, but we need to be proactive in how we shape and guide these changes. The danger is that there is not the capacity, or in some cases the will, in local areas to take advantage of these funds or decision making powers, meaning that more disadvantaged communities could lose out, as more articulate and wealthier communities take the lions share of the cash and new opportunities. This could lead to further marginalisation of disadvantaged communities, increasing inequalities and widening gaps; resulting in poorer outcomes and escalating costs for the principal council.\nKirklees Council’s role must be to remove barriers and enable communities to realise their own aims and ambitions. This could make up for the deficiencies in the Government’s ‘Big Society’ model and actually make it work.\nTaking the opportunity offered by Neighbourhood Planning\nAs mentioned above, the Localism Act provides a strong incentive for why we need to support the development of capacity in communities at a local level. The option for areas to produce Neighbourhood Development Plans is both a threat and an opportunity, it is quite right to be cynical about them as being a charter to ‘build as much as you like but not as little as you would wish’ so long as they don’t contradict the numbers in the Local Development Framework. But equally they provide a real opportunity for local dialogue and ownership, not just focused on development and new houses, but around communities’ broader aspirations for their local areas.\nWe need to ensure that communities have equal chance to develop Neighbourhood Development Plans that are properly resourced, not in conflict with each other and that are not hijacked by developers or other organisations with dubious motives. It would be inefficient to support a locally led Neighbourhood Development Plan Process and then not use to that work to help consolidate that capacity to ensure there is ongoing community based approaches to direct resources and actions on local priorities. As such the establishment of ward based community forums where they don’t exist (and don’t conflict with parish boundaries) should be a priority for Kirklees as should the consolidation of support for them where they do exist. We should also lend our support to enable Town and Parish Councils to realise their potential as bodies to coordinate the delivery of services in their communities.\nPotential sources of funding\nThere are a variety of sources of funding and capacity which could be better aligned to support local community capacity building and the delivery of local priorities and service solutions under the model proposed through this budget amendment. Potential funding sources include:\n• Funding which can be accessed by community organisations, but which is not available directly to principal councils – including:\no Parish/Town Council precepts – this is an existing funding stream which has been used to successfully lever in funds from other third sector sources, e.g. Kirkburton Parish Council/East Peak Innovation Partnership.\no Community First and similar initiatives\no Support for capacity building\no Support for the development of community led cooperatives and mutuals\no Funding for community-led energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives, e.g. the Local Energy Assessment Fund\no Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) - Localism Act reforms to the CIL will require a ‘meaningful proportion’ of the levy to be handed over to the local neighbourhoods where the development takes place)\no Big Lottery Funding\no Landfill Tax funding\no Big Society Capital (formerly referred to as the Big Society Bank) - will not make direct grants but will instead act as a wholesaler of capital, attracting funding from foundations, institutional investors, companies and private individuals, to invest in intermediary organisations. Applicants, from all parts of the UK, could approach the intermediary organisations and access capital at a more competitive rate than through a normal bank.\n• Kirklees Sources:\no New Homes Bonus – the intention behind the New Homes Bonus which sees the government match the council tax on any new properties for the first six years, was to incentivise communities to ‘go for growth’. It is arguably wrong for the council to rely on such funds for core funding and can lead to accusations, fair or not, that the Council seeks development to fund core services at the detriment of the local environment. If instead this funding was directed towards local communities to resource their priorities there would at least be a logical symmetry in that communities have taken the ‘pain’ of new development but have access to benefits and could direct funding to locally determined priorities\no Land and assets – could be made available, for example through Community Land Trusts to support local priorities and new service solutions (a similar rationale could apply to Parish/Town Council assets).\no Green Deal Partnership funding - the Governments ‘Green Deal’ is introduced this year and partnerships between Councils and Green Deal providers offer real opportunities to raise significant funds based on access to Council, Parish and Community endorsement. This will be new funding that is available and unaccounted for in current Kirklees Budgets\no Community Infrastructure Levy – we could go further than the minimum requirements under the Localism Act and direct a greater proportion of S106/CIL monies to community forums or parish councils\no Kirklees Community Development support and support to local area governance (funding and staff capacity)\no Proportion of planning officer resource\no Proportion of devolved Area Committee budgets\no Other, mainstream Kirklees Council resources, which relate to the delivery of neighbourhood level services, provided they could be disaggregated to a more local level without losing economies of scale or strategic coherence.\nClearly, the arrangements proposed here will take time to develop and embed – it would not be necessary or even desirable to take a ‘big bang’ approach to consolidate the above capacity and funding. What is required, though, is a meaningful enough initial investment to give a clear sense of commitment and provide sufficient leverage to engage parishes and communities, which could then be built up incrementally.\nGovernance\nIf we are serious about building local community capacity and maximising the impact of increasingly limited but very disparate funding sources, we need to create a new solution to oversight and governance of community level resources. A key principle behind this budget proposal is the need to bring together currently fragmented resources and capacity to enable community-led solutions to emerge and flourish. We have to accept that the traditional ‘top down’ forms of area based governance cannot fulfil this role alone, given that an increasing level of resources are outside of the direct control of the council or local councillors.\nThe overall thrust of the government’s localism proposals arguably presents a real challenge to local democracy and local community leadership. The approach outlined here, provides a potentially powerful response to that challenge and an opportunity to stimulate a much more dynamic and entrepreneurial role for Kirklees ward councillors.\nIn addition, it creates an environment where community activity, enterprise and capacity can be combined with public, private and philanthropic resources to stimulate innovation and create added value.\nA mechanism needs to be created whereby these resources and funding streams can be collectivised and fairly allocated. We propose establishing an overarching not-for-profit body, independent of Kirklees Council, established with a clear public interest purpose. (Membership of the body could include senior Kirklees councillors, parish chairs, third sector leaders, community representatives, partner agencies, business leaders and others. This would be the primary vehicle to which relevant public sector staff, capacity and resources would be transferred. Similar Community Interest Companies could be established at lower levels of geography, such as Parish/Town Council boundaries, to create, lead and administer community-led programmes and activities, pooling resources available at these lower geographies, such as the parish precept, Area Committee monies, CIL, New Homes bonus etc.. Kirklees ward councillors, working alongside parish councillors and others, would have a key leadership role using the more locally focused CIC’s as a vehicle to pool resources and develop local initiatives based on local priorities and aspirations.\nThe local CIC’s would draw on the expertise, staff, resources and capacity of the Kirklees-wide body who would provide overarching support, community development capacity, capacity to help support the development of Neighbourhood Development Plans, funding expertise and administrative / back-office support.",

The Jackroyd Lane site is part of a green corridor that goes all the way up to Castle Hill and land at Blue Bell Hill and provides recreational space for people in the middle of a built up area between Newsome and Taylor Hill. The importance of access to nearby green spaces for good mental health has become really clear to so many of us through the covid lockdown. Kirklees needs to protect green land not build on it. There are plenty of brownfield sites we should develop on if we really care about our local environments.”\nCouncillor Karen Allison said,\n“The access to both sites is very poor with narrow roads through built up residential areas towards the fields the Council wants to build on. It would mean lots more traffic on what are currently quiet estates. It will also be a nightmare for residents during the construction phase.”\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper said,\n“We are not NIMBYs, and we want development in the Newsome Ward. We have been actively seeking to encourage new homes on the Newsome Mills, a brownfield site, where there is good access. This makes far more sense than Kirklees proposals to build on local green fields. They should drop these plans and respect the views of local people\"\n| Jackroyd Lane protest |",

Of course there's very little choice in reality. This week has been redundancy/retirement week at Kirklees Council. The numbers of staff leaving the Council is huge, around 500 are gone with around another 1000 to go over the next few months but even this will not be enough services will have to be cut further to satisfy government demands or as Eric puts it,\n\"For the first time, councils will have real power and a real say over how money gets spent. \"\nanother particularly irritating quote,\n\"We've cut the apron strings which have tied (Councils) to Whitehall for too long, giving them freedom to act on behalf of their residents,\"\nThis is just utter tosh and a degree of spin that would make Mandelson blush (OK maybe not). People are being 'freed' of local facilities, services and income. He makes a virtue of getting rid of reporting such as that needed for the Comprehensive Performance Assessment and more reporting to citizens on how ther money is spent. OK but we do need to report on the impact on public services, the jobs lost, the impact on the wider economy, the health and social impact of cuts, the loss of public facilities.

I am of course talking about the 'policy' to move households in council houses in deprived areas to council houses in areas with plenty of jobs. Since the Tories started selling off council houses in the 80's there are now much less available council houses anyway. You also have to ask yourself how much available council housing there will be in 'well to do' areas with lots of jobs - not many if any. So maybe they could build some more Council houses with all the money we haven't got. In any case even if they did have the money they have abolished the house building targets which throws all housebuilding plans into disarray. Of course you have to question the wisdom and morality of a government accepting that some communities should be allowed to sink into further decline as its more mobile working age (young?) people move away. This so called 'policy' is utterly meaningless and I am completely bemused how Duncan-Smith has got some status as a Tory welfare guru when he appears to be so devoid of ideas and initiative. Hence this latest nonsense.\nHere's another 'non-policy',David Cameron talking about troops coming out of Afghanistan in 5 years. No plans to do it, no real plan to create a stable Afghanistan, no recognition that British Troops are not part of the solution in Afghanistan but part of the problem.

We never suggested it would be a panacea or a silver bullet but we now have from Kirklees their assessment of the proposals impact. It would save £3.6million and preserve 122 jobs. With the Council considering cuts of 1500 it is by no means a solution but it is part of the answer. It needs proper consideration and thought with sensitive discussions with unions on the preservation of jobs and services in our area.\nSunday, 13 September 2009\nFrom 37 to 35 hours\nWhichever government we get after the General Election we know that to pay for the bankers we will have a huge contraction of the public sector. Hundreds of thousands of jobs are under threat. It will be the next dip in the recession within 12 months. If the choice is cut jobs or cut hours my vote goes for hours. To have potentially thousands of breadwinners becoming unemployed is unacceptable. The question for Kirklees Councillors will they take the 'we are a service not an employer approach' (yes someone has said that) and put thousands of families on the dole OR can we find another way. A 35 hour week would save the Council millions yet preserve jobs. It would also drive efficiencies in the way Kirklees operates.\nIs it possible, politically, to acheive a 35 hour week? We'll see. If I manage that I may try the more difficult problem of getting the other Party groups to abandon the £2000/year party groups hospitality allowance. Stop free beer for Councillors now that would be an achievement.\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2013_09_letter-to-yorkshire-and-humber-meps_html/content_512.html": "RE: September 11 – Plenary vote on the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive – amendments on shale gas and other unconventional hydrocarbons\nDear MEP\nOn July 11, the Parliament’s Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee voted overwhelmingly (49-13) in favour of a report by MEP Zanoni on the European Commission’s proposals for a review of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive.\nThe Committee notably adopted proposals to adapt the EIA Directive to the arrival of a new type of industrial-size activities in Europe, namely the plans to explore and extract unconventional hydrocarbon such as shale gas in Europe. The negative environmental, health and climate impacts associated with hydraulic fracturing or fracking - the technique used to explore and extract such unconventional hydrocarbons – have been well documented since the shale gas drilling boom started a decade ago in the United States. The proposals in the Zanoni report allow us to take the necessary measures in order not to repeat the same mistakes observed in the US.\nI respectfully ask you to offer your support to the current version of the Zanoni report and to the unchanged provisions on shale gas and other unconventional fossil fuels in particular amendments 31 and 79 point (e). The EIA, Annex I, Article 14 shall be amended as follows:\n“(e) the following points (14a) and (14b) are inserted:\n14a. Exploration, evaluation and extraction of crude oil and/or natural gas trapped in gas-bearing strata of shale or in other sedimentary rock formations of equal or lesser permeability and porosity, regardless of the amount extracted.\n14b. Exploration and extraction of natural gas from coal beds, regardless of the amount extracted.”\nThis is necessary to provide a legal clarification. According to the European commission, unconventional hydrocarbon projects are now already subject to an EIA because it cannot be excluded, on the basis of objective information, that the project will have significant environmental effects. But since not every member state or administration / public authority is willing to take this into account, an EU-wide mandatory EIA for unconventional fossil fuel activities is vital.\nThese amendments follow strong and clear recommendations, which received broad political support in the vote on last year’s European Parliament resolutions on shale gas. In the own-initiative report on the “Environmental impacts of shale gas and shale gas oil extraction activities”, authored by MEP Boguslaw Sonik, the European Parliament called “for the inclusion of projects including hydraulic fracturing in Annex I of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive” (§24).\nThese amendments are crucial, because the current version of the legislation fails to guarantee a systematic and mandatory EIA before new unconventional hydrocarbon projects start up:\n• Because they have a maximum daily production rate of between 115,000 and 250,000 m3, they will never meet the 500,000m3/day threshold mentioned in the existing legislation. As a consequence, no mandatory and systematic EIA for UFF projects can currently be guaranteed.\n• Because deep drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques are systematically used throughout the process, including during the exploration phase, several important environmental damages can already occur during the exploration phase. This is why not only the extraction phase should be included in Annex I, but also the exploration activities. The poor environmental record of the development of this industry in the United States has taught us that:\n• It is essential to engage in a systematic gathering of baseline data – with samples of air, water and soil quality – in order to prove the causal link between UFF operations and air and/or water contamination around drilling sites.\n• Such industrial developments cannot take place without properly consulting the communities living around potential drilling sites.\nIf large-scale UFF operations are allowed to go ahead in an unregulated way, this industry will repeat the same mistakes as in the United States, with the same dramatic impacts for the climate, environment and public health. I believe it is absolutely vital that this recommendation receives strong support, and I look to you to represent my views in this matter for the good of our constituency and for the rest of Europe.\nYours sincerely,\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper\nThank you for highlighting this vote on your blog.

I only know of one example of someone in such a position and that is of course Commissioner Gordon from Gotham City. I am not thinking of the Gary Oldman version here but the hapless bloke who played him in the 60s version of Batman starring Adam West. Gotham City was obviously starved of public funding as every time there was any sort of crisis at all (usually involving Mr Freeze, Catwoman, the Joker etc) Commissioner Gordon and his Chief O'Hara would be straight on the blower to some masked vigilante to get him to help them out. Has the Gotham City Police Department actually solved any of its own crimes without having to outsource/commission someone else to sort out the bad guys and probably at a premium. Bruce Wayne isn't an eccentric millionaire for nothing I'm sure. So for the Police Commissioner system of governance to have any chance of working we are going to need a West Yorkshire equivalent to Bruce Wayne to supplement a cash starved police force. An eccentric millionaire, a 'do gooder' with a penchant for fast cars and a flamboyant taste in costumes. A reasonable runner as well and a former wrestler who might be able to hold his own in a scrap would be handy. There are just two problems. The chap who fits the 'Bruce Wayne' profile died last year and the other problem is that he was Jimmy Saville.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

The hard part is going to\nbe how do they finance the sort of Health Service local people deserve? We know\nabout the bad PFI deal and we could spend many happy hours deciding which Government\nis to blame for that one but it is not the only financial factor in this sorry\nsaga. We have an NHS in crisis. The contract being forced on Junior Doctors is\none issue another is that GP practices like the University Health Centre and\nSlaithwaite Health Centre are under threat due to cuts resulting from a new\nfunding formula. Against this is the backdrop of a £30 Billion national\nshortfall in NHS funding identified prior to the last General Election but left\nunaddressed. We also have the ongoing privatisation of the NHS where private\nhealth companies are allowed to cherry pick juicy parts of it using public money\nfor private profit and with many millions of pounds of public money being spent\nsimply monitoring private contracts. The Private Sector should only have a very\nlimited & well regulated role in the NHS. The NHS Reinstatement Bill recently\nput before Parliament would ensure a publicly funded, publicly delivered NHS\nnot just the narrow ‘free at the point of use’ one we have at the moment. It’s\na pity that MPs from one Party sought to filibuster it out of Parliamentary\nTime, last Friday, and another sent only a pitiful 15 MPs to support it. The guilty\nparties know who they are but will\nremain unnamed on this occasion.\nThis brings us to the role of central Government. They\nresponded to the on line Parliamentary petition to save A&E at Huddersfield\nwith the following. They said, \"It is\na matter for local determination\" and \"it is right that these\ndecisions are led by local clinicians, who best understand the healthcare needs\nof their local populations \". This response fails to recognise that\nGovernment sets the rules and is the ultimate provider of NHS funding.\nGovernment makes the funding environment within which local decisions are made.\nSuccessive Governments have set the rules and now this one wants to say it is a\nlocal decision. What I do find very strange is that Prime Minister David\nCameron felt able to go to the Calderdale Royal Hospital in April last year,\nbefore the election and guaranteed that A & E services would remain there.\nI am pleased that A& E will remain in Halifax but what makes that issue one\nthat the Prime Minister felt he could comment on and yet the decision at\nHuddersfield A&E is a \"matter for local determination\"?\nThe best possible tactic now (as well as putting pressure on\nlocal NHS decision makers) is for those of us who want to maintain Accident and\nEmergency and other Acute Services at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary to keep\nknocking at the Government’s door and to make them take responsibility. They\nare the key to coming to a satisfactory resolution to this crisis. They have\nthe power, they have the funding and it is our responsibility to ensure that\nthey do not evade their responsibilities. So yes Local Kirklees Party Leaders and\ncampaigners need to meet Government Ministers but I do wonder that if at some\npoint thousands of us from Huddersfield are going to need to go down to Westminster\nfor a Mass Rally to make our voices\nheard before this all over. That is one for HandsoffHRI Campaign Team to ponder\nI think.\nSo let’s be united. Let’s work together. Let’s get behind the\npeople of Huddersfield in this vital campaign. They are after all the Leaders\nin this fight. Hands off HRI!\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

The Yougov Poll for the Electoral Reform Society shows the Greens on over 12% beating the Lib Dems into fifth place and anything over 10% gives us a good chance of ensuring we getting a Yorkshire and Humber seat. As I am the Lead Candidate for the the Greens in our Region this is an exciting prospect and gives people who oppose establishment parties, but don't want to vote a Right Wing Conservative Party Mark 2 like UKiP, a real choice. At the last Euro Poll in 2009 the Greens were just over 1% short of winning and lost out narrowly to the BNP who won the sixth seat. The collapse of the BNP and faltering support for the Lib Dems leaves a real opportunity for the Green Party to make a breakthrough.\nIf elected I wouldn't want it to be one off expression of discontent but a positive vote for an MEP who is trying to get more European funds to help create jobs and worthwhile investment in our communities. Someone who is working to improve the energy performance of our homes and businesses and at the same time helping young people develop skills in worthwhile jobs that they can build a life upon. It is locally owned and managed businesses working together that are the key to a truly sustainable economy where wealth is not siphoned out of our communities. As a Green MEP I would want to work with local councils across our Region to support the development of more sustainable local economies that are more resilient to the insecurities of an increasingly globalised economy.\nWhat concerns me about the current state of UK politics is the lack of a positive vision. Negativity and being against things seems to be how many politicians express themselves all of the time. Of course we need to say when we have legitimate concerns about issues affecting our communities but we must spend at least the same amount of time telling people what our vision for a positive future looks like and what we will do to help us get there.\nDetails of the Yougov Poll here\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Despite overwhelming scientific evidence they still cling to the deluded notion that it is somehow a hoax or even worse a conspiracy. The ‘conspiracy’ usually goes along the lines of global warming being invented by the liberal left to impoverish the economy except for their buddies in the green energy sector. So what to do about these deluded desperate deniers while the evidence against their thesis is all but lapping at their feet? Well if they persist in their beliefs against the weight of scientific evidence we have to jump to one of two conclusions. You could, like them, be a conspiracy theorist and say that they’re only taking this position because they have mates working for big energy companies and huge corporations who have profits as their principal amoral motive and that they couldn’t give a flying frack about the future of the ecosystem. Now I’m not by nature a conspiracy theorist (even though I do find them really interesting). UFO’s being hidden by the US, 9/11 being planned by the White House and fake moon landings are all concepts which fascinate me even though they are complete and utter bollocks. So if I don’t believe that climate change denial is just concocted drivel to protect vested interests then it must be an illness of some sort. Now a medical condition is something which we should react to sympathetically. We can’t go around ridiculing people who are ill. I mean what sort of bleeding heart, tree hugging, green liberal are you if you go around behaving like that? So from now on it is help and treatment that need to be order of the day for your Nigel Lawson’s and David Bellamy’s.\nThe real hardcore sufferers though are those in the extreme state of ‘climate change denial\ndenial’ In this manifestation of the condition sufferers deny they don’t believe in climate change but their actions give them away. They cut feed in tariff subsidies to decimate the solar industry, they cut investment in renewable energy projects and champion fracking as a new energy source and call for more gas turbines and a third runway at Heathrow. Would they do this if they really believed in the devastating impact of climate change? Of course not. Crazy as it may seem our own government are sufferers of what I am now calling ‘Canute Syndrome’. King Canute (sometimes spelt ‘Cnut’) is of course the English and Norwegian King who tried to send back the incoming waves from his throne by a beach in Hampshire and got his feet soggy. I fear there are quite a few ‘Cnut’s’ in the cabinet and even more since the reshuffle. Actually Canute is supposed to have been demonstrating his humility before nature and God to his courtiers when he got his feet wet. This is a humility before nature that our current politicians need to demonstrate by their actions or perhaps they should give up their responsibilities and take the treatment they so obviously need in both their best interests and that of the wider planet.\nExcellent blog! And this was published six years ago! Yet the 'debate' over the authenticity of AGW still wrangles through the offices of power... Whilst the rest of the world continues to broil.\nReplyDelete",

We weren’t willing to accept large reductions in care for vulnerable people, and so we took an opposing position (along with the verbal abuse from the 3 larger parties) We are confident we did the right thing.\nFebruary Kirklees successfully gained Fairtrade status, and many community groups, children’s centres and schools joined us in celebrating this achievement during Fairtrade fortnight. The Fairtrade Foundation was successful in gaining the world record for the longest length of bunting and it was all made from Fairtrade cotton. Many of the bunting triangles came from Kirklees. In February I was being re-elected as Chairperson of Newsome Ward Community Forum. The title of Chairperson gives the impression of leading on the work we do, and in some cases that is true, but in other cases, the team just tell me what to do now!\nFebruary included the ongoing debates over the budget and we continued to champion the needs of vulnerable people. We also had a visit from Caroline Lucas Green Party MP, and I hosted the public meeting where she addressed a large crowd, supported by our Andrew. The questions from the public were constructive and considered.\nIn March I went to a free conference provided by the Local Government Association about Localism. I know many people are anxious about the bits of information in the news and how it would affect local people. The conference didn’t help much, it focussed mainly on Social Enterprises and working with the voluntary sector; something I already do a lot of and is commonplace across Kirklees.\nApril I lead on arrangements for a street party in my neighbourhood for the Royal Wedding, and it was great to see so many people, from many different backgrounds, come out to celebrate just being British. April was also very busy with the build up to the local elections, but also very enjoyable, as I got to speak to many positive people.\nMay: What a great result in the Local Elections! I was delighted to have won so convincingly with over 50% of the vote. Thank you to all of you who believe in me – I won’t let you down.\nFollowing the elections I was reappointed as Lead Member for the Council’s Overview and Scrutiny Panel for Resources. It oversees very complex fast moving issues due to the need to restructure the Council due to big reductions in Council budgets. Trying to save £83m without impacting on front line services will be difficult to achieve, e.g. front line workers need to do their own admin / office work as back of house staff are reduced, so they can’t be out doing their main role as much as they used to.\nIn June I was appointed to the Board of Trustees for the One Community Foundation. It was established in May 2010, to generate financial support for local community activities. Our role is to build and manage a series of endowment funds, so that we can make a lasting contribution across Kirklees, by delivering grants to local groups and the wider community. You can help raise funds by doing your on-line Christmas shopping via http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/causes/onecommunity\nIn July, I made time to do a sponsored Dragon Boat Race for the Huddersfield Rotary, and I got to Captain their team. The majority of the money raised went to the two hospices, with a little of the profits going to their local charity funds. I also managed to do the Race for Life this year, I’d not been able to do it for a couple of years, and it was great to be a part of it again.\nThe Newsome Out To Play sub group of the community forum gained funding to develop local play opportunities for children of all ages, arrange training for volunteers, enable better co-ordination of activity, etc. One of the highlights of the year was the Play Day event on 3rd August; I was amazed by how many people joined in.\nAugust: Newsome High School had tremendous GCSE results, and is going from strength to strength. I’ve been a Governor at the school for several years and I’m so pleased with the continual improvements and achievements.\nSeptember: Members of CPRE (Campaign for the Protection of Rural England) arranged for us to talk to local residents at a public meeting in Hall Bower Chapel, which was very helpful. Andrew and I were able to share our views about the impending Localism Bill and the National Planning Policy Framework, and listen to concerns of local people.\nOctober: While I was Mayor of Kirklees, I chose to champion local farming and local food production, and this campaign had several lasting legacies. In October I was delighted to help present awards to several more schools who have achieved the Soil Association Food for Life Bronze Awards. We now have 24 local schools who have achieved this award and 25 more progressing towards it. The School Catering Service itself has achieved the Soil Association’s Bronze Food for Life Catering Mark for its healthy meals supplied to 184 schools across Kirklees. The March figures show that Kirklees Catering Service was the second largest local authority caterer in the country and the only one in the Yorkshire and Humber region to have achieved this award.\nNovember:\nThere is a Special Meeting of Council scheduled for 23rd November regarding the LDF, which hadn’t taken place at the time of writing this report. We will do all we can to influence the LDF policies; to protect our valuable open spaces, to ensure there is space for agriculture, and to ensure development is targeted at the real needs of our communities.\nDecember: We’ve arranged a Special Public meeting for 1st December to help raise awareness about Welfare Reform. Another huge challenge facing everyone is the cuts to benefits, there are 47 in total which are being introduced in stages until April 2013. One of the biggest changes will be the Housing Benefit changes which will be introduced in January. Council have produced an information booklet to try and help. Copies are available at Together Shop in Newsome, as well as Children’s Centres, Council Information Points and Job Centre Plus.\nThe Budget process starts again in December, meaning another series of briefings and debates on the best way to manage the huge reduction in funds provided by the Government. It’s a position no one would want to be in and some tough decisions will need to be made. I’m not looking forward to it, but I do take it very seriously and will be taking an active part in the process.\nThe ‘Kiddies Xmas Party’ takes place again on 10th December, all organised by volunteers of Newsome Ward Community Forum, and always a wonderful occasion; the start of the Christmas season for me. I’ll be doing the ‘Santa Dash’, organised by the Lions Club of Huddersfield, in Huddersfield the next day to help raise funds for the Mayor’s Charity Appeal – the ‘Forget Me Not Trust’; a very seasonal weekend.\nThroughout the year, casework for individuals seems to be getting more complex; I’ve helped people with things that are common concerns e.g. planning, highways, cleansing issues, but this year there seems to be an increasing number of more personal issues, e.g. home care, care for people with dementia, domestic violence, and anti-social behaviour.\nDespite this sad note to end on, I am looking forward to Christmas and wish you all warmth, health and happiness this Christmas and for the year ahead.\nCllr Julie Stewart-Turner\nThis has been a year full of new and difficult challenges; here’s some of those challenges along with some highlights.\nJanuary: Andrew and I started the year being very heavily involved in budget briefings and debates. We weren’t willing to accept large reductions in care for vulnerable people, and so we took an opposing position (along with the verbal abuse from the 3 larger parties) We are confident we did the right thing.\nFebruary Kirklees successfully gained Fairtrade status, and many community groups, children’s centres and schools joined us in celebrating this achievement during Fairtrade fortnight. The Fairtrade Foundation was successful in gaining the world record for the longest length of bunting and it was all made from Fairtrade cotton. Many of the bunting triangles came from Kirklees. In February I was being re-elected as Chairperson of Newsome Ward Community Forum. The title of Chairperson gives the impression of leading on the work we do, and in some cases that is true, but in other cases, the team just tell me what to do now!\nFebruary included the ongoing debates over the budget and we continued to champion the needs of vulnerable people. We also had a visit from Caroline Lucas Green Party MP, and I hosted the public meeting where she addressed a large crowd, supported by our Andrew. The questions from the public were constructive and considered.\nIn March I went to a free conference provided by the Local Government Association about Localism. I know many people are anxious about the bits of information in the news and how it would affect local people. The conference didn’t help much, it focussed mainly on Social Enterprises and working with the voluntary sector; something I already do a lot of and is commonplace across Kirklees.\nApril I lead on arrangements for a street party in my neighbourhood for the Royal Wedding, and it was great to see so many people, from many different backgrounds, come out to celebrate just being British. April was also very busy with the build up to the local elections, but also very enjoyable, as I got to speak to many positive people.\nMay: What a great result in the Local Elections! I was delighted to have won so convincingly with over 50% of the vote. Thank you to all of you who believe in me – I won’t let you down.\nFollowing the elections I was reappointed as Lead Member for the Council’s Overview and Scrutiny Panel for Resources. It oversees very complex fast moving issues due to the need to restructure the Council due to big reductions in Council budgets. Trying to save £83m without impacting on front line services will be difficult to achieve, e.g. front line workers need to do their own admin / office work as back of house staff are reduced, so they can’t be out doing their main role as much as they used to.\nIn June I was appointed to the Board of Trustees for the One Community Foundation. It was established in May 2010, to generate financial support for local community activities. Our role is to build and manage a series of endowment funds, so that we can make a lasting contribution across Kirklees, by delivering grants to local groups and the wider community. You can help raise funds by doing your on-line Christmas shopping via http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/causes/onecommunity\nIn July, I made time to do a sponsored Dragon Boat Race for the Huddersfield Rotary, and I got to Captain their team. The majority of the money raised went to the two hospices, with a little of the profits going to their local charity funds. I also managed to do the Race for Life this year, I’d not been able to do it for a couple of years, and it was great to be a part of it again.\nThe Newsome Out To Play sub group of the community forum gained funding to develop local play opportunities for children of all ages, arrange training for volunteers, enable better co-ordination of activity, etc. One of the highlights of the year was the Play Day event on 3rd August; I was amazed by how many people joined in.\nAugust: Newsome High School had tremendous GCSE results, and is going from strength to strength. I’ve been a Governor at the school for several years and I’m so pleased with the continual improvements and achievements.\nSeptember: Members of CPRE (Campaign for the Protection of Rural England) arranged for us to talk to local residents at a public meeting in Hall Bower Chapel, which was very helpful. Andrew and I were able to share our views about the impending Localism Bill and the National Planning Policy Framework, and listen to concerns of local people.\nOctober: While I was Mayor of Kirklees, I chose to champion local farming and local food production, and this campaign had several lasting legacies. In October I was delighted to help present awards to several more schools who have achieved the Soil Association Food for Life Bronze Awards. We now have 24 local schools who have achieved this award and 25 more progressing towards it. The School Catering Service itself has achieved the Soil Association’s Bronze Food for Life Catering Mark for its healthy meals supplied to 184 schools across Kirklees. The March figures show that Kirklees Catering Service was the second largest local authority caterer in the country and the only one in the Yorkshire and Humber region to have achieved this award.\nNovember:\nThere is a Special Meeting of Council scheduled for 23rd November regarding the LDF, which hadn’t taken place at the time of writing this report. We will do all we can to influence the LDF policies; to protect our valuable open spaces, to ensure there is space for agriculture, and to ensure development is targeted at the real needs of our communities.\nDecember: We’ve arranged a Special Public meeting for 1st December to help raise awareness about Welfare Reform. Another huge challenge facing everyone is the cuts to benefits, there are 47 in total which are being introduced in stages until April 2013. One of the biggest changes will be the Housing Benefit changes which will be introduced in January. Council have produced an information booklet to try and help. Copies are available at Together Shop in Newsome, as well as Children’s Centres, Council Information Points and Job Centre Plus.\nThe Budget process starts again in December, meaning another series of briefings and debates on the best way to manage the huge reduction in funds provided by the Government. It’s a position no one would want to be in and some tough decisions will need to be made. I’m not looking forward to it, but I do take it very seriously and will be taking an active part in the process.\nThe ‘Kiddies Xmas Party’ takes place again on 10th December, all organised by volunteers of Newsome Ward Community Forum, and always a wonderful occasion; the start of the Christmas season for me. I’ll be doing the ‘Santa Dash’, organised by the Lions Club of Huddersfield, in Huddersfield the next day to help raise funds for the Mayor’s Charity Appeal – the ‘Forget Me Not Trust’; a very seasonal weekend.\nThroughout the year, casework for individuals seems to be getting more complex; I’ve helped people with things that are common concerns e.g. planning, highways, cleansing issues, but this year there seems to be an increasing number of more personal issues, e.g. home care, care for people with dementia, domestic violence, and anti-social behaviour.\nDespite this sad note to end on, I am looking forward to Christmas and wish you all warmth, health and happiness this Christmas and for the year ahead.\nCllr Julie Stewart-Turner\nCouncillor Derek Hardcastle – 2011 Annual Report to Kirkburton Residents\nCouncillor Derek Hardcastle – 2011 Annual Report\nDear Resident,\nThis year has been one of the most challenging in my time as one of your local Councillors. We have had one of the toughest budget settlements the Council has ever had to face with central government slashing £80 million from Kirklees Council services over the next 4 years with no reduction in the Council Tax we have to pay. We have had the Local Development Framework which threatens green fields and spaces (and not just greenbelt) right across the district. It is against this background that the Green Party team have been continuing to take up issues at the Kirklees and Parish level.\nIn February this year the Green Party leader and MP for Brighton Pavillion visited Huddersfield and we held a well attended public meeting the evening before Kirklees Councils budget decision. I must say she is a real asset to our Party and has impressed many people with her insights into the actions of the government and the impacts of the cuts on ordinary families up and down the country.\nIn the Council Budget meeting the Green Party stood alone in opposing Council cuts to services for elderly and vulnerable people. The majority of the cuts fell on those in the greatest need. The budget for care for older people was slashed from £52 million to £40 million. Daycare services were cut from £5.3million to £1.5million. We believed as a matter of principle that to cut services for those who are in the direst circumstances is morally wrong particularly when the bankers who got us into this economic crisis seem to be able to continue to reap the same rewards as before. You don’t have to be a ‘socialist’ to see that this is wrong. The Green Party made these points strongly in the Kirklees Budget meeting in February and received a lot of abuse from the other Parties on the Council for making that stand. We still believe it was right that we spoke for those in most need. As it turned out some of the proposed cuts to day care services were withdrawn following a legal challenge which has at least brought respite for some people. What really annoys me is when cuts are characterised as ‘improvements’ to services. If we have to make cuts the least the Council can do is be upfront with people about the impacts on heir everyday lives.\nThis year was the end of my first 4 years as one of your Councillors and so I was up re-election in May. What I really enjoyed was getting round to seeing so many people in the run up to the election. It is a huge ward that stretches from Farnley Tyas to Flockton so we had a big area to get round. As usual it was a nail biting election count and I was re-elected by 82 votes but then I‘ve lost by 5 in the past so I was very pleased. I still can’t get used to the misinformation and half truths from my local opponents that I get during local campaigns. There were some very misleading statements about my attendance at meetings and dodgy montages of a wind turbine at Grange Moor (which I actually opposed at Planning Committee). All I can really say to people is that if you see some criticism of us in our opponents please don’t take it at face value please ring me or one of my colleagues and we’ll give you a straight story. Having said all that I found my Conservative opponent Amanda Shaw to be a pleasant and capable candidate and I’m sure she wasn’t responsible for much of the material in her leaflets.\nThe other elections that were held this year were those for the Parish Council and I was really pleased that the Green Party got the most votes and Parish seats of all the parties and that every village in the Kirkburton Ward has a Green representative. We are the only party that can make that claim. Our candidates topped the poll in Kirkburton/Highburton, Shepley, Grange Moor and Farnley Tyas and Thurstonland. Thank you to everyone who voted for us.\nOf course the day to day role of a Councillor is taking up local issues. Here’s a small selection of the issues we’ve taken up this year:-\n• Getting Moor Top Avenue resurfaced at Thurstonland\n• Helping get funding for ‘The Hub’ at Kirkburton\n• Helping get a new bench for Stocksmoor (then getting Kirklees to turn it round to face the right way!)\n• Helping householders with planning advice for installing solar panels on their roofs\n• New street lighting for Grange Moor on Bedford Avenue\nThere are issues which continue to frustrate me such as the need to get the footpath at Paddock Road in Kirkburton resurfaced. I must confess that it has been difficult to get this issue resolved been one voice among three local Councillors who don’t share my view on this. The other issue I really want to see progressed is traffic calming in Stocksmoor. We successfully worked with local people in Farnley Tyas and Thurstonland on their schemes now we need to get some impetus behind resolving issues in Stocksmoor. My Parish Colleagues Robert Barraclough and Andrew Cooper are helping me and liaising with the village association.\nWind turbines continues to be a concern for some householders and I and my Green Party colleagues have taken a balance approaching where we have opposed those that are poorly sited and intrusive and supported those that aren’t. I have opposed new turbines at Shelley and Grange Moor but supported 2 small turbines on farmland at Thurstonland. Sadly there was a rather political letter produced at Kirklees expense distributed in Thurstonland by the 2 Conservative Councillors on the subject of the wind turbines and the Green Party response to this. I have no objection to people putting their opinions in a leaflet and letter but no funded by the Council Tax. We have always taken the trouble to speak to the Thurstonland Village Association about local concerns and we had in this instance and I think actually talking through some of the issues we managed to address a number of concerns people had which were associated with much larger turbines.\nMy year will end very much like the last one. I will be driving a minibus on Boxing Day from Flockton to Grange Moor through Lepton and on to town. We have been running this free service for local people for 4 years now and I really enjoy it.\nA Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all.\nYours sincerely\nCouncillor Derek Hardcastle\nDear Resident,\nThis year has been one of the most challenging in my time as one of your local Councillors.

He has lived and worked in the Kirkburton ward all his life and is a tenant farmer at Farnley Tyas. He became involved with the National Farmers Union (NFU) in 1994 becoming Local Branch chairman until 2003 holding office through both the BSE and Foot & Mouth crises. During this period he also represented the NFU on the Kirkburton Parish Council Environment Committee.\nRobert said of his nomination as Green Party candidate,\n“I will aim to make a real difference as a local Councillor for the Kirkburton Ward. It is an area I know well and have a genuine concern for, which goes beyond party politics. I already engage with local groups in the area and am always keen to see community involvement in the delivery of local projects. During my time as Chairman of the Parish Council I was able to meet and help a number of community organisations across the area so I feel well placed and up for the challenge of representing our area at the Kirklees level.”\nCouncillor Derek Hardcastle said,\n“People who know Robert know he can be trusted, is straightforward and hardworking . He is a real asset to our area and I would greatly value his support on Kirklees Council.”\nGreen Party Council Leader Councillor Andrew Cooper,\n“I’m really pleased Robert has been selected as our prospective candidate. His knowledge of rural and community issues is very strong and he brings a whole new set of skills to the Green Party Team.”\nTuesday, 6 December 2011\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper –Annual Report 2011 to Newsome Ward residents\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper –Annual Report 2011\nThis has been my twelfth year as one of your local Councillors and almost certainly one of the busiest I can remember. Much of the beginning of 2011 was dedicated to the Kirklees Council budget as we grappled with the £80 million of cuts imposed on Kirklees by the Coalition Government. I spent hours in budget meetings going over proposals to come up with a solution which did not result in huge cuts to adult social care. In the end I and my Green Party colleagues were not prepared to vote for the Kirklees budget as a matter of conscience and principle. We could not vote for a budget which saw care for older people reduced from £52 million to around £40 million over the next 4 years and Day Care Services to drop from £5.3 million to £1.5 million and all this at a time when the demand for these services is likely to rise. All this is happening at a time when the banks are seemingly unscathed, benefits are being cut and services are disappearing all around us.\nPlanning was also a major item for me in this Council year. I was the only Councillor, not on the Planning Committee to speak against the proposed Tesco development to be built on the site of the current Sports Centre. Bizarrely many of the Councillors on the Planning Committee had huge reservations but ended up voting for it. Could it have been anything to do with the ‘bung’ Kirklees were getting from Tesco to build a new Sports Centre at Springwood? Also last month I attended and spoke at the Public Enquiry into the Tesco Planning Decision along with Barry Sheerman MP who spoke in favour of the Planning Decision being overturned.\nAnother key big issue this year was changes to planning policy both at the national and local level. The Coalition Government has introduced a new National Planning Policy Framework which in a nutshell makes it easier for developers to build on greenfield sites. I have spoke out regarding this issue at a number of meetings including a well attended one at Hall Bower Chapel. I have also used links with the Local Government Association to get some direct input into the Conservative Minister responsible Eric Pickles MP. As things stand I don’t anticipate much change. At the Kirklees level we have the Local Development Framework which will contain the policies which guide where housing will and will not be developed working with Julie and Graham we are continuing to press hard on the Labour led Council not to allocate greenfield land for development we have particularly mentioned land adjacent to New Laithe Hill and Jackroyd Lane on a number of occasions. We’ll keep people updated with developments.\nI was particularly pleased this year to welcome Green Party leader Caroline Lucas MP to Huddersfield. She spoke at a meeting in February in the Hudawi Centre about her work as an MP and the impact of government cuts.\nThe Newsome Ward continues to be a national beacon for renewable energy and I was able to help Newsome South Methodist Church with sourcing funding to get solar panels installed on their roof. The Church did a lot of fund raising itself and the panels will help them save electricity costs and provide funds to keep this well used community building going.\nWhen I first started knocking on doors in Newsome in 1993 I took up the issue of traffic calming on Hangingstone Road Berry Brow. This year we finally got the funding sorted out. I asked the Highways Engineer leading the project how old he was in 1993 and he told me he was just 5! In the end the real success of this was local people getting together to put their case strongly to Kirklees with me as local councillor providing help and guidance.\nI continue to be a strong supporter of the Growing Newsome project and I share an allotment in Primrose Hill where I’ve grown food now for the last couple of years. I‘m especially pleased that the Stirley Farm project is up and running to support local food initiatives and it now has its own cattle in addition to its vegetable and fruit growing activities. It is important that the green land around the area is worked and useful to protect it from those would see it as ripe development land but it is also a great project in its own right and lots of local people are getting involved.\nOne issue which has affected a great number of people in the Ward has been Labour’s proposed £30 charge for permit parking. Many people in Aspley, Highfields and Springwood are on low or fixed incomes and even though many don’t have, or can’t afford, a car they are able to offer visitors, carers and relatives a car parking space. This proposed charge is effectively a £30 increase on the Council Tax for people who are generally on lower incomes. I have been very vocal on this issue in Council and have asked for an equalities impact assessment to be carried out on this decision.\nI was originally a sceptic but now have a ‘blog’ www.greeningkirklees.blogspot.com which is basically an online diary of my views and opinions on things affecting the Newsome Ward and Kirklees in general. Again I was sceptical about Twitter but now I am an avid user of it. If you want to ‘follow’ me I’m at @clrandrewcooper\nMy New Year will begin as it did last year driving Newsome’s New Years Day Bus Service. This is now in it’s 19th year and thanks to everyone who helps with and uses this service.\nI wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.\nAndrew Cooper\nThis has been my twelfth year as one of your local Councillors and almost certainly one of the busiest I can remember.

RJ Bray can be forgiven for taking some of the dubious misinformation from Government and in the papers about the cost of Feed In Tariffs at face value but maybe not on describing me as \"Clr Khan’s friendly Green \". More research required R J! If he'd stuck 'occasionally' in front that would be fine! Anyway here's R J followed by myself\nKIRKLEES Council leader Clr Mehboob Khan’s latest gripe is that money which he hoped to receive for a solar energy panel scheme which were to be fitted to 1,000 council properties has now been cancelled.\nClr Khan’s friendly Green Clr Andrew Cooper told the Examiner that it was a blow to the elderly and vulnerable people currently living in fuel poverty.\nSo does Clr Cooper’s statement mean that there are only 1,000 people in the Huddersfield area living in fuel poverty and all are currently living in council property? I think not.\nCome the cold months myself and her that shall be obeyed will be wearing more layers than an onion has skins due to the criminally high energy prices.\nClr Khan and Clr Cooper I feel would have more credibility if they represented the collective rather than a select few.\nWhy do they not campaign for cheaper energy for everyone or more winter fuel allowance for those in more need?\nInstead, they help create higher energy bills for people by having them fund through their meters the feed-in tariffs for those who have solar panels or wind turbines.\nIn this manner they also put more money into the energy companies’ pockets. In all fairness, is this right?\nAlternative energy will never drive our country forward. It will have the reverse effect and send our country back to the Stone Age.\nIndustry along with our homes cannot be sustained by wind, solar or wave power. It’s a little like a dripping tap into an empty reservoir at the height of summer.\nThe country needs a nuclear project and it needs it now if we are to get away from fossil fuels and be less dependent on gas from overseas. Let’s not forget the madcap carbon capture process that is to get underway at the cost of billions of pounds to the taxpayer along with industry itself.\nMaybe Clr Khan and Clr Cooper could ask for some money from that major worthless project called the European Union which drives these schemes.\nI agree that we must pollute our atmosphere less and giant steps have been taken – but let us remember that this cannot be at the cost of the extinction of mankind, otherwise what has it all been for?\nR J Bray\nShelley\nRead More http://www.examiner.co.uk/views-and-blogs/reader-letters/2011/12/03/examiner-letters-june-2011-86081-29886400/#ixzz1fgGUnGIB\nTo the Editor\nRJ Bray (Examiner 3/12) takes me to task for my dismay over the government cuts to the funding of the Feed In Tariff for solar panels and in particular the suspending of the Council scheme to install solar panels on the homes of 1000 Council Tenants. He says,\n“does Clr Cooper’s statement mean that there are only 1,000 people in the Huddersfield area living in fuel poverty and all are currently living in council property?”\nNo I don’t, but it would be a start to help those people by running such a scheme which could then be expanded later. There are also currently schemes available for private householders where the panels are installed for free and the householders get the benefit of the electricity in return for handing the Feed in Tariff to the installing company. A number of households around Huddersfield have done this already. If he wants details I’ll pass them onto him. Of course not everyone can benefit from this scheme due to the orientation or size of their roof but many can. So the existing policy framework for solar is one which many people can take advantage of but changes by the government threaten its viability for everyone.\nMr Bray says that Feed In Tariffs,\n“help create higher energy bills for people by having them fund through their meters the feed-in tariffs for those who have solar panels or wind turbines”\nThe actual impact of the Feed In Tariff policy on energy bills last year was 30p for the average household. This is less than a penny a week. The cost of a new nuclear power station, which Mr Bray is so keen on, can be a round £4.25 Billion and that doesn’t take into account the decommissioning costs and the costly handling of dangerous nuclear waste. This will have a much more significant impact on energy bills.\nHe asks of myself and Cllr Khan,\n“Why do they not campaign for cheaper energy for everyone”\nI don’t presume to speak for Cllr Khan but for my part I successfully proposed making insulation free for all householders in Kirklees, I was the trustee of a national fuel poverty charity for 8 years and have helped many householders reduce their fuel bills through advice on energy tariffs and by getting information out to householders on a number of ways to help reduce fuel bills. So I don’t believe I’m deficient in wanting to help people reduce their bills.\nMr Bray goes on to say,\n“Industry along with our homes cannot be sustained by wind, solar or wave power.”\nI agree to a point. In addition we are going to need greater levels of energy efficiency in buildings better controls and energy management, district heating systems, anaerobic digestion and a whole host of other actions to make the future of energy supply in the UK more secure. Althis l does rather beg a question why only Malta and Luxembourg in Europe have a worse proportion of their energy generated from renewable sources than the UK. What is technically possible on the continent seems somehow difficult here. The laws of physics are not different this side of the channel but some attitudes, prejudices and opinions among some certainly are.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper - Green Party\nSaturday, 3 December 2011\nFIT to drop! Solar PV - A question of priorities\nSomehow I can’t separate in my mind the cuts in Solar PV tariffs from other unrelated news items other than they are all outpourings of policy announcements from Government.\nThe basic mantra from Climate Change Minister Greg Barker is ‘Solar PV is expensive, the tariffs are unaffordable, capital costs are dropping so fast that the FIT is overgenerous that’s why we are cutting it. Its times not right yet for mass deployment, it’s a regressive tax on energy bills and adversely affects the fuel poor. Its like the poll tax and we all know how unpopular that was!’\n| A ground mounted PV install in Brockholes where I live. Will the flag be at half mast on the 12th of December when the FIT rate drops? |\nSomehow I can’t separate in my mind the cuts in Solar PV tariffs from other unrelated news items other than they are all outpourings of policy announcements from Government.\nThe basic mantra from Climate Change Minister Greg Barker is ‘Solar PV is expensive, the tariffs are unaffordable, capital costs are dropping so fast that the FIT is overgenerous that’s why we are cutting it. Its times not right yet for mass deployment, it’s a regressive tax on energy bills and adversely affects the fuel poor. Its like the poll tax and we all know how unpopular that was!’\nThis line doesn’t stand a lot of examination but it represents their expressed views and it would seem that DECC have pulled the drawbridge up on this one and are sticking their fingers in their ears to reasoned argument. So given it only cost a few million last year, the equivalent of 30p on the average energy bill what other things have the government been spending our money on? Well there’s the £600 million for Free Schools, a totally unnecessary support for a new school system usually parent led which will run parallel and in addition to local authority schools. There was the £250 million by Eric Pickles offered to councils to recommence weekly bin collections which actually nobody is much bothered about. Then there’s all the money for new infrastructure projects that has been announced this week. All this yet solar PV a technology that has been made available for the fuel rich and the fuel poor, that can be quickly deployed, that significantly reduces fuel cost and carbon emissions is regarded as too expensive (it isn’t). It simply doesn’t add up as an argument. You can’t really believe that they believe it. When we are talking about expanding nuclear generation this is couched in the terms of energy security and there’s no real reference to the impact on energy bills. The same arguments could be used for solar PV but they aren’t. So what is really going on? I’ll stick my neck out and say that it must be lobbying from the energy generators and suppliers. How would you feel if your monopoly over the provision of electricity was under threat from millions of people sticking solar panels on their roofs and then you have to pay them for the privilege. I’ve heard no mutterings, I have no proof but given the government’s position on FITs isn’t really credible this seems like a believable explanation. DECC Ministers may wag their fingers at the suppliers and generators but ultimately they’re going to need them to pursue their energy ambitions for new nuclear. May lord have mercy on us all!\nWednesday, 30 November 2011\nPensions Strike\nA really inspiring turnout today from Unions, staff and folk generally expressing their concern about the cuts. I couldn't stay too long unfortunately but I did make the mistake of telling Cllr Khan it was my birthday. Apparently after the video finishes they sang me a rendition of Happy Birthday. I wish I'd had time to see it. Thanks Mehboob - I think!\nWhat I think was a real game changer for this March was that it wasn't just the usual suspects in the crowd. The crowd for one thing was a lot bigger which reflects the fact that the concern is more deeply routed than those who are permanently politically aware and motivated. It also recognises the links between large scale public sector cuts and the assault on public pensions. If this is the way things are now what are they going to be like in another 12 months, 2 years or the 6 months of pain we are told we have. The government haven't a mandate for these policies and their therefore legitimacy is highly questionable. I don't think I've ever see a government in this country that is more divisive than this.

The viability of younger people being able to enter the housing market will be increasingly stifled due to the impact of tuition fees which will mean that when students leave college and start receiving the sort of salaries they would need to consider the purchase of a property they will start having to repay those fees.\nWhile we recognise that there is an increasing social need for more housing, the mere projection of house building figures in the absence of interventionist social and economic policies will not create the construction of needed housing units. Rather it will give greater licence to the speculative builder of executive properties on green field sites. Without changes in government policy which will support the development of social housing, an open supply‐side private housing market cannot solve this problem, but only create distortions of excessive building on green field sites whilst leaving the overall stock of needed housing low.\nSimply making land available in its own terms will not deliver new housing so the LDF’s own targets are not realisable due to the underlying economic conditions the UK is in and the lack of policies to stimulate an economic revival and develop social housing.\nPast performance on housing completions does not support the targets given in the LDF document. The average number of completions between 2000 and 2010 was 1248 per year and even this level is skewed due to particularly high years. Expectations of mainly 1500 completions per year across the plan are clearly unattainable.\nIf our figures were to be adopted this would require no housing development on land that is currently in the greenbelt. We wish to see development in Grimescar, Honley, Meltham and Brockholes taken out of the plan. Just as the Local Development Framework has proposed to remove greenbelt status from nominated areas we would add land below Castle Hill bordered by High Lane and New Laithe Hill which is directly adjacent to greenbelt land and part of the backdrop to the historic and iconic Victoria Tower on Castle Hill.\nLike the Government asserts we also believe in Localism and support the concept of Neighbourhood Development Plans where communities establish what land they would like to see developed in their area above and beyond those targets set in the LDF. Our fear is that the Government's belief in localism is only skin deep and that the Government through the Planning Inspectorate would favour developers rather than communities.\nWe believe that where previously undeveloped land is to be developed that this should be constructed to a higher environmental standard than those proposed in building regulations in terms of energy performance and sustainable urban drainage.\nWe recognise that there is value in the juxtaposition of new design and new technology with heritage assets such as modern glass atriums on church buildings and solar panels being utilised on older properties and we would expect the LDF to include policies that support that approach.\nOverall the Kirklees Local Plan should not only consider the urban settlements on a quantitative basis, but qualitatively take into account their unique features of these different communities taking into account their urban, rural and environmental factors .

To any informed outside observer this must have been nonsense. Up and down the country Councils had been pursuing schemes to install panels on their own buildings and council houses having done the maths and concluded their proposals were self financing. Possibly Winchester knew something the rest of us didn’t about the FIT cuts that were coming over the horizon.\nThe implications of the Governments rushed review of the Feed In Tariff rates for solar photovoltaics are significant and in many ways tragic. In Leeds the City Council had innovative plans to use the Feed In Tariff incomes from installations on Council houses to help finance free insulation for private homes. That great idea would now appear to be a total dead duck. In Kirklees we have/had a thousand house solar PV programme some of which are in the Newsome Ward. I’ve asked the Council’s Leader Councillor Khan and the Chief Executive to see what can be done to accelerate installations ahead of the cut. It’s going to be difficult and I anticipate a lot of weekend working to get PV systems commissioned and working ahead of the deadline.\nSo why are government making this cut? Well the first thing to say is that this is not public money we are talking about so this is not saving you and me tax. We do however all pay for the feed in tariff through a levy on our fuel bills along with a number of charges which subsidise nuclear and renewable programmes. The FIT element of this is reckoned to cost the average household around 30 pence per year or less than 1 penny/week. As the FIT is the result of public policy however it is counted in the governments Public Sector Borrowing Requirement and so Treasury has put a cap on it OR as Climate Change Minister Greg Barker refers to it ‘a budget’. Given the very low cost of the tariff the cap is obviously set very low demonstrating a very limited ambition by government for the solar sector. Government’s argument is that the capital costs for installing PV have dropped dramatically and therefore the FIT should drop. While this is true it is only half the story. Government are ignoring the fact that demand for PV has been generated by the level of FIT that has in turn helped generate the economies of scale that have enabled prices to come down. So if you reduce the FIT rate then capital costs are likely to start rising significantly. There is probably a reasoned argument for a limited FIT reduction but not one of over 50% that will put companies out of business and make thousands unemployed.\nThe cuts to the FIT rates take effect on the 12th of December yet the consultation on the review of feed in tariffs is due to close on the 23rd of December. So Merry Christmas everybody! This is just one of the reasons that solar companies are pursuing legal routes to challenge government over this abomination of a consultation. The other reason is that right now there will be many millions of pounds worth of solar panels and inverters on the high seas already bought and paid for by British companies on the understanding of a return based on current FIT rates. Some of these solar panels will have been destined for Council projects such as those planned for Kirklees, Leeds and York but NOT Hampshire.\n| Many council and free solar schemes have checked into the Sundown Motel |\nA few weeks ago, and somewhat inexplicably,Winchester City Council in Hampshire cancelled its plans to install solar panels on their municipal buildings as they said that they did not stack up financially and that the prices they got back from their tender were not what they were expecting.

Following newspaper reports and mistakenly leaked documents it has become clear that the Government has plans to halve the Feed In Tariffs for solar photovoltaic panels.\nCurrently people can claim 43 pence for every kilowatt of electricity they generate off their roof but the government now plans to cut this to around 21p from the beginning of December.\nCouncillor Cooper who has solar panels himself said,\n“If people install solar panels now before the cut is due to take place in December then they will get the 43p rate for the next 25 years if they were to install them after that they would get less than half that.”\nI recommend that people get three quotes from local companies. You can save significant amounts of money by comparing the prices of installers. A list of installers in our area can be obtained from the Yorkshire and Humber Microgeneration Partnership website www.yhmp.org\nYou should make sure your contractors and the components they install are registered under the Microgeneration Certification Scheme. All companies on the www.yhmp.org website should be.\nIt is also worth checking the warranty period on the solar panels and the inverter which converts the DC electricity from the panels into the AC electricity that we use in our homes. You can get warranties of over 20 years for solar panels but it can vary more with inverters.\nIf you can’t afford the capital cost of solar panels then there are companies that will install them on your house for free. They claim the feed in tariff and you get the benefit of the electricity generated of the roof saving you around £150 - £250 per year depending on the number of panels you have and the current cost of electricity. One such company is A Shade Greener who are based in Tankersley www.ashadegreener.co.uk another is Home Sun www.homesun.com\nCommenting on these cuts Councillor Cooper said,\n“These cuts by the government are nonsensical. Over 25,000 people are employed in the solar industry and these cuts are a threat to them. The cost of the Feed In Tarrif is very small less than 50p/year on the average fuel bill and a fraction of the cost of government subsidies of nuclear power stations. As always it is those on the lowest incomes who will suffer the most. This cut will jeopardise free solar schemes for people unable to afford the upfront costs of solar panels and planned schemes for council tenants properties which are self funding under current Feed In Tariff arrangements but may not be following the proposed cut. The government’s claim to be the Greenest Government ever is looking increasingly hollow and lacking in substance.”\nSunday, 23 October 2011\nGrowing Newsome Grows and Grows -Autumn Gathering on Saturday\n| Kim Warren of Stirley Farm.Pumpkin maker extraordinaire |\n| Hardy winter veg and seedlings on offer for donations |\n| Cut price fleece and netting for your allotment.

We had Lib Dem Councillor James Blanchard with what I presume was a planted a question to Councillor Khan on the Green Party’s record as the administration on Brighton City Council. Basically the question was implying that the Greens there had broken a manifesto commitment to lower Councillors allowances and top executives pay. On the basis of past planted questions to Cllr Khan on the subject I was pretty sure this was a load of.... rubbish (that was the word I was searching for). I sent a quick email to Brighton Green Party Councillor and Cabinet Member for finance Jason KitKat for his view. The other point to make is that the question goes against the Councils Constitution in that it has nothing to do with the area of responsibility of the Leader of the Council nor was it anything to do with the Kirklees area. Of course if I’d made that point before the question was made or the dubious answer given then I’d have been accused of trying to hide what the Greens were doing in Brighton. So I let them have their fun then made a point of order pointing out the question was out of order and read Jason Kitkat’s email to me which conveniently arrived a couple of minutes before the question was put and said,\n“Not true. Our Chief Exec reduced his salary by 5% and tomorrow we are voting on report to reduce the total cost of councillors allowances and expenses packages.” (see it on Kirklees Webcast here 2.22 in)\nThere’s a pattern of Green bashing and misinformation going on here from Mehboob (see Wrath of Khan) and its strange that Cllr Blanchard somehow or other gives credence to him. All good knockabout stuff of course but you do wonder what the point is.\nThe other source of misinformation in the Council meeting was Lib Dem Councillor Kath Pinnock. A debate was held on Kirklees proposals to outsource Adult Homecare provision as the result of 5000 signature petition. Independent Councillor Edgar Holroyd-Doveton spoke in support of the petitioners and also later proposed a motion to promote a public sector ethos for care homes and services. Councillor Pinnock decided that this meant the Holme Valley Independents wanted to bring all Homecare services inhouse (they don't) and tweeted,\n“Holme Valley Independent Cllr now proposing action to raise council tax 12.5% costing every tax payer about £100 extra a year”\nAll pretty shameless stuff from Councillor Pinnock, but consistent with her usual approach and her dubious relationship with the truth.\nThe Lib Dems put forward a motion on restricting speed limits to 20 in residential areas on the basis that it will help road safety. All good stuff and not anything new in that we’ve all been pushing for this for a long time but Highways officers always block it on the basis that if there are no physical measures in place e.g. humps, ramps, chicanes then the speed restrictions would be ignored and unenforceable. I’ve disagreed with this approach for a long time and agree that we should send a message, even if it is just with signange, that residential areas are low speed zones. Unfortunately the motion was not put, due to time restrictions, but I would have pointed out that Lib Dem/Con Government proposals to raise the motorway speed limit to 80 will probably lead to more deaths and certainly more carbon emissions. I wanted to know if the Lib Dems had done the maths to work out if they would save more lives with the ‘20s Plenty’ policy than they lost on the ‘80s plenty’ policy.\nThere was another motion on the changes to constituency boundaries which is going to see around 50 Parliamentary seats going across the country. There are some fairly crazy new boundaries being proposed with Dewsbury being split between 3 MPs. Ultimately though you have got to ask why the Lib Dems agreed to this with the Conservatives in their coalition agreement without getting an agreement on some form of Proportional Representation. Instead they just got a referendum on an inferior form of PR, the Alternative Vote. They seem to have been taken to the cleaners in their negotiations on the coalition agreement. What a wasted opportunity.\nAs usual we didn’t get through the agenda and Edgar’s motion was curtailed at the 9.00pm deadline and despite me seconding the motion and reserving the right to speak the larger parties voted against our proposal to extend the Council meeting so we could debate the motion properly.\nFriday, 14 October 2011\nJobs, Homes and Cows\n| Jobs and homes and that's it! |\nIn planning policy at the national level I've had a very small victory recently in the Local Government Association's response to the consultation on the National Planning Policy Framework. It is a much reviled document and the Coalition Government has attacked some of the 'anti growth/anti capitalist' orgainsations that have had the temerity to oppose them. These include the National Trust, English Heritage and the Campaign to Protect Rural England. The LGA has to balance its responses to consultations against the competing views of different political parties and the ruling Conservative Group. I am the Independent Cllrs group rep on the LGA Environment and Housing Board (the Greens are included with Independents). Of course the LGA response is much more restrained than the Green Party's but I have got the following wording included:\n\"It should also be recognised that undeveloped land can have a sustained lasting economic value in terms of agriculture, tourism and amenity and can be strongly related to the quality of life of the people in the area.\"\n| Jobs , Homes and Cows |\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)",

No it was none of these things it was because the electorate don't 'love' him. 'Sherlock is not going to the toilet' as they say!\nIn the Huddersfield Examiner he is quoted thus,\n\"I think over the last two-and-a-half years he hasn't shown that he can engage with the electorate.

In policy terms Gordon Brown and Tony Blair couldn't have a better ally but it seems that Labour have had a bit of a foul up in the PR department and Gordon doesn't smile convincingly enough so Barry is getting the knife out Of course in the run up to a General Election it is very convenient for Barry to distance himself from a very unpopular Prime Minister. Given his lack of policy differences with Gordon Brown it is also a wee bit cynical.",

Otherwise the view many people have of them following the tuition fees fiasco will be reinforced and politics as a whole will be further devalued in the minds of the general public.\nClr Andrew Cooper\nLeader, Green Party Kirklees Council\nWe protect green belt - Examiner - 27/4 /11\nI SEE that Clr Andrew Cooper is once again castigating the Lib Dems and Conservatives over green belt policies (Examiner Mailbag, Tuesday April 26).\nOne of the most effective ways of protecting the green belt is by sitting on Huddersfield Planning Committee or the Heavy Woollen Planning Sub-Committee where decisions about green belt and brownfield sites are made. Yet no Green Party councillor will sit on any planning committee.\nSo, when Clr Cooper talks about responsibilities, policies and green belt, he needs to look to his own party first, particularly here in Kirklees.\nPerhaps the electorate, whom he purports to represent, should start to ask questions as to why the Greens will not sit on any planning committees where decisions concerning green belt are made.\nClr Christine Smith\nChair of Planning and Highways Committee, Kirklees Council\nAnd my response...............\nCouncillor Christine Smith , Conservative , criticises the Green Party for not having a Councillor on Planning Committee. As she well knows despite not being a member of Planning Committee I have been a regular attender of it, referring applications for decision and representing views of constituents. I was the only Councillor who was not a member of Planning Committee to make representations regarding the Tesco’s Development and the proposed replacement Hotel on Castle Hill. The real scandal here is that the larger parties rarely send anyone to Planning Committee to represent the views of constituents. As Cllr Christine Smith also knows being a member of Planning Committee restricts the ability of its members to represent local people effectively as they are bound by planning protocols. Ironically you can be a much more effective at protecting your local green spaces by not being a member of the Planning Committee and she knows this as someone who has voted for development on Lindley Moor.\nI do notice however that in her criticism of me and the Green Party she does not contradict my view, and the Campaign for the Preservation of Rural England’s view, that the latest Coalition Planning Policy statement made during the budget is a significant threat to our green belt and greenfield sites. I would be really interested in her role as Chair of the Planning Committee how she responds to CPRE’s and my concerns.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper\nGreen Party Leader – Kirklees Council\nWell explained Andrew.

Well we learnt that it appears the Conservatives support for Labour at the Annual Council meeting wasn't a one off and that they are intent on propping up Mehboob Khan's administration.The debate on the Lib Dem amendment on the Council budget rollover report demonstrated this new alliance between the supposed adversaries.\nThe Council had significant underspends of several million on its budgets for 2011/12 on both the Capital and Revenue side. This gave an opportunity to use some of these funds to support threatened services and develop new projects. The amendment, which was supported by the 8 Green Party and Valley Independent Group Councillors, proposed secure funding of the Library service for the next four years at its current level. This would have protected the staffing of the 7 village libraries currently under threat including Shepley Library which is in the Kirkburton Ward.This gave the combined 'opposition' Councillors an opportunity to outvote the Labour minority administration and save the library service from likely cuts in provision. When it came to the vote the Conservatives voted with Labour against the amendment. So what arguments were used against the amendment by Labour and Conservatives? One argument was that there would be no certainty for the Library service after 4 years. This argument was interesting on a number of levels. For one thing it was an implicit acceptance by Labour that if their Party came to power following the next General Election that there would be no assumed change in government support to Councils and that Labour would continue to follow Coalition spending priorities. Also the Conservatives like all Parties know that we don't plan budgets more than 4 years ahead anyway so it would be consistent with how we currently approach Kirklees budgets. Council Leader Mehboob Khan's oft quoted position is that the libraries are not under threat anyway. Unfortunatelty this is the usual, (and by I guess automatic) attempt to mislead by our glorious Leader. Why the review of 7 libraries if there is no threat? Why did Council officers advise the sum of 1.3 million to the Lib Dems to maintain the service at its current levels if there are no assumed cuts to the services?\nSo why are the Conservatives propping Labour up? Well they were given several committee Chairs (and the allowances which go with these) at the Annual Council meeting in return for supporting Mehboob remaining Leader. My comment at Council was along the lines of \"The Conservatives have few virtues but one is that when they are bought they stay bought\". I think it probably has as much to do with the fact that certain (but not all) Conservative Councillors who would rather walk over hot coals than be on the same side as the Greens. I find it strange and bizarre that such a destructive and partisan approach prevents our communities getting the best outcomes and in this case a secure Library service.\nIf it's raining and there's nothing on the telly you can watch the rerun of the Council Webcast here:\nhttp://www.kirklees.public-i.tv/core/portal/webcast_interactive/82293\nWe definitely missed Huddersfield Examiner coverage and comment on the meeting and particulalry Mr Barry Gibson's take on events.

I get a call off Councillor Julie Stewart -Turner one morning saying \"You've got a car. Can you go and rescue a young partridge that is sitting by this shop in Lockwood?\" So off me and Cllr Karen Allison trot armed with a cardboard box and find the aforementioned partridge, looking a bit sorry for itself and put it in the box. Now it is worth saying at this point for people who do not know Huddersfield that Lockwood is not the natural habitat of partridges. It's like finding a crocodile in the Antarctic or a Lib Dem in Newsome. It's just not their natural habitat. Lockwood is built up, close to the Town Centre and not a place you feel likely to find what some people refer to as 'game birds'. So having rescued the Partridge the question was what to do with it next? We rang Cllr Robert Barraclough, a farmer who living in Farnley Tyas may well have come across the odd partridge in his time. We didn't fancy his first suggestion too much but then he did identify a spot in Farnley Tyas where it would be good to relocate it. It would be in its natural surroundings and be able to forage, so off we went and released it back into the wild. What has happened to 'Alan' now is anyone's guess but hopefully feeling a bit more at home than it was. As casework goes a bit more bizarre than usual. So that was the bird! Next the bees!\n|\n| Cllr Karen Allison opens the Apiary at Kirklees College Taylor Hill Annex |\nFor a long time I have been keen to get the concept of the Bee-llotment established. We have had A-llotments for years but we need to get more and more purpose built homes for colonies of bees where their hives are cared for, secure and are safe from predators. Somewhere a hive can thrive! I was really pleased to hear that Huddersfield Bee Keepers Association have established an Apiary with 3 hives at the Kirklees College Taylor Hill Annex. Cllr Karen Allison was asked to open it which she was very keen to do and she is even considering getting her own hive. It is an ideal spot for holding bee keeping courses and the links with the College are particularly welcome with opportunities to pass on skills to new generations. This is an important project with the many threats to bees. Their fate and ours, with regards to the pollination of many crops, are inextricably linked. The Bee-Keepers are hoping to build the Apiary up to be a 8 hive site and they regard the area as a great spot for foraging. The next job for us is to look at what we can do to get more wild flower plants in the area. The fact that the Council are cutting back on grass cutting might be something we can turn into a real positive by finding more areas for wild flowers providing new food sources for the new bee colonies in the Newsome area.\n|\n| The 'Bee- Suited' Cllr Karen Allison |\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

A revolution in reducing the demand for energy in our homes, yet the\nCoalition government have cut funding to the Energy Company Obligation so\ndrastically that 264,000 homes that would have been insulated, this coming\nyear, will now not be and the Energy Companies as a result of these cuts will\nbe £245million/year better off (Good news for their profits though!)\nIf elected to the European Parliament I will use the\nMEPs office to draw in funding and resources to improve the energy efficiency\nof homes in our Region and provide free clean renewable energy for hundreds of\nthousands of homes.\nGetting\nGreens elected to the European Parliament can be about much more than just a\none off protest. We will promote positive and practical projects that improve\nhomes and increase skilled employment.\nThe\npolls are looking good for us.

There have been several damaging cuts to what were already pretty miniscule programmes to support low carbon technologies. These have destabilised small renewable industry installers particularly with regard to biomass. With the cancellation of the Low Carbon Buildings Programme grants and uncertainty over the Renewable Heat Incentive struggling biomass installers are up against it.\nThere was hope by some that the Lib Dems would make the Tories green rhetoric a reality but little evidence is forthcoming yet. During the election campaign Friends of the Earth released lots of yellow balloons outiside parliament representing all the Lib Dem candidates who had signed up to their key election asks (and a few blue ones). When I asked them why they hadn't released any Green ones for all the Green Party Candidates who had signed FOEs asks (like me!) they said that they went out to buy green ones but there weren't enough. Hmmm..... with 'friends of the earth' like these who needs enemies.\nCuts to low-carbon technology programmes:\n- £12.6m from The Carbon Trust's grant for low carbon technology and business support funding from DECC\n- £6.1m 'efficiency savings' and under-spending on programme budgets within DECC\n- £4.7m by cancelling final rounds of Bio-Energy Capital Grants Scheme and Bio-Energy Infrastructure Scheme\n- £3m by reducing the scope of the Offshore Wind Capital Grants Scheme\n- £3m from closing the Low Carbon Buildings Fund early\n- £2.9m by reducing the scope of the government's Low Carbon Technology Programme\n- £1m cut to funding for development of deep geothermal energy generation\n- £700,000 by closing the Energy Saving Trust technology trials early\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nOf course now the Coalition have abolished the Sustainable Development Commisssion there is no one inside the government to contradict their assetion that they are the 'greenest government ever'.\nReplyDelete",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2021_11_cop26-what-did-it-mean-for-local-and_html/content_16.html": "COP26 resulted in what is officially known as the Glasgow Climate Pact. This is the document that included the now infamous ‘phasing down’ rather than ‘phasing out of coal reference. Many of us feel immense dismay about the COP26 outcome but within the document it is worth knowing what is in it that is relevant to our local Councils.\nThere are several key references in the ‘Glasgow Climate Pact’ document. There is a mention in\nthe Preamble to the pact\n“Recognizing the important role of indigenous peoples, local communities and civil\nsociety, including youth and children, in addressing and responding to climate change, and\nhighlighting the urgent need for multilevel and cooperative action”\nMultilevel action means local government and it’s important it is recognised in the preamble to the Glasgow Climate Pact as it gives legitimacy and recognition to national government for the role councils play in addressing climate change.\nAt the UK level the key body we have to key into is the Local Net Zero Forum which is a body where national and local government come together to work on action to address climate change from a local perspective. This was announced as part of the Net Zero Strategy in October so we know nothing about how it will operate or it’s terms of reference. The Local Net Zero Forum has its roots in the agreement at COP24, 3 years ago. As well as Government Departments it includes the Local Government Association so we Greens have the opportunity to get our input through that route as members of the LGA Independent Group.\nThe importance of involving local communities on action to address climate change is also mentioned,\n“Emphasizes the important role of indigenous peoples’ and local communities’ culture\nand knowledge in effective action on climate change, and urges Parties to actively involve\nindigenous peoples and local communities in designing and implementing climate action and\nto engage with the second three-year workplan for implementing the functions of the Local\nCommunities and Indigenous Peoples Platform, for 2022–2024;”\nThe only way that local communities can be effectively engaged is through the facilitating role that local Councils play as the body that works most closely with local communities. There is no structured way that this would happen coming from a national level so each Council will do it in its own way. There needs to be a more organised and structured way for Councils to engage their communities in climate action.\nGetting the Local Government Association to do some work on this and get it recognised by national government would be one way to progress this.\nThere is a special mention for ‘youth’ and in the context of local government\n“Urges Parties and stakeholders to ensure meaningful youth participation and representation in multilateral, national and local decision-making processes, including under the Convention and the Paris Agreement;”\nThis is the first time I’ve seen a specific role for youth in a COP outcome document and also in reference to local decision making processes. As with local communities it seems it is up to local councils as to how they do this with no specific guidance from national government. Again some guidance on how this can be done meaningfully would be helpful.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

He refers to ‘stepping down as a Parish Councillor’ last year and his ‘retirement’ from the role. Actually he never ‘stepped down’ he lost his seat because he didn’t attend for a period of over 6 months and as such under Parish Council rules was removed from office. He had been a very poor attendee of meetings attending only 11 meetings out of a possible 48 in his last 2 years of office. To avoid a By-Election following John Taylor’s vacancy, in 2010, the Green Party supported the co-option of Cllr Adrian Murphy to the Parish Council for Shepley. Ironically he was also a very poor attendee of Parish Council meetings only turning up to 12 meetings out of a possible 35 in his 2 years of office. John Taylor said he wanted to avoid ‘the costs of a By-Election by being co-opted onto the Council’. Effectively he was saying to us that we had to co-opt him, despite his unreliability and equally poor attendance record, or the Conservatives would call a By-Election which in the end was what they did. This along with Kirkburton By-Election takes £8000 out of the Parish Councils £122,000 budget and out of funds that we could use to benefit the communities we represent. The real irony of this is that the other Conservative Parish Councillor for Shepley who was elected last May has attended 5 out of a possible 25 meetings this year.\nIt would be a shame indeed if the Conservatives were rewarded for playing politics with local peoples money and for seeking to mislead people over their role in calling these By Elections. What would you have spent £8000 on in your village?\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper\nKirkburton Parish Councillor for the Farnley Tyas and Thurstonland Ward\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2011_10_80s-plenty-last-kirklees-full-council_html/content_958.html": "| 80's Plenty? |\nThe misinformation quotient was pretty high at last Wednesday's Kirklees Full Council meeting. We had Lib Dem Councillor James Blanchard with what I presume was a planted a question to Councillor Khan on the Green Party’s record as the administration on Brighton City Council. Basically the question was implying that the Greens there had broken a manifesto commitment to lower Councillors allowances and top executives pay. On the basis of past planted questions to Cllr Khan on the subject I was pretty sure this was a load of.... rubbish (that was the word I was searching for). I sent a quick email to Brighton Green Party Councillor and Cabinet Member for finance Jason KitKat for his view. The other point to make is that the question goes against the Councils Constitution in that it has nothing to do with the area of responsibility of the Leader of the Council nor was it anything to do with the Kirklees area. Of course if I’d made that point before the question was made or the dubious answer given then I’d have been accused of trying to hide what the Greens were doing in Brighton. So I let them have their fun then made a point of order pointing out the question was out of order and read Jason Kitkat’s email to me which conveniently arrived a couple of minutes before the question was put and said,\n“Not true. Our Chief Exec reduced his salary by 5% and tomorrow we are voting on report to reduce the total cost of councillors allowances and expenses packages.” (see it on Kirklees Webcast here 2.22 in)\nThere’s a pattern of Green bashing and misinformation going on here from Mehboob (see Wrath of Khan) and its strange that Cllr Blanchard somehow or other gives credence to him. All good knockabout stuff of course but you do wonder what the point is.\nThe other source of misinformation in the Council meeting was Lib Dem Councillor Kath Pinnock. A debate was held on Kirklees proposals to outsource Adult Homecare provision as the result of 5000 signature petition. Independent Councillor Edgar Holroyd-Doveton spoke in support of the petitioners and also later proposed a motion to promote a public sector ethos for care homes and services. Councillor Pinnock decided that this meant the Holme Valley Independents wanted to bring all Homecare services inhouse (they don't) and tweeted,\n“Holme Valley Independent Cllr now proposing action to raise council tax 12.5% costing every tax payer about £100 extra a year”\nAll pretty shameless stuff from Councillor Pinnock, but consistent with her usual approach and her dubious relationship with the truth.\nThe Lib Dems put forward a motion on restricting speed limits to 20 in residential areas on the basis that it will help road safety. All good stuff and not anything new in that we’ve all been pushing for this for a long time but Highways officers always block it on the basis that if there are no physical measures in place e.g. humps, ramps, chicanes then the speed restrictions would be ignored and unenforceable. I’ve disagreed with this approach for a long time and agree that we should send a message, even if it is just with signange, that residential areas are low speed zones. Unfortunately the motion was not put, due to time restrictions, but I would have pointed out that Lib Dem/Con Government proposals to raise the motorway speed limit to 80 will probably lead to more deaths and certainly more carbon emissions. I wanted to know if the Lib Dems had done the maths to work out if they would save more lives with the ‘20s Plenty’ policy than they lost on the ‘80s plenty’ policy.\nThere was another motion on the changes to constituency boundaries which is going to see around 50 Parliamentary seats going across the country. There are some fairly crazy new boundaries being proposed with Dewsbury being split between 3 MPs. Ultimately though you have got to ask why the Lib Dems agreed to this with the Conservatives in their coalition agreement without getting an agreement on some form of Proportional Representation. Instead they just got a referendum on an inferior form of PR, the Alternative Vote. They seem to have been taken to the cleaners in their negotiations on the coalition agreement. What a wasted opportunity.\nAs usual we didn’t get through the agenda and Edgar’s motion was curtailed at the 9.00pm deadline and despite me seconding the motion and reserving the right to speak the larger parties voted against our proposal to extend the Council meeting so we could debate the motion properly.\nAndrew, I'm pleased to tell you that I have now got 20mph on virtually all the residential streets in my division, Lancaster East - this is part of the initiative which will lead to all residential streets in Lancashire, and all roads outside schools which are in non-residential areas, being 20mph by the end of 2013. I'd be delighted to invite Kirklees councillors to come for a visit to see it in action if you think it might help convince them!\nReplyDeleteSam\n[County Cllr Sam Riches, Lancashire CC]",

I went out to see this one on Bell Street, Newsome today. The first thing I noticed was that it was incredibly heavy as if it was was filled with concrete of something. I then looked over the bin to see if I could see any clues as to which house on the street it belonged. It was then that I saw the Leeds City Council logos. So somehow or other this bin had made the 20 mile or so trip to Huddersfield.

I went out to see this one on Bell Street, Newsome today. The first thing I noticed was that it was incredibly heavy as if it was was filled with concrete of something. I then looked over the bin to see if I could see any clues as to which house on the street it belonged. It was then that I saw the Leeds City Council logos. So somehow or other this bin had made the 20 mile or so trip to Huddersfield.

We see here Rana Younas Lib Dem Candidate (a nice chap as I remember him) standing with some students at Athene Court, Ashenhurst calling for tuition fees to be abolished. They had just been introduced by the then Labour Government. It does however get better than this on the rear of the leaflet they have a piece calling on the government to 'abandon student loans'.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2012_02_greens-win-all-3-seats-in-kirkburton_html/content_967.html": "We won all 3 seats in the Kirkburton Parish By Elections last night. In Shepley Ian Lumb topped the poll with 293 votes and in Kirkburton Rae Thomas and Peter Pankhurst were elected with 364 and 330 votes respectively. This brings the Green Party total on the Parish Council up to 14 out of 25 Councillors. All 3 candidates and their teams worked hard during the campaign and were worthy winners.\nOf course we didn't want these by elections in the first place. Ironically it was the Conservatives who instigated the By Elections by collecting the 10 signatures needed to trigger them. They have cost the Parish Council £8000 out of our £122,000 budget. The even greater irony is that the Conservative Candidate for one of the Kirkburton seats was Kirklees Councillor Adrian Murphy who is up for re-election in May. It did seem that they had called these by elections as an ill judged tactic to give them a boost in the run up to the Kirklees Elections in May. It is a tactic which has misfired for them rather spectacularly. The low turnout reflects the lack of wisdom, in calling these by elections and a good proportion of the turnout was made up of postal votes. A by election on a cold February day during half term holidays was never going to encourage voter participation. Here's the results\nShepley Ward\nIan Lumb - Green Party - 293 - ELECTED\nJohn Taylor - Conservative - 238\nJan Thornton - Labour - 32\nTurnout - 25.9%\nKirkburton Ward ( 2 seats)\nMike Greetham - Labour - 199\nAdrian Murphy - Conservative - 261\nPeter Pankhurst - Green Party - 330 - ELECTED\nRae Thomas - Green Party - 364 - ELECTED\nTurnout 19.85%\nA great result that shows that residents appreciate the support that Green Party Councillors bring to their communities.\nReplyDeleteReality not rhetoric wins the day!\nGreat news!

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2020_07_yorkshire-and-humber-green-party_html/content_320.html": "Yorkshire and Humber\nGreen Party Response to the West Yorkshire Devolution Deal\nQuestion 1\nDo you agree or\ndisagree with our proposals for the revised arrangements for the Combined\nAuthority, as set out above and in the Scheme, in particular the proposed\narrangements for a Mayor, Mayoral Combined\nAuthority, and the councils, working together?\nStrongly Disagree\nThis is not real\ndevolution.\nThe Elected Mayor does not represent real devolution. It is\nsimply replacing a remote Westminster politican with a remote individual who is\nsupposed to represent 2.3 million people which they cannot. When mayoral models\nhave been put before local people in referenda before they have rejected. Now\nit is proposed to impose a Mayor on West Yorkshire without a referendum.\nThe Mayoral Combined\nAuthority – Some members are more equal than others\nThe proposed West Yorkshire Combined Authority will have 11\nmembers. 5 of these members will most likely be the Leaders of the constituent\nCouncils. These will be Councillors who have been elected by the unfair first\npast the post electoral system unlike the WYCA mayor. Having members of the\nsame body elected by different electoral systems is bizarre and perverse. The\nproposed 3 additional members will also be Councillors elected under the first\npast the post system but these places will be allocated on the basis of the\nnumber of Councillors in political groups on the constituent councils not on\nthe basis of popular share of the vote. We believe that West Yorkshire should\nhave an Assembly like the GLA in London elected by Proportional Representation.\nIf it is good enough for London why not West Yorkshire?\nThe 3 additional constituent council members on the Mayoral\nCombined Authority appointed for political balance should be referred to as\n“Second Class Members” as their support is not required to pass the Mayor’s\nSpatial Development Strategy, the designation of land for a Mayoral Combined\nAuthority Area, the compulsory purchase of land, decisions that could incur a\nfinancial liability on a constituent council or any matter pertaining to the\nMayoral Combined Authority’s Constitution. Using the same logic the 5 members\nappointed by each constituent Council should be referred to as “Premier Class\nMembers” as their support is required to approve the above matters.\nAll Councillors need\nto be represented on the Mayoral Combined Authority\nOver 8% of elected Councillors in West Yorkshire are from\nparties other than Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats. All these\nCouncillors are members of the LGA Independent Group. Current proposals would\nmean that these Councillors and the communities they represent would have no\nrepresentation at all on the Mayoral Combined Authority. Provision should be\nmade on the board to represent all groupings represented by LGA Political\nGroups including the LGA Independent Group which consists of Independent and\nGreen Party Councillors. We propose an additional member for political balance\nto ensure Councillors who are members of the LGA Independent Group, and\ntherefore the people who vote for them, are represented.\nThe proposals for 2\nDeputy Mayors are undemocratic\nThe proposal for the Mayor to be able to simply appoint 2 paid\nDeputies is undemocratic and will most likely be given to ‘Party worthies’ as a\nform of patronage. If it follows the model of the West Yorkshire Police and\nCrime Commissioner the Deputy Mayors positions will attract an allowance of at\nleast £50k/year with no democratic mandate. The Leader of Kirklees Council has\nstated at a Kirklees Scrutiny meeting that a Deputy Mayor position will be\ntaken by a Leader of one of the Constituent Councils. There is no reference to\nthis in the Governance Review document.\nMayoral Compulsory\nPurchase and Development Area powers should need approval of a meeting of the\nconstituent Full Council\nThe Mayor will have the power to compulsory purchase land\nwithin each Combined Authority area and set up Mayoral Development areas.\nBefore any of these powers are put into effect they should require the approval\nof a vote in Full Council in the constituent Council affected.\nAs with the Compulsory Purchase powers we strongly believe\nthat proposals to establish a Mayoral Development area should also require Full\nCouncil approval.\nIf London can have\nthe GLA why can’t West Yorkshire have an elected assembly?\nIt is not at all clear that powers will not be taken away\nfrom Councils and given to the Mayoral Combined Authority - the exact opposite\nof devolution.\nIt is our view, for Devolution to work in this area it needs\nto have a representational assembly elected by proportional representation to\ncover the whole Yorkshire region with similar powers to those of the Scottish\nParliament or the Welsh Assembly. Yorkshire has a population somewhat greater\nthan Scotland, and significantly larger that Wales. What’s good enough for\nScotland & Wales is good enough for Yorkshire.\nSpecific Governance\nproposals\n·\nAllocation of places to be based on LGA Groups -\nGreens and Independent councillors would all fall under the LGA Independent\nGrouping rather than being treated as small parties or individuals.\n·\nThere should be 4 balancing members on the\nMayoral Combined Authority. This would create a more balanced authority giving\n10 voting members. 4 balancing members would currently result in 2\nConservative, 1 Lib-Dem and 1 LGA Independent Group members.\n·\nEqual voting rights for all Mayoral Combined\nAuthority members on all matters not reserved to the Mayor. The proposed\nstructure creates 3 classes of voting member.\nThere is no justification for the Mayor and the balancing members to be\nexcluded from key decisions, and there should be only 1 class of voting member\non Combined Authority decisions.\n·\nIn the absence of an Elected Assembly there\nshould be all member assembly from the constituent councils for key decisions -\nAs far as possible all elected members should be involved in the decisions that\nwill shape and determine our shared future.\nQuestion 2\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer transport functions and new transport related\nfunctions to a West Yorkshire Mayor and mayoral combined authority?\nDisagree\nAdditional Transport\nfunding should simply be passed down to each constituent Council\nWhile we would welcome some of the potential powers that\nwould be granted to the Elected Mayor in relation to Public Transport and\naccess to funding, we believe that Government should simply devolve this\nfunding and powers to the Local Authorities without requiring the establishment\nof a new undemocratic Mayoral Authority.\nTransport funding\nshould not be used to support higher carbon emissions\nThe Key Route Network proposed could involve the\nestablishment of new roads encouraging car use and destroying valued green\ncorridors. This would also be inconsistent with WYCA’s commitment to have a\nzero carbon economy by 2038. It might be noted that while WYCA have stated a\ntarget of 2038, Leeds City Council, via a motion of Council, set a target date\nof 2030 – We believe that within the boundary of Leeds the Elected Mayor, if\nbrought in, should implement the Zero-Carbon economy by the 2030 date.\nWe would oppose the use of funding on any projects that\nwould enable expansion at Leeds Bradford Airport by the Mayor and the Mayoral\nCombined Authority. Any such funding would be contrary to reaching Zero-Carbon.\nWe acknowledge that delivering a mass transit system has\nlong been the plan for Leeds City Region, and aligns with the move towards\nbecoming Zero Carbon. However, the need to progress at pace to achieve modal transport\nshifts in order for Leeds to reach its Zero Carbon target of 2030 may require\nthe mass transit system ambition to be revisited. Funding is needed now to\ndevelop an effective and responsive bus system, the means for all transport to\nbe Zero Carbon and to greatly increase active travel. Planning for low carbon\ntransport is no longer good enough; travel needs to be Zero Carbon, and this\nmust include ensuring that the electricity for electric vehicles is generated\nfrom renewable sources. We welcome the plans for improvements at Leeds city\nstation as long as the modal shift is to Zero Carbon transport.\nQuestion 3\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer skills and employment functions to a West\nYorkshire mayoral combined authority?\nAgree with some reservations\nWhile we would argue that Adult Education – lifelong\nlearning – is about more than those outcomes linked to employability and the\nminor extensions into Community Learning covered by the current AEB, the\nquestion asks only about the current system.\nWe are conscious that levels of participation in the\nYorkshire & the Humber region in the forms of Adult Education covered by\nthe AEB at 30%, are only just above the lowest level nationally (29% in the\nSouth West)\nThere is a concern about the unpredictability of funding\nlevels, which have seen a 45% fall over the last ten years. Clearly if the\nmayoral region is to plan for provision in the long term it needs assurance\nthat funding will reflect levels of commitment made and increase at the very least\nto cover the inflationary costs.\nWe are conscious that the administrative and procurement\nprocesses that have operated at a national level have shown great weaknesses\nthat have undermined provider confidence. We would want to see devolution of\nthe budget linked to the power to simplify rules, make required outcomes\nclearer and support provider confidence. The devolution of the budget has\npromise, but only if the administration can be simplified and made more\ntransparent. If devolution is to mean anything it must include devolution of\ndecision making about the outcomes wanted in the region.\nThe region as a whole, and the West Yorkshire region in\nparticular have great potential in building the new green economic order that\nis needed. There is a strong skills base that can be built on in the provision\nof training, and this development should take place not just in the context of\nthe 2038 Zero carbon Agenda target of the WYCA, but also reflect local\ncommitments, such as those in Leeds to a 2030 target.\nAs such we would favour further devolution of the budget to\nthe five constituent authorities of the sub-region and not just to the WY\nmayor, and for the opportunity for lifelong learning to become an offer that is\navailable very locally, for example from community centres or schools.\nQuestion 4\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer housing and planning functions to a West\nYorkshire Mayor and mayoral combined authority?\nDisagree\nPlanning decisions\nshould be taken at a local level\nWe do not support the granting of any land assembly or\nplanning powers to the Elected Mayor, these should be held by the appropriate\nLocal Authority, as those councillors have the local knowledge to be able to\nmake these decisions. Clearly, it is our view if this function were to be\ngranted to the Elected Mayor and, we note that the local authority will have a\nveto, we would like to put in the safeguard that any decision taken by the\nElected Mayor in this area should have to be endorsed by both the Executive\nBoard and a meeting of the full Council of that particular metropolitan\nauthority.\nThe Mayoral Combined\nAuthority should be able to suspend the ‘Right to Buy’\nOne function we would like devolved to a local level is the\npower to suspend the Right to Buy scheme. We have seen a massive reduction in\nCouncil Housing at a time of high demand for income particularly for the\nmillions left behind in the policy push over the last 40 years towards home\nownership. Not everybody can own a home and we need a secure affordable option\nfor the millions who cannot. Suspending\nor preferably abolishing the Right to Buy would boost the business case for\nCouncils wanting to build new affordable homes.\nThe power we need is\nto insist on higher energy efficiency standards for buildings\nThe Mayor will not have powers to insist on higher building\nstandards in the region such as Passivhaus for all new build. This would be\ncompatible with WYCA’s stated commitment to a Zero Carbon Economy by 2038 but\nis a power that we won’t have.\nWe need a 2030 Target\nfor the West Yorkshire Zero Carbon Economy\nWe strongly believe that the Mayoral Combined Authority\nshould set a new, more ambitious target for a Zero Carbon Economy by 2030 in\nline with the conclusions of the report of the United Nations Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change. This would help support our argument for stronger\nhousing and planning policies either at the local or regional level.\nQuestion 5\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer Police and Crime Commissioner functions to a\nWest Yorkshire Mayor?\nStrongly oppose\nPolice and Crime\nfunctions are even more unaccountable under the Mayoral Combined Authority.\nThe appointment of a highly paid, unelected Deputy Mayor to\nlead on the Policing function, however, just makes matters worse. It will undoubtedly put an unelected\npolitician in a role where the people scrutinising them will have a democratic\nmandate (albeit through FPTP), but they will not.\nQuestion 6\nDo you support or\noppose this proposal to confer additional finance functions on a West Yorkshire\nMayor and mayoral combined authority?\nStrongly oppose\nNo taxation without\nadequate representation and scrutiny.\nOur opposition to these additional powers is due to the lack\nof a suitable democratic mandate as we have detailed in our answer to question\n1 and/or the lack of suitable scrutiny and powers to limit the powers of the\nMayor by a democratically elected Assembly.\nThe power to charge a precept for policing would mean that\nthe funding gained could be the responsibility of an unelected functionary and\nor ‘Party Worthy’.\nQuestion 7\nAre there any\ncomments you would like to make that you do not feel you have addressed in your\nresponse?\nWhat about the\nchallenge of Climate Change?\nThe West Yorkshire Authorities Governance Review document\nhighlights the major challenges to the sub region. It includes growth,\nproductivity, diversity, innovation and trade but Climate Change is not\nidentified as a challenge bizarrely. The self-declared target of having a Zero\nCarbon Economy in just 18 years’ time is a significant challenge but it is\nconcerning that it has not been included here. For the record the Green Party\nbelieves that our target should be 2030 not 2038 in line with the evidence from\nclimate scientists.\nWhat about a\nresilient economy?\nAnother significant challenge highlighted by the COVID19\ncrisis is the need for a resilient economy that is less affected by global\nfactors such as international trade, the money markets and financial speculation.\nA more resilient economy would have an emphasis on local\nproduction for local need, more locally owned and managed businesses trading\nwith each other ensuring money remains within the regional economy. This is not\nidentified as a significant challenge and therefore cannot be regarded as a\npriority by the Mayoral Combined Authority. This is a major weakness in the\nGovernance Review Document\nA Devolution Deal for\na Post-COVID/Post-Growth World\nThe proposed devolution deal was prepared in the pre-COVID\nworld, and therefore it will need significant rethinking in order to align with\nthe new normal that individuals, businesses, communities, councils, regions and\nnations are now preparing for. Recently 200 leading UK businesses, investors\nand business networks, called on the Government to deliver a Covid-19 recovery\nplan that builds back a more inclusive, stronger and more resilient UK economy that\naligns with the UK's wider social, environmental and climate goals. There is no\nmention here of economic growth. More and more people with vision are realising\nthat growing an economy is at odds with tackling climate change. What we can\nhave instead is a strong, vibrant, inclusive and sustainable economy and that\nshould be the vision that underpins the devolution deal. We have an opportunity\nhere in West Yorkshire to be leaders in this new green recovery world.\nIn view of this, the metrics used for making the 5 year\nGateway Assessments on which ongoing funding may depend cannot be based on\neconomic growth, but on other measurements of a vibrant economy. In the new\nCOVID 19 world economic growth may be a thing of the past anyway. In particular\ndecisions must not be made in order to meet the Gateway Assessments that will\nreduce the capacity of Leeds to meet the Climate Emergency commitments.\nLet’s have Real\nDevolution not Faux Devolution\nIn our view this is only partial devolution to, effectively,\nan elected dictatorship, and not a proper democratic body. The area covered,\nthe County of West Yorkshire, is a failed concept of the early 1970’s and does\nnot cover the economic footprint of the Leeds City Region. To have real devolution\nwe need an Assembly and First Minister with powers similar to those granted to\nWales, and Scotland, but based upon the region of Yorkshire. The proposal\nstates that this agreement is the first step in the process to further\ndevolution, therefore a Yorkshire Assembly should be seen as the assumed next\nstep, which should be included in this devolution agreement. Devolution for\nYorkshire has wide support, including in the Sheffield City Region where\nreferendums held in Barnsley and Doncaster, indicated an overwhelming\npreference for a One Yorkshire deal over the South Yorkshire deal.\nDevolution that\nacknowledges the Climate Crisis\nOn October 8 2018 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange issued a report, in which they stated that ‘Limiting global warming to\n1.5°C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all\naspects of society.’ Other parts of the report state that ‘With clear benefits\nto people and natural ecosystems, limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to\n2°C could go hand in hand with ensuring a more sustainable and equitable\nsociety’. We are already seeing the consequences of 1°C of global warming\nthrough more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice,\namong other changes. The report finds that limiting global warming to 1.5°C\nwould require “rapid and far-reaching” transitions in land, energy, industry,\nbuildings, transport, and cities.’ It is already widely acknowledged that the\nUK’s zero carbon target of 2050 will not achieve the limiting of global warming\nrequired, which is why councils around the UK have committed to achieve zero\ncarbon much sooner.\nSo it is within the context of the Climate Emergency that\nWest Yorkshire now has the opportunity, through devolution, to set truly\nambitious plans to lead this country in a green economic recovery from the\nCOVID pandemic, a recovery that will achieve the challenging but necessary zero\ncarbon targets that have been set. This will require public support, and that\ncan only be achieved through the democratic processes and structures that are\noutlined in our response.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

It is an artificial construct of disparate communities and towns brought together under local government reorganisation in 1974. Kirklees has done some marvellous things and made some mistakes over the years but it we'll never achieve the semi mythical status of the Huddersfield Borough Council in the eyes of many older/voting resident. Comparisons aren't really fair as the pressures and responsibilities of the old Huddersfield Council doesn't compare with that of modern day Kirklees. You also have the misconception in North Kirklees that all the money goes to Huddersfield and in Huddersfield that all the money goes to North Kirklees. Around the margins some areas may get a bit more money based on whoever happens to be running the Council at the time but largely the increasingly meagre pot of money is distributed according to need. As funding for the services Kirklees provides is withdrawn by Central Government a greater proportion of that funding will have to be directed at those in the greatest need and so the Council will be largely funding adult social care and vulnerable children's services. Funding for things people care about in their communities such as libraries , museums, roads, street cleaning will all diminish hugely. It doesn't look like Kirklees Council will be loved any more any time soon! Nor will it be abolished. Requests to halve it quarter it and establish new councils have been rejected by Governments of all hues over the years. Love it, or more likely, loathe it, Kirklees isn't going anywhere fast!\nSo why and how a Huddersfield Town Council? We have a Town Council in Kirklees now. Meltham is a Town Council. We also have Parish Councils in Mirfield, Kirkburton, Holme Valley and Denby Dale. In Kirkburton through a Green Party initiative, supported by Independents and most Parties, we developed a successful plan to save Kirkburton Library (there was no other plan!) Without the Parish Council it is unlikely that the building would have remained open and would probably have ended up as a large private bungalow or a small supermarket. Similarly in Skelmanthorpe there has been another asset transfer of the Library to Denby Dale Parish Council. So these bodies can act as lifeboats for the retention of local facilities and services and to be a way of promoting more local priorities.\nAttempts at devolving power to Area Committees and now District Committees covering different parts of Kirklees have never really worked and I guess never will. However enlightened and willing teh chairs and members of Huddersfield District Committee are they are still beholden to the Kirklees Cabinet and have to operate within their priorities. Whoever happens to be in power at the time. Issues like the future of Huddersfield Town Centre are regarded as outside the scope of the District Committee and responsibility for it is jealously guarded by the Cabinet. A new political body representing Huddersfield once established could see responsibilities and some funding transferred to it from kirklees as part of new political settlement for our area. Whatever decisions were made by Huddersfield Town Council would be those established by the representatives elected by Huddersfield people. Town Councils have the same status as charities and voluntary organisatuions and are able to apply for funding that Kirklees would not have access to. So we could get more 'bang for our buck' than we ever would with KMC.\nHighly symbolic, but nethertheless real, would be the moment the Council was established and it adopted the coat arms of the old Borough Council of Huddersfield. The people of Huddersfield could begin to believe they had got their Town back and greater control of their own destinies.\nAttempts at devolving power to Area Committees and now District Committees covering different parts of Kirklees have never really worked and I guess never will.

An average post gets around 100 views or so, which I'm quite happy with. Going through the stats on which posts are most popular is interesting. So here's the Top 10 countdown\nNumber 10 - A relatively new post with 215 views is this expose on Labour's election expenses in the Newsome Ward at the last Local Elections\nNumber 9 - Is my report on beginning the first post General Election Kirklees Budget setting process and contains some criticism of Eric Pickles 233 views\nNumber 8 - Is a report back on an LGA Environment and Housing Board meeting. A bit mundane I thought but obviously not - 236 views\nNumber 7 - Is a string of letters regarding the Feed In Tarrif between myself and a local Conservative Bernard McGuin in the Huddersfield Examiner. He is desperately trying to defend his anti FITs opinions which have no basis in fact. - 359 views\nNumber 6 - Is the story about my role in getting 'Welcome to Huddersfield' signs erected on our bit of the Kirklees boundaries. Funnily enough the Kirklees Highways staff forgot about one of the signs at Ainley Top which was all taped up so I unveiled it myself and videoed with the assistance of my Dad. Here it is - 385 views\nNumber 5 - Was the Green Party winning all 3 seats in Kirkburton Parish Council By Elections that were called by the Conservatives in February 2012. Those By Elections cost us £10,000 out of Parish funds. 385 views\nNumber 4 - Zombie Posterboards are those which are left behind long after an election is finished. Labour always manage to leave at least one behind. There's still one hanging around in Newsome now which I pass most days. This post from 2011 introduced the concept 509 views\nNumber 3 - This was a short piece criticising the Huddersfield Tory Candidate for not appearing at Hustings meetings during the election campaign - 667 views\nNumber 2 - We may be entering terriotory here where people may have arrived at Greening Kirklees by accident. The post is entitled 'The Wrath of Khan' and refers to misinformation at a Council meeting from Cllr Mehboob Khan about the Green Party administration on Brighton City Council. Of course there may be the odd Trekkie or two who got there by accident. 706 views\nNumber 1 - This post had a massive 2812 views. So what was it about. It was entitled 'Strange Bedfellows' and was all about the shenanigans at this years Annual Council Meeting. I thought it was a pretty good post highlighting how the Conservatives had enabled Labours Mehboob Khan to run the Council and his reward to them of committee chairs and the allowances that go with them. It might have been a good post but even I thought it wasn't good enough to see such a dramatic spike in interest. So I did a bit of digging and found that most of the people viewing it were from Canada. I did a search on 'Canada' and 'Strange Bedfellows' and was directed to a video on Youtube. Fortunately it was all about linking environmental action with investment companies and not anything too dodgy. So yes unfortunately they had arrived at my blog by accident. The video is mildly entertaining and here it is.\nNumber 10 - A relatively new post with 215 views is this expose on Labour's election expenses in the Newsome Ward at the last Local Elections\nNumber 9 - Is my report on beginning the first post General Election Kirklees Budget setting process and contains some criticism of Eric Pickles 233 views\nNumber 8 - Is a report back on an LGA Environment and Housing Board meeting.

It was entitled 'Strange Bedfellows' and was all about the shenanigans at this years Annual Council Meeting. I thought it was a pretty good post highlighting how the Conservatives had enabled Labours Mehboob Khan to run the Council and his reward to them of committee chairs and the allowances that go with them. It might have been a good post but even I thought it wasn't good enough to see such a dramatic spike in interest. So I did a bit of digging and found that most of the people viewing it were from Canada. I did a search on 'Canada' and 'Strange Bedfellows' and was directed to a video on Youtube. Fortunately it was all about linking environmental action with investment companies and not anything too dodgy. So yes unfortunately they had arrived at my blog by accident. The video is mildly entertaining and here it is.",

One which I’m\nsure many people have is that we are anti nuclear power. Now nothing could be further\nfrom the truth. We are actually very pro nuclear power with just some\nconditions around the finances. There should be no public or consumer subsidy\nfor capital costs, the same rule should apply to ongoing revenue costs and of\ncourse decommissioning costs which are often a concern for nuclear power\nplants. The question then is always well would a nuclear plant ever be constructed\nunder such a hostile financial regime? To which we would answer “\nConstructed? it already exists! It is 93\nmillion miles away, is pretty reliable, predictable and if it ever did develop\na fault we really would be in trouble”.\nThe UK\nGovernment is also very pro-nuclear power but it prefers its nuclear energy to\nbe closer to home and they have a different take on the finances. The cost of\nHinckley C to the consumer via the deal they have agreed on our behalf is reportedly\naround the £37 Billion mark. Government\nis all about choices and what could we do with £37 Billion with solar for\ninstance? Here’s a very rough and ready calculation. £37 Billion/ £5000 the\nlower end cost of a 4kWp solar PV system would provide on-site solar energy to 7.5\nmillion homes. This is around 30% of all UK homes. Of course that is a very\nrough and ready figure but it shows the potential - but possibly only the lower end of the\npotential. What if we had a national house by house programme which helped\nreduce costs further could we shave another £1000 off the cost that would be enough\nfor 9 and quarter million homes. Such a programme would encourage significant expansion\nin solar manufacturing in the UK bringing with it more jobs, investment and the\ntax revenue that governments love. If we invested in large community owned\nsolar PV installations the value of that £37 Billion would go even further. The\nadvances that continue to be made in storage make solar an ever growing option\nfor year round energy.\nWe\nneed a Government vision informed by the renewables industry. During the\nGeneral Election the Green Party policy in our Manifesto was attacked by some\nas being undeliverable but we were on firm ground because we worked with the Solar\nTrade Association to develop a policy that was ambitious but would be realistic\nbased on the assumption that it would come from a Government that truly believed\nin a renewable energy future\nPolitics\nis all about choices and the vision we have for the future of our country and the\nwider world. Solar is not just a renewable energy it can also be a\ndemocratising energy that puts more power in the hands of individuals and\ncommunities and less in the hands of large corporate energy supply interests.\nThis is not the general thrust of current UK Government policy. The abolition\nof the Zero Carbon homes standard for new build properties and the loss of\nEnergy Company Obligation funding for retrofit insulation measures helps maintain\nhigh and growing domestic energy demand. The effective outlawing of onshore renewable\nenergy through the planning system in England\nand the hacking away at the Feed In tariff has slowed the advance of\nrenewables in our country and as such the UK Government should be regarded as at\nbest disinterested in sustainable energy and at worst overtly hostile. The\nfuture at the moment is nuclear, fracked gas heating and poorly insulated\nbuildings. It’s their choice of future , not mine and I’m sure not yours.\nBrexit\nmay be Brexit what ever that means but it is not good news for renewables. The EU\nRenewable Energy Directive is/was a useful driver for investment in renewables\neven if UK policy was pushing us in the wrong direction and we were way down\nthe EU Renewable Energy League Table along with Malta and Luxembourg. We need\nto ensure that whatever Brexit means that we stick with EU targets even if\nfailure will no longer mean a financial penalty on the UK Govt.\nSo\nwhat do we do?\nIn\nKirklees our 2000 Council house solar PV programme was stopped in its tracks\nlast year. We got to 600 before the feed in tarrif cut hit. So we had to start\nthinking of other ways to make progress\nIn\nKirklees we are looking at the viability of establishing our own building\nstandards on land that we own. Those standards would be Passivhaus standards\nwith 10% of the energy demand of a standard new build. They could incorporate\nsolar PV and thermal. An all party working group that I chair on Kirklees Council is developing recommendations for this\npolicy. We want to hold a mirror up to Government to say this is what you can\ndo when you have the political will. If that can be achieved in one Council in\none part of the UK why not everywhere?\nSo I’d\nlike to conclude by saying the Green Party does not have all the answers. We\nneed the humility and common sense to realise that we need to work with others\nwho share our vision and values for a clean energy future. So let us work\ntogether. Let’s work on solutions with\ncommon purpose and optimism.\nThe future\nwill be bright , if its solar and renewable.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Of course many can, and do, contribute to the rents to the tenant of the property, usually the parents. The tenant could be retired or unable to work due to illness or disability. All this new cut will mean to the tenants or occupants of these homes is a reduction in their income and possibly further pricing them out of the communities that they may have lived in for many years.\nThis is actually part of a confused theme running through this government of moving people on low incomes around the country. It was only a few months ago that we had Iain Duncan- Smith telling us that he wanted families in council houses in deprived areas to move to council houses in affluent areas so they could get work -\nsee link. There were many echoes of Norman Tebbit's 'On yer bike' speech from the 80s. Of course as we know it was a non policy as there are huge waiting lists for limited numbers of council houses,(Conservative /Labour 'Right to Buy' policies) and this is more pronounced in more affluent areas. So where would these job seekers go if they want to clean George Osbourne's floor? That's right, to the private rented sector but haven't we capped the benefits making it more difficult for them to live near George. Yes we have. Of course the real answer is to put a cap on the rents not on the benefits but that would put a cap on the earnings of private landlords which may not go down too well with some Conservatives who may have interests in this area of the economy. The only crumb of comfort is the unlikely vision of George Osborne having to clean his own house.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

I went out to investigate and there they were lying on the surface being watched over by a heron who looked like he had already had his fill of this unexpected bounty. The theories from local people came thick and fast. Poisoning and pollution were what people initially thought but following investigations it turned out it was none of these. The long hot dry spell had de-oxygenated the water and the fish had simply suffocated. The had been killed by the weather.\nIn the past, as a Green, who wants to be taken seriously on climate change I've been reticent to link single weather events to climate change, but this is different. The phenomenon we are experiencing is a global one. We have had huge moorland fires on Saddleworth Moor, wildfires in Greece that have killed many, even wild fires within the Arctic Circle due to the heat and record temperatures in Japan. Comparisons with the summer of 76 are not really valid as that was very much a UK experience. This is global one and we know that extreme events such as these are going to become more common as climate change begins to have a greater impact.\nTwo events happened today of note. One was a new report titled 'Planning for Climate Change - a guide for Local Authorities' by the independent Local Government Information Unit. It referenced a report by the Royal Town Planning Institute from last year stating,\n\"that a lack of integration of climate change into local plans was\npartly a result of a skills shortage related to budget cuts, and partly due to\nchanges in national government policy that appear to de-prioritise climate\nchange action.\"\nSadly this comes as no surprise. The actions of our Government appear to be those of Climate Change deniers not that of an enthusiastic signatory to the Paris Climate Agreement. The evidence is there for all to see not least of which being a huge drop in renewable energy and energy efficiency installations.\nThe other event today was the Government decision to allow Fracking at Preston New Road in Lancashire against the wishes of the Lancashire County Council. Nationally the Government is pushing through permitted development rights for fracking exploration drilling overriding any local democratic objections. There is a sad lack of politicians in Westminster who 'get it' who understand that promoting these policies threatens us all.\nThe other event today was the Government decision to allow Fracking at Preston New Road in Lancashire against the wishes of the Lancashire County Council.

There is a sad lack of politicians in Westminster who 'get it' who understand that promoting these policies threatens us all.\nPromoting action on climate change is so positive in terms of skilled jobs, putting money back into local economies, increasing energy security not to mention actually ensuring our survival and that of many other species that it beggars belief that any Government can turn its back on it. The disconnect between the impact of climate change on our weather and the decisions Governments and some opposition MPs make is truly worrying. These MPs must be made accountable and challenged for the stances they take. It has to be us and it has to be now. It is that urgent.\nIf you want to see the latest on climate catastrophe, espcially in the Arctic, follow Paul Beckwith:\nReplyDeletehttps://youtu.be/fdtK2oH4M0c",

It was a nice, if a bit of a pricey day out. A couple of years ago I was asked to have a look around the site by Doncaster Council to give a few opinions on how the site could be brought back into use or at least pay its way. My suggestion was to put some significant size wind turbines on the large Earth Centre site to generate electricity and some valuable revenue to at least help support the site and possibly bring some much needed cash to the Council. The Council has been able to make some cash from the Earth Centre as a film location for a post apocalyptic HQ following a plague in the BBC series 'Survivors'. The Earth Centre was ideal and the only thing they had to CGI on the skyline to complete the picture were some large wind turbines.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

If humanity is to avoid simply becoming fossils ourselves then fossil fuels have to stay in the ground. Real security for future generations will only be achieved through serious investment in energy efficiency and a massive scaling up of our renewable energy resources. The emission commitments that have been made so far in preparation for Paris simply are not fit for purpose. They will not keep global temperatures below 2 degrees and the consequences of that lack of resolve must be understood.\nIt is not enough however to simply make those energy resources clean and sustainable. For real security we need to ensure that energy is owned by individuals, communities and local authorities and devolved administration such as the ones we all represent. The political power wielded by large energy corporations will ultimately get in the way of action on climate change. EU citizens should not simply be energy consumers they should be energy producers & generators in their own right. We need an Energy Generating Democracy.\nAnd finally if the people of Europe are to have Energy Security then their heat and power must be affordable. Energy or fuel poverty must be eradicated across Europe. No one should have to choose between eating of heating their home. I would like you to come to England to see some of the work Kirklees Council is doing to tackle fuel poverty not because of the policies of the UK Govt but because of our own local priorities.\nNational policies too often act as a limiting ceiling on local ambitions on energy security we need them to be a floor that we can build upon.\nWe need an Energy Union for now but also for future generations.\nWe need an Energy Union for the people.",

Would the Cabinet Member agree that this “allowable solutions” money could be used to further enhance the homes building policy Kirklees Liberal Democrats will propose later today? For example, it could help to pay for the installation of energy efficiency measures on the new homes, such as solar hot water panels.”\nI was rather surprised the Lib Dems are wanting to talk about the Coalition's so called Zero Carbon Homes policy as it is widely regarded as a big disappointment by those concerned with reducing the carbon emissions of new homes. With the backtracking and the amendments to the policy a 'Zero Carbon Home' is one that emits carbon at 32kgC02/m2 as opposed to the 47kgCO2/m2 that a house built to 2006 Building Regulations emitted. You would be forgiven for thinking 'zero emissions' meant well 'zero emissions' but that is Government 'Newspeak' for you. It is really a measure of the success of the Home Builders Federation in getting the Government to lower standards and therefore their costs.\n\"allowable solutions\" simply means opting out of high efficiency solutions for buildings by paying a sum of money to other carbon saving initiatives. Funding was, at one point, going to be destined for use by Local Authorities. This would have made a lot of sense, as it could have been targeted at those people in fuel poverty or on community renewables initiatives but now developers decide how they want to\nuse it and there is a lot of uncertainty over where it will end up and what it will be used for.\nIn Planning Resource magazine it stated,\nHousebuilders will decide\nhow to meet carbon mitigation requirements under the zero carbon homes policy\nrather than local authorities, the government has confirmed.\nColin\nMorrison who is a director and head of sustainability at a building\nconsultancy Turley, said:\n\"Based on\nour experience of allowable solutions projects and policies within emerging\nlocal plans, this will come as a disappointment to local authorities as it\ncould have represented a significant source of funding for local carbon\nreduction projects.\nSo unfortunately the\n‘greenest government ever’, with a Department of Energy and Climate Change led\nby a Lib Dem Minister, has failed to come up with the green goods yet again.\nHowever\nin the absence of effective policies coming out of the UK Govt, Kirklees Council can,\nwithin the Local Plan, set its own standards for buildings erected on land the Council owns and they can be better\nthan those established by central government. Housing\nbuilt to a Passivhaus standard has very high insulation performance, low heating\ndemand , controlled ventilation and very low fuel bills. A Passivhaus social housing\ndevelopment built in Oldham by Keepmoat has homes that are costing tenants no more than £20a year in fuel bills and the builders were trained by the Green Building\nCompany which is based in Huddersfield.\nSo I so will certainly be pushing hard for Passivhaus standards on Council land as part of the new Kirklees Local Plan. In the absence of good policy from central government we at least can do our best at the local level and show them the error of their ways.",

This is positive but what is lacking is a\nfinancially sustainable model, which can deliver improvement to homes at scale\nto a zero-energy standard. Our proposal based on the Energiesprong (energy leap)\nmodel addresses this and provides a way of building the capacity and capability\nto deliver for owner occupiers and the wider housing sector.\nEnergiesprong work with local Councils on developing a\nprogramme to deliver warmer homes through a retrofit programme delivering a\nhome which is net zero energy, meaning it generates the total amount of energy\nrequired for its heating, hot water and electrical appliances. It also provides superior indoor comfort.\nThis is achieved using prefabricated facades, insulated rooftops with solar\npanels, smart heating, and ventilation and cooling installations. A\nrefurbishment comes with a long-year performance warranty on both the indoor\nclimate and the energy performance for up to 40 years. A complete home makeover\ncan be completed in as little as a day!\nEnergiesprong are not a contractor themselves but work with\ncouncils to help procure contractors to deliver to the Energiesprong\nspecification.\nCouncils such as Nottingham, Exeter and a number of London\nBoroughs are already working together on Energiesprong projects as part of the\nRetrofit Accelerator Homes Investment Partnership. They share best practice and\nexpertise and have been successful in a number of funding bids to government drawing\nin millions to support the development of the Energiesprong model.\nHow much does it cost?\nThe cost for an initial 50 properties would be around\n£85,000/property. The expectation is that for future rounds of properties that\nthis would reduce to around £55,000/property as economies of scale are realised.\nHow is it paid for?\nThere is some initial outlay for setting up the\nEnergiesprong approach through the Housing Revenue Account but as the capital\ncosts come down the expectation is that it would become self-financing through\nlower maintenance and servicing costs e.g., no gas safety checks, lower\nmaintenance etc and through charging a comfort charge to the tenant.\nEnergiesprong guarantee that the fuel bill that the tenants pay plus the\ncomfort charge will be less than they were paying in energy costs for their\nhome before refurbishment.\nhttps://www.energiesprong.uk/\nhttps://www.energiesprong.uk/newspage/innovation-partnership-why-a-new-approach-to-retrofit-procurement-is-key-to-net-zero\nhttps://www.ukgbc.org/news/nottingham-first-to-adopt-revolutionary-energiesprong-housing-approach/\nPassivhaus or equivalent\nas standard on all Council new build projects\n5 years after the all party\nPassivhaus group recommended that the Council build its new developments to the\npassivhaus standard Kirklees is now doing a pilot project on 12 houses.

What can be learnt by building in Kirklees that can’t be learnt\nfrom more progressive Councils in other parts of the country such as Exeter\nCity Council?\nThe lack of a policy is expensive as one-off projects like\nKirklees passivhaus pilot come at a cost premium. Having a high energy\nefficiency standard means developers can invest in skills locally, build\ncapacity and the capability to deliver to the passivhaus standard or\nequivalent.

Involving people in positive projects helps give people a sense of well\nbeing and not just thinking they are at the mercy of decisions by national\ngovernments and decisions at global climate summits.\nWe can help them feel empowered and involved in addressing\nthe threat to all our futures. For the next 2 years through the Place partnerships,\nwe wish to support a range of community lead projects to address climate\nchange.\nThis could be improving the energy efficiency of public\nbuildings, tree planting, projects to support biodiversity and nature-based\nflood prevention measures.\nLearning from others\nKirklees\nneeds to approach its role in addressing climate change with humility. We\nfrequently hear from Labour Cabinet members about how we are ‘the best’ in this\npolicy area. We aren’t. There are positive things happening on the climate\nagenda in Kirklees but we are not forerunners or innovators in addressing\nclimate change. The lack of a climate action plan lead to the Council getting a\n0% rating from Climate Emergency UK earlier this year. Joining the Global Covenant\nof Mayors would provide us with valuable insight and support form the\ninternational community of local and regional authorities addressing climate\nchange. It works to provide value to participating councils by mobilizing the\ncritical financing and technical assistance that members require to access\ninvestment. The Global Covenant of Mayors ensures that signatories are\ncontinuously supported in their efforts.

Showing\nthem that renewable energy helps power their school be it from wind, solar or\nother renewables is a positive for learning and gives a demonstration of hope\nfor a better future.\nFor this scheme we will seek funding through a Community Municipal\nInvestment/ Climate Bond issue. These have been successful in West Berkshire Council\nand the London Borough of Islington and provide a return to community\ninvestors.\nhttps://info.westberks.gov.uk/wbcmi\nhttps://www.abundanceinvestment.com/invest-now/municipal-investments\nMobilising the community\nto help tackle the cost of living crisis\nThe massive hike in energy bills caused in large part by our\ndependence on fossil fuels is something that Kirklees Council needs to mobilise\nitself to address, and a single budget amendment is not the way to do that.\nThere are things we can do though and establishing a fuel poverty fund to help\nimprove the energy efficiency of people living in cold homes in the owner\noccupied and private sector. We will seek initially to fund this through a\ncharitable trust that the council will establish and seek contributions too\nthrough a variety of methods including an appeal through the Council Tax mailing.\nSimilar charitable trusts have been established in other parts\nof the country and have raised hundreds of thousands of pounds. It has initially\nbeen tried in rich Council areas in the south of England but it is worth trying\nhere to bolster and support work being done on broader poverty issues by a\nrange of third sector organisations.\n|\n| Cllr Sue Lee-Richards |\nSupporting\nactive travel\nWe lack a programme to support the development of a\nprotected cycleway network in Kirklees. This proposal will kick start that\nprogramme and we would push for a reprioritisation of the West Yorkshire\nTransport Fund away from road building and road widening projects.\nSafer streets for all\nThose of us who have tried to get traffic calming to make\npeople feel safer in their communities from speeding traffic have frequently\nbeen frustrated.\nGreen Councillors have prioritised ward budgets, public\nrealm funding and any other funds we could use to get roads traffic calmed to\nmake roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists. This has been in the face of\nlimited budgets and against Kirklees Highways policy. We need sustained funding\nto support area wide traffic calming on residential roads so we are able to\nrespond positively to community concerns, take a preventative approach to\ntraffic speeds rather than one rationed on the basis of injury accidents.\nBetter adult social care\nPositive work was carried out a few years ago by the\nAdministration helping establish Valley Care a community based care\ncooperative. Our proposal is to provide staff to support the development of\nCommunity Based Care Cooperatives in Kirklees. Members of the Care Cooperatives\nwill have a stake in the organisation they work for and the emphasis is on care\nnot the profit motive.\nWe will support the\ndevelopment of Care Cooperatives that will operate on the basis of reinvesting\nsurpluses in improving and extending the services they offer to provide a wide\nrange of care services.\nThese cooperatives will provide all staff with at least the\nliving wage, a training programme which supports development and progression.\nThis model of care provision will also play a role in raising standards in the\nwider care sector.\nhttps://www.valleycare.coop/\nUnder development – A\nKirklees Workplace Parking Levy\nNot included in this Green Party Budget amendment but we\nbelieve establishing a workplace parking levy to support public transport and\nactive travel in Kirklees is worth investigating further. Employers with fewer\nthan 10 parking spaces pay nothing at all.\nEmployers offering more than 10 parking spaces pay a fee of £1.17 per\nday per parking space. There are\nexemptions for local emergency services, NHS frontline staff and blue badge\nholders.\nIn Nottingham, the Workplace Parking Levy on employers has\nraised more than £9 million each year, with the revenue used to fund tram\ninfrastructure, a smart card scheme, electric buses and cycling facilities.\nLeicester are also looking at introducing a Workplace Parking Levy.\nKirklees Climate Commission\nWe are disappointed that there appears to be no dedicated\nbudget line in the Administration’s budget for Kirklees Climate Commision\n(KCC). Given the importance the Administration have placed on setting up KCC\nand their position as vice chair we would have expected to see a dedicated\nbudget that KCC would manage independently of the council to facilitate\nadministration, sourcing third party research and working in the communities'\ninterest.\nWe would hope that the council can rectify this outside\nthe 2022-23 budget process so the KCC can establish independence in order to\ndemonstrate a degree of self-determination that they can exercise in\ncollaboration with other partners such as the Chamber of Commerce, University\nof Huddersfield and others.",

Yorkshire Wildlife Trust have commenced their\nCre8 barn project. One of the old stone barns is being completely refurbished to passivhaus building standards by local award winning company the Green Building Company with substantial support from Veolia following a successful bid by the Trust. Passivhaus standards are where buildings are insulated to a very high standard with air tightness being key to acheiving extremely low heating requirements in the building. The Green Building Company are national leaders in passivhaus design and build and this will be the first time in the UK that such standards have been applied to the retrofit of a non domestic property.(Correction in comments from Green Building Company -oops!) It is pleasing to have yet another high eco spec development in the Newsome Ward. Bill Butcher of GBC is doing a blog on the construction of the barn which you can access\nhere. The launch event featured Barry Sheerman MP who provided his support to the event and told us of his passion for the English poet John Clare. The new barn wuill be used for training a skills development and will have very negligible heating costs.\n|\n| Still a bit of work required on the roof! |\n|\n| Green Party member Karen Allison in the barn.

The timber frame structure will have the additional advantage of supporting and shoring up the original stone building.\nMore information on the project is at:\nhttp://www.greenbuildingstore.co.uk/page--stirley-farm-enerphit.html\nThanks for the clarification.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2011_07_greening-calderdale_html/content_610.html": "| Scholes Farm in Calderdale. That roof's looking a bit bare! |\nAt first glance you might think Calderdale didn't need much 'Greening'. It is indeed a green and pleasant area and a Council I worked for for a while as their Home Energy Conservation Officer. They pioneered universally free insulation for the over 60s regardless of income before any other Council in the country and did so for around 8 years before funding constraints took hold. Calderdale has Hebden Bridge with the Alternative Technology Centre and more 'right on' folk than you can shake a stick (that may be later used as biomass) at. It also has Todmorden which pioneered the food growing revolution that is 'Incredible Edible'. The Council is also doing some pioneering work on new social housing with high Code for Sustainable Homes standards. So there's a lot for them to shout about on the green front but even the more proactive areas have a blind spot and Calderdale's is their Planning Department's approach to solar PV on listed buildings.\nA recent planning application for a solar PV panels on a listed farmhouse at Scholes Farm is a case in point. The applicants wanted to put their panels on a section of roof that was on a new extension to the listed building that could not be seen from the road or particularly easily from anywhere else. Calderdale Planning however reckoned that this was still adversely impacting on the buildings listed status and recommended refusal. All I could imagine that the applicants could have done to make the panels more acceptable to planners would have been to bury them in the garden but this would have rather negated their purpose in life.\n| St James Piccadilly Solar Panels |\nI advised the applicants of their right to ask one of their local councillors to refer the matter to the Planning Committee for a decision rather than be decided by officers. Fortunately the Councillors could see that the interpretation of government planning policy in this instance was not being regarded as an enabling one but in a more restrictive light. Evidence was ably provided by Mr Adam Gillespie of the Energy Saving Trust on behalf of the applicant. The Councillors wisely approved the application.\nAndrew, this case reminds of a presentation I attended given by the environmental psychologist Patrick Devine-Wright (University of Exeter), particularly as you seem to attribute the initial refusal of CP as one, perhaps, of attitudes which has driven a particular interpretation of planning policy.\nReplyDeleteDevine-Wright researches NIMBYism and found that in one coastal town in North Wales there was resistance to a proposal for an off shore wind farm. The 'industrial' wind farm was perceived as a threat to the identity of the town which was historically seen as a place of scenic beauty and restoration. But, he concluded that 'new, industrial' wind farm technology could be reconciled with the 'old, natural' identity of the town by drawing upon the town's 'proud history' as a progressive and forward-thinking place in its early, formative years - a much more palatable place identity.\nPerhaps, therefore, a way forward for reconciling listed building status with renewable technology would be to 're-imagine' or 'reconstruct' the meaning that we attach to such buildings; for example, in these cases, drawing upon the adaptability of such buildings in a modernising world as a reason for its continued existence and public appeal, rather than as passive, historical relics that shouldn't be tampered with.\nI agree. Personally I find the juxtaposition of the old and the new to be often quite positive. I like old churches and other buildings with modern glass atriums. The odd thing here in many ways is that the NIMBYism isn't coming from the community but from the Councils Planning department. It's not really NIMBYism either but a very rigid interpretation of planning policy which is supposed to be enabling rather than restrictive. Opposition to wind turbines from communities is a very different phenomenon and curiously British from what I can make out. The best examples of dealing with it is through community ownership or a community share of a wind development. Oddly a lot of the 'aesthetic' and spurious reasons for objection melt away.\nReplyDelete",

By the end all the candidates must have got sick of hearing each others repeated lines. I know I did. The Tories fancied their chances and put up Itrat Ali, a young, articulate Muslim woman who put a lot of effort into her campaign and was a good choice by the Huddersfield Conservatives. A number of things let her down. Obviously being a Tory defending her governments record was a big obstacle to overcome which was never going to be easy but she made a fairly good fist of it all things considered. My real concern was the advice and people behind her campaign. An ill thought out leaflet entitled 'A letter from Mehboob' advising Greenhead ward voters to 'Vote for Itrat' was a poor attempt to get people to somehow believe former Labour Council Leader Khan was advising people to vote Tory. Now I can believe Mehboob would do all sorts of things but that's never going to happen. At that point her campaign lost any legitimacy it may have had. If she had have won using those tactics it would have been a shameful victory.\nThe UKIP Candidate Rob Butler did what you'd expect of a Kipper and blamed most of our woes on immigrants and the EU. I was intrigued as a Science Teacher what his stance would be on the anti science climate change denial policy of UKIP. I had hoped he would be slightly embarrassed by it but unfortunately not. He is a fully paid up climate change sceptic and did come out with some of the dodgy 'evidence' refuting the widely held views of the vast majority of climate scientists.\nBarry was as amiable as ever but we never really got into a debate with him on issues such as Labours support for the cuts, fracking, Trident renewal etc To be be fair to him a lot of the hustings didn't lend themselves to 'banter' between the candidates which was to my mind was a mistake. Challenge is important for politicians and sometimes if the challenge isn't coming from the audience we need to challenge each others policies and views.\nFor a flavour of the hustings here is the one from the University of Huddersfield Students Union. I did bait the UKIP guy a bit but then you have to get your entertainment where you can!\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Scientists are coming up with renewable energy ideas all the time but there are so many limitations in this country. They say it's too expensive to be green yet Ecotricity offer green power to the UK for the same prices as the big 6 before the price hikes. My husband and I want to build a passive house but can't afford the land or the mortgage and don't want one if we could as I have about as much trust for the banks as I do for our current government so that equates to 0. Green energy isn't expensive, yes there's outlay but there are people who post on youtube all the time and show how they create their own energy and conserve what they do have. I'm not surprised Germany wasn't interested, just look at German technology! It far surpasses the basic shacks we knock up on a regular basis with a pretty exterior and a price that far exceeds value. The houses built now are even worse than those built 200 years ago and it's supposed to be the other way around! Most of Europe is far superior to the UK in how they build, we aren't suited to either hot or cold and have to deal with both. It makes sense to be green, not just financially but for our futures and the future of this fragile planet we seem hell bent on destroying despite it being what keeps us alive.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2014_06_vote-harry-perkins-for-labour-leader_html/content_354.html": "| Harry Perkins MP (sadly Ray McAnally RIP) |\nThe Leadership issue for Labour is a real one, but at its heart is the lack of a distinctive agenda from them or an inspiring alternative vision. Simply saying we accept current govt spending and aping the Tory rhetoric on welfare must be disheartening to manŷ qLabour activists, who presumably joined up to champion social progress. At a Billy Bragg gig this weekend I saw a few Kirklees Labour Cllrs obviously enjoying his good music and his principled undiluted, full fat socialism. It must have been a much needed shot in the arm for them given the lack of that sort of message coming from the Labour Party at a national level.\nIf I was a Labour activist I know who I would want as Labour Leader and that would be Harry Perkins. \"Who?\" I hear you cry. \"Is he an obscure up and coming backbencher that we should look out for?\" No Harry Perkins was the fictional Labour Leader who 'came to power' following a run on the banks in Chis Mullin's 'A Very British Coup'. It is one of those peculiar dramas where the TV series is better than the book in my opinion. Harry is a fantasy Labour Leader who sticks by his socialist principles, opposes nuclear weapons and American bases, champions the NHS and alternative energy. Through a combination of wily manoeuvring and being smarter than the entrenched right wing establishment he generally comes out on top. What comes across in Ray McAnally's portrayal of the Sheffield Trade Unionist turned Prime Minister is his authenticity, what you see is what you get. Agree with him or not you know he won't be mealy mouthed or slanting his message so as not to offend a particular constituency of opinion, probably identified following exhaustive fieldwork and opinion polling research. Ed Miliband's is as far from Harry Perkins as Brie is from Red Leicester. It depends on whether your taste in leadership is like your taste in cheese, soft and bland or hard and full flavoured (and red)\nSo who are the potential Harry Perkins types coming through the Labour machine? Well there aren't any that I can see. Chuka Umunna, one potential future Leader, is a classic example of what's wrong with Labour, He's undoubtably capable, a safe pair of hands and media savvy but lacking that uncompromising idealism that makes you under no doubt that his principles come first and last and won't be swayed by misinformation and supposed public opinion. He's definitely the SPAD or smart guy you want informing a 'proper politician' but not a Leader.\nIf Labour, (and the Tories and Lib Dems come to that) failed in the May Elections it was by having Leaders who were so bland and seemingly interchangeable that they allowed Nigel Farage, a former Tory Stockbroker, to characterise himself as 'anti establishment'. That is a measure of how low the level of political leadership has become in the UK.\nOf course this is really none of my business. I'm not a Labour Party member and don't regard myself as a socialist (even though the Kirklees Tory Leader has described me as an extreme socialist!). All I can say is that many people who do regard themselves as socialists find themselves more comfortable in a principled party like the Greens than having to make excuses or apologise for the lack of direction and leadership from the Labour Party. Fortunately for Labour in Kirklees they now have there own version of Harry Perkins in the form of the unabashed, unashamed, unreconstructed Socialist Councillor David Sheard.\nHere's Harry on form\nHere's Harry on form\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

One phenomenon of public transport that does drive me to distraction however is audible mp3 players/ipods. They used to be called 'personal' stereos but oft times there is nothing very personal about them. The tinny bass beat can frequently be heard and it winds me up. I have nothig against people listening to their music its just that I don't want to hear it. I like a good bit of thrash punk myself but I do understand that not everyone wants to hear 'The Exploited' screaming out 'Dead Cities' while they're travelling to work in the morning. I often ask people politely to turn them down. The reactions vary. Some people turn them down a bit or even off but others react rudely and even aggressively. Sometimes the response is \"No one else is complaining\" as if that was an excuse. Other people do speak up and add their support which usually (but not always) has the desired effect. Earphone leakage is not a rare occurence and I believe it can't just be me who gets irritated by having other peoples music inflicted on me. So what is to be done. Bus and train companies haven't really caught onto this problem. Sometimes there is a small notice as part of an array of rules but most times there is nothing about keeping music 'personal'. People who just want peace on public transport need backing up with a high profile campaign by West Yorkshire PTA and the relevant companies. It needs to be explicit 'Your music should only be heard by you' ' Keep your music to yourself'' etc etc. There also needs to be advice for people on the action they should take when reasonable requests to turn music down are ignored such as informing the bus driver or the guard. If we are to encourage more people to use public transport we need to ensure that respect for others is part of the culture of bus and train travel.\nOr there is Spock's solution from \"Star Trek IV - The Voyage Home\"!\nRant over now to act!\nGive people an application for a Public Performance License!\nReplyDelete",

It is well known as being prone to speeding cars and there have been collisions demolishing walls with many local people concerned that it was only a matter of time before someone is killed on this stretch of road. The works are scheduled to be carried out between Monday 24th July and Friday 4th of August during which time the road will be closed to traffic.\nNewsome Ward Green Party Councillor Andrew Cooper said,\n“ I am really pleased this work is finally being carried out. Local residents have been calling for action to reduce speeds for some time. The scheme did not meet Kirklees Council’s criteria for funding so we had to use our limited local budget to ensure the traffic calming went ahead. As the Westgate part of the schemes and some of Kaye Lane were in the neighbouring Almondbury Ward we pooled our local budget with the Almondbury Councillors budget to enable the scheme to get the go ahead. The important thing is that this will make a dangerous road safer.”\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

There is a lot of interest in the Public Meeting at the John\nSmiths Stadium on Monday 18th April and they should be planning for\na big crowd. I don’t believe we are just talking about a few hundred people\nattending. I think we are most likely talking thousands. If they hold another\nevent where people are left outside an unable to participate it is further\nevidence that they are out of touch with public opinion.

Lockwood is one of those areas.\nCouncillor Cooper, who is a member of the West Yorkshire Combined Authority Climate Change, Energy and Environment Committee, that approved the scheme said,\n“Back in February 2022 a number of businesses down Albert Street and Queens Mill Road were flooded. I remember it well as I was on the scene at the time redirecting traffic away from flooded roads. Several businesses in the area were badly affected and some businesses were out of action for several months\nThe half million pound scheme funded by West Yorkshire Combined Authority will install 2 pipes to redirect flood water back into the River Holme further downstream and reduce the risk of flooding for 28 businesses.\nHeavy rainfall events are becoming more frequent due to the impacts of climate change. So we need to invest in schemes which make homes and businesses more resilient to climate change.\nReferences\nSee Page 64\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

The talks established the ‘Rulebook’\nfor achieving tough carbon reduction\ntargets. Many have rightly been concerned at the lack of ambition in the final agreement and in particular the lack of recognition by the United Sates, Russian and Saudi Arabia who seem to put oil interests ahead of a safe climate for the people of the world.\nCouncillor Cooper said, “My mission at COP24 was to get more\naction at the local and regional level and push the United Nations to acknowledge\nthe need for National Governments to do much more to reduce carbon emissions.\nWhat we knew before the climate talks was that National Governments had not\nagreed enough carbon savings to limit a global temperature rise below 1.5\ndegrees to ensure we had a reasonably stable climate to pass on to future\ngenerations.”\n“Countries Carbon Emission targets are described under UN\nrules as Nationally Determined Contributions. I had proposed, and got EU\nbacking, to call for a new category of Locally and Regionally Determined\nContributions to encourage local and regional governments, below the State\nlevel, to take more action to reduce their carbon emissions. There was real\nprogress towards this goal in the final statement signed up to by World Leaders\nin Katovice.”\nThere is now a statement in the final text on how to assess Nationally Determined Contributions that\nrefers to preparing implementation plans to include “domestic institutional\narrangements, public participation and engagement with local communities”. This\nstatement gives a much greater role to Local Councils and Regional bodies in\nthe UK and around the world.\nCouncillor Cooper said, “ I’m very pleased that we managed\nto get such a strong statement out of the COP24 Climate Talks from over 200 governments\nfrom around the world. In a UK Context we need to be asking what our Government\nwill be doing now to work in partnership with Local Government and devolved administrations\nto help reduce carbon emissions. A growing number of Councils have now\ndeclaring a Climate Emergency following the IPCC Report that showed we have\nless than 12 years to reduce emissions to a level compatible with a stable\nclimate. Now is the time to back up those declarations with solid actions.”\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2022_12/content_587.html": "Just to be clear and to avoid accusations by Cllr Simpson, that I am making up my own facts, I'll only quote from the report that is in front of us today.\nWhen is a Climate Change Action Plan NOT a Climate Change Action Plan? I guess the answer to this question is when it says it isn’t. The report on the Climate Change Action Plan says,\n“The CCAP is not a list of firm commitments, investment proposals or instructions at this point in the process. But it does set out detailed actions that can be taken by the Council, key partners, and members of the wider community to help deliver the district's net zero and climate ready target.”\nNow I don’t know about you but that doesn’t sound anything like an action plan to me.\nAnd what consequences flow from “the plan”. For instance costs, risks, legal implications. The report says\n2.15. As this version of the CCAP is not a list of commitments and instructions at this stage in the process, there are no costs associated with its approval.\nFurthermore it says,\n2.23. There are minimal risks associated with the publication of this plan, due to the non-committal nature of the CCAP”.\nAnd on legal implications\n5.2. As the CCAP shown in Appendix 1 of this report is not a list of commitments and instructions, there are no broader legal implications in the approval of this plan.\nI am disappointed that there are no implications from this report. I want the report to be consequential, important and substantial.\nI do the report a slight misservice as there is a risk identified. It says:\n2.24. The core risks with this CCAP comes primarily from potential communication and publication of the documentation. Specifically associated with the positive and negative response expected from the public, partner organisations such as the Kirklees Climate Commission.\nWhen you are expecting a possible poor response from your principal partner the Kirklees Climate Commission you’ve got to be asking yourself some serious questions as to why we are in this space.\nIt further goes on to say\n5.14. A core focus of this criticism is expected around the non-committal nature of this CCAP at this stage in the process. To combat this, we are striving to clearly communicate how the next steps in our action plan process will result in firm commitments, once we have developed and identified – through extensive resident and stakeholder engagement, a refined number of high-priority actions by place, which will be accompanied by a business case providing indicative costs and carbon figures.\nSo in a strange way I am reassured by this report. Reassured because I have heard certain Cabinet Members saying how we are one of the best Councils in the country on addressing climate change. I tell you now, we are not and recognising that is the first step towards improving so I commend officers for their candour in this report and all the good work they are doing but I’d like a clear understanding from Cabinet Members of when we will have a real Climate Change Action Plan given that we are nearly 4 years since the Council declared a Climate Emergency.\nI was a bit bemused by this statement in the report\n3.11., Kirklees Council have and will continue to deliver a Young Persons Climate Festival helping educate, inform, and give young people a chance to get involved with the various environmental initiatives taking place across Kirklees.\nIf there’s something I’m really clear about, it is that young people, ( with one or two exceptions), get climate change almost instinctively, as the future that we are just beginning to see is getting worse and the consequences of our actions are ones that they will experience acutely. Many are well informed, and educate themselves, you do that, when it is a threat to your future and your very survival.\nI think we need another “Festival'' to inform and educate Councillors, Directors, Heads of Service. Why not ensure we all go through a Carbon Literacy course so they properly understand the implications of decisions on future generations.\nIn some ways the most shocking part of the report was this statement,\n“6.3. Review by portfolio holders: Cllr Simpson (Green and Clean), Cllr Davies (Environment) and Cllr Mather (Corporate) were consulted and had no comments on the options or recommendations put forward in this report.”\nWhat nothing? Zilch? Nada? Arguably the most important document about what we are doing locally to address climate change and our Kirklees Cabinet members had nothing to say?\nUtterly shocking!",

I was persuaded to take the following sentence out of our response as it wasn't the right tone I quite liked it though\n\"The\nintermediate West Yorkshire stop on the Northern Powerhouse Rail route HS3\nshould be located in Narnia as a fantasy project should be located in a fantasy\nkingdom.\"\nSo if you're reading from West Yorkshire Combined Authority that is what you could have had!\nThe Green Party Response\nto the West Yorkshire Transport\nStrategy 2016 - 2036\nThis response to the\nWest Yorkshire Transport Strategy represents the views of the Green\nParties of West Yorkshire and has been shared and agreed with our elected\nrepresentatives on Leeds, Bradford and Kirklees Councils and through\nconsultation with Party members throughout West Yorkshire.\nHow strongly you\nagree or disagree with our proposed policies described in each of the core\nthemes and the cross-cutting theme?\nWe believe a 60\nyear vision is needed. 20 years is too short a period to realise the sort of\ntransformation in our transport system that is needed.\nAn initial\nobservation on the consultation questions is that there are a lot of obvious\n‘Motherhood and Apple Pie’ statements that we are asked to express an opinion\non. This devalues the consultation exercise and\ncould lead respondees to question its validity.\nDelivering the\nStrategy is very dependent on road improvements with a strong emphasis on road\nschemes which will lead to increased capacity on Major routes. This\naccommodation of demand can only be temporary in nature. Delivering road\nimprovements to local congestion hot spots is eventually and inevitably\nself-defeating as demand increases and diminishes the dubious benefit of the\ninvestment.\nRoad\nsurfaces however desperately need improvements for all road users\nespecially cyclists who are at most personal risk from potholed\nroads. The austerity budgets being imposed by central Government on local\nCouncils is leading to a rapidly deteriorating road network\nIn the Consultation\nquestionnaire it asks whether we should “Provide new roads to improve\naccess to development sites” – This seems a very odd\nquestion and leads to a strong suspicion that it is aboutencouraging\ndevelopment in green belt as it assumes development will be away from existing\nhubs.We need to develop housing and employment around existing transport hubs\nand communities rather than creating new ones. We must avoid monoculture\ncommunities e.g. commuter belt towns. We also have concerns that improving\norbital roads may well suck the life out of city centres\nDemand reduction\nneeds to be an aim of the Strategy. We must have policies in place that limit\nthe necessity to have vehicles. Spatial Planning that links existing\ntransport hubs with new development is one way of addressing demand, as is l.\nTravel diaries/Travel Planning are important tools to\nhelp people adopt healthier forms of transport. More food grown and used\nlocally to avoid food miles is another\napproach. You should also be working with local\ncouncils, developers, and bus operators to ensure that developments proposed\nover the next 15- 20 years in DLP’s can be serviced by public transport,\ncycling and walking. The alternative is more congestion and\npressure to carry out self-defeating road improvements\nWe strongly believe\nthat local and community rail improvements should be prioritised\nover new road schemes, as should improvements to the bus network\nwhich currently carries 5 – 6 times more passengers than\nrail. A process of “Debeechification” should begin with greater\nemphasis on improving and expanding the rail network; while more road space\nshould be dedicated to bus priority lanes.\nHS2 is largely\nirrelevant to our local transport needs and the money would be much better\nspent on improving public transport infrastructure locally ie rail,\nlight rail, tram and bus networks. We strongly oppose a\nmasterplan for a new HS2 Yorkshire Hub Station in Leeds on that basis.\nThe question as to\nwhere the intermediate West Yorkshire stop on the Northern Powerhouse Rail\nroute HS3 should be located is unfortunately irrelevant as we believe this is a\nfantasy project not grounded in reality.\nThe Consultation\nQuestionnaire says that we should “Involve Communities in making\nimprovements to their neighbourhoods to create safer and healthier places” –\nHow and with what money?\nAccessibility for\npeople with disabilities should be an important part of the\nStrategy particularly as we move to more pedestrian friendly town centres.\nWe should look\nto banning diesel cars from all Town and\nCity Centres – California has set a good example with\na policy that we should follow – starting by announcing a\nban on the worst polluting diesel vehicles/cars from Town Centres to start\nby 2020.\n“The current duopoly of First and Arriva in\nWest Yorkshire is uncompetitive and does not act in the interest of the public\ntransport user. It gives unfair advantage to the dominant operator in any\nsub-area and stops the development of other operations that could significantly\nimprove services. Effectively the market works for First and Arriva, but\nnobody else. In our view anything short of the powers that Transport for\nLondon have regarding buses means the main providers of public transport in\nWest Yorkshire will not work in the interest of its people.”\nWhat you think we\nshould measure to show our progress in delivering transport improvements in\neach of the core themes and the cross-cutting theme?\nThe Strategy should\nbe set against the context of the Paris Climate Agreement. It should be an\nintegral part of the Strategy to show how it is contributing to\nthe carbon emissions reduction targets set in the Nationally Determined\nContributions agreed in Paris last year. It is a major omission that it is not.\nThe Strategy says it\nwants to have “The best bus system in Europe” as an aspiration. This is a very\nstrange aspiration. Where is the best bus system in Europe? How is it\ndetermined – what about the rest of public transport? What about\nwalking and cycling?\nThe automatic\nassumption that all growth is good is a fundamental problem with the strategy.\nGrowth can negatively impact on quality of life through, for instance, air\npollution and the knock on impact on public health. What we should measure\nto show progress in delivering improvements to road network are\ndecreasing emissions in terms\nof Carbon/SOX/NOX/Particulates and noise reduction.\nWe need a\nholistic cost analysis of different transport options for instance\npublic transport V car would have added a lot of substance to the strategy.\nThere is no such analysis in the strategy and this is a major weakness.\nAnother important way\nto measure the success of the Strategy would be by measuring modal shift\nfrom car to Public Transport and measuring the use\nof the Mcard for regular public transport users.\n“Road deaths” are not\njust about traffic accidents but the premature deaths caused each year as a\nresult of emissions and low air quality – Gloucestershire’s Speed Reduction\nPartnership give communities their own speed guns – This is a\ngood example that West Yorkshire could emulate.\nWe were asked to say\nhow we should measure progress in delivering improvements to\nplaces to places to live and work? There is a well established methodology\ncalled the Happiness Index that would be well suited to this task. We\nshould also measure progress through satisfaction\nsurveys of commuters and general transport users using all modes of transport.\nHave we missed\nanything you feel should be included in the strategy?\nA hierarchy of users\nshould be followed through in the Strategy starting with the pedestrian\nfirst and the private car last.\nThe strategy should\nnot encourage aviation by supporting the expansion of Leeds/Bradford airport.\nThis would be in harmony with a strategy that took a holistic approach to\ntransportation and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nRail use for freight\nshould be encouraged and there is an absence of serious comment on this in the\nstrategy documentation.\nWe need to invest in\ntraffic signals so vehicles can move more freely, more efficiently and in a\nless polluting fashion. This should be linked with Action in the ground by the\nHighways Agency and local Councils.\nThere are jobs in a\n‘green approach’ to transport policies – e.g. cycle logistics firms. Showing\nhow the transport strategy is going to support employment would be a positive\naddition to the strategy\nThe benefits of new\ntechnology should benefit us all – autonomous and connected vehicles providing\n“collective” solutions rather than new gadgets for an elite. We are thinking\nparticularly of advances towards driverless cars which may become a reality during\nthe life of this strategy.\nFleet Managers need\nthe right policy levers to enable them to be the first movers on new vehicle\ntechnology such as electric and hybrid cars. Showing how this could be achieved\nin the strategy would have been helpful.\nWe would be happy to meet relevant officers\nof West Yorkshire Transport Authority to discuss our observations\nYours sincerely\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper on behalf of Green\nParties across West Yorkshire\nLike it. Very well written with only a couple of glitches that I could see.\nReplyDelete",

By establishing a ‘Huddersfield Jobs’ You tube Channel employers will be able to look for potential employees and get additional information about them that they wouldn’t get from a simple CV. People looking for work will also be able to email a link to their Youtube Interview to local companies so they can get themselves, their character and their skills noticed. In this way we can help people get back into employment quicker.”\nAndrew has identified some funding to support this project through the Huddersfield Area Committee and is working with council officers and Paddock Village Trust to get it up and running and off the ground. He said,\n“I think this initiative has real potential. We have got to come up with fresh ways to use the new media to help get people into work.

The flower which gives it's name to the street where I used live with 'Huddersfield Conservative' Bernard McGuin |\nCost of ‘green’ policies\nTHE true cost of renewable means of producing power are now being exposed.\nAs I have said in the past, the power companies pay four times the value of any electricity produced by wind and solar means. The cost is passed on to the consumer in hidden subsidies. It is effectively an extra tax on already heavily burdened ordinary hard working individuals.\nThe fact that energy prices themselves are screaming ahead of inflation means that effectively we are putting a brake on economic growth and ultimately economic recovery.#\nTo all those people who voted Green in the last local elections, the message should be, do you really support policies that harm the British economy?\nTo the coalition government I would ask – do we really have to follow every edict from Europe on cutting carbon emissions and do you think all our competitors put so-called climate change policies ahead of economic growth?\nBernard McGuin\nHuddersfield Conservative\nBlaming the wrong folk\nA RATHER bizarre letter from Conservative Bernard McGuin blames the Green Party for taxes on energy bills.Last time I checked it was the Conservatives who were running the country with their Lib Dem helpers, not the Green Party.\nHe says these taxes support renewable energy. Yes they do – but nuclear energy is very heavily subsidised too.\nIt is also worth noting that half of the £20m budget for Kirklees Warm Zones free insulation scheme came from these sources, which is saving energy and money for Kirklees householders to the tune of about £4m each year.Mr McGuin would be quite correct in blaming the Green Party for the free insulation scheme which was the result of an amendment we made to the Kirklees Budget in 2007.\nClr Andrew Cooper\nLeader, Green Party, Kirklees Council\nEnergy subsidies\nIN REPLY to the Clr Andrew Cooper, (Mailbag, June 17) who thinks I wrote a bizarre letter regarding renewable forms of energy, may I just remind him that on his website that he acknowledged that the Feed In Tariffs, that rewards producers of such energy with a 41p per unit payment as opposed to the market price of 11p per unit, is a form of indirect taxation?\nI was careful in my letter to say that it was a subsidy which was being paid by us in our electricity bills.\nOn average we are each paying £200 plus a year to pay for this and other forms of ‘green taxes’ in our annual expenditure on energy.\nThe coalition has been saddled with the last government’s zeal to expand wind and solar power.\nThose that can afford the cost of solar panelling, the comparatively rich, will make a good return on their investment, around 10-12%. Paid by us poor folk who can’t afford it.\nIf you want to rent out your roof for solar panels, beware! You must have room for 16 panels and those in terraced housing, most of us in Huddersfield, won’t qualify.\nAlthough insulating one’s house is a good thing, the cost is again taken by the taxpayer.The warming Kirklees scheme was undertaken by a Conservative administration. I have heard all four political groups take credit for this scheme. Of course it is possible the three green councillors outvoted the other 66.\nThe main thrust of my letter was to ask whether the ‘taxing’ of energy would put a brake on economic growth. It is only that which will get us out of the debt that the country faces. In the General Election 2010, there was a move towards a rejection of tax and spend policies. Do the people who voted for Green councillors in Newsome and Kirkburton want a return to that?\nBernard McGuin\nHuddersfield Conservative\nConservative Bernard McGuin states the impact on energy bills of policies to tackle fuel poverty and reduce carbon emissions (or ‘green taxes’ as he puts it) is £200. The figure he gives is one from a right wing newspaper parroting a dubious report from a right wing policy group. The actual figure given by the Department of Energy Climate Change on behalf of the right wing Conservative Government is £42 per year. I can direct Mr McGuin to the appropriate part of his government’s website if he wants.\nHe says the coalition has been ‘saddled with the last government’s zeal to expand wind and solar power’. Actually there was consensus among the Westminister parties about the need for a feed in tariff for renewable energy before the General Election. If he can show me anything at all which contradicts my view I’d be interested to see it.\nMr McGuin also attempts to take credit away from the Greens for gaining free insulation for households in Kirklees through the Warm Zone scheme. The Green Party amendment to the 2007 Council budget which made the scheme free is a matter of public record. The emails I have between myself and the then Conservative leader and the official notes of discussions of meetings on the budget further confirm free insulation as a Green Party initiative. I’m more than happy to show Mr McGuin the evidence.\nHe asks whether the taxing of energy would ‘put a brake on economic growth’. As much of the money goes towards schemes that help reduce peoples fuel bills and projects which create employment and economic activity that is highly unlikely.\nIt is easy for Mr McGuin to write letters to the paper repeating misinformation he may have read in the national tabloids but he would do better to direct his concerns regarding fuel prices to the government which is lead by the Conservative Party, which for reasons best known to himself, he supports.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper\nLeader of the Green Party group\nI did ask Jason McCartney what the hell the party were playing at and, he said, there was no realisation of the huge costs involved. They have stopped the big schemes that drain the money. There is a problem with the amount of businesses that were drawn to these FIT's. It would be hard to pull the rug from underneath them now. I say go ahead and pull. The only real sufferers will be the Chinese and solar panel energy advisors.\nReplyDeleteThe costs for FIT on bills is negligible according to DECC (your government). Certainly not the £200 you mention. There are UK solar manufacturers such as Romag and Sharp. The big schemes weren't draining the money. Its just part of the usual coalition appreciate costs but not values. Our Solar PV industry is 0.3% of the size of the German PV industry so we're hardly going crazy. The Conservatives were fully aware of the feed in tariff before the election and Greg Barker was very much signed up to it. I know I was involved in the campaign to get the FIT in place. The other people who will suffer are the thousands of council tenants on low incomes who could get over a hundred pounds off their electricity bills each year. I don't know what your specialism is but I would tread carefully before expressing opinions about things which I really don't know much about and you do. This sounds like some stuff you've read in the Daily Mail as opposed to actual facts.\nReplyDelete",

Then there was the damage caused by the parking of their HGVs on pavements on Queens Mill Rd. This was followed more recently with HGVs parked on double yellow lines outside their works for days at a time. While checking progress on the parking fines on their vehicles I noticed a noxious smell. I walked up to the banking above their works and saw a mountain of festering, stinking unprocessed waste spilling out of building over 20 feet high. I have reported this to Kirklees Environmental Health and they made me aware that both they and the Environment Agency are pursuing legal action against Hunters Group.\"\nWhat is needed now is for Hunters to recognise their failings quickly and to deal with the problems they are causing the local community. Faîlure to do so is going to result in legal action that could make their business untenable going forward. This rogue company cannot be allowed to continue to operate in this out of control fashion. I advise people affected by the noxious stench from Hunters yard to contact the Environment Agency hotline on 0800 80 70 60.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2013_12_mono-mania_html/content_420.html": "| A monorail goes up New Street - from 2025 Kirklees Transport Vision |\nOne anecdote from the last Full Council meeting was my mock proposal to have a monorail from Scapegoat Hill, through Golcar and Milnsbridge and on into Town. The idea was to highlight the fantasy proposal from the Lib Dems about having some flyover bridge over Milnsbridge by coming up with something similarly financially unfeasible. For more background see my 'What's pink and hangs from a lamppost' blogpost about the Golcar By election.\nIt was during my speech that Tory Leader Robert Light piped up and said, 'The monorail was our idea!'. Apart from completely missing the point that I was taking the 'michael' out of the Lib Dems he was also wrong. Back in the days of plenty, 2005 to be exact, I asked for a feasibility study to be carried out into having a monorail link between Huddersfield Railway Station going up Leeds Road and past the Stadium on up to Cooper Bridge and back. The idea was to provide an alternative link for people going to the shopping up Leeds Rd, going to the Cinema or to watch a match without using the car. Leeds Road is a hotspot for traffic pollution and is an Air Quality Management Area so it would be one way of addressing this. The following day from the meeting I put the word 'monorail' into my search facility in my Outlook account and hey presto on the 14/2/2005 popped up the Green Party Budget amendment for that year compiled for us by the Ex Finanace Chief for Kirklees Dick Hewitson and there it stated:-\nProvide\na detailed feasibility for a public transport link between Huddersfield Town\nCentre, Leeds Road and Cooper Bridge - The 'Cooper Monorail'\nThis was from the Press Release we put out at the time:-\nLeeds Road is a hive\nof industrial and retail units, the Galpharm stadium and the UCI. With the\npossible expansion of industrial outlets on the Leeds Road corridor this puts\nincreasing pressure on traffic congestion and increasingly dangerous levels of\nlow air quality. “This is a typical example of the ‘build it and they will\ncome’ mentality where no thought has been given to how people will be able to\nget to places other than by road. Greens are proposing a detailed feasibility\nstudy into alternative modes of transport from Huddersfield Town Centre up\nLeeds Road and to Cooper Bridge. These will include the serious evaluation of\ndedicated bus lanes, trams and monorails as alternatives to the car.” Said\nCouncillor Cooper.\nI'm pretty sure I'd asked Dick Hewitson to take the 'Cooper Monorail' out of the final version of our Budget Amendment. At the time it was a bit of a 'mono mania' I had and the sort of Councillor enthusiasm that Council Officers may be sceptical about but can't really ignore if it is part of budget discussions. The reason I was pushing it was because whenever I saw a futuristic city ('Logans Run' springs to mind) they always had monorails as their preferred form of public transport. Electric non polluting and modern. The idea was taken up and some work was done on it during the Tory minority administration but like some other notable acheivements during their time such as 'free insulation' their origins came from the Green Party.\nThe thing to take away from all this is that with imposed local austerity, significant improvements to local transport are stalled and in some cases going backwards. Many local bus service are under threat and slow and unreliable train services like the Penistone Line limp on. Meanwhile the Coalition has its own 'mono mania' with the £50-80 Billion HS2 which it continues to bulldoze through despite robust evidence of its non-benefits. Governments should be judged, in part, by their vision of the future. For the Coalition it is big, national with highly contested benefits. The future has to be local, of significance to health and quality of life and benefit to communities and local economies. I think the 'Cooper Monorail' would stand up to scrutiny against HS2 on those parameters at least.\nKirklees is not the first place to consider a monorail the small town of Springfield in the USA also gave it some serious thought\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

The cost of building new classrooms and facilities would be placed on Kirklees Council’s already overstretched budget. There would also undoubtedly be significant new pressures on the road network around Shelley College, improvements to which would come at a cost.\nKirkburton Ward Councillor Robert Barraclough said,\n“Both mine and my colleague Derek Hardcastle’s children went through the middle school system and it has worked well for them as it has for thousands of other children in our area.\nShelley College should abandon this proposal and seek to rebuild relationships with the First and Middle schools, working collaboratively to deliver a first class, stable educational environment for our children.”\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper who leads the Greens on Kirklees Council said,\n“ It is unbelievable that a head teacher can put these sort of proposals forward with no accountability to democratically elected bodies like the Council. Just because Shelley College is at the top of the Shelley Pyramid does not give him the right to act like a Pharaoh. It shows a lack of respect for other schools and a scant disregard for the opinions of local people. I urge him to drop these proposals forthwith and recognise that he has overstepped the mark.\nWe strongly support the Save Shelley Pyramid campaign that is lead by local parents and would urge all other parties on Kirklees Council to do so also.”\nWell said! At last someone who understands the area making useful and sensible comments. I completely agree Andrew Cooper when he says Mc Nally has no respect for the middle & first schools. He also has in my opinion ,no respect for the parents & children he is employed to serve. This proposal is totally wrong for the children of this area, and if he had the first inkling of how this community works he would know that. When a headmaster becomes a business man first & foremost ,we are are all in trouble, our children are commodities to him. Bring this megalomaniac down in order to safeguard our children's futures.\nReplyDeleteI have children who will eventually move up through this system and to be honest I welcome the consultation that is going to happen. I don't understand the parents who are supposedly \"fighting for their children\" being so reluctant to wait for all the facts to be presented both for and against and then making an informed decision at that point. This \"angry mob\" Daily Mail reader mentality is laughable. KSP have stated their aim is to stop the Consultation happening - why? Makes me wonder how much the middle school staff are fueling this after all Turkeys dont vote for christmas!\nDeleteI support KSP. I'm not a Daily mail Reader or part of an angry mob nor do I have any 3-tier v 2-tier bias. I do however know what I want for my children. I am very interested to hear what Shelley have to say but I don't have to support how they have gone about it.\nDeleteI agree you Derek and Robert have shown common sense and stand by the community. well done.\nReplyDeleteto anonymous:\nReplyDeletepeople are up in arms for two very good reasons.\n1. The current system allows for the existence of some excellent small community schools. You will hopefully come to appreciate these. The middle schools save 10 year olds the trauma of moving from a 100 pupil school to a 2000 pupil school with pupils up to age 18 the head is trying to create\n2. Shelley college is not that good a school. It takes pupils from schools with outstanding ofsted status and only achieves a good score itself. This is because it is too big already and is way too regimented.\nBoth central facts are well known to all parents who have experience of the schools\nTo Mr or Mrs Anonymous (posted 22nd Oct 09:37),\nReplyDeleteYour comments are both arrogant and completely miss the plot. This should not even go to consultation for the reasons clearly mentioned. If you read the KSP facebook forum of follow on twitter then perhaps you would understand the strength of feeling to reject the Shelley proposal as it is financially motivated. The three tier system works fantastically well.

Suma's values make it a strong force for good business practice not just in environmental terms but in treatment of its employees. I've worked in the public sector, the rapacious cut throat private sector and even an employee owned company so it was refreshing to see a successful workers cooperative of many years standing doing so well. It is not the sort of company you would join if you were looking to buy a luxury yacht or a holiday cottage in the Cotswolds. What it does offer, it seems, is job satisfaction and relative job security in an increasingly insecure world. I got a buzz and feel for the place over the couple of hours I ŵas there and you definitely got the impression that it was a happy workforce as well as an obviously successful one.

Are politicians supposed to admit they enjoy things? Well one of the things that I particularly like doing is getting to understand political institutions and seeing how they work and using them to get some positive change. So I understand that is not everybody's cup of tea but it is mine.\nIt was 4 years ago when I was offered a place on the EU Committee of the Regions by Councillor Marianne Overton, Leader of the Independent Group on the Local Government Association I was part of the 24 strong UK delegation giving a voice from the local level into EU policy making. As a representative of the European Alliance group I have participated in 4 United Nations COP Climate Talks, lead on 2 policy documents (opinions) and seen best practice on mainly environmental initiatives across the EU. By it's very existence it demonstrates the lie that we have no influence over EU policy.\nIt has been a part of my working life for the last 4 years and I've reported on my activity fairly regularly on my Blog. The last few years, for have been blighted by the Brexit vote in 2016 for me. Just as UK MEPs have continued to go to the European Parliament I have continued to go to the Committee of the Regions and provide my views from a Green and UK perspective on EU policy.\nToday I made my last contribution. We heard from Jacob Werksman, Principal Adviser for International Aspects of EU Climate Policy, European Commission, who is the EU's chief climate negotiator to the UNFCCC COP25. He explained how he was working on something called the 'Climate Pact' a process by which National Governments would make agreements with local authorities on how they could work together on climate action. My suggestion was that the EU Committee of the Regions, as the body representing Local and Regional Authorities, should be involved in the design of the Climate Pacts. This seemed to go down well and I'm hopeful that we will get a better document as a result. Depending on the outcome of the UK General Election, UK Councils may or may not be involved in climate pacts with National Governments to address the climate emergency we face.\nSo farewell talented employees of the EU Committee of the Regions who guided us through EU policy and helped me achieve some of my policy ambitions, farewell colleagues and now friends who I worked with and some who I'll continue to work with.\nIs it the end?

This is a totally necessary and responsible activity for any large public organisation responsible for delivering vital local services. There is a danger however that this reinforces the risk averse culture that can exist in many councils with an emphasis on playing it safe and giving an undue weight to risk avoidance rather than taking opportunities.\nIn June Sheffield City Council passed a resolution to establish a Corporate Opportunities Register to balance the attention given to risk and opportunity by senior officers and Councillors. The motion proposed by the Green Party group said,\n\"that to act as a balance to the Corporate Risk Register, there should be a Corporate Opportunities Register, detailing new funding opportunities, partnership opportunities and initiatives that will help deliver the Council's objectives, such as supporting those affected by the cost of living crisis.\"\nSo what might a Corporate Opportunities Register look like? First you need to identify what the opportunity is. Is it funding you can bid for from Government or other sources? Is it a partnership with another organisation that might help you drive efficiencies and deliver better services? Is it a new activity that can help the Council achieve it's aims or generate an income stream? All these opportunities would need to be broken down by directorates to ensure high level attention is given across the council .\nNot all opportunities we could take should be taken. Perhaps the likelihood of success is low or the effort expended simply not worth it, but demonstrating that as an organisation the Council is aware and tracking opportunities is important. It builds confidence and shows that officers and members are outward looking and keen to look beyond the councils own resources to achieve it's goals.\nThe real gain from establishing a Corporate Opportunities Register is to show that the culture of the Council is one that is outward facing, ambitious for it's people, entrepreneurial and dynamic. Surely that is something we would like all our Councils to be?",

The US-EU\nTransatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) could be sealed in the\nnext few days and under cover of the benefits of free trade, it is set to\ncreate an obscure process, known as the investor-state dispute mechanism, which\ncould strike down the democratic wishes of British citizens.\nAndrew Cooper said:\n“The Government has\nrepeatedly promised a referendum on any big changes to the EU, but, TTIP poses\nby far the biggest potential threat on the sovereignty of Britain in decades\nand it seems ready to just sign our rights away. The treaty is supposed to\nharmonise regulations between Europe and the USA, but it will also create the\nlegal right to rip the heart out of any Government policies or laws which big\nbusinesses decide are not in the interests of their shareholders.”\nMany of TTIP’s\nprovisions are being kept confidential at the moment, but they are known to\ninclude a right for private companies to sue Governments that introduce any\npolicies that go against their business objectives, especially if they harm\ntheir profits. Under the investor-state dispute mechanism, private investors\nwill then be able to take legal action against Governments to reverse policies\nand claim compensation from taxpayers.\nAndrew Cooper continued:\n“Look at the current\ndebate on energy policy and the different choices for Britain's future. Well, a\nfew years ago, Argentina introduced a range of policies on energy and economics\nto rescue the country from a national financial crisis. Because they were\nunhappy with these, five international energy companies used a similar treaty\narrangement to TTIP to sue the Argentinian Government, which has just agreed to\npay them $677 millionsto settle their claims. There are similar examples with\nplain cigarette packets in Australia and cyanide water pollution from\ngold-mining in El Salvador.”\n“If the TTIP passes,\ncompanies based anywhere in the world would be able to sue over laws on\nenvironmental protection, renewables commitment, health and so on, whenever EU\nrules are tougher than US ones or affect profit. For example, in food,\nYorkshire consumers could be forced to accept hormones in beef cattle and\nchicken meat washed in chlorine and our farmers could have to surrender any\nfreedom to choose about GM crops.”\nThe US and British\nGovernments argue that the treaty will create jobs, but there is no evidence\nfor this – indeed, similar agreements in the past in other countries have led\nto the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n“The Green Party is\nraising the alarm – the other parties aren’t,” said Andrew Cooper. “The\ncosts will dramatically outweigh any benefits. Jobs could be lost here in\nYorkshire as well as elsewhere unless we accept lower and lower standards, and\neven potentially dangerous ones, in both consumer and employee protection.”\n“Caroline Lucas, Green MP, has tabled an Early\nDay Motion in Parliament expressing concern about the investor-state dispute\nmechanism – but she has received no support from the Coalition or Labour. Apart from the Greens,\nthe other parties at Westminster and in Europe seem spellbound by the desire\nfor free trade at any price, and the price could be high indeed.”\nENDS\n----------------------\nContact: Andrew Cooper, 01484 667519 | 07721\n348619\nGreen Party Energy Spokesperson; Yorkshire &\nHumber lead Euro candidate.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

I saw it during construction an at its opening and I'm incredibly impressed by the work the groundbreaking work the Green Building Company have done on this project. The estimated heating costs are around £75/year and around £100 for the hot water (though the solar thermal system may reduce that cost). It is of national significance as it uses cavity construction and so could by replicated by the building industry across the UK.

RJ Bray can be forgiven for taking some of the dubious misinformation from Government and in the papers about the cost of Feed In Tariffs at face value but maybe not on describing me as \"Clr Khan’s friendly Green \". More research required R J! If he'd stuck 'occasionally' in front that would be fine! Anyway here's R J followed by myself\nKIRKLEES Council leader Clr Mehboob Khan’s latest gripe is that money which he hoped to receive for a solar energy panel scheme which were to be fitted to 1,000 council properties has now been cancelled.\nClr Khan’s friendly Green Clr Andrew Cooper told the Examiner that it was a blow to the elderly and vulnerable people currently living in fuel poverty.\nSo does Clr Cooper’s statement mean that there are only 1,000 people in the Huddersfield area living in fuel poverty and all are currently living in council property? I think not.\nCome the cold months myself and her that shall be obeyed will be wearing more layers than an onion has skins due to the criminally high energy prices.\nClr Khan and Clr Cooper I feel would have more credibility if they represented the collective rather than a select few.\nWhy do they not campaign for cheaper energy for everyone or more winter fuel allowance for those in more need?\nInstead, they help create higher energy bills for people by having them fund through their meters the feed-in tariffs for those who have solar panels or wind turbines.\nIn this manner they also put more money into the energy companies’ pockets. In all fairness, is this right?\nAlternative energy will never drive our country forward. It will have the reverse effect and send our country back to the Stone Age.\nIndustry along with our homes cannot be sustained by wind, solar or wave power. It’s a little like a dripping tap into an empty reservoir at the height of summer.\nThe country needs a nuclear project and it needs it now if we are to get away from fossil fuels and be less dependent on gas from overseas. Let’s not forget the madcap carbon capture process that is to get underway at the cost of billions of pounds to the taxpayer along with industry itself.\nMaybe Clr Khan and Clr Cooper could ask for some money from that major worthless project called the European Union which drives these schemes.\nI agree that we must pollute our atmosphere less and giant steps have been taken – but let us remember that this cannot be at the cost of the extinction of mankind, otherwise what has it all been for?\nR J Bray\nShelley\nRead More http://www.examiner.co.uk/views-and-blogs/reader-letters/2011/12/03/examiner-letters-june-2011-86081-29886400/#ixzz1fgGUnGIB\nTo the Editor\nRJ Bray (Examiner 3/12) takes me to task for my dismay over the government cuts to the funding of the Feed In Tariff for solar panels and in particular the suspending of the Council scheme to install solar panels on the homes of 1000 Council Tenants. He says,\n“does Clr Cooper’s statement mean that there are only 1,000 people in the Huddersfield area living in fuel poverty and all are currently living in council property?”\nNo I don’t, but it would be a start to help those people by running such a scheme which could then be expanded later. There are also currently schemes available for private householders where the panels are installed for free and the householders get the benefit of the electricity in return for handing the Feed in Tariff to the installing company. A number of households around Huddersfield have done this already. If he wants details I’ll pass them onto him. Of course not everyone can benefit from this scheme due to the orientation or size of their roof but many can. So the existing policy framework for solar is one which many people can take advantage of but changes by the government threaten its viability for everyone.\nMr Bray says that Feed In Tariffs,\n“help create higher energy bills for people by having them fund through their meters the feed-in tariffs for those who have solar panels or wind turbines”\nThe actual impact of the Feed In Tariff policy on energy bills last year was 30p for the average household. This is less than a penny a week. The cost of a new nuclear power station, which Mr Bray is so keen on, can be a round £4.25 Billion and that doesn’t take into account the decommissioning costs and the costly handling of dangerous nuclear waste. This will have a much more significant impact on energy bills.\nHe asks of myself and Cllr Khan,\n“Why do they not campaign for cheaper energy for everyone”\nI don’t presume to speak for Cllr Khan but for my part I successfully proposed making insulation free for all householders in Kirklees, I was the trustee of a national fuel poverty charity for 8 years and have helped many householders reduce their fuel bills through advice on energy tariffs and by getting information out to householders on a number of ways to help reduce fuel bills. So I don’t believe I’m deficient in wanting to help people reduce their bills.\nMr Bray goes on to say,\n“Industry along with our homes cannot be sustained by wind, solar or wave power.”\nI agree to a point. In addition we are going to need greater levels of energy efficiency in buildings better controls and energy management, district heating systems, anaerobic digestion and a whole host of other actions to make the future of energy supply in the UK more secure. Althis l does rather beg a question why only Malta and Luxembourg in Europe have a worse proportion of their energy generated from renewable sources than the UK. What is technically possible on the continent seems somehow difficult here. The laws of physics are not different this side of the channel but some attitudes, prejudices and opinions among some certainly are.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper - Green Party\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Newsome isn't a huge area but we believe we have identified enough space for the trees. The 1000 fruit tree project (I must think of a better title) has 2 aims:-\nAim 1 - To plant a 1000 fruit trees - We want to plant a mixture of fruit species giving people a range of free food in their own backyard. We are keen to involve school children in the planting to give them a sense of connection with the land around them and to give them the ability in a few years of being able to eat food from a tree they planted. I believe the benefits go beyond the food itself and it helps give people a sense of place and a better connection with the geography around them.\nAim 2 - To get the word 'Beellotments' into the Oxford English Dictionary - People are familiar with the word 'Allotments' . You get a patch of ground from the Council and grow stuff on it. Recently people have tried putting hives on allotments but the bees annoyed other allotment holders. With the thousand fruit tree scheme we have the opportunity to fence off an area of trees specifically for hives which the Council can rent out to beekeepers. The bees will emerge from their hives with trees to pollenate on their doorstep and we will be doing our bit to protect our vital bee population.

I like old churches and other buildings with modern glass atriums. The odd thing here in many ways is that the NIMBYism isn't coming from the community but from the Councils Planning department. It's not really NIMBYism either but a very rigid interpretation of planning policy which is supposed to be enabling rather than restrictive. Opposition to wind turbines from communities is a very different phenomenon and curiously British from what I can make out. The best examples of dealing with it is through community ownership or a community share of a wind development.

The 'industrial' wind farm was perceived as a threat to the identity of the town which was historically seen as a place of scenic beauty and restoration. But, he concluded that 'new, industrial' wind farm technology could be reconciled with the 'old, natural' identity of the town by drawing upon the town's 'proud history' as a progressive and forward-thinking place in its early, formative years - a much more palatable place identity.<br />Perhaps, therefore, a way forward for reconciling listed building status with renewable technology would be to 're-imagine' or 'reconstruct' the meaning that we attach to such buildings; for example, in these cases, drawing upon the adaptability of such buildings in a modernising world as a reason for its continued existence and public appeal, rather than as passive, historical relics that shouldn't be tampered with.Garethhttp://homelessinstoke.comnoreply@blogger.com",

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2011_10_jobs-homes-and-cows_html/content_807.html": "|\n| Jobs and homes and that's it! |\nI've long had an issue with the way Kirklees Council has approached the Local Development Framework. I remember sitting in a Kirklees Party Leaders meeting and seeing the proofs of the consultation document entitled 'Jobs and Homes'. Immediately I said that planning was about much more than simply 'jobs and homes'. It was about transport , agriculture, amenity, quality of life. Somehow it reminded me of one of those Labour Conference slogans in the 80s. Did they ever have one called 'Jobs, Homes and Peace'. I probably just imagined it. What is really striking (and frankly depressing) is how similar Council Leader Mehboob Khan's approach is to the Coalition Goverment is on planning policy. When Labour Cllr Khan and Conservative Communities Minister Eric Pickles see a field they see people building on it and pound signs. They both see a field ripe for development that once it has a house built on it has a monetary value, a quick bung for allowing development, some short term jobs in construction and a revenue stream to replace some of the central government cuts. It is a narrow, unimaginative and rubbish concept of land that devalues our local environment.\nIn planning policy at the national level I've had a very small victory recently in the Local Government Association's response to the consultation on the National Planning Policy Framework. It is a much reviled document and the Coalition Government has attacked some of the 'anti growth/anti capitalist' orgainsations that have had the temerity to oppose them. These include the National Trust, English Heritage and the Campaign to Protect Rural England. The LGA has to balance its responses to consultations against the competing views of different political parties and the ruling Conservative Group. I am the Independent Cllrs group rep on the LGA Environment and Housing Board (the Greens are included with Independents). Of course the LGA response is much more restrained than the Green Party's but I have got the following wording included:\n\"It should also be recognised that undeveloped land can have a sustained lasting economic value in terms of agriculture, tourism and amenity and can be strongly related to the quality of life of the people in the area.\"\n|\n| Jobs , Homes and Cows |\nThere can be real value in land which is not simply related to sticking some huge 'shopping shed 'on it erected by some monopolistic company which will take most of the economic value of their work out of the area (and probably out of the country as well via tax avoidance). These sort of developments are exactly the sort of rubbish approach that gives politics a bad name, creating cynicsm and alienating communities, but it doesn't have to be like this. We have a prime (beef?) example on our doorstep with\nStirley Farm in Newsome. This council land was disused agricultural fields with derelict buildings. It is now managed by Yorkshire Wildlife Trust who are developing a community farm and local food projects on the farmland around Newsome and below Castle Hill. It enjoys huge local support, links well with the\nGrowing Newsome group and is rapidly being embraced as part of the tapestry that makes up the Newsome community. It is 'development'. Jobs are being created in paid employment, training and voluntary work. Local food is being grown and through outreach work local people are being shown how to grow their own fruit and vegetables and thereby helping lower their household costs. This 'development' is preserving and improving the local area in harmony with the community in a way that simply 'bunging up' another Barratt estate or yet another sodding Tesco's never would or could. Stirley Farm has real value, is valued locally and today has cows. The first 3 beef shorthorns arrived today with another dozen on the way to help build the herd. This is a small part what a real 'Local Development Framework' that people could support and one that would enhance rather than threaten their quality of life.\nBy what regulation can the Council stop Councillors discussing the LDF before the 'big date?'\nReplyDeleteNone\nReplyDeleteSo why didn't they?\nReplyDeleteSorry you'll have to explain.\nReplyDeleteWhen attending public meetings on the LDF one got the impression that the councillors were instructed not to put their views forward. One said that if they opposed the LDF publicly it would 'prejudice' the matter when they came to vote on it. Whas that the case or were they allowing the public the space to express their views?\nReplyDeleteOK I understand now. No I see no reason why Councillors can't express views and opinions on the LDF nor do I believe it would prejudice the decision. It is not a particular planning application. Sounds like a convenient position to take.\nReplyDelete",
  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2012_08_staying-bought_html/content_370.html": "| The Conservatives were well rewarded for allowing Cllr Khan to continue to run the Council |\n“The Conservative Party has few virtues but one it does have is that when it is bought it stays bought.”\nSpeeches by Conservative Councillors had just let the cat out of the bag. They wouldn’t be supporting the amendment to the Councils rollover report which would have secured the library service at its current staffing levels for the next 4 years. Given their public pronouncements during the election campaign this flew in the face of their stated position of defending the library service from future cuts that are strongly indicated by the review of the service. In short the Tories were backing Labour against the Lib Dems , Independents and Greens. This followed their tacit support for the Labour Leadership at the Annual Council Meeting in May as Labour supported the Tories taking a disproportionate number of Committee Chair places (along with the allowances that go with them) hence the ‘staying bought’ comment.\nThis situation is a bit of a shift for Labour as well. The ‘Strong Leader’ Mehboob Khan made much of the need for ‘progressive’ parties to unite against the Conservatives, who had been pushing a misleading and populist agenda in the run up to the local elections.\nPatronage and the pursuit of power beats both populism and progressive politics in this particular version of the‘paper stone scissors’ game.\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Very good our churches installing solar panels. For all that live near by and all that see this on our Churches. If your Local Government will not look to the Future go to a Church.<br /><br /><br />The Island of Maui in the Pacific Ocean is truly a Tropical Paradise like many of the Hawaii Islands that has used Solar and wind Energy for many years. Its Seascapes are as Beautiful as its Landscapes. Many like Hana’s by Kipahulu in Maui were the coffee maker runs on the Sun Solar Power. Her freshly picked Tropical fruit smoothies are the greatest. You make the electrical power on a bicycle for the blender to run. Banana, Mango, Papaya, Guava and of course My favorite Coconut and Pineapple are just some of what you can make.<br /><br /><br />Many of us that live and visit Maui already have Solar and Wind Energy. Very soon many more will and some day most all will be cutting the line to the Power Utilities Grid. Stopping them from putting their hands in our pocket book.<br /><br /><br />Free Energy from the Sun. WHY pay for it, to some one else? Your Local Utility Provider is NOT A valuable resource in Your Time Of Financial Need. Or the GOV they just want to TAX you more. LOOK TO SOLAR AND WIND ENERGY on the internet it has been the learning platform for our Schools and Universities for Years. In this case look to the House of GOD. It has always been the best place for the truth. The Church and the Bible.<br /><br /><br />Many in the Island of Maui and other Islands have been off the Grid for years.<br /><br />There are many Reasons Home Owners Should Consider Going Solar there has to be at least 100 Good Reasons. Soon Hawaii will Lead with showcasing Solar Energy To the World.<br /><br /><br />GOD Bless for the good work all do to Help the Church Light the Way.<br /><br />Now if we can only get our World Leaders to Read the Bible More, and look to the real Paradise Heaven not Hell, and stay out of our Pocket books.<br /><br /><br />The Lord’s little Helper<br /><br />Paul Felix SchottP.F.S.https://www.blogger.com/profile/09527885065760876564noreply@blogger.com",

The idea behind this is to give the old Milnsbridge Socialist Club a new lease of life and as a useful centre and venue for radical/progressive politics. It gave me some cause for thought about some of the labels we go by in politics. As Milnsbridge Socialist Club it's traditional allegiance would have been to the Labour Party when 'socialism'and Labour were regarded as pretty much the same thing. With the loss of Clause 4 and a recent Labour Government which did its own share of privatisation, being a Socialist in the Labour Party may be more of a convenience than a conviction for those who label themselves as such. There's also no end of other groupings who are proud to shout from the rooftops their socialism e.g. The Socialist Party, Trade Unionist and Socialist against the Cuts, the Socialist Workers Party, the Alliance for Green Socialism. Within the Green Party we have people who regard themselves as socialists and organise themselves under the banner of 'Green Left'.\nI've never regarded my own politics as socialist. I'm philosophically a Liberal and believe strongly in the positive freedoms of the individual and freedom from 'Ignorance, Poverty and Conformity' as we used to say in the Young Liberals back in the 80's. I'm sure some folks in the Liberal Democrats still say that now but with much less credibility given their bedfellows. In Kirklees Council meetings the Tory Leader once described me as an 'extreme socialist' which I found pretty amusing and reflected more how far to the right of the Tories he was than any understanding of my own politics or motivations. I'm not frightened by the word 'socialist' nor regard it as a negative it just doesn't reflect my own political background . I usually tell Tories who accuse me of being a Socialist or a 'Watermelon' (red on the inside green on the outside -geddit? Yawn) that they've got it wrong and \"No I'm not a Socialist I'm much worse than that!\" They sort of wander away looking a bit confused.\nBack to 'The Red and Green Club' and all credit to Labour Cllr Paul Salveson for pushing this venture and for stepping above the tribalism that is Party Politics. The Colne Valley has a strong radical tradition with the Luddites, Socialist MP Victor Grayson and I would argue Liberal MP Richard Wainwright a life long pacifist who worked as an ambulance driver in World War 2 rather than take up arms. I'm not suggesting Paul changes the name to 'The Red, Green and Yellow Club' the Lib Dems have obviously moved a long way since Richard Wainwright's time.\nIf you want to have a go at objectively testing how socialist/radical/tender you are there is a test you can take. I guess Tories/UKIP people could take it in the same way someone might want to test if they've got some awful disease. My scores for the record were radicalism 96.75 socialism 88 tenderness 55 (got a bit of work to do on that last one) so here's Andrew Strong singing 'Try a little Tenderness'\nSimilar to my score so I don't think we need to take that one very seriously. I got 56.25 for tenderness and I always though I was a bit mushy.\nReplyDeleteDon't worry about the tenderness I only got 50, and I'm the nicest person I know - 100 for socialism and 94 for Radicalism. I'll post it to the green left and see what they all get!!!!!!!!!\nReplyDelete",

I was part of the Green Party Team in the 'Spin Room' to provide commentary on the debate. The Spin Room was in a seperate building from the place where the debate proper was held. It was in a building called 'The Pie Factory' which I guess it might have been once. It looked like it had been very hastily put together as a studio to contain all the camera crews and milling politicos and their press teams.\nIn the end I did a piece to camera for the Press Association and that was that, but interesting to be there nonetheless. Green MSP Patrick Harvie described the atmosphere as being like a Count without the ballot papers and it was. The room was full of prominent Politicians waiting around for hours many of whom I don't like much. it was just that instead of your common or garden Tory Cllrs we had George Osborne and Teresa May accompanied by their Special Branch minders. Reps from all the parties were there all in their huddles just like we were.\nNatalie gave solid and substantial answers to the questions posed and the social media response to her was very positive. Nicola Sturgeon shone with righteous anger and Leanne Wood took first blood. She laid into the contemptible Farage. He seemed to have completely defaulted to his BNP factory settings by blaming immigration for every question posed to him.\nCameron and Clegg we learnt nothing new about as a result of the debate. Clegg in denial of the harm he's caused and Cameron as 'smooth' and oily as ever. It was Miliband who was 'odd'. Now I know it isn't a revelation to say he is odd but Sheffield Central Candidate Cllr Jillian Creasy reckoned he had over rehearsed. It was the way he stared directly at the camera as if he was trying to enter your very soul when he answered a question that freaked me out.

To tackle these problems, we have made a donation\nof £1500 to The Welcome Centre who are the largest food bank in our area\nand asked them to engage with the many villages that make up the Kirkburton\nParish. We have also encouraged community organisations that have been hit with\nbig room hire costs to apply to the Parish Council for a grant to help deal\nwith these extra costs.”\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper who is also a Kirkburton\nParish Councillor said,\n“We are also asking people managing Community\nBuildings to apply for funding to improve the energy efficiency of their\nbuildings. Whether it is insulation or solar panels or improvements to lighting\nall these things can help reduce energy use in buildings. It is good for\nfinances and the environment. Parish Councils don’t have huge budgets like\nKirklees Council, but we do make good use of the funds we have even if it is in\na small way.”\nDetails of Kirkburton Parish Council grant schemes\ncan be found on the Kirkburton Parish Council website www.kbpc.co.uk",

My own view is that there is a lot of lazy analysis by opponents of electric vehicles which doesn't fully take into account the benefits of overnight charging using the spinning demand of the generators or the lower carbon mix from the use of wind energy generated at night. There are also the plans to decarbonise electricity generation anyway so it makes sense to start to develop ways of storing energy that could be produced from a range of renewable technologies. Electric cars are part of the solution to our energy and transport problems.\nEach local authority involved in the EU Programme was asked to provide information on how many vehicles the Council used, including the 'grey fleet' (employees own vehicles). For Kirklees this was 1050 vehicles including 1 x Electric 3.5 Tonnes Transit Tipper truck. This vehicle was purchased for emptying all the street bins around Huddersfield Town Centre and is a familiar sight to shoppers and it has a nice 'Tackling Climate Change' livery. It was purchased as a result of one of our budget deals around 4 or 5 years ago and it is charged up every night at the Incinerator (sorry Waste to Energy Plant!) Effectively it is charged up by burning peoples household rubbish. Whatever your views about incineration , and my own are mixed, this is charging a vehicle at nil additional cost to the Council. Sadly the truck is still a lone electric addition to the Councils fleet.\nOne of the tangible frustrations Councillor Roger Stone of Rotherham had was the seeming reluctance/inability of the manufacturers present to lower the prices of their vehicles even with the 'tempting' carrot of the additional buying power offered by joint procurement. The story from the manufacturers is that there is not much if any margin on the product and production is not up to capacity yet anyway, so the opportunity to bring prices down is not high. The £5000 grant from the government obviously helps but there's still several thousand pounds above the costs of a petrol/diesel equivalent to find. Talking to one of the manufacturers I tried a different angle by asking what value they would place in marketing terms to a council that really went out of its way to promote electric vehicles. I suggested a package of measures:\n- lower fees for the licensing of taxis/private hire electric vehicles\n- Taxi ranks with electric charging points\n- Free on street parking for electric vehicles for the next 3 years\n- Charging points for electric vehicle at car parks\n- Section 106 agreements to install charging points on new developments\n- Promotion of the benefits of electric vehicles in council media and publications\n- More demonstration vehicles by the Council itself\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

Regular readers of this blog will recall the 2 floods on Dean Brook Road that have occured in recent years. At times of high rainfall there is increased danger of a high water level on Dean Brook which has seen the road turn into a river and some local houses flooded with all the misery hat accompanies such events.\nThis solution to the problem has come out of the community and a lot of credit should go to local man John Lockwood who came up with a solution that diverts water onto the field before Dean Brook Road at times of high flood risk. Local Architects 'One 17 Design' have also been a great supporter carrying out the work and have matched funds from local people and those that Newsome Ward Councillors have contributed from Area Committee funds.\nThis is a real good news story and one where it is local people and community spirit that has produced a locally grown solution that should protect this part of the village for years to come.\n| Dean Brook Road during the first flood a few years ago |\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

I am of course talking about the 'policy' to move households in council houses in deprived areas to council houses in areas with plenty of jobs. Since the Tories started selling off council houses in the 80's there are now much less available council houses anyway. You also have to ask yourself how much available council housing there will be in 'well to do' areas with lots of jobs - not many if any. So maybe they could build some more Council houses with all the money we haven't got. In any case even if they did have the money they have abolished the house building targets which throws all housebuilding plans into disarray. Of course you have to question the wisdom and morality of a government accepting that some communities should be allowed to sink into further decline as its more mobile working age (young?) people move away. This so called 'policy' is utterly meaningless and I am completely bemused how Duncan-Smith has got some status as a Tory welfare guru when he appears to be so devoid of ideas and initiative. Hence this latest nonsense.\nHere's another 'non-policy',David Cameron talking about troops coming out of Afghanistan in 5 years. No plans to do it, no real plan to create a stable Afghanistan, no recognition that British Troops are not part of the solution in Afghanistan but part of the problem. Why 5 years, why not 4, why not 2, why not tomorrow?\nWhy do journalists give this sort of non-policy, non-story any credence whatsoever?\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

It's one of the things that got me involved in politics in the first place. The need to take on the pompous, the bullies and those who believe they have a right to the positions they hold or those who believe that no one has a legitimate democratic right to challenge them. When I was first elected and many years afterwards I inwardly winced when Council officers referred to me as 'Councillor' and I tried to steer them in the 'Call me Andrew' direction. Now I recognise that Council Officers referring to me as 'Councillor' is a way of them emphasising their professional detachment and being clear about our respective roles which is not the same as the deference I so despise. I live with the title, I guess I've earn't it.\nThe general populace has caught up and deference to politicians is not what it was in years gone by. This has got to be a good thing. It comes as a bit of a shock after 18 or so years on the Council to find that some people regard you as part of 'the establishment'. So one Saturday night a few weeks ago I'm wandering through Huddersfield Bus Station and this drunken guy shouts across at me \"Hey! you're Andrew Cooper, my MP. I could do your job but I bet you couldn't do mine!\", It was on the tip of my tongue to come out with some witty remark referencing what I thought his job might be but I decided instead to just give him a cheery wave and say 'Bye!'. Of course, and unfortunately, I wasn't his MP and a Councillor gets about a seventh of the salary of an MP. I also guess that he only had the faintest idea of what I actually did as a Councillor (or what an MP did come to that) and that to him it would be something along the lines of just saying whatever came into my head in a meeting and who can't do that for goodness sake?\nJust as a drink or two can make people bold so can social media and I often read, whimsically, the inaccurate comments made about me, or my role, on the Huddersfield Examiner Facebook page. The latest was someone who asserted that I could claim back my energy bills in expenses from the Council ' I'm afraid not matey!' I didn't bother trying to correct him. Maybe I should have done.\nSo has the lack of deference to politicians gone too far? I don't think so and politicians can worry too much about what some guy posts (it usually is a guy) on social media about them. We've just got to a certain extent 'suck it up'. Every now and again someone will cross a line but generally we've got to live with it or take them on as you see fit. A bit of a thick skin can be helpful to people in the public eye.\nDeference and the love of positions for their own sake is not dead. For some politicians the title as opposed the role, and the deference/respect that comes with those positions, remains a prime motivator. It concerns me greatly because a desire for a position is not generally a good measure of someone's suitability for that position. If that position is achieved by patronage to secure the deference of colleagues then that concerns me even more. So though some regard me as part of 'the establishment' these days I will continue to challenge those in power and those who seek it for the wrong reasons.\nSo has the lack of deference to politicians gone too far?

Despite this fact the Lib Dems have a ‘balancing\nseat’ on the Combined Authority and the Greens are not represented at all.

We were ahead of the Liberal Democrats who got 53,433 votes.\nThat the Lib Dems should get 5 more seats on the Combined Authority’s Scrutiny\nPanels is clearly unfair and undemocratic and contrary to the views of West\nYorkshire voters. I don't blame the Lib Dems for this it is the result of a system that doesn't reflect voters views bt instead the number of Councillors elected to each West Yorkshire Council.\nWhen proposals for the Governance arrangements for the\nCombined Authority were being negotiated between Government and West Yorkshire\nCouncils the Green Party proposed that there should be an additional seat on\nthe Combined Authority to ensure all voters were represented.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2015_06/content_40.html": "A blog by Green Party Councillor Andrew Cooper about Green Politics, action on Climate Change, Kirklees Council and our activity to improve the local and global environment (and also anything that I fancy talking about)\nPromoted and published by A Cooper, 76 Brockholes Lane, Holmfirth HD9 7EB\nI went to my first meeting of he SEDEC Commission of the Committee of the Regions today.\nWhat stood out for me on the agenda was the draft opinion on minimum wages across the EU. It had been raised as a issue by a Labour member and it was a fine enough paper in its own terms. One of the problems I had with the paper was that it didn't really look at low wages in the context of wider inequality and a widening gap between the rich and the poor. This is what I said,\n\"I am fully behind the sentiments of the draft opinion but I wonder whether the quickest way to help people on the lowest incomes is by introducing a maximum wage rather than just a minimum wage. Imagine how fast minimum wages would rise if the Chief Executive of a Company or Council could only be paid no more than 10 times the salary of the lowest paid worker. Addressing low pay is tackling one symptom of a culture based on inequality. If we are to have a holistic approach to poverty and inequality we need to address greed with as much vigour as we tackle need.\"\nCllrs Julie Stewart-Turner, Andrew Cooper and Karen Allison at Kings Bridge\nKings Bridge is to shut to through traffic between 13/7 to the 16/8 this summer for essential gas works\nDuring the 5 weeks that the bridge is to be closed to vehicles it will be open for pedestrian use only. The work, costing £70k will replace old gas pipes with new and is being timed for the summer holidays to minimise disruption.\nNorthern Gas Networks have informed Kirklees that staff will be working 7 days/week to ensure the work is completed on schedule. Diversion signage will be placed at strategic spots along the route.\nGreen Party Councillors Andrew Cooper & Julie Stewart –Turner met with Kirklees Highways staff and Northern Gas Networks representatives to discuss the project and to see how disruption to the closure of this busy entry point to the Town Centre can be kept to a minimum.\nEconomic Growth was a bit of a theme for me at the latest EU Committee of the Regions (CoR) meeting. Firstly the group I am affiliated to in the CoR, the European Alliance was debating the principles that itwill be pursuing through the CoR. Throughout the draft principles document were references to Economic Growth as being always a positive thing without question. Given some of the negative aspects of Economic Growth I had asked for this to be changed to Sustainable Development and this was accepted & without much disagreement from what was reported to me. Growth came up again in the Plenary session on employment rights. Again Economic Growth was put up as a positive goal to be achieved without any question as to its negative impacts and inherent contradictions. I gave my maiden speech at CoR Plenary by qchallenging the unquestioning positive assumptions people make about economic growth. There's a great book called 'Enough is Enough' which is a great read which rightly questions whether growth is always worth it in terms of the environmental damaged and lower wages that often result. The other point is to question whether or not Economic Growth is even achievable, in the long term, as an economic aim as it is exponential in nature but consumers and resources are finite. At the bottom of this post is an interesting film which lasts only 18 minutes but outlines the inherent contradictions of Economic Growth.\nAnother positive thing was I met other Greens on the CoR for the first time. At a meeting organised by be European Green Party 5 of us came together for the first time. There are about 12 Greens in the CoR but are spread across a number of groups. 18 Greens are needed across 7 countries to enable us to form our own group so we are not quite there yet and in any case perhaps our strength lies in having influence in a number of different groups.\nMr Juncker, the President of the European Commission came to talk to us about his 300+ Billion Euro Investment Plan. He outlined some details of his plan and complained about a lack of an invite to the UK Govt for a visit so I was all lined up to ask a question but he left early before I had chance to put it. So exclusively for you here is the question I would have asked.\nQuantative easing is likely to be a significant part of the funding for the Juncker Plan. If this funding is simply thrown at financial institutions it will either be wasted or unfocused or both. Using that funding to support Green Bonds could ensure it is linked to achieving EU Carbon & Energy targets and linking with the energy security aims of the Energy Union. I would like Mr Junckers view of this suggestion.\nI would also like to take the opportunity to invite you to the UK in the absence of an invitation from the UK Govt to look at the work of Kirklees Council is doing to address fuel poverty and reduce carbon emissions often in spite of the policies of the UK Government rather than because of them.\nSo unfortunately we will never know whether Mr Juncker would have accepted my invitation to Kirklees after apparently being snubbed by the UK Govt. The question I asked is consistent with what Greens in the European Parliament have been asking for.\nMy next aim is to develop a proposal for a CoR opinion. I'll keep you posted.",

The Green Group was more than happy to help\nand as a result Kirklees had the UK’s first universally free insulation scheme,\na renewable energy fund that installed solar panels on many council buildings,\na solar scheme for householders with no upfront costs and schools constructed\nto very high energy specifications. Kirklees now has a majority party in\ncontrol and is less innovative, risk averse, officer lead and managerial. My\nown politics aside it is a real shame and a waste of political power. For me\nthe whole point of my political journey has been to make change happen and that\nis why I am standing to be West Yorkshire’s first Mayor.\nSo enough about me what about\nthe policies I will champion as West Yorkshire Mayor.\nThe Green Bullding Fund that I\npropose aims to mainstream quality assured high energy standards in public\nsector building and social housing projects.\n4 years ago I chaired an All\nParty Group on Kirklees Council looking at the Passivhaus standard. A quality\nassured means of construction that produces buildings with low energy\ndemand, low carbon emissions and high\nenergy efficiency standards. These are airtight properties with mechanical heat\nrecovery ventilation.\nWe looked at costs and\ngathered evidence from the Passivhaus Trust, and leading pioneering councils\nlike Norwich City Council and Exeter City Council where they have mainstreamed\nPassivhaus on public sector projects. Once backed by a good supply of work and\na policy that gives the construction sector the confidence to invest in skills,\nconstruction costs are not that much higher than building to current building\nregulation standards. The Passivhaus Trust reckons additional building cost are\nsomewhere between 4-8% but that cost is soon recovered in saved energy costs. Some\nof the most powerful evidence we took was talking to people who lived in passivhaus\nproperties and also seeing passive houses being constructed.\nThis is where policy can make\na difference. So the conclusion of the All Party Passivhaus Group 4 years ago\nwas to recommend to the Kirkees Labour Cabinet that we specify the Passivhaus\nStandard or equivalent in all public funded projects or as a condition of sale\non the sale of council land for development.\nSadly the Kirklees Cabinet\nhas ignored the report and sadly when challenged uses evidence on costs derived\nfrom one off demonstration projects which by their nature can cost an\nadditional 30% or more.\nSo my proposal as West\nYorkshire Mayor is to establish a Green Building Fund to cover up to 5% on top\nof the usual capital cost of the development to ensure that all public sector\nprojects are constructed to the Passivhaus standard or an equivalent standard\nthat achieves the same outcomes. The fund would stay at 5% for the first 5\nyears and then the percentage would decrease gradually as skills and\nfamiliarity with the standard help construction costs come down. This would not\nonly cut emissions but put thousands of pounds back in the pockets of\nhouseholders in saved energy bills, with money generally going back into the\nlocal economy.\nWon’t the Government’s future\nhomes standard do the same job in reducing energy costs and carbon emissions?\nWell probably not . Research has shown that there is a substantial performance\ngap on supposedly green homes where they use far more energy than predicted.\nThe quality assured approach to Passivhaus Construction ensures it does pretty\nmuch what it says on the tin and energy demand remains very low with 70-90%\nreductions in fuel bills typically being reported.\nWe also want to tackle the\nneed to retrofit existing properties to reduce their emissions with some\nsubstantial demonstration programmes that will aim to influence the significant\ninvestment needed from national Government, who have so far avoided a long term\nstrategy to tackle the emissions of existing buildings. This is where the Mayor\ncan make a real difference by being a pathfinder and policy innovator leading\nthe way forward for national governments.\nThe education and skills\nresponsibility of the Mayor should be harnessed to ensure we have the\narchitects, suppliers and builders to deliver the Green Building Fund, renovation\nof existing houses and to ensure that we have the skills to address challenges\nwe know are coming such as the move from gas boilers to air sourced heat pumps\nwhich is a significant challenge in itself.\nI’m also a strong supporter\nof social rented housing, but they have been poorly served by successive\ngovernments of all political hues, with an ever diminishing council housing\nstock due to the wrong headed, right to buy policy. Social housing is a social\ngood, an alternative to ownership, more secure than private rental and ensures\nthere is an alternative to both. We need a strong and growing social housing\nsector to create not just the poverty housing of last resort but a viable\noption for people who can’t get on the housing ladder. With enough support and\nrising numbers of council housing it would be an essential check on rising house\nprices. The power I would seek from Government is the right for Councils in\nWest Yorkshire to suspend the right to buy to ensure the business plans for\ninvestment in new Council housing stacked up and there would no longer by a\nhole in the financial case for investment.\nThe role of West Yorkshire\nMayor should not just be a souped up Council Leader or a MP with a bigger constituency.\nIt has to be something different, It has got to be about generating real change,\nproviding direction for the region and providing the policies that we need to deliver\na sustainable future.\nI went to Salendine Nook High School with you. I don't agree with your politics but you have done well for yourself.\nReplyDeleteThanks, I am fine with people disagreeing with me but I try hard to back up the points I make so I'm not just 'mouthing off' you tend to see a lot of that from politicians across many parties.

  "https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_/https_clrandrewcooper_blogspot_com_2018/content_107.html": "A blog by Green Party Councillor Andrew Cooper about Green Politics, action on Climate Change, Kirklees Council and our activity to improve the local and global environment (and also anything that I fancy talking about)\nPromoted and published by A Cooper, 76 Brockholes Lane, Holmfirth HD9 7EB\n2019 New Year's Day Bus - Andrew Cooper, Sue Lee-Richards & Karen Allison\nOur New Year's Bus Service is now in its 26th year. It feels bizarre that we've been doing this each year for nearly half my life. The concept was from David Taylor a Green Party member and public transport enthusiast who lived in Linthwaite at the time. I remember his knowledge of bus timetables was phenomenal. I dimly recall an evening in The Sair Inn in the nineties where David and our first Newsome Green Councillor Nick Harvey were in conversation discussing the best way of getting by bus between 2 points with changes, times etc. Both were experts and however tedious a subject might be its always a pleasure to see people who really know what they are on about in animated discussion.\nSo here we are. Today I, Cllr Karen Allison and our 2019 candidate, Sue Lee-Richards got our timetables on the bus stops and in local shops. The timetables have also been distributed to 7500 homes in the Newsome Ward in our 8 page Annual Report newsletter.\nI've never regretted doing it, even on the occasions when it rained all day and we had hardly any passengers, and even when someone who could have given more consideration to their personal hygiene decides they are going travel with us. It's a service and part of the rhythm of my year. With so much uncertainty in my life there's a comfort in knowing exactly what I'm doing at least one day out of 365 in a year. So here we go again. I know the route and though I couldn't do it blindfold perhaps in a few years time maybe the service may be provided by an autonomous, driver less and electric vehicle. When it does I may just come along for the ride.\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper at the COP24 Climate Talks\nGreen Party Energy Spokesperson Councillor Andrew Cooper was\npart of the EU Committee of the Regions Delegation attending the COP24 Climate\nNegotiations in Katovice Poland last week. He is a Councillor in Kirklees in West Yorkshire.\nThe COP24 Climate Talks took the important step of deciding\nhow the Paris Climate goals of limiting Global Temperature increases to 1.5\ndegrees centigrade were to be achieved. The talks established the ‘Rulebook’\nfor achieving tough carbon reduction\ntargets. Many have rightly been concerned at the lack of ambition in the final agreement and in particular the lack of recognition by the United Sates, Russian and Saudi Arabia who seem to put oil interests ahead of a safe climate for the people of the world.\nCouncillor Cooper said, “My mission at COP24 was to get more\naction at the local and regional level and push the United Nations to acknowledge\nthe need for National Governments to do much more to reduce carbon emissions.\nWhat we knew before the climate talks was that National Governments had not\nagreed enough carbon savings to limit a global temperature rise below 1.5\ndegrees to ensure we had a reasonably stable climate to pass on to future\ngenerations.”\n“Countries Carbon Emission targets are described under UN\nrules as Nationally Determined Contributions. I had proposed, and got EU\nbacking, to call for a new category of Locally and Regionally Determined\nContributions to encourage local and regional governments, below the State\nlevel, to take more action to reduce their carbon emissions. There was real\nprogress towards this goal in the final statement signed up to by World Leaders\nin Katovice.”\nThere is now a statement in the final text on how to assess Nationally Determined Contributions that\nrefers to preparing implementation plans to include “domestic institutional\narrangements, public participation and engagement with local communities”. This\nstatement gives a much greater role to Local Councils and Regional bodies in\nthe UK and around the world.\nCouncillor Cooper said, “ I’m very pleased that we managed\nto get such a strong statement out of the COP24 Climate Talks from over 200 governments\nfrom around the world. In a UK Context we need to be asking what our Government\nwill be doing now to work in partnership with Local Government and devolved administrations\nto help reduce carbon emissions. A growing number of Councils have now\ndeclaring a Climate Emergency following the IPCC Report that showed we have\nless than 12 years to reduce emissions to a level compatible with a stable\nclimate. Now is the time to back up those declarations with solid actions.”\nThe headline for the outside world with COP24 is the refusal by the USA, Russia and Saudi Arabia to\nCOP24 - Katovice - Poland\ndo anything other than 'note ' the IPCC report saying we only have 12 years left to get our house in order to keep the average global temperature rise to a survivable 1.5 degrees. I say 'the outside world' because a lot of the time you are inside. COP24 very much has the feel of an International Space Station (with gravity!). You don't see much of the outside world. You could be anywhere, in any part of the world. You're also very conscious that people from every part of the world are there as well. The experience for most attendees is probably equivalent to a Festival of Climate Action. In the various meeting rooms, every possible aspect of climate change, climate mitigation and climate adaptation is\nMiguel Canete - EU Climate Change Commissioner\ndiscussed in depth. Now and again there will be a star turn. Top of the bill yesterday was former US Vice President Al Gore giving a bravura presentation on the 'State of the Climate' with ongoing criticism of the shortsightedness of governments and businesses.\nMy mission at COP24 was very clear to me. To focus on the issue I had conceived and promoted for the last 2 years, 'Regionally and Locally Determined Contributions' - RLDC's. It's hard to make a subject with this title sound engaging. What exactly does it mean? The short explanation is that just as we have carbon emission savings identified for nations, Nationally Determined Contributions - NDCs, we also should have savings identified for Councils and other political bodies at the Local and Regional level - RLDCs. To engage the power of the local could\nWith CoR Vice President Markula at the EU Commission Briefing\nhelp bridge the gap between the emissions we need to save and those identified in the NDCs. So if it works the difference between achieving and failing to achieve the COP21 Paris Climate Goals.\nSo I've been away from home for 10 days and frankly want to get back. At COP24 I've made a number presentations and press interviews as well as participating in briefings on progress of the talks. The key one for me was with EU Climate Change Commissioner Miguel Canete where I asked for strong support for RLDCs but also the ongoing involvement of Local and Regional Authorities in developing policies and strategies to address climate change. It's not going to be as easy an ask as you might think. COP stands for 'Conference of the Parties' and the Parties are Governments. Giving LRA's their own contributions is regarded by some as ignoring the agreed structure of global action on climate change.\nPresenting on RLDCs in the EU Pavillion\nSo even if it makes perfect sense to seek to resolve climate change in this way it may be politically difficult to deliver.\nWhat we do know is that there has been a growing pressure for action at the local and regional level to have greater recognition fro LRAs. Todays's statement from 'Non State Actors' through the Talanoa Dialogue Call for Action has piled on the pressure for greater emphasis on action by LRAs on mitigation and adaptation. Here's just some of the positive statements they made yesterday that were endorsed by the Presidents of COP23 and COP24 that indicate a greater role for LRAs\n\"Actors in all countries,\nincluding Parties and non-Party stakeholders at the national, regional and\nAl Gore doing his impressive 'State of the Climate' talk\ncommunity levels are already\ntaking action. Pre-2020 action is vital for putting the world on a path towards achieving the long-term\ngoals of the Paris Agreement. But it is not only governments that must act. Non-Party stakeholders can\nand should join in pre-2020 action and complement action by states. \"\n\"Multilateralism and cooperation will enable us to address problems together, find solutions, and\nbuild consensus for the common good. Only a global coalition of actors – including Parties,\nnational and sub-national governments, private sector companies, the investment community,\ncivil society and all non-Party stakeholders – can take us there.\" \"Together, Parties, working\nwith non-Party stakeholders including sub-national governments, should pursue efforts to strengthen\nmitigation and adaptation commensurate with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. They must work\ntogether in the planning and pursuit of low emissions and climate-resilient development.\" \"We call upon civil society leaders to marshal the public and political will needed to drive action.\nWe call upon them to engage political leadership, influence and challenge norms, enhance awareness,\nand mobilize action at the regional, state and local levels.\"\nAndrew and the Andalucians (not a new band)\nA really positive meeting for me yesterday was when I met 2 representatives from the Andalucian Government, Jose Fiscal Lopez, Minister of Environment and Territory and Jose Hernandez teh Depity Regional Minister. In Andalucia they had established a Climate Law that meant carbo savings carried out at the local level fed directly into the Spanish Governments Nationally Determined Contributions. They have effectively created an RLDC and are happy for the EU Committee of the Regions to use them as an example of best practice for others to follow.\nSo where are we with only a day to go before COP24 is supposed to end? Well nothing is guaranteed. I'm hoping all the positive work we have done from the EU Committee of the Regions team pays off and we a greater role for LRAs in action to address the threat of global change. Lets see what happens.\nI've been busy over the last 2 days speaking at a number at events at COP24 on Regionally and Locally Determined Contributions on behalf of the EU Committee of the Regions. I'm here till late next Thursday and intend to make the most of every opportunity to get the message across.\nStaff at the EU Committee of the Regions (CoR) have really done an amazing job in securing the support of the LGMA, the global body representing Local Government and the European Parliament. There has also been some great work done by the CoR on social media and production of promotional materials on LDCs for COP24. I really feel we have a top notch team here and we a deserve a win. We also have the support of some committed NGOs like Climate Alliance and ICLEI who have strong networks and knowledge we can link in with,\nSo where does hope lie from Locally Determined Contributions at COP24? The strongest statement I have seen so far that indicates the need for Locally Determined Contributions come from the latest UNFCCC Gap Report that analyses the gap between the Nationally Determined Contributions and the savings we need to make to acheive the Paris Climate goals. It states\n\"Non-state and subnational action play an important role\nin delivering on national pledges. Non-state and subnational action could\npotentially allow countries to raise their ambition. However, current impacts\nare extremely limited and poorly documented.\nAction by non-state and subnational actors (NSAs),\nincluding regional and local governments and businesses, is key to realizing\ngreenhouse gas emissions. However, the impact of current individual NSA pledges\non reducing the emissions gap is extremely limited\nIf international cooperative initiatives succeed in\nincreasing their membership and ambition, much greater potential can be\nrealized\nTo enhance the credibility of NSA action, monitoring and\nreporting of actions and resulting emissions reductions will be essential\"\nThis statement stops short of calling for Locally Determined Contributions but it has to be the natural conclusion from such a statement.\nA lot of work goes on in the run up to Climate Summits like COP24 and the key meetingearlier this year was in Bangkok was of the Paris Agreement Working Programme. The conclusions from this feed into COP24. A key statement there on Nationally Determined Contributions refers to\n\"Contributions from sub-national or sectoral baselines\"\nThis could indicate the possibility of a Locally or Regionally Determined Indicators approach. What is important now is to push hard for such a statement or stronger to make its way into the final text of COP24. That is my job for the next few days.\nAs I write this Blogpost the United States (President Trump), Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have all declined to 'welcome' the latest report from the IPCC showing we have only 12 years to act to stabilise the climate by getting a grip on emission reductions. Of course nobody really 'welcomes' bad news but in UN diplomacy terms this means acknowledging its legitimacy which is the starting point for taking radical action to address the problem. Disappointing doesn't cover it really. Instead they have decided to 'note' the report. 'Note' is diplomatic code for \"I saw it but I'm not going to necessarily do anything about it\". So why do these oil rich nations run by despots behave so poorly? Well the clue is in the question I guess. My hope is that when Government Representatives from these countries arrive tomorrow that they move their position swiftly to one which is compatible with the survival of civilization.\nHow should the UK respond? Well ignoring our own Government's failings for just a second perhaps we should react in the same way as we would to a Novichok attack or the murdering of a journalist in a Government building. Acts of barbarism by Governments are not all as obvious as these examples but the contempt shown for science and the billions who will suffer is truly horrific and mind bogglingly self serving.\nYou probably never really know what the most significant events in your life are till they actually happen. I'm hoping the next few weeks are going to be mine. In early December I will be in Katowice, Poland for a week as part of EU Committee of the Regions Delegation to the COP24 United Nations Climate Change talks. To get to this point has been a three year journey.\nMy first Climate Change Talks experience was COP21. In the delegates area they were negotiating the historic agreement to limit Greenhouse emissions to 2 degrees above global norms and hopefully 1.5 degrees. I was outside the delegate area in Paris speaking in a room somewhere to probably less than a dozen people. As part of my talk to the folks there I reflected on the fact that UK Local Authorities had received no communications from central Government about helping them reduce emissions to achieve the Paris Climate Goals. Sadly 3 years later this is still the case.This got me thinking, especially when it became clear that the carbon savings identified by national Governments, the 'Nationally Determined Contributions' were not going to be enough to limit emissions to the targets agreed at COP21 in Paris. So why not empower Regional and Local Authorities to play their part in achieving the Paris Climate goals? Why not encourage them to produce their own action plans to reduce emissions? So the concept of Locally Determined Contributions was born. This lead to it being referenced in 3 opinions (policy statements) of the EU Committee of the Regions and also 1 in the European Parliament.\nLast year at COP23 in Bonn an agreement to develop Locally Determined Contributions was agreed at the Global Local and Regional Leaders summit. This was not the same as the UNFCCC agreeing it but was without doubt a significant moment and gave LDCs a global stage.\nAt COP24 in Katovice, for me, it is an opportunity to make a real difference. It is the Climate Summit that agrees the Rulebook for achieving the Paris Climate Goals. How we will actually do it. I am part of the EU Delegation and so Brexit means it could be my last chance to influence global climate change agreements. So its a big deal. There are loads of positives. The European Parliament have referenced and backed Locally Determined Contributions in their position statement going into COP24. In addition the statement from 'Non State Actors' the global groups representing Local Government, Trade Unions, Agriculture and other organisations have also backed LDCs. I am receiving great support from talented and committed staff at the EU Committee of the Regions and from global bodies such as Climate Alliance and ICLEI. All things seem possible at the moment. My diary is filling up for the week and I feel hopeful.\nThe ambition/hope is that Locally Determined Contributions fill the gap in emissions savings that we need to make to prevent runaway climate change. That 'Think Global Act Local' becomes a tangible reality fostering an enthusiastic international movement focused on creating not just a stable environment but a sustainable better world.\nSo wish me well. I have a sense of mission and an understanding that this could be a key moment. Like the emissions contributions I mean to achieve I remain determined. My clock is ticking and I have to make the most of every moment in the next few weeks. Here we go!\nSo after 9 years and 592 blogposts my blog is no longer 'Greening Kirklees' but now is the imaginatively titled 'Councillor Andrew Cooper'. This reflects the fact that though there is still a lot of comment I make on local issues and issues pertaining to Kirklees Council I am also writing about national issues such as energy efficiency and renewables in my role as Green Party Energy Spokesperson. With my involvement in COP talks I'm also blogging a lot about policies to address global climate change.\nI also have the 'rider in my Blog description that says \" and anything else I fancy talking about\". In the past this has included subjects as diverse as wearing braces, the Sex Pistols and Thunderbirds. Subjects which don't even a tenuous or contrived relationship with 'Greening Kirklees' so my Blog is now the title bestowed on me by the electorate of Newsome and my name.\nSo here I am from near the beginning of my blogging life, 8 years ago, talking about 'Greening Kirklees' and the joys of Twitter and Facebook.\nSue Lee-Richards & Cllr Andrew Cooper at Castle Hill\nFollowing fires that set alight large sections of gorse at\nCastle Hill on November 4th Green Campaigners Sue Lee-Richards and Cllr Andrew\nCooper called on Kirklees to enforce the Public Space Protection Order at\nCastle Hill that banned fireworks, fires, barbecues and flying lanterns. A fine of £75 can be issued to anyone breaking the ban.\nSue said, “What is the point of placing a rule forbidding\nsomething and then not following through and enforcing it?”\nCouncillor Andrew Cooper agreed, “It took Labour nearly 2\nyears following a successful Green Party motion at Kirklees Council to\nimplement the ban. The lack of any enforcement at all at Castle Hill does not\ngive the public confidence. People love Castle Hill but the authorities need to\nprotect it.”\nAndrew and Sue helped local volunteers clear up used\nfireworks from around Castle Hill after Bonfire Night on the 6th of November\nJust\nto update you on my work on Locally Determined Contributions to address\ncarbon emissions as part of my role at the EU Committee of the Regions\nand as part of their Negotiating Team for COP24 in Katovice in December. This could play a vital role in finding some of the additonal emissions reductions we need to make to ensure we keep global temperatures below 1.5 degrees C and maintain a reasonably stable climate.\nThere have been 2 exciting developments.\nThe first was a meeting last week of the ‘Non Party\nStakeholders’ constituency in Krakow in advance of Katovice COP24 Climate Summit in\nDecember where they produced a statement about what they want out of the COP\ntalks. Non Party Stakeholders covers global organisations representing farmers,\nwomen and gender NGOs, environmental NGOs, cities and regions, workers and\ntheir unions, as well as children and youth. The ‘Parties’ are national Governments. They have produced a joint statement\nwithin which it states\nThe\nLocal Governments and Municipal Authorities (LGMA) constituency underscores the\nneed\nfor collaboration among all levels of government and the importance of\npositioning\nintegrated,\nsustainable urban and territorial development as an important tool to accelerate\nthe\nimplementation of NDCs. We look forward to having our engagement strengthened\nthrough\nthe Paris Agreement Work Programme. In 2018, cities and regions invited national\ngovernments\nto fix and list NDCs under the Cities and Regions Talanoa Dialogues Initiative,\nalso\nthrough the formal recognition of the Locally Determined Contribution.\nThe\nLGMA is the global body representing Local Government interests. The concept of\nLocally Determined Contribution (LDCs)s to address carbon emissions is something I’ve\ndeveloped at the EU Committee of the Regions where it is now firmly adopted via\nan opinion on Climate Governance for which I was the Rapporteur. So I’ll\nbe using this to push for LDCs to be included in the UNFCCC Declaration coming\nout of COP24 to provide a defined role for Local and Regional Government\ninternationally to address the gap in the carbon savings we need to make to\nachieve a minimum of 1.5 degrees rise in global temperatures.\nThe second piece of good news is from the European Parliament where in their resolution in advance of COP24 they make the following statement last week.\nCalls on the Commission to further\nintensify its relations with local and regional authorities, to enhance\nthematic and sectoral cooperation between cities and regions both within and\noutside the EU, to develop adaptation and resilience initiatives, and to\nstrengthen sustainable development models and emission reduction plans in key\nsectors such as energy, industry, technology, agriculture and transport in both\nurban and rural areas, e.g. through twinning programmes, through the\nInternational Urban Cooperation programme, through support for platforms such\nas the Covenant of Mayors and by building new fora for exchanging best\npractice; calls on the EU and the Member States to support efforts by\nregional and local actors to introduce regionally and locally determined\ncontributions (similar to NDCs) where climate ambition can be increased through\nthis process;\nAll exciting stuff, there’s clearly a growing\nmomentum for LDCs for COP24\nFor a\nprimer on what LDCs is all about here is a link to the subject on my blog click here\nThere’s\nlots more on my blog on LDCs just click on the tabs section on the right of my page on 'Locally Determined Contributions' of course!\nHere's the COP24 Conference site in Katovice where I'll be seeking to get LDCs adopted by the UNFCCC in December.\nA 50p that celebrates the liberation of Europe from fascism\nI'm not a royalist and not a big fan of all the commemorative tat that gets produced for a royal wedding but I recognise that it is part of the heritage of the country we live in and I ignore it for the most part. We mark the end of wars and we will soon mark a 100 years since the end of World War 1. I believe in many ways that war was a pointless war as do many historians but still I see that it was an event that brought the country together in common cause and that many people gave their lives at the behest of our Government. Their sacrifice needs to be marked and remembrance is important to help us learn from the past. So we come to today's announcement that we are to have a commemorative 50 pence piece to mark 'effing' Brexit as if this was some sort of national victory or cause for celebration. I don't care if it says \"Peace, Prosperity and Friendship With All Nations\" its about Brexit and arguably a detriment to all of those things. Of course if you're a rampant Brexiteer it might be something that you might want to celebrate but nearly half the country (and maybe more now) definitely aren't. There are deep divisions in our country rumbling on with Brexit. Racists now feel they have license to spout their nonsense more freely now they have 'got their country back'. In an already divided society people can now differentiate themselves further by identifying themselves as a Remainer or a Leaver. So the Government then goes and rubs the noses of half the country in it 'the losers' by minting a sodding coin. I felt pretty much the same way when the Government said there would be a national holiday on 'Brexit Day' so one half of the country can celebrate whatever it is they feel they have to celebrate while the rest of us cry into our pints at the chaos to come. Maybe it would be most fitting to have two 50 pence pieces. After all 2 x 50p makes a good old honest British pound. One could have Union Jacks on one side and the Queen on the reverse. The other coin could have the EU Flag on and Donald Tusk on the reverse. I'm of course joking but if the Government wants to make an overt dividing political statement with the coin of the realm favouring one side of the argument why not do it for the other side as well. Here's 'Anarchy in the UK' by the Sex Pistols. Sorry if anyone's offended. Well not really. Not today.\nI was definitely lost. My headtorch lit up various parts of the woodland but I couldn't hear or see the headtorches of the others I had been with 15 minutes earlier. Then I saw the eyes gleaming back at me. The fact they were a foot off the floor and the faint silhouette made me think dog but definitely not a chihuahua. Then I saw another pair of gleaming eyes about the same height but this time with a shadowy person shaped figure. He called the dogs to him and I felt a bit more secure as he put their leads on. I thanked him continued along the woodland path and emerged from the woods at Manor Estate in my shorts, fluorescent coat with my bulging bin bag and litter picker in hand. I was somewhat relieved to know where I was and worked my way back down Kings Mill Lane to meet the others at the other entrance to the woods.\nSo what was I up to in the woods late at night? \"Well Officer it's like this.......\" Actually I wasn't doing a reinactment of 'The Blair Witch Project' or anything untoward I was in fact doing good things with Goodgym Huddersfield. The Goodgym concept is you run with a group to a place where you do a good thing for around 45 minutes such as a clean up or cutting back vegetation and then run back again. So last night it was about 2km to Longley Woods to clean up bottles and crisp packets and prune back branches and twigs on the path and avoid treading in the unfortunate dead badger, then run back again. For me a good bit of exercise to supplement my parkruns but doing some practical hands on stuff at the same time.Have you a mission for the Goodgymers in your area? Get in touch\nHere's the trailer for the Blair Witch Project which seriously freaked me out when I firsyt watched it\nToday's report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change should be a wake up call for the UK Government. It is quite clear that current action to reduce emissions is inadequate and that a 3 degree C global temperature rise or worse is on the cards with catastrophic effects for people in the UK and around the world.\nWe need a response from Government and we need it now. I am incredulous as a Local Councillor that Local Councils around the country have had no significant contact from UK Government asking for our help and assistance in achieving the Paris Climate goals. There are things we can do without direction from Government but a lot more could be achieved if there was a genuine partnership to encourage positive action on climate change quickly. Here are some key asks that Government could do tomorrow but preferably today.\nestablish a National Climate Taskforce including Ministry of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Ministry of Communities, Housing & Local Government and the Local Government Association to drive action on climate change at the local level, addressing barriers to action and making good practice examples the mainstream\nrequire Councils to produce Climate Action Plans on how they can cut emissions quickly and what actions they could take with greater support from central Government.\nget Councils to lead local Climate Action Partnerships to drive deeper action on carbon emission reductions. This would draw in support from business, the wider public sector, the voluntary sector and the wider community\ngive a clear steer to local Councils that they are expected to insist on higher energy efficiency standards in new buildings up to (and preferably) the Passivhaus Standard.\nAsk Councils to produce a plan (with a timetable) for a complete electrification of their vehicle fleets and to work with other large fleet operators on similar plans.\nRevive the Home Energy Conservation Act powers of Local Government and ask for new plans to be established within a year for costed plans to improve the energy efficiency of homes in line with the emissions savings we need to achieve the Paris Climate goals within a ten year timeframe.\nThese are all initiatives that the UK Government and BEIS in particular could start work on or set in motion today. We clearly need more action than this to acheive the Paris Climate goals but this would be a significant start and I'm requesting a meeting with the BEIS Minister of State Claire Perry and the Local Government Association to see what progress we can make together to address the Climate Emergency we are facing.\nI've just been to a conference in Barcelona in my role as a Rapporteur on Climate Change with the EU Committee of the Regions and a fascinating few days it was. People had told me I'd like Barcelona for the architecture and general vibe and I wasn't disappointed. The Sagrida Familia (not Barcelona Cathedral!) probably the most individual and striking building I've ever seen. the Hospital Sant Pau constructed at the beginning of the 20th Century and just the general feel of the place.\nSagrida Familia\nOne of the things I wanted to get out of the trip was an understanding of was views on Catalonian Independence. It's just over a year ago since Catalonia\nvoted to cede from Spain and become an independent nation within the European Union. Supporters of Independence point to the overwhelming majority in support of independence and those opposing it say that it is not valid because people opposing independence didn't vote saying the Poll was not valid under Spanish law. What is beyond dispute is that the response of the Spanish Government was heavy handed at best and brutal at worst. Spanish Police blocked and beat people trying to vote and Catalonian Politicians have been imprisoned and are effectively political prisoners. Very worrying within the EU but then we do have the Frack Free Three in the UK. I spoke to as many Catalonians about it as I could and it seems support for independence is still strong. Catalonian flags still fly from balconies. Many Catalonians and their buildings are sporting a yellow ribbon (not unlike the SNP logo) showing their support for those political prisoners.\nThere was a time when I worried about Nationalist movements being Right Wing and possibly Xenophobic. I think that was to a certain extent true but has become less so in recent times. Certainly the SNP and Plaid Cymru are generally on the progressive side of the political spectrum. The politics seems less about Nationalism as such and more about Independence and Self Determination. \"Taking control\" if you will!\nSo now what else other than Freddie Mercury singing 'Barcelona'\nToday was interesting. I reacquainted myself with the Transition Network. You remember it don't you? \"Totnes?\". Yes that's it. \"Rob Hopkins?\" Yep we're on the same page. \"Oh yes I've got a copy of the \"Transition Town Handbook...somewhere. Whatever happened to them?\" Well to be honest that was my thought and the answer seems to be that they became a global success and spawned lots of community based resilience activity all over the world being particularly successful in France, Belgium and Japan to name but a few but sadly they need to re-imagine themselves back in the UK I feel and it would be good if they could. In a nutshell the Transition Network is all about resilience. Resilience to a world less reliant on dwindling fossil fuels and where more goods and resources can be sourced sustainably locally. Where a thriving community becomes even more important and a vital part of the solution. One of the reasons for the 'Rest of the World' success of the Transition Network is the smash hit film 'Tomorrow'. \"What? You mean Tomorrow Never Dies with Pierce Brosnan as Bond?\" No 'Tomorrow' a film about the Transition Movement. It's won stackloads of film awards and scores 92% on Rotten Tomatoes. Its success is attributed to the fact that it spends the first 5 minutes on environmental doom and gloom 'get me out of this room' stuff and the rest of the movie on solutions, optimism and hope. Its been inspirational to people around the world and I'm ashamed to say that until today I'd never heard of it. I wonder if its on Netflix. The reason I know all this is because today I was one of the speakers at the European Day of Sustainable Communities event in Brussels hosted by the EU Committee of the Regions and EESC which was full of people from around Europe who have been inspired by the resilience message of the Transition Movement. Their Umbrella body is ECOLISE or 'the European network for community-led initiatives on climate change and sustainability' It was great to be among like minded people to whom the ethos of 'Think Global Act Local' is intrinsic to their very being. They think small scale and value community, incremental change and recognise that as I put it today \"That we don't just want to save the world but create a better world\". It was a very positive event and full of articulate, bright and many young people. So when we were asked for a word to sum up our thoughts of the day I chose 'hope'. I wonder what can be done to revitalise the fortunes of the Transition Network in the UK? It warrants serious thought. We have a group near us Holmfirth Transition Town which continues to do some excellent work but I get the feeling across the UK they are not as active as they were five or six years ago. Maybe one of the reasons is that they came out of 'The End of Oil' debate that seemed to place the crisis with the lack of fossil fuels as opposed to the fact that we'll burn them and ourselves to oblivion before we have to worry about them running out. This doesn't make the Transition Network any less relevant at all in fact the 'Hothouse Report' and ongoing extreme weather events mean that we must find ways of making the approach they take relevant to many more communities. My resolution from today? To watch the film 'Tomorrow' and if I like it to get many more people to watch it probably at Huddersfield Green Drinks at the Media Centre. Here's the trailer\nI've always admired the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. They are one of the largest membership organisations in the country. Over the years they will have had plenty of pressure on them to oppose planning applications for wind turbine and wind farm developments but they have taken a pretty robust line saying from the start that, \"Climate Change poses the single greatest threat to birds and other wildlife and the RSPB recognises the essential role of renewable energy in addressing this problem\" Its a bold opening statement but they do follow through and only object to about 6% of wind applications and that was when the UK Government hadn't to all intents and purposes practically outlawed onshore wind farms and turbines. They are still strong defenders of avians and are not shy to say where there are inappropriate wind developments but not as many as misinformed Mail readers and retired Colonels would like I'm more than sure. They speak of the need for wind farms to be sited away from major migration routes and breeding/roosting areas and point to examples of poor sitings of wind farms but generally not in the UK. So why this interest? Well tomorrow I'm speaking at an event in Brussels looking at the impact on biodiversity of renewable energy and how to minimise it. What I've been encouraged by through reading the literature is the desire from both perspectives to seek common ground and a real expectation that it can be found. Kent Wildlife Trust have produced some good principles by which sustainable (as opposed to just renewable energy) can be measured. These 6 principles are good ones to assess any renewable energy development. They are to :-\nCommit to ensuring overall positive outcomes for wildlife from the outset, aiming for a ‘net biodiversity gain’.\nAvoid sites that are designated for nature conservation.\nIdentify potential negative impacts on wildlife and avoid these impacts wherever possible.\nWhen all possible options have negative impacts, seek the least environmentally damaging option.\nRecognise that there may be unknown impacts on wildlife that development needs to consider and mitigate, employing the ‘precautionary principle’.\nAchieve this by consulting experts and relevant stakeholders early on ecological aspects of sites and routes.\nNow my role in this debate is to assess from a UK perspective how renewable energy developments interact and match EU Nature Legislation. To be fair the EU legislation is pretty good in this regard and has at its heart a desire to balance the needs of humanity with the natural world. The question I have is will that same balanced approach be one that we will realise with our current government? As they have made it practically impossible to install wind technology on our island I think balance is the last thing they are seeking. They don't seek to harness the wind but to simply bend in the wind to a vocal minority most likely from their own potential supporters. Far from 'taking back control' from the EU we will be passing it on to narrow perspectives with no appreciation of the real issues. A triumph for the ill informed opinions of the guy in the pub over anyone who actually knows what they're talking about.\nThe 'Hothouse Earth' Report makes grim reading and questions whether we can 'safely park' global temperature rises at 2 degrees C and indicates that we may have set in train a series of carbon releasing events that will be difficult to stop and that we may end up with global temperatures around 4 to 5 degrees C higher than the pr- industrial era. This really is a nightmare scenario with a significant rise in sea levels, highly disrupted weather threatening food supplies and much more frequent extreme and violent weather events. It is a respected summation of current peer reviewed climate science and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nA number of things have concerned me over the last few weeks. One is the cheery assertion by Conservative Government Minister Michael Gove that Climate Change and higher temperatures in the UK is a great opportunity for British Farmers to produce good quality sparkling wine. Now of course there may be some truth in this but it indicates a lack of perception of the grim reality of climate change. You could argue that what he said was taken out of context and that really he really does 'get it'. I'd like to believe that but you see the vote on the 3rd runway at Heathrow, the permission to commence Fracking at Preston New Road and the 4 new gas turbines at Drax that are on the cards and you can only conclude they don't believe and don't care about climate change. Sadly that goes for a lot of Labour politicians as well.\nMichael Gove gave the impression when he was first elected that he had hugged plenty of huskies in the fashion of David Cameron when he was in his 'vote blue go green' phase. With his positive comments on neonicitinoids and their impact on the bee population I thought well this is a little bit different from before. Now it seems that this is yet another attempt to detoxify the Tory Party using 'green issues'. Actually it is difficult to work out which needs the most detoxification Gove or the Conservative Party. So yes maybe there will be a brief mini-sparkling Wine Age before the very worst impacts of Climate Change hit us but we desperately need to be acting NOW to reduce emissions for the sake of civilization and human sentience on this planet. Even if they had the time away from their headlong pursuit of Brexit I doubt it would make them act any more responsibly.\nIn my role as a local Councillor I got a call the other week from a local resident who said they had seen hundreds of dead fish in Newsome Mill Ponds in Huddersfield. I went out to investigate and there they were lying on the surface being watched over by a heron who looked like he had already had his fill of this unexpected bounty. The theories from local people came thick and fast. Poisoning and pollution were what people initially thought but following investigations it turned out it was none of these. The long hot dry spell had de-oxygenated the water and the fish had simply suffocated. The had been killed by the weather. In the past, as a Green, who wants to be taken seriously on climate change I've been reticent to link single weather events to climate change, but this is different. The phenomenon we are experiencing is a global one. We have had huge moorland fires on Saddleworth Moor, wildfires in Greece that have killed many, even wild fires within the Arctic Circle due to the heat and record temperatures in Japan. Comparisons with the summer of 76 are not really valid as that was very much a UK experience. This is global one and we know that extreme events such as these are going to become more common as climate change begins to have a greater impact.\nTwo events happened today of note. One was a new report titled 'Planning for Climate Change - a guide for Local Authorities' by the independent Local Government Information Unit. It referenced a report by the Royal Town Planning Institute from last year stating,\n\"that a lack of integration of climate change into local plans was\npartly a result of a skills shortage related to budget cuts, and partly due to\nchanges in national government policy that appear to de-prioritise climate\nchange action.\"\nSadly this comes as no surprise. The actions of our Government appear to be those of Climate Change deniers not that of an enthusiastic signatory to the Paris Climate Agreement. The evidence is there for all to see not least of which being a huge drop in renewable energy and energy efficiency installations. The other event today was the Government decision to allow Fracking at Preston New Road in Lancashire against the wishes of the Lancashire County Council. Nationally the Government is pushing through permitted development rights for fracking exploration drilling overriding any local democratic objections. There is a sad lack of politicians in Westminster who 'get it' who understand that promoting these policies threatens us all.\nPromoting action on climate change is so positive in terms of skilled jobs, putting money back into local economies, increasing energy security not to mention actually ensuring our survival and that of many other species that it beggars belief that any Government can turn its back on it. The disconnect between the impact of climate change on our weather and the decisions Governments and some opposition MPs make is truly worrying. These MPs must be made accountable and challenged for the stances they take. It has to be us and it has to be now. It is that urgent.\nSo here it is and thanks to Susan Jones for putting it together. It was a lovely sunny day in the Lickley Hills looking over Birmingham. Filming had its challenges. Drones buzzing and hovering nearby, a dog owner shouting for his mutt.Yours truly may have had one or two takes and the outtakes would probably be quite amusing if they ever see the light of day.\nFeedback so far has been great so a good start. A few weeks to go now in the campaigning period and like in our Local |Elections it is a case of keeping your cool, focusing on your own messages and not get distracted by things that niggle or annoy you.\nI'm no stranger to international train travel in my role as a member of the EU Committee of the Regions. Usually its Brockholes to Brussels for Committee and Plenary meetings. I've also travelled to the South of France by train a couple of times and to Bonn in Germany for the United Nations COP23 Climate Summit. This particular meeting was looking at different approaches to tackling plastics recycling and local community energy schemes among other things so particularly interesting and a lot to learn there from others.\nLeeds\nWherever I can the train is my default position not just for environmental reasons but also as it is much easier to work on the move on trains. I used to get seduced by the speed and technology of planes but the inconvenience and unpredictability of air travel has been a significant reason for me to fall out of love with jet travel as well of course the significant climate change impacts.\nEurostar in 'That London'\nTravelling to Budapest by train has been my furthest adventure so far. From Brockholes 'International' to Budapest is around 1300 miles. I used the very helpful website 'The Man in Seat 61' to plan my journey. Setting off from Brockholes at 6.38am to Huddersfield on\nParis\nthe most elderly train on my trip courtesy of Northern Rail. From there Huddersfield to Leeds, 10 minutes late but I factored in some UK slippage. Leeds to London on the newly nationalised LNER which I reckon must stand for 'Lovely Nationalised Electric Railway'. Across the road\nMunich\nfrom my Kings Cross to St Pancras station and the Eurostar then onto the train to Paris Gare du Nord station. A 10 minute walk by a tree lined Boulevard to Gare Du L'Est Station then onto the ICE train to Munich arriving around 9.30pm. I thenhad an hour or so at Munich station which was well provisioned with food outlets for my evening meal. At 11pm it was the Sleeper service to Budapest and a couchettee where hopefully my snoring wasn't too disruptive for other passengers.\nBudapest\nThe point for me was that I had the time to get to my meeting this way on this occasion and doing the green thing was also an enjoyable experience and prefereable to the tedious processing and frequent delays you can experience at airports. Of course this is my view as an individual traveller but it is Government's job to make the positive experiences of international rail travel easier for more people. Instead it chose to back a climate wrecking 3rd runway at Heathrow and with the support of a majority of Labour MPs and very sadly the abstentions of SNP MPs. As Greens we need to promote and highlight alternatives as much as we can but not from a 'holier than thou approach' but by showing what can be done, showing how it could be made easier for more people and showing what barriers we need to overcome to make making the right choices easier and cheaper for more people. Here's 'Pop Music' by M from 1979 which is only relevant because it mentions London, Paris and Munich but also New York but I didn't go there!\nIn Brussels today I saw a 10 foot tall slab of multi coloured concrete erected in a Park between the European Parliament and the Committee of the Regions. There is a small plaque nearby explaining that it is cut from the Berlin Wall and was sent to Brussels in 2014 to commemorate the wall's demise following the end of the Cold War.\nAs I stood there and looked it up and down I pondered its significance. My immediate thought was how reminiscent it was of the black slab in the film '2001 - A Space Odyssey' That rectangular slab (or Monolith) was created by a benevolent alien intelligence that had been subtly but significantly influencing the progress of humanity towards the advanced technological species that we are today.\nThis slab however was not created by anything benevolent at all. It was part of a wall designed to divide people, to provide a physical barrier between 2 different political ideologies. The significance of this particular part of the walls relocation to Brussels was to show by its very presence that the wall did not exist any more in its previous location. Its purpose had been lost, that people divided were now united. So why relocate it to Brussels? As Europe's Capital, Brussels represents the blurring of national boundaries and a recognition that people beyond nation states can have common purpose, that walls and boundaries had less relevance than they once had.\nOf course that positive vision has taken a bit of a battering in recent years. We have seen the subject of walls and barriers between nations rise as people seek to move from areas of war and poverty to countries where they see the opportunity for safety, opportunity and a living. Their actions are completely understandable. Politics has failed them, often in the most dramatic of fashions, and they are on the move. The reactions from the countries that they are moving towards has been mixed. Some have acted with humanity showing the best of what we can be. They have welcomed people often from cultures different to their own and have understood that many have skills, abilities and knowledge that can add to their own and give some positive benefits to society. Then there are those who have been less welcoming. Donald Trump's recent actions on the Mexican border have shown him to be a 'borderline Fascist' in more than one sense and I am not one of those politicians who call someone a 'Fascist' at the drop of the hat. He has truly 'earned' that title. In Hungary the barbaric move to make helping migrants illegal has also shown that some Governments are quite prepared to make common humanity a crime. Being a Good Samaritan has become a risky business in Hungary.\nSo what are we to make of the multicoloured slab in a Park in Brussels? First of all it is important to note that it remains. It may be silent, it may be inert, its purpose may not be immediately apparent but whatever turmoils happen in the political world it will stay there in the park. As walls rise it will remain as a reminder of a more hopeful time when barriers between people were removed. The influence it has will not be of a super advanced technological basis such as the black slab in 2001 but more of a more subtle nature. It will make people ask questions, it will demonstrate that there was widespread hope for the future once and that common humanity and a sense of a bond across national boundaries was a view held by many millions. Any piece of concrete that can make people ask questions is a one important piece of concrete.\nFor those of you who are desperate to understand what '2001 - A Space Odyssey' is all about but can't be bothered to read the original Arthur C Clark's short story 'The Sentinel' here is an explanation of what went on in in the film. Some folks found it a bit cryptic understandably",

It would have been more\ndifficult for the Coalition Govt to introduce these changes if a previous\ngovernment hadn’t opened the door to privatisation. By changing the NHS from a\nservices provider to a commissioner of services it gave a far greater role to\nthe private sector in the NHS. Hospital Trusts increasingly contracted out\nservices to the private sector. Public money supported the extortionately expensive\nPrivate Finance Initiative used to build hospitals with no reasonable\nalternative funding source provided by govt. Unfortunately there are many other\nexamples of the creeping privatisation of the NHS allowed under a previous\ngovt.\nThe Coalition’s view of the Health service is very narrow\nand infact NHS to them stands for a Narrow Health Service. One where the Health\nService delivered by the public sector narrows and one where the private,\nprofiteering sector just keeps on growing.\nThe Green Party is 100% behind a publicly funded,\npublicly managed and publicly delivered National Health Service focused on\nprevention of illness, the promotion of good health and the treatment of those\nin need whatever their income or background. Such a National Health Service is\nthe hallmark of a civilised society. One which invests taxation to the benefit\nof the public not one which uses peoples taxes to pay the profits of\nshareholders .\nWe know that when the private sector gets involved in the\ndelivery of public services that there will always be a tension between the\nneed to deliver good quality care and the need to provide a dividend to\nshareholders. Something will have to give be that staff wages, specialist\nequipment or even lifesaving drugs. Will we be faced with a situation where\nincreasingly the cost of delivering vital health services will be the deciding\nfactor to an even greater degree than it is at the moment.\nWe now need to broaden the Coalitions narrow vision of the\nNHS to one which inspires and fits with the expectations and values of our\nnation\nThe National Health Service is a whole and holistic\nservice not one where the public sector picks up only the parts which the\nprivate sector finds too difficult, problematic or simply unprofitable\nThe National Health Service is a public service not one\nfor private profit\nThe only ‘shareholders’ who should benefit from the\nNational Health Service should be the public who fund it.\nThe initials ‘CCG’ should not stand for Clinical\nCommissioning Groups.

Another is that they should not be nailed into trees or telegraph poles. All these rules were ignored by the Conservatives in the Kirkburton Campaign. Another irritating thing was that we were given permission to put up our boards on land around Farnley Tyas by the landowner and so were the Conservatives. One morning our boards had disappeared and were replaced with Conservatives ones. Now I'm not implying anything, well maybe I am.\nThere are benefits to getting your posterboards up first but the downside is that the opposition can come by afterwards and turn your boards sideways while they're putting there's above yours. We've always prided ourselves on getting ours down early and usually Derek Hardcastle is getting them down in Kirkburton the next morning. One year we were a bit slow at getting them down and found some of ours pushed higher up the lamp posts presumably by the oppostion while taking there's down. Nice!\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment",

I'd never been to the Town Hall before but I did remember that my Grandad told me that his brother, Friend Cooper, had been a Councillor in Rotherham. I thought I'd have a nose round and see if his name was on anything around the place. So I was chuffed to discover this photo of him on the wall showing him in his Mayoral robes in 1976. He was of course an 'Old Labour' Councillor. A couple of people I spoke to knew him including Cllr Roger Stone who was hosting the event. I unfortunately never met him. He had a gift name for his election leaflet 'Vote Friend'.\nI've never really considered my family to be very political really apart from my brother Richard (the Tory Cllr in Harrogate), my Grandad on my mum's side who was an Independent Cllr (Tory really) and now Cllr Friend Cooper. This 'non political' family argument of mine doesn't seem to be going too well!\nSo I guess you as a green councillor are labour in disguise - trying to fool the middle classes of Kirkburton that you are anything but.\nReplyDeleteHello Anonymous. Not a fan then. Ah well! The usual comment from Tories is Greens are watermelons - Green on the outside, red on the inside (yawn).

My brief was well, 'brief'. I was told that I would be talking about transport policy. There was to be Lord Lucas (not Lucan mores the pity) down the line from London who would talk about the fact that Councils are wanting to charge more for parking tickets and about the possibility that in addition to the cuts that Councils could be asked to repay millions in parking fines due to poorly painted yellow lines and incorrect signage. This is just what we need more money taken off councils when we're being asked to make huge swingeing cuts. I was to come in after the Lord when they widened it out to a more general discussion about transport. In reality there was very little time for that and I just made the link between this policy and the lack of revenue Councils had for jobs and services following government cuts. As I wandered home towards the station after the interview I realised the line I wanted to say,\n\"Don't you realise that Councils have to raise these fines and cut jobs and services for local people. I mean otherwise how are the banks going to be able to afford to pay some of their staff huge bonuses if we were to tax them instead.\"\nA blog by Green Party Councillor Andrew Cooper about Green Politics, action on Climate Change, Kirklees Council and our activity to improve the local and global environment (and also anything that I fancy talking about) Promoted and published by A Cooper, 76 Brockholes Lane, Holmfirth HD9 7EB\nMonday, 29 November 2010\nSaturday, 27 November 2010\nSupermarket Sweep?\n| Dale Winton of Supermarket Sweep fame. |\nWe need to understand how 'the Golden Rule' will work, which says that any savings made will greater than the cost for paying back the measures. With so many different house types, with different usage patterns, different heating requirements this is going to be a tall order and if the golden rule isn't convincing for all householders whatever their circumstances then confidence in the Green Deal will be severely shaken. The other good news is that Private Landlords could be fined if they don't improve the energy efficiency of their dwellings, with Local Councils being able to penalise them up to £5000 for non compliance.\nThis is all good stuff and credit where its due. I don't however believe that Greg's yet given up on his supermarkets as a major deliverer. Lets hope its not a clean (supermarket) sweep when it comes to who actually does the Green Deal and Local Authorities that demonstrate the capability to deliver also get the opportunity.\nSaturday, 20 November 2010\nFeed In Frenzy?\n| A solar farm under construction |\nThe Feed In Tariff for renewable electricity is working and working well. So well, that the Con Dems are already contemplating cutting back on it. When the scheme comes up for review in 2012 they are planning on ‘reducing projected costs by £40 million by 2014-15’. You have to wonder why though. Government does not pay for the Feed In Tariff through taxation, we all do through our energy bills so why is government so concerned? They would have been right to be concerned about ensuring that lower income customers benefit from the FIT through solar installations on their properties but fairrness doesn’t seem to be a priority for this government.\nThough 2014-15 sounds a long way off DECC Minister Greg Barker has said that,\n“in the event of deployment running ahead of published projections would we bring forward that review. But, to reassure the industry further, we will announce the trigger for such an early review shortly”.\nSo there we have it if the policy is working too well the FIT will be cut and soon we will know the limit of the government’s ambition for FIT funded renewables.\nAnother aspect for concern is the Government’s desire to limit large scale ‘solar PV farms’. This statement by Greg Barker in the House of Commons last week sent shivers through the solar industry,\n“we inherited a system that simply failed to anticipate industrial-scale, stand-alone, greenfield solar, and, although we will not act retrospectively, large field-based developments should not be allowed to distort the available funding for roof-based PV, other PV and other types of renewables.”\nThis is clearly nonsense. The Conservatives supported the Feed In Tariff in opposition and were fully aware of the 5MW limit on installations. What is described by Greg Barker as ‘greenfield’ developments could equally be large installations on derelict, brownfield land with little agricultural or amenity value. Far from distorting the market for microgeneration these large PV developments could help drive down the costs of renewables for householders by growing the solar industry and creating large economies of scale.\nThe Government, and particularly the Lib Dems, have made great play of the fact that they will now allow Councils to keep the revenue they make from renewables through the FIT. A prime example is Cornwall Council which is soon to install a 5MW array and this will be a real money spinner for the Council at a difficult time. One of the greatest opportunities for Councils to make back some of the money taken from jobs and vital services in the cuts could be from large scale PV arrays on land that otherwise would have no value to them or to the communities they serve. It now appears that the Government are effectively removing that solar silver lining from their cloud of cuts.\nFriday, 12 November 2010\nNewsome South Methodist Church - Sponsor a Solar Panel!\nNewsome South Methodist Church are planning to put solar panels on the roof of their church to generate electricity for the building and help save money and the environment at the same time. The panels will be available for everyone to look and will have a display meter in the lobby area showing people how much electricity is being generated at that moment in time and how much has been generated over the life of the panels. There will be an information board below the meter telling people how the panels work and where they can get more information for getting panels for their own home business or community building. Next to the information board we will have a sponsorship board where we will display the names of individuals and companies who have contributed array. The sponsorship board will take the form of a mock up graphical solar panel with sponsors names and details going in each individual cell that makes up a panel.\nIndividual sponsorship will be £50 each. If a number of people wish to club together to sponsor a cell\nCompany Sponsorship\nAt this stage we are looking for pledges from individuals and companies. So if you are interested in sponsorship please contact Councillor Andrew Cooper with your name and contact details at andrew.cooper@kirklees.gov.uk and whether you are an individual or company sponsor and we will contact you in the New Year when we expect the project to commence. If you have any queries regarding this please get in touch.\nA £5000 sponsorship target\nTo put the panels on the church roof will cost around £15,000. We believe we can raise around £10’000 from grants and other fundraising so we are aiming to raise around £5000 from sponsorship. If 100 individuals pledge a minimum of £50 we reach our target. If companies also provide sponsorship this will make the target easier to achieve.\nIndividual Sponsorship\n(up to a maximum of 5 at £10 each) they are very welcome to do so.\nIf you want to organise a fundraising event to help riase your £50 please let us know and we'll help you promote it\nCompany sponsorship will be £100 each. As well as your company name you may put your contact details and a brief sentence explaining what your company does.\nWhat do I do next?\nAt this stage we are looking for pledges from individuals and companies. So if you are interested in sponsorship please contact Councillor Andrew Cooper with your name and contact details at andrew.cooper@kirklees.gov.uk and whether you are an individual or company sponsor and we will contact you in the New Year when we expect the project to commence. If you have any queries regarding this please get in touch.\nMonday, 8 November 2010\n2010 - The Year We Made Energy\nIt's been a landmark day in our household. Our 'Dunsley Yorkshire' Wood Boiler was fitted today. It will provide heating and hot water and is an approved appliance for smoke control areas. The added bonus is that it is made in Holmfirth a couple of miles away. It is connected to our thermal store as is our gas boiler and solar thermal system. It also has a hot plate on the top so we can cook on it if the mood takes us. So though we have a stone built edwardian house it's carbon emissions should be pretty low. Our solar thermal and solar PV systems were installed in March and we signed up to Good Energy for our electricity and gas.\nIt's taken a while but I think we're becoming 'green'\nIt's taken a while but I think we're becoming 'green'\nSaturday, 6 November 2010\nLies and the lying liars who tell them\nPhil Woolas Labour MP (as was) has lost his seat for lying in his election literature. It was pretty unpleasant stuff that Mr Woolas put out about his Lib Dem opponent but there really is heavy irony here. Having been in politics a good number of years I've seen some dodgy leaflets from Labour in Newsome but the dodgiest I have seen from all over the place has to be the Lib Dems. The incredibly spurious graphs they produce indicating how high their support is supposedly is one example. When challenged about these tactics I usually get a sort of half embarrassed smile and the words 'well that's politics' as if that were some excuse for having no standards on the paper you stick through electors doors. There was the nonsense they put out accusing the Green Party of calling for lower insulation standards for Council tenants. Scandalous an undefensible but Lib Dem tactics through and through.\nOf course we have the Lib Dems in government who's election priorities bear little relation to those of the coalition e.g. Trident, nuclear power, tuition fees etc etc. Are we going to be able to take the whole Lib Dem Parliamentary Party to court for lying in their literature? No of course we can't because if they actually had won the election they would of course delivered on their promises - yeah right. The problem they have right now is that it is difficult to spot the Liberal morsels in the Coalition amidst the devastation that is being wrought in their name. Anyway for entertainment value here's Captain Ska with 'Liar Liar'. How come Ska comes into its own when there are Tory Governments (sorry Tory/Lib Dem Govts)?\nOf course we have the Lib Dems in government who's election priorities bear little relation to those of the coalition e.g. Trident, nuclear power, tuition fees etc etc. Are we going to be able to take the whole Lib Dem Parliamentary Party to court for lying in their literature?
