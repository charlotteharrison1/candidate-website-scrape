This has helped change Fenland from being the Forgotten Fens of the past and delivered over £100 million in recent investment.\nHis key priorities are continuing to make it easier to access NHS services locally, upgrading infrastructure, delivering better local schools and skills, providing improved sports and arts facilities, protecting our rural landscape and backing local farmers.\nFarmers will be forgiven for feeling they have no friends in Government at the moment.

This will undermine the business case for investment funding for construction of the incinerator.\nLabour are choosing to put their party interest above the country, forcing family farms to be sold off to pay inheritance tax bills which will not affordable without land sales.\nThe beneficiaries of Labour's policy will be private equity firms, and other companies who will buy the land for solar, carbon offsets and other environmental schemes.

Labour has hit them with new taxes, increased costs, and a top-down diktat to simply do more with less. And now Labour is doubling down on green plans that will take a significant amount of land out of food production.\nThis plan will mean at least the equivalent of 12,000 average UK farms forced out of business, as 9% of farmland is no longer used to grow food, and a further 5% mostly taken out of production. And the true impact could be even more significant because there are other smaller changes that could impact agriculture. Livestock and dairy farmers are likely to be hardest hit and it was telling that, when questioned, Labour’s Environment Secretary suggested people could be encouraged to reduce their consumption of meat in order to hit Labour’s targets, rather than defend this vital part of our rural economy. This is in stark contrast to the focus I had during my time in Defra, which sought to better support food production and align nature schemes to improvements that can benefit this, such as improved soil quality and abundant pollinators.\nThe Government hopes historical increases in agricultural productivity will be maintained, to help to offset the effect of reducing the amount of land farmed. A real focus on productivity would be welcome, yet Labour’s policies seem designed to do the exact opposite. In particular, the introduction of a damaging family farm tax will mean farmers are disincentivised from making productivity-boosting investments. Labour also has little to say on longer-term game-changing technologies like automation and vertical growing. They have still not brought forward the enabling legislation on gene editing, which would enable cutting-edge science on draught and disease-resistant crops. This would give our farmers a competitive edge, and it is a key Brexit benefit.\nRural areas are seeing a worrying trend with Labour. When I challenged my then-opposite number during the last election campaign on both plans to apply inheritance tax to farms and take significant amounts of land out of production, both were vigorously denied. Yet both are being quickly implemented now Labour is in government – showing we simply can’t trust any promise it makes when it comes to backing farmers or protecting food security.",

Taking into account the generous NHS pension scheme, these are estimated to cost over £2.2 million a year. 35 recent roles have been advertised on the NHS’s jobs website, including a Head of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion for NHS North East London on £91,336 a year, an Equality, Diversity & Inclusion Lead for NHS England on £81,138, and a Deputy Head of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion for Sussex Integrated Care Board on £72,293. Wider estimates suggest that the total cost of all dedicated ED&I roles in the health service is in the region of £40 million.\nAs the former Health Secretary, having previously taken action to try and cut wasteful DE&I spending when in office. I ensured that the Department for Health and Social Care had no standalone diversity roles and instructed the department’s arms-length bodies as well as local NHS organisations to cease recruitment to DE&I roles. However, this was met with a fierce backlash, with senior NHS bureaucrats bizarrely claiming that the NHS ‘will simply not survive’ without EDI staff and that a focus on EDI was a ‘key strategic function’ of the NHS. It would appear they used my move to a different cabinet role as an excuse to ignore my direction.\nThere is a renewed focus on DE&I programmes after new US president Donald Trump issued an executive order bringing such programmes to an end in the US federal government earlier this month. I’ve long tried to bring an end to dedicated DE&I roles in the health service. They don’t represent value for money for taxpayers, divert resources from frontline needs, and seem more interested in pushing highly politicised ideology than actually improving care. Bureaucrats did everything they could to frustrate my DE&I crackdown, and now under Labour, they seem free to recruit even more on eye-watering salaries, whilst at the same time experts have called the emergency care on offer to patients degrading, dehumanising, and dangerous.",

I also questioned why more use was not being made of the new £2.1 million state-of-the-art Wisbech Community Diagnostic Centre.\nCambridgeshire health bosses assured me at the time that the change in the MRI scanner was temporary, for a few months only, to enable an upgrade at the Wisbech site. They wrote on 23rd November 2023 to say :\n\"essential electrics work is being undertaken at the Wisbech site to allow MRI and CT scan units to move away from generator use and onto mains power. Once these works are complete in early 2024, the MRI unit will be installed back on site at Wisbech CDC”.\nIn fact instead of returning to Wisbech in April 2024 as previously promised, the ICB has since cancelled the MRI scanner which it previously rented. At no point does this information appear to have been shared with the public and elected representatives, despite stating the decision was due to a lack of patient demand.\nThe claim of a lack of patient demand is an odd given high waiting lists and the absence of any public information campaign. Nor should this information only come to light after I raised further questions recently over the under utilisation of the Wisbech CDC (as set out in my blog on Monday).\nPlease see my letter to health bosses below asking why the valuable MRI scanner has been lost from Fenland, why the information appears to have been kept from the public, and why the £2.1 million investment in the Community Diagnostic Centre is not being maximised.",
