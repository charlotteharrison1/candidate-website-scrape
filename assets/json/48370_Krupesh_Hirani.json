It is the least subsidised major transport system in the world. 72% of it’s funding comes from Passenger fares. Before the Coronavirus period, TfL’s finances were in a good condition as verified by independent auditors. With failed projects such as the Garden Bridge which was never built and the phasing out of a Government Grant to TfL, Boris Johnson left TfL with a £1.5bn deficit when he left the Mayoral office in 2016. In addition, a legacy of his deal with the David Cameron Government means that from 2021, the £500m raised every year from Londoners paying Vehicle Excise Duty (more commonly known as the Road Tax) will be collected by central Government and not given back to London – thereby only invested in roads outside the Capital.\nUnder Sadiq Khan’s mayoralty, TfL’s operating deficit before the Covid 19 period hit was reduced by 71%.\nThe Coronavirus lockdown and the continued message to stay at home and work from home as much as possible has led to a drastic reduction in people using London’s public transport system. At the peak of the pandemic, TfL's passenger income was reduced by more than 90 per cent compared to last year. TfL kept running trains and buses throughout the pandemic period to ensure that essential workers such as NHS staff could get to work. This has had a devastating financial impact on the essential public service.\nTransport for London is not alone. Transport networks in other cities such as Manchester, Tyne and Wear, Nottingham, the West Midlands and Sheffield for example have also been impacted. However these transport networks have all been given debt free bailouts.\nLondon has been treated differently. In order to receive a bail out, the Government has set conditions on receiving bailout funding. Within the first round of bail out negotiations, those conditions included;\n- Stopping free travel for under-18s\n- Stopping freedom pass holders from traveling at peak hours\n- Increasing the congestion charge\n- This was part of a short-term deal to keep TfL going to October.\nAs part of fresh negotiations, the Government is proposing further conditions as part of a bailout deal. These include;\n- Extending the Congestion Charge Zone to the North and South Circular Roads and increasing its charge further\n- Increasing Council Tax for all Londoners\n- Increase public transport fares\nThis approach from Government is very political and quite clear they are more interested in political elections rather than dealing with urgent and emergency issues. However in trying to hurt or attack the Mayor of London, they are in fact hurting people and businesses in London.",

Confirmed cases of coronavirus in Brent are rising quickly again. This is serious and the human cost is real and truly devastating. We see in the news every day that people are dying from coronavirus, including here in Brent at Northwick Park Hospital. Older people and particularly Asian men seem to be most affected. If you want to protect your loved ones – your parents, aunties, uncles and grandparents – you cannot afford to ignore the rules.\nThe current national restrictions mean that we all must stay at home, avoid seeing relatives or friends who we do not live with and follow the Public Health Rules. The rules are slightly different to the lockdown earlier this year. Schools and other types of education have stayed open. But the only way to lower the rate of infection in Brent, and protect our freedoms, is to stick to the rules. This is life and death.\nThis weekend Hindus, Sikhs and Jains will be celebrating Diwali, the festival of lights. Religious festivals and celebrations are such a big part of what makes Brent so special. I know how incredibly difficult the pandemic has been for people of all faiths. Earlier this year, Eid was very different. It’s likely that Hanukkah and Christmas won’t be the same either.\nAs a person of faith, I feel for you. These celebrations are normally a time when families, friends and neighbours come together. None of us wants to stop seeing our loved ones – particularly at such important times of the year. I know how disappointed many of you who were looking forward to celebrating Diwali with your loved ones, at a time when we need hope and light more than ever, will be. But the terrible reality is that we have got to make hard sacrifices together.\nTemples in Brent have decided to remain closed this weekend. I want to thank everyone involved for making this responsible choice. I also want to personally thank everyone who will be celebrating at home and online instead, and wish you a Diwali that brings happiness and joy to you and your family. By staying at home you’ll be helping to protect those closest to you – especially older relatives who may be extremely clinically vulnerable, and are at risk of becoming very seriously ill if they pick up the virus. Although the celebrations will be different, there are still plenty of ways to mark Diwali safely. There is also a virtual Diwali event online\nThe current restrictions are essential to keep Brent safe, and we must all play our part together. There is no single outbreak in the borough. Instead, we believe COVID-19 is being passed on through community transmission. Most likely, this means people are transferring the virus to family and friends by visiting them in their homes.\nSo please, stay at home and follow the important Hands, Face, Space guidance. If you do develop symptoms of the virus, stay at home and book a free test straight away by calling 020 8937 4440.\nIf we all follow the rules and stop the virus spreading among our communities, we will be able to look to better times ahead.",

  "https_krupesh_co_uk_/https_krupesh_co_uk_news_page_6/content_348.html": "Krupesh Hirani AM at the London Assembly Health Committee asking about hospitalisation and vaccines\nIt is incredibly important to take up all three doses of Covid vaccinations. Heard from Public Health Regional Director for London Professor Kevin Fenton at a recent Health Committee meeting at the London Assembly that 3 in 5 of those in London hospitals with Covid-19 are not vaccinated and 80% have not taken all three doses.\nMore help for those on low incomes to get rid of higher polluting vehicles as £5 million more added to the scrappage scheme to help people get ready for the ULEZ expansion later this year\n- Mayor announces additional £5 million funding to support disabled and low-income Londoners to scrap older, more polluting vehicles, bringing total investment up to £61 million\n- These schemes have been incredibly successful, helping replace or retrofit nearly 10,000 vehicles since 2019.\n- Londoners have responded positively to the upcoming expansion of the ULEZ with over 80 per cent of vehicles seen in the zone already compliant\n- A recent survey found that 26 per cent of owners of non-compliant vehicles had looked to change how they travel and 17 per cent had replaced their vehicle with a less polluting one\nAs part of the Mayor of London’s bold action to tackle dirty air across the capital, Sadiq Khan has today announced an additional £5 million for the scrappage scheme that is accelerating the move to cleaner vehicles across London.\nThe scrappage scheme aims to help Londoners on low incomes or with disabilities ditch their older, more polluting vehicles and switch to cleaner models, ahead of the Ultra Low Emission Zone expansion in October 2021 up to, but not including, the North and South Circular roads. Since the scheme was launched in 2019, it has helped replace or retrofit more than 10,000 vehicles.\nAs well as low income Londoners, the scheme has already successfully helped micro businesses, sole traders and charities to scrap more than 5,000 older vans. While the enthusiastic uptake of the vans scheme means that this element is currently suspended, it also means that Londoners are benefitting from reduced emissions from thousands of vans, even before the ULEZ expansion happens.\nMotorists can apply for:\n- £2,000 for scrapping a car\n- £1,000 for scrapping a motorcycle or moped\nCharities can continue to access funding to scrap minibuses, given their vital role in our communities and the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.\nPolluting vehicles account for around 50 per cent of London’s harmful NOx air emissions. The health impacts of air pollution have an economic cost to the capital and research from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has showed that cleaner air could also boost the economy by £1.6 billion.\nWhile significant progress has been made, with a substantial reduction in the number of Londoners living in areas exceeding legal limits for NO2, tens of thousands of Londoners still breathe illegally polluted air and 99 per cent of Londoners live in areas exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended guidelines for PM2.5, which are much tighter than the legal standards.\nThe Mayor’s additional investment in London’s scrappage scheme has been made without Government, unlike the scrappage schemes supporting Birmingham and Bath’s Clean Air Zones which have received significant Government support. This is despite the fact that Londoners are paying hundreds of millions of pounds in Vehicle Excise Duty every year, even though only a tiny fraction of it is spent in the capital.\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: “Air pollution is a national health crisis that is stunting the lung development of our children and leading to thousands of premature deaths.\n“Despite the lack of Government support, our car and motorcycle scrappage scheme will continue to help low-income and disabled Londoners scrap their older, polluting vehicles and switch to walking, cycling and public transport or a cleaner vehicle.\n“In central London, the Ultra Low Emission Zone has already helped cut toxic roadside nitrogen dioxide pollution by nearly half and led to reductions that are five times greater than the national average. But pollution isn’t just a central London problem, which is why expanding the ULEZ later this year will benefit Londoners across the whole of the city and is a crucial step in London’s green recovery. There is no time to waste. We know pollution hits the poorest Londoners and those from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities the hardest, which is why I’m doing everything I can to improve the health for all Londoners.\n“We need the Government to follow London’s lead and help clean our filthy air once and for all, by strengthening the Environment Bill to include WHO recommended air quality limits to be met by 2030 and supporting a targeted national vehicle scrappage fund that will help motorists across the UK to ditch their polluting cars.”\nSuha Al-Khayyat, Artistic Co-Director at Little Fish Theatre Company said: “Little Fish Theatre works with underserved young people across London. The company tours large scale theatre shows into venues big and small, relying on good transport for its theatre set and actors. Before the scrappage scheme, Little Fish was using a van that was far from environmentally friendly. The scheme enabled the company to put a large deposit on a new vehicle which finally met the safety standards needed, providing us and all our hard working staff with a comfortable and reliable mode of transport. Without the scheme, it would have taken a number of years to raise the funds needed for the upgrade. We are now the proud owners of a Euro 6 van that meets the ULEZ standards, enabling us to reach more young people.”\nAlex Williams, TfL’s Director of City Planning, said: “We know that London’s dirty air hits the most vulnerable the hardest. It leads to thousands of premature deaths, induces asthma and impacts the development of children’s lungs. That’s why the expansion of the ULEZ up to but not including the north and south circular is vital for the health of Londoners. The larger zone, which is 18 times the size of current one, will see harmful nitrogen dioxide cut by around 30 per cent across the whole city. We recognise that some more vulnerable Londoners may need a vehicle to get around, which is why we are delighted to announce this additional £5million to help them make the green transition.”\nDetails:\n- To apply for the scheme visit here: http://tfl.gov.uk/car-motorcycle-scrappage.

Within my constituency Transport for London (TfL) has trialled different lubrications on some trains in Kingsbury as this ‘further reduces friction between the wheels and track, particularly around curves’ and this has proved successful. When do you expect to roll this vital initiative out to the entire fleet?\nAnswered By: The Mayor Date: Tuesday, 1st June 2021\nTackling Tube noise continues to be a priority for me and for Transport for London (TfL), including around Kingsbury where TfL is investigating new on-train lubricators, which, as mentioned, could reduce friction between the wheels and track, particularly around curves.\nUnfortunately, recent testing has found that the initial design is not suitable for installation on the Jubilee line fleet. TfL is now investigating different designs of on-train lubricators to assess whether these could be installed on the Jubilee line.\nI have asked that TfL officers keep you updated on the progress of these works.\nCan you also please provide a date for the spring 2021 fitting of electrical lubricants on the Kingsbury track as promised by TfL back in February?\nAnswered By: The Mayor Date: Tuesday, 1st June 2021\nThe installation of electrical lubricators, which should help to mitigate noise by more reliably applying lubrication to the track, is now expected to be completed by the end of July 2021.\nThese works have unfortunately been delayed as a result of social distancing requirements due to the coronavirus pandemic, but I have urged Transport for London to ensure they are completed as quickly as possible.",

The scheme is providing rapid security support for any buildings vulnerable to Hate Crime, boosting the work done by local police forces and building on the Government’s existing Protective Security for Mosques Scheme, with up to £29.4 million already to fund security at mosques and Muslim faith schools.\nFaith Associates, who are leading experts in Mosque security, led the first of the four new sessions at Al Manaar to provide practical advice on how to keep congregations and premises safe. Representatives from the Met were also in attendance. The sessions will cover protective security and safety processes, as well as hate crime and online\nsafety and security. A Community Resilience Champions programme also runs in partnership with London Boroughs Faiths Network that provides practical support for faith leaders on how to keep their places of worship safe for staff, visitors and communities.\nAs disorder took place in some cities, the Mayor chaired a meeting with the Met Commissioner, London MPs and borough leaders on community cohesion and safety in the capital. He also visited Chelsea FC Foundation who deliver sessions and online workshops funded by City Hall that empower young Londoners to reject hate and give them the confidence to stand up to intolerance.\nThis followed the Met Police and London Resilience Unit bringing together partners across the capital to ensure they were working together at a time of heightened tensions, and the Met making it clear that anyone seeking to engage in disorder and sow division would face the full force of the law.\nThroughout his time as Mayor, Sadiq has led from the front to ensure the Met takes a zero-tolerance approach to all hate crime. This Mayor has invested a record £14.8m in combatting hatred, intolerance and extremism in all its forms, providing support to grassroots community groups, This includes his £3.95m Shared Endeavour Fund which\nis helping tens of thousands of Londoners to get involved in grassroots community-led projects across London that stand up to hate, intolerance, extremism and radicalisation wherever they are, as well as supporting the Community Alliance To Combat Hate (CATCH) partnership which supports victims of all forms of hate crime.",

Since the scheme was launched in 2019, it has helped replace or retrofit more than 10,000 vehicles.\nAs well as low income Londoners, the scheme has already successfully helped micro businesses, sole traders and charities to scrap more than 5,000 older vans. While the enthusiastic uptake of the vans scheme means that this element is currently suspended, it also means that Londoners are benefitting from reduced emissions from thousands of vans, even before the ULEZ expansion happens.\nMotorists can apply for:\n- £2,000 for scrapping a car\n- £1,000 for scrapping a motorcycle or moped\nCharities can continue to access funding to scrap minibuses, given their vital role in our communities and the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.\nPolluting vehicles account for around 50 per cent of London’s harmful NOx air emissions. The health impacts of air pollution have an economic cost to the capital and research from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has showed that cleaner air could also boost the economy by £1.6 billion.\nWhile significant progress has been made, with a substantial reduction in the number of Londoners living in areas exceeding legal limits for NO2, tens of thousands of Londoners still breathe illegally polluted air and 99 per cent of Londoners live in areas exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended guidelines for PM2.5, which are much tighter than the legal standards.\nThe Mayor’s additional investment in London’s scrappage scheme has been made without Government, unlike the scrappage schemes supporting Birmingham and Bath’s Clean Air Zones which have received significant Government support. This is despite the fact that Londoners are paying hundreds of millions of pounds in Vehicle Excise Duty every year, even though only a tiny fraction of it is spent in the capital.\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: “Air pollution is a national health crisis that is stunting the lung development of our children and leading to thousands of premature deaths.\n“Despite the lack of Government support, our car and motorcycle scrappage scheme will continue to help low-income and disabled Londoners scrap their older, polluting vehicles and switch to walking, cycling and public transport or a cleaner vehicle.\n“In central London, the Ultra Low Emission Zone has already helped cut toxic roadside nitrogen dioxide pollution by nearly half and led to reductions that are five times greater than the national average. But pollution isn’t just a central London problem, which is why expanding the ULEZ later this year will benefit Londoners across the whole of the city and is a crucial step in London’s green recovery. There is no time to waste. We know pollution hits the poorest Londoners and those from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities the hardest, which is why I’m doing everything I can to improve the health for all Londoners.\n“We need the Government to follow London’s lead and help clean our filthy air once and for all, by strengthening the Environment Bill to include WHO recommended air quality limits to be met by 2030 and supporting a targeted national vehicle scrappage fund that will help motorists across the UK to ditch their polluting cars.”\nSuha Al-Khayyat, Artistic Co-Director at Little Fish Theatre Company said: “Little Fish Theatre works with underserved young people across London. The company tours large scale theatre shows into venues big and small, relying on good transport for its theatre set and actors. Before the scrappage scheme, Little Fish was using a van that was far from environmentally friendly. The scheme enabled the company to put a large deposit on a new vehicle which finally met the safety standards needed, providing us and all our hard working staff with a comfortable and reliable mode of transport. Without the scheme, it would have taken a number of years to raise the funds needed for the upgrade. We are now the proud owners of a Euro 6 van that meets the ULEZ standards, enabling us to reach more young people.”\nAlex Williams, TfL’s Director of City Planning, said: “We know that London’s dirty air hits the most vulnerable the hardest. It leads to thousands of premature deaths, induces asthma and impacts the development of children’s lungs. That’s why the expansion of the ULEZ up to but not including the north and south circular is vital for the health of Londoners. The larger zone, which is 18 times the size of current one, will see harmful nitrogen dioxide cut by around 30 per cent across the whole city. We recognise that some more vulnerable Londoners may need a vehicle to get around, which is why we are delighted to announce this additional £5million to help them make the green transition.”\nDetails:\n- To apply for the scheme visit here: http://tfl.gov.uk/car-motorcycle-scrappage.

From Saturday 17 October all of London, including Brent and Harrow, were moved into the high level of alert.\nThe most significant new rule is that you must not meet socially with friends and family indoors, unless you live with them or have formed a support bubble together. This applies in your home, and at pubs or restaurants.\nYou can continue to see friends and family, who you don’t live with, in outdoor spaces, such as parks, but you must not meet in a group of more than six – including children.\nPlease work from home if you can and reduce the number of journeys you make. To help stop the spread of coronavirus it is vital that we all continue to:\n- Wash hands regularly\n- Wear a face covering\n- Keep a safe distance from anyone not in your household or support bubble.\nLook out for the symptoms of coronavirus which are: a high temperature; a new, continuous cough or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. If you have these symptoms, stay at home and apply for a test.\nThis is a difficult and worrying time for many of us. I know how many sacrifices you have made, to protect your loved ones, friends and neighbours. But a big effort from us at this moment can save lives, protect the local economy and stop the big growth in cases seen in other parts of the country.\nBy following the rules together, we can all play our part in keeping ourselves, our families and communities safe.

  "https_krupesh_co_uk_/https_krupesh_co_uk_news/content_2.html": "New Google technology in place to help combat mobile phone theft\nThe recent announcement of Google’s new security features for Android phones marks a significant step forward in the battle against mobile phone theft. As the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, rightly pointed out, this issue has become a pervasive problem in our cities, with criminals increasingly targeting high-value devices.\nThe new features, which include automatic screen locking and remote device control, are designed to make Android phones less attractive to thieves and provide enhanced protection for users’ data. This is a welcome development, as it demonstrates a growing recognition among technology companies of their responsibility to address the social and economic consequences of their products.\nWhile these measures are undoubtedly helpful, it is important to acknowledge that they are not a silver bullet. The illegal trade in stolen mobile phones remains a complex issue with deep-rooted connections to organized crime. To effectively combat this problem, a multi-faceted approach is required, involving law enforcement, technology companies, and policymakers working together.\nOne promising avenue is the exploration of ways to disable stolen devices worldwide, regardless of location. This would significantly reduce the resale value of stolen phones, making them less attractive to criminals. Additionally, stricter regulations and enforcement of existing laws are needed to crack down on the illicit trade in stolen parts and accessories.\nUltimately, the fight against mobile phone theft is a battle that we must win. It is a matter of public safety, economic justice, and the protection of individual rights. By working together, we can create a safer environment for all and ensure that the benefits of technology are enjoyed by everyone, without fear of theft or exploitation.\nMayor launches new toolkits and workshops in London primary schools to help educate pupils about healthy and respectful relationships\n- The new innovative £1million toolkit is now available online for all primary schools in the capital and will help champion healthy and respectful relationships and attitudes. Online courses will train teachers to run classes and workshops in every school\n- The move comes as research shows that young people are increasingly being exposed to misogynist influencers on social media – with one in three young males having a positive view of ‘self-proclaimed misogynist’ Andrew Tate and one in ten children having watched pornography by the time they are nine\n- The Mayor has today written to every primary school in London to highlight the importance of pupils learning about equality and respect\n- Today the Mayor warned there has never been a more important time to counter the pernicious influence of those who preach misogyny online, saying ‘young people must learn about respectful relationships before they start seeing content from individuals like Andrew Tate online.’\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, today launched a new landmark toolkit for every primary school in London to teach pupils about healthy and respectful relationships, as part of his work to tackle violence against women and girls.\nSadiq has written to every primary school in London explaining the importance of young boys and girls learning about equality and respect.\nThe new innovative £1million toolkit, funded by the Mayor and developed by educational experts Tender, uses workshops, drama and interactive sessions in the classroom to engage with young Londoners aged between 9-11 and champion healthy and respectful relationships and attitudes.\nTender is a pioneer in educating primary schools about healthy relationships and this is the first time they have put that knowledge and experience into a toolkit specifically for primary schools. Funding from the Mayor has allowed them to put their knowledge and experience into a toolkit to run classes and workshops empowering young people to confidently recognise, call out and help stamp out inequality and sexism among their own peer groups.\nThe move comes as research shows that young people are being increasingly exposed to misogynist influencers on social media – with one in three young males having a positive view of ‘self-proclaimed misogynist’ Andrew Tate. Young people are also being exposed to pornography online from as young as nine years old and this is having a negative role in shaping children’s understanding of girls and relationships.\nThe toolkit will help educate the next generation of Londoners on what harmful behaviour looks like, and why it is not ok. It will be delivered by primary school teachers and supported by specially trained workshop leaders.\nIt builds on work already delivered by the Mayor’s Violence Reduction Unit, which has pioneered a public health approach to tackling violence. It’s £2million funding includes investing in Tender to deliver work with 15,200 children and young people taking part in arts and drama-based healthy relationships sessions. This work has led to 90 per cent of pupils having a better understanding of healthy relationships and 80 per cent now able to spot red flags in a friendship or relationship.\nThe action is the latest part of the Mayor’s approach to tackling the underlying causes of violence against women and girls (VAWG). It will build on the success of his multi award-winning #HaveAWord campaign and allyship training in secondary schools which is working to educate and empower young Londoners to take a stand and help prevent violence against women and girls.\nThe launch of the new toolkit, following a successful trial, is based on the Mayor’s early intervention and prevention approach to tackling VAWG which places a stronger emphasis on partnership working, prevention and education across a wide range of services in London.\nThe Mayor is clear that it is never too early to start educating young Londoners about the need to treat one another fairly and kindly. And that education from a young age is key to strengthening the resilience young people have to toxic influences and attitudes towards women and girls in society and those proliferating on social media.\nIt is part of the Mayor’s record £233million investment to tackle violence against women and girls in all its forms – as well as its underlying causes. This funding is working to educate young people about harmful attitudes and behaviours, save lives, reduce waiting lists, keep doors open for vital specialist support services for victims and supporting the police and agencies to go after the worst perpetrators of violence.\nLondon’s Investment Boom Defies Global Trends with the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan announcing a record-breaking £100m of investment deals\nIn a remarkable display of economic resilience, London has continued to attract significant international investment, even as global markets grapple with uncertainty. Mayor Sadiq Khan’s proactive approach and strategic initiatives have played a pivotal role in fostering this growth, positioning the capital as a thriving hub for businesses across various sectors.\nThe recent announcement of record-breaking investment deals, totaling over £100 million, is a testament to London’s enduring appeal. The city’s ability to attract such substantial capital inflows, despite the challenging economic landscape, underscores its unique advantages. From cutting-edge technology companies to innovative biotech firms, London has proven to be a fertile ground for entrepreneurship and innovation.\nMayor Khan’s commitment to driving economic growth is evident in his strategic initiatives. The new London Growth Plan, with its ambitious target of creating 150,000 good jobs by 2028, demonstrates his vision for a prosperous and inclusive city. By investing in skills development and supporting small businesses, the Mayor is ensuring that Londoners have the opportunities they need to succeed.\nThe International Investment Summit serves as a significant platform for London to showcase its strengths and attract further investment. By working closely with the government and fostering partnerships with international businesses, Mayor Khan is positioning the capital as a global leader in economic development.\nLondon’s investment boom is a testament to the city’s resilience, innovation, and the strategic leadership of Mayor Sadiq Khan. As the capital continues to attract global capital and foster economic growth, it is poised to play a leading role in shaping the future of the UK economy.\nBlack History Month: A Time for Reflection and Action\nOctober in the UK marks Black History Month. The Month is more than just a commemoration of historical figures and events. It is a time for reflection, education, and action. The 2024 theme, “Reclaiming Narratives,” underscores the importance of correcting the distorted and often overlooked stories of Black history and culture. By highlighting Black excellence, honouring heroes, and challenging harmful stereotypes, this month aims to create a more accurate and inclusive understanding of the past.\nThe contributions of Black people to society are immeasurable. Black individuals have consistently made significant strides in various fields. However, it is essential to acknowledge that despite the progress made, Black communities continue to face systemic racism and discrimination. Disparities in healthcare, education, and economic opportunities persist.\nBrent Council’s Black Community Action Plan is a commendable initiative aimed at fostering greater engagement and collaboration with Black communities in the borough and tackling the issues the community have identified and working towards solutions. By seeking to work with these communities in unprecedented ways, the plan recognises the importance of addressing their needs and concerns.\nIn some quarters there are criticisms about the mere concept of having Black History Month. There has been a question on why a specific month is needed. While there may be opposition to the concept of Black History Month, it is crucial to recognise its value. By dedicating a specific time to celebrate, reflect, and learn more about Black history, we can deepen our understanding, challenge biases, and work towards a more equitable future.\nBlack History Month is an opportunity to honour the past, celebrate the present, and work towards a brighter future. By reclaiming narratives, acknowledging the contributions of Black communities, and addressing persistent injustices, we can create a society that truly values diversity and inclusivity. Let us use this month as a catalyst for change and a reminder of the ongoing struggle for racial justice.\nWelcoming new Violence Against Women and Girls funding to Harrow from the Mayor of London\nMore than 100 vulnerable women and girls in Harrow who have been subjected to violence and exploitation will benefit from specialist support from new community groups thanks to the Mayor of London’s grassroots fund.\nThis comes as part of the Mayor’s Office for Policing & Crime’s Violence Against Women Grassroots fund which announced a further £3million in funding for projects throughout London.\nAmong the organisations to benefit from the new funding package is the Dawn Charitable Trust in Harrow which has been awarded £100,000.

There were 146,293 on Thursday 15 August, 153,727 on Friday 16\nAugust, and 141,552 on Saturday 17 August, with hundreds of thousands more expected to have passed through the station for the final two nights on Monday 19 August and Tuesday 20 August.\nDuring the first three dates of her tour in June, Wembley Park Tube station broke more than 150,000 entries and exits in a day for the first time since 2019, with 167,237 entries and exits on the Friday 21 June and 153,761 on Saturday 22 June. On Sunday 23 June there were 137,059.\nTaylor Swift’s record-breaking The Eras Tour is estimated to have boosted the capital’s economy by £300m. Ahead of her first performance in London, TfL launched a Swift-themed Tube map with lines representing albums and songs for stations. London (Taylor’s version) has been on display at Wembley Park Tube station to create photo\nopportunities for fans who attended the concerts and will remain in place for the next few weeks.\nThis follows the unveiling of two public artworks at Wembley Park Tube station, including a giant mural on the Spanish Steps, which are being temporarily renamed the ‘Swiftie Steps’.\nLondon has had a fantastic summer of international and homegrown music performing, including Green Day and Bruce Springsteen at Wembley Stadium, Burna Boy at the London Stadium, Nicki Minaj, 21 Savage, J Hus and Doja Cat at Wireless Festival in Finsbury Park, Kylie, SZA and Stray Kids at BST Hyde Park.\nTfL confirms the next 12 Tube stations to be prioritised for step-free access, as work on improving accessibility of Underground network gathers pace. Neasden and Alperton station schemes progress to next stages.\n- Design work to start on making Alperton, Arnos Grove and Eastcote Underground stations step-free, building on feasibility work that started last year\n- These stations join North Acton and West Hampstead, announced earlier this year\n- An additional seven Tube stations will be assessed for step-free access feasibility, including Neasden\nTfL is starting design work imminently on making a further three Tube stations step free, which means there are now five Underground stations with funding in place for this phase. A further seven Tube stations will undergo assessment for step-free access feasibility.\nWork is starting on the designs that would make three Piccadilly line stations step-free (Alperton, Arnos Grove and Eastcote, which is also served by the Metropolitan line), building on feasibility work that started last year.\nThis follows TfL confirming earlier this year that work was to start at Northolt Tube station on the Central line to make it step-free, and that design work will start at North Acton (Central line) and West Hampstead (Jubilee line).\nA further seven Tube stations will also undergo assessment for step-free access feasibility; they are Croxley (Metropolitan line), East Finchley (Northern line), Neasden (Jubilee line), Northwood (Metropolitan line) and Turnham Green (District / Piccadilly lines), as well as Colliers Wood and Tooting Broadway on the Northern line.\nToday, more than a third of Underground stations across the city provide step-free access, with the Mayor of London’s ambitious goal set at making 50 per cent of Tube stations step-free by 2030. Increasing the number of Underground stations with step free access continues TfL’s work to make the capital’s transport network more\naccessible but progress will depend on deliverability and TfL’s future funding position, with schemes prioritised where there is third party funding available.\n£3.1 million provided by the Mayor to transform Neasden Town Centre\nI fully welcome the announcement from Mayor Khan that a £3.1 million investment for green spaces, road safety and a revitalised high street in Neasden Town Centre has been approved by City Hall.\nThe Neasden Town Centre project will transform one of London’s most polluted town centres into a greener, safer, and more accessible area for residents and visitors. It will invest in parks and green spaces, realign the road junctions to make it safer, make the town centre more accessible for pedestrians and refresh the high street to include a community training kitchen – engaging with young people and the local community.\nNeasden Town Centre is one of five areas across Brent, Redbridge, Hackney, Lewisham, and Croydon receiving funding. Town centres totalling the size of four Wembley football pitches will be made greener, safer and more accessible over the next three years.\nThe funding is part of the Mayor of London’s, Sadiq Khan’s, £12.4 million Civic Partnership Programme, which will build a fairer city, making all areas of London enjoyable to spend time in. The funding will help create open, connected, and inclusive public spaces and high streets, allowing Londoners from all backgrounds to shape their city’s growth.\nMayor reiterates that London is for everyone as he provides extra support for security training at mosques following recent violence and disorder across the country\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has reiterated that London stands united against racism, Islamophobia and antisemitism as he announced additional support for security training at mosques in the capital, following the scenes of violence and disorder across the country earlier this month.\nThe targeting of Muslims and minority ethnic communities has left many fearing for their safety and the Mayor has worked closely with the Met, partners and communities across the capital to ensure those in London are safe – and feel safe.\nThe Mayor has provided funding for four additional security training sessions in mosques across the capital, as he extends his work to support faith leaders across the capital, build community cohesion and tackle hate crime following the recent disorder.\nSadiq has also welcomed the reopening of the Government’s Mosque Security Scheme following his calls. The scheme is providing rapid security support for any buildings vulnerable to Hate Crime, boosting the work done by local police forces and building on the Government’s existing Protective Security for Mosques Scheme, with up to £29.4 million already to fund security at mosques and Muslim faith schools.\nFaith Associates, who are leading experts in Mosque security, led the first of the four new sessions at Al Manaar to provide practical advice on how to keep congregations and premises safe. Representatives from the Met were also in attendance. The sessions will cover protective security and safety processes, as well as hate crime and online\nsafety and security. A Community Resilience Champions programme also runs in partnership with London Boroughs Faiths Network that provides practical support for faith leaders on how to keep their places of worship safe for staff, visitors and communities.\nAs disorder took place in some cities, the Mayor chaired a meeting with the Met Commissioner, London MPs and borough leaders on community cohesion and safety in the capital. He also visited Chelsea FC Foundation who deliver sessions and online workshops funded by City Hall that empower young Londoners to reject hate and give them the confidence to stand up to intolerance.\nThis followed the Met Police and London Resilience Unit bringing together partners across the capital to ensure they were working together at a time of heightened tensions, and the Met making it clear that anyone seeking to engage in disorder and sow division would face the full force of the law.\nThroughout his time as Mayor, Sadiq has led from the front to ensure the Met takes a zero-tolerance approach to all hate crime. This Mayor has invested a record £14.8m in combatting hatred, intolerance and extremism in all its forms, providing support to grassroots community groups, This includes his £3.95m Shared Endeavour Fund which\nis helping tens of thousands of Londoners to get involved in grassroots community-led projects across London that stand up to hate, intolerance, extremism and radicalisation wherever they are, as well as supporting the Community Alliance To Combat Hate (CATCH) partnership which supports victims of all forms of hate crime.",

So far 110 houses in Brent and 28 in Harrow have joined the Mayor of London-backed Solar Together initiative, latest City Hall figures show. Local London Assembly Member, Krupesh Hirani AM, is urging residents to sign up to the “exciting and innovative” scheme before registration closes on 3rd April to save cash and help London towards a “greener, cleaner future”.\nResponding to a written question from Mr Hirani, the Mayor for London, Sadiq Khan, revealed more than 1,500 homes across London, including 138 in Brent and Harrow, were now part of the affordable renewable energy project. The deadline for the latest phase of installations is April 3rd.\nSolar panel installation could reduce household electricity bills by 30-50%. With energy prices increasing to record levels, now is a better time than ever to invest in solar to get cleaner energy and save money on bills. With rising petrol and diesel prices, the option is also available for people to use the scheme to install a car charging point powered by solar energy.\nAn installation through the Mayor’s Solar Together initiative is a third cheaper than the typical market price. For an eight-panel system – the most common system installed – customers have saved an average of £3,504.\nMr Khan said that hundreds more installations are booked in over the coming months which are “critical for both tackling the climate emergency and helping to reduce household energy bills”.\nEnergy bills in the UK are set to climb by £693 to an average £1,971 in April, after regulator Ofgem announced in February it was lifting the price cap putting more pressure on those struggling with the rising cost of living.\nRecent increases in energy bills have pushed an estimated 75,000 Londoners into fuel poverty. The latest Office of National Statistics (ONS) figures show that in 2019, 20,322 households in Brent and 13,014 in Harrow were living in fuel poverty.\nLast month the Mayor announced he is committing a record £90 million through green bonds to unlock more than £500m in private investment to support low carbon projects, create green jobs and move closer to his target of a zero-carbon capital by 2030.",

There is no UK recovery from the pandemic without a London recovery and there is no London recovery without a properly funded transport network in the capital. It is essential London receives the sustained long-term Government funding that is vital for the coming years if a period of ‘managed decline’ of London’s transport network is to be avoided.\n“We have today (4 February) agreed with the Government that our existing funding agreement will be extended until 18 February 2022 so that these discussions can be concluded. Working together, we must achieve a longer term capital funding settlement for at least three years, that ensures London’s transport network can remain reliable and efficient, can support the jobs and new homes that rely upon it and can support the economic recovery of the capital and the country as a whole. We hope these discussions can be concluded successfully soon. “\nOn 1 June 2021, TfL announced that an extraordinary funding and financing support package (the “Funding Package”) had been agreed between TfL and the DfT to support transport services in London and contribute towards TfL’s forecast revenue loss due to reduced passenger numbers using TfL services as a result of the pandemic. The Funding Package initially provided support for the period from 29 May 2021 to 11 December 2021 and was subsequently extended.\nOn 17 December 2021, TfL announced that the terms of the Funding Package had been amended to extend the funding period to 4 February 2022, to allow TfL to continue discussions with the government in relation to further financial support.\nFollowing further discussion, the terms of the Funding Package have now been amended to define the funding period as 29 May 2021 to 18 February 2022. Other provisions of the Funding Package remain materially the same, including the Top Up Grant mechanism, pursuant to the terms of the Funding Package.\nThe original terms of the Funding Package announced on 1 June 2021 can be found in the funding letter.",

Once complete, customers will be able to make calls wherever they are on the Underground, check the latest travel information, keep on top of their emails, catch up on social media and live stream videos, transforming the passenger experience and securing London’s transformation into a smart city.\nBAI’s neutral host mobile network will also host the new Emergency Services Network (ESN), which will give first responders immediate access to life-saving data, images and information in live situations and emergencies on the frontline.\nWork on delivering 4G coverage across the Tube network is well underway, following the successful transfer of the previous pilot section on the eastern end of the Jubilee line to BAI earlier this year. Positive progress now means that the next five stations to get coverage – Bank, Oxford Circus, Tottenham Court Road, Euston, and Camden Town – will go live within the next six months. The additional connectivity within these stations will help customers visiting the city to make plans for shopping, events and socialising with friends and family in Central London across the festive season.\nAll stations and tunnels across the Tube network remain on course to have high-quality and uninterrupted mobile coverage. Some sections of Tube network will go live by summer 2023 – including parts of the Central line including stations and tunnels through the City and West End. TfL and BAI are also continuing to progress with delivering mobile coverage across the recently opened central section of the Elizabeth line between Paddington and Abbey Wood.\nMobile operators will also ensure continued and improved coverage via Wi-Fi on the London Underground and Elizabeth line when the network transfers to BAI in April 2023.",

This action is a key part of the Met’s recently announced Turnaround Plan and the renewed focus on modernising training and developing a strong cohort of leaders in every policing department across the capital.\nThe Leadership Academy will also empower Met leaders to identify officers whose performance is not meeting the high standards set and give them the training to tackle issues around discipline and performance more effectively. This includes improving the working environment for all officers and staff and taking action against officers with “repeated or patterns of unacceptable behaviour” in support of key recommendations from the interim Baroness Casey review.*\nThe investment will also include increase the number HR staff within the Met to better support Met leaders and line managers to tackle performance and standards issues at source, accelerating the work the Commissioner is leading on to make the Met a workplace where everyone is supported and proud to be a part of.\nA further £2.5million from City Hall would be used to improve the training and resilience of the Met’s Command and Control Centre (MetCC), which handles more than six million emergency calls and online queries from the public each year. This action follows the findings of the HMICFRS PEEL inspection3, which found that the Met needed to improve how it responds to calls from the public.\nThe Mayor’s funding proposals are part of a package of measures designed to support the Met to exit Special Measures as quickly as possible and to accelerate the root and branch reforms and systemic change to the Met’s performance and culture.",

  "https_krupesh_co_uk_/https_krupesh_co_uk_new-10m-investment-announced-in-green-new-deal-to-secure-thousands-of-green-jobs/content_142.html": "- Sadiq invests £10 million in green projects that will support around 1,000 green jobs to boost London’s economic recovery and tackle the twin dangers of air pollution and the climate emergency.\n- The fund will address inequalities exposed by the pandemic – with funding provided to support those most likely to experience cold, damp homes, poor air quality and with limited access to green space.\n- A key step towards the Green New Deal mission as agreed by the London Recovery Board which aims to create tens of thousands of jobs through doubling the size of London’s green economy sector by 2030.\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, today launched the first part of London’s Green New Deal fund with £10 million invested in projects to boost green jobs, tackle the climate emergency and address inequalities. This sits alongside the investment he is making to support action on the climate and ecological emergency through other City Hall programmes on housing, adult education, skills and transport.\nThe first phase of the fund will secure around 1,000 jobs for Londoners, and support the green industries that are crucial to meeting the city’s climate targets and recover from the economic and social impacts of COVID-19. The jobs will be in areas such as solar panel installation and other programmes to make homes more energy efficient.\nNew data shows that London’s £48 billion green economy now supports five per cent of jobs in the capital – it is worth more than the construction and manufacturing sectors combined and has grown rapidly over the last decade, creating more than 161,000 new jobs in that time*. The Mayor’s Green New Deal Fund supports the London Recovery Board’s ambition to double the size of the green economy in London to £100 billion by 2030, an ambition that would kick-start greater job growth over the next decade. The pan-London Recovery Board – co-chaired by the Mayor of London – co-ordinates the planning for London's future post-COVID.\nThe fund will also tackle inequalities exposed by the COVID-19 crisis. London has some of the highest levels of fuel poverty in the country with one in nine** London households unable to meet the cost of heating their homes. Energy efficiency and low-carbon heat projects will cut energy bills and improve living conditions for thousands of Londoners. Funding will be provided to green London Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), in particular supporting Black Asian Minority Ethnic and female-led enterprises, and also support London Living Wage paid internships for those starting their careers into cleantech businesses – which are business that develops solutions to environmental challenges through technology.\nThe Mayor’s Green New Deal demonstrates Sadiq’s world-leading commitments to tackle the climate emergency including setting a bold target to make London a zero carbon city by 2030 and having a climate plan for London that is compatible with the highest ambition of the Paris Climate Agreement. Once projects from the first £10m fund are completed, they will save up to 20,000 tonnes of CO2 per year directly and support the ability to rapidly scale up further carbon savings across London.\nThe new fund will boost the green economy by supporting SME jobs as well as creating and retaining a range of jobs such as solar panel installers, designers, engineers and various jobs in construction including site managers, supervisors and builders.\nThis initial £10m investment from the GLA will be broken down into three areas:\n- Decarbonising the Built Environment\nTackling emissions from heating and powering London’s buildings. Programmes will make homes more energy efficient and ensure London is supplied with more green energy through district energy networks and other clean sources such as solar. - Green Transport and Public Realm\nTackling transport emissions and encouraging walking, cycling and electric vehicles. Projects will also improve access to green spaces and the natural environment while increasing London’s resilience and adaptation to climate change impacts. - Green Foundations\nSupporting growth of new and existing businesses in the green economy. Projects will create job opportunities and develop skills for Londoners to exploit the opportunities that the transition to a low carbon circular economy represents.\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: “I am delighted to be investing £10 million in projects that will create green collar jobs in London as part of our Green New Deal that will both support our economic recovery from COVID, and tackle inequalities faced in our city.\n“The funding will directly help those most likely to experience cold and damp homes, and also support Londoners with limited access to green space. We must rebuild our city post COVID so that it’s cleaner, greener and fairer.\n“With just under a year to go until the UK hosts COP26, the government this week set out its ambition for meeting its climate targets, but this can only be achieved if the Government gives cities the power and funding they need to deliver. We have a proven track record that shows when cities are empowered to deliver, they are given the ability to deliver the transformation that we need to our economy and society.”\nLord Karan Bilimoria, CBE DL, CBI President, said: “London’s Green New Deal prioritises bold, low-carbon investment which will be welcomed by business who want a green recovery from the pandemic that helps us towards net-zero emissions.\n“The creation of 1,000 new skilled jobs for Londoners, and support for SMEs, are welcome moves. This will help bring about the green energy upgrades for homes, and clean transport links, that will give Londoners more opportunities to reduce their carbon emissions.\n“Establishing effective partnerships between public and private sectors will be vital if London is to meet the Mayor’s goal of becoming a zero carbon city by 2030. Firms across London’s fast-growing green economy stand ready to support this.”\nMark Watts, Executive Director of C40 Cities, said: \"Achieving a green and just recovery from the COVID crisis is essential to create jobs, save lives and build the foundations for a zero carbon economy. London is a global leader on climate and with this Fund, Mayor Khan once again is setting an example for others to follow. Actions like these are how cities around the world can collectively deliver a Global Green New Deal.\"\nJayne Clare, Managing Director, Energetik said: “We’re delighted to receive this funding which will be spent in two distinct areas. The first element will allow us to pilot and establish a methodology for retrofit connections at scale. Space heating and hot water accounts for over 20% of the UK’s carbon emissions and is one of the biggest challenges to decarbonising the UK. This project will help Energetik retrofit future-proofed, very low carbon heating infrastructure to existing homes to supporting Enfield and London with its decarbonisation targets. In addition, we’re very pleased to receive funding which will support the creation of a cross-borough, large scale heat network in north London. By providing our neighbouring boroughs with the same low-carbon heat we have access to, we are able to directly assist in their local decarbonisation plans.”\nSyed Ahmed, Chair of Community Energy London said: \"The Mayor's London Community Energy Fund has been hugely successful in driving community-led action on carbon reduction and fuel poverty projects across the city. London is now in the vanguard of community energy and at the same time we are seeing more and more Londoners who want to get involved. We are excited with this new expanded fourth round of the London Community Energy Fund, and groups will continue to focus on delivering projects that support those communities most affected by the pandemic.\"\nOne thought on “New £10m investment announced in Green New Deal to secure thousands of green jobs”\nComments are closed.",

Services on the Piccadilly line return on the evening of Friday 29 July and will run throughout the night on Fridays and Saturdays. The return of this line means a complete restoration of the weekend Night Tube and Night Overground services previously available to customers, providing more options for safe travel around the city.\nNight Tube services across the capital have been steadily returning to support with London’s economic recovery, with the Central and Victoria lines being the first to start operating from November 2021. This was further bolstered this summer with the return of the Jubilee and Northern lines in May and June 2022. In addition, Night Overground services between Highbury & Islington and New Cross Gate returned in December 2021.\nLondon’s recovery from the pandemic has been driven by a safe and reliable public transport network that serves the city night and day. The complete restoration of Night Tube services will allow Londoners and visitors to make the most of all the capital has to offer on weekend evenings with shorter journey times, whilst also providing late night travellers another safe way to return home.\nThe complete restoration of Night Tube services on London Underground marks a key moment in London’s recovery. The return of the final Piccadilly line Night Tube services comes at a time in the year where many holiday goers are in need of travel options to and from Heathrow Airport throughout the night to continue their journeys. Since the return of the Night Tube service in November 2021, 3.2m entries and exits have been recorded – demonstrating customers’ continued confidence that services are safe, clean and reliable. Weekday ridership on the Tube network has grown to 70 per cent of pre-pandemic levels and weekend ridership is now regularly above 85 per cent of pre-pandemic levels.\nThe Night Tube offers a safe, low crime environment. TfL has dedicated British Transport Police officers patrolling stations and trains during Night Tube and Night Overground services to provide support and reassurance to staff and customers. Across the TfL network, there are more than 2,500 police and police community support officers and 500 TfL enforcement officers who patrol London’s transport network, while thousands of frontline transport staff support customers and an extensive CCTV network is in place across the Tube. All stations that are open through the night are staffed at all times to ensure passengers always have someone to speak to should they have any questions or need assistance. Customers are now able to report safety concerns directly to the British Transport Police (BTP) through the new ‘Railway Guardian’ app or by texting 61016.\nTfL also operates an extensive night bus network along with the Night Overground, to ensure everyone can travel around the capital throughout the night. More than one hundred routes currently run through the night and ridership on buses is regularly at 80 per cent. In addition, licensed and regulated taxis and private hire vehicles provide door-to-door transport at all times of the day. The Tube continues to operate between approximately 05:30 and 00:30 through central London from Monday to Saturday.",

The scheme ensured no child is going hungry in the classroom and saves parents up to £1,000 per child over two years.\nMr Hirani has successfully campaigned for numerous improvements to community safety in Brent, seeing an uplift in police numbers by three police constables and four police community support officers dedicated to the Kilburn area as a result of his campaigning for a greater police presence in the neighbourhood.\nHe has promised to continue to campaign on combatting hate crime – including Hinduphobia, which is currently not given the recognition that statistics suggest that it should be given. Home Office figures show Hinduphobia and anti-Hindu hate crimes are increasing across England and Wales. He will continue to work with police and community leaders to help prevent London’s Hindu community from being subject to a recognised hate crime.\nHe will also continue campaigning to tackle London’s housing crisis, supporting the Mayor’s plans to build 40,000 new council homes. Councils in London currently spend £90 million each month on temporary accommodation to house, for example, those leaving violent relationships or who have been made homeless. Mr Hirani has supported greater provision of council housing to save the public money, take pressure off of the private rented sector and, crucially, keep people off the streets.\nKrupesh Hirani AM, London Assembly Member for Brent and Harrow, said:\n“Under Mayor Sadiq Khan, City Hall has done a great job of protecting London from the damage the government has done to the rest of the country.\n“City Hall has stepped up to help Londoners through the cost-of-living crisis by providing, for the first time ever, free school meals to all state primary children. On top of this, mayoral funding has made sure that the Metropolitan Police have the resources they need to properly support our communities and keep Londoners safe.\n“Thank you to voters for putting their confidence in me. I will be the champion for Brent and Harrow at City Hall. The Mayor’s plans will make London fairer, safer and better connected over the next four years – and our area must be a part of that.”",

Local London Assembly Member Krupesh Hirani has welcomed the inclusion of Alperton and Rayners Lane stations in this list. This is part of TfL’s yearly £20 million commitment to making the transport network in London more accessible to all passengers.\nAccessibility is vital to our transport network, ensuring all passengers are able to get around the capital for work, for school, for leisure and more. Since 2016, the number of step-free stations in London has increased by 20%, with over 200 stations step-free across the network.\nThis latest step will see stations across North West London prioritised for works that would make them accessible to all. However, funding is key to this as these projects can be costly due to the scale and difficulty of installing lifts and other measures to increase accessibility. This is why TfL will work with all partners and stakeholders including central Government, local boroughs and development partners to identify investment opportunities.\nLocal London Assembly Member Krupesh Hirani AM said:\n“It’s great to see Alperton and Rayners Lane on this list of stations. Following the recent successful completions of step-free access at Sudbury Hill and Harrow on the Hill stations, I hope to see these and other stations across Brent and Harrow become accessible to everyone.\n“Making these stations accessible would make a huge difference to disabled passengers in my constituency, making it easier for them to access the transport network, and allowing them to travel safely and with dignity.\n“Step-free access will also benefit other passengers, including parents with pushchairs, anyone travelling with luggage, or anyone who just needs an easier journey.\n“I look forward to working with TfL and local councils to advocate for these stations to become step-free.”\nInformation on TfL’s prioritised stations can be found here",

Those with non-compliant vehicles will be able to access funding through the scrappage scheme as listed above.

However, in spite of cuts, the will is there and local bodies have a moral duty to come together to tackle this issue.

In addition, the murder of Sarah Everard as well as the unravelling of the actions of Metropolitan Police officers in the aftermath of the murders of Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry have further eroded trust and confidence in the Metropolitan Police.\nPart of the issue lies with the lack of BAME representation in the Police as well as female representation.

The Month is more than just a commemoration of historical figures and events. It is a time for reflection, education, and action. The 2024 theme, “Reclaiming Narratives,” underscores the importance of correcting the distorted and often overlooked stories of Black history and culture. By highlighting Black excellence, honouring heroes, and challenging harmful stereotypes, this month aims to create a more accurate and inclusive understanding of the past.\nThe contributions of Black people to society are immeasurable. Black individuals have consistently made significant strides in various fields. However, it is essential to acknowledge that despite the progress made, Black communities continue to face systemic racism and discrimination. Disparities in healthcare, education, and economic opportunities persist.\nBrent Council’s Black Community Action Plan is a commendable initiative aimed at fostering greater engagement and collaboration with Black communities in the borough and tackling the issues the community have identified and working towards solutions. By seeking to work with these communities in unprecedented ways, the plan recognises the importance of addressing their needs and concerns.\nIn some quarters there are criticisms about the mere concept of having Black History Month. There has been a question on why a specific month is needed. While there may be opposition to the concept of Black History Month, it is crucial to recognise its value. By dedicating a specific time to celebrate, reflect, and learn more about Black history, we can deepen our understanding, challenge biases, and work towards a more equitable future.\nBlack History Month is an opportunity to honour the past, celebrate the present, and work towards a brighter future. By reclaiming narratives, acknowledging the contributions of Black communities, and addressing persistent injustices, we can create a society that truly values diversity and inclusivity. Let us use this month as a catalyst for change and a reminder of the ongoing struggle for racial justice.",

With high pollution levels in London, we have a duty to improve our air quality and in turn improve health outcomes for all. Investment in public transport is also key and major infrastructure projects such as the West Orbital light rail have huge potential to improve travel experiences of residents in North West London.\nAccessible transport is also a critical issue. As someone who has worked and campaigned tirelessly for disabled people across the country, I know how important it is for people to be able to travel by public transport. It is an absolute right. I will support community led campaigns for accessible tube stations as well as better bus routes for all.\nLondon's public transport system is at threat by the Government who have used the Coronavirus crisis to meddle with London's transport system. Across the country they have mismanaged National Rail services and we cannot allow them to have control of TfL given their track record on rail services. They have continued their assault on young people by targeting cutbacks on free under-18 travel.\nTransport for London's main source of income since the Government grant was cut back is fares and naturally, with people the numbers of people using public transport drastically reducing, this has had a significant impact on TfL. The Government has placed damaging bail out conditions on TfL which has not been the case for the Manchester Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram, West Midlands Metro, NET Nottingham and Tyne and Wear Metro systems who have all had debt free bailouts.\nI will work with the Mayor of London to campaign against these unfair and unjust attacks on London from the Government.\nThe Freedom Pass is also a lifeline for people over 60 in London and disabled people. We need to ensure it is protected and continues to support Londoners and also disabled people which I will continue to do.\nULEZ\nThe Mayor has had to make a difficult decision to expand the Ultra Low Emission Zone to all of London. This was not an easy decision to make but the evidence on the difference it makes from a public health perspective and in terms of kerbing NOx levels in our air is clear.\nThe Mayor has listened to feedback and changes made to the scrappage scheme means that people will be able to receive compensation to get rid of their non-compliant cars or make changes to the car to make them compliant.",

It’s clear that the only way to start to deliver the scale of the change required is to have new leadership right at the top of the Metropolitan Police.\n“I would like to thank Dame Cressida Dick for her 40 years of dedicated public service, with the vast majority spent at the Met where she was the first woman to become Commissioner. In particular, I commend her for the recent work in helping us to bring down violent crime in London – although of course there is more to do.\n“I want to put on the record again that there are thousands of incredibly brave and decent police officers at the Met who go above and beyond every day to help keep us safe, and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude.\n“I will now work closely with the Home Secretary on the appointment of a new Commissioner so that we can move quickly to restore trust in the capital’s police service while keeping London safe.”",

These calls were not followed by the Government and instead they have had to impose a longer lockdown this month. If the original advice had been followed, Covid-19 would not have spread as much and we would be out of the ‘circuit break’ period by now. If timed with half-term holidays, the impact on children and schools would have also been less severe.\nDiwali is the largest celebration in the Hindu, Sikh and Jain calendars and over the festive period and the Hindu New Year, Temples celebrate the festival of lights and families meet and greet each other to welcome the New Year. This year Diwali will be on Saturday 14th November with the New Year commencing on Sunday 15th November. It would have already been impacted by Coronavirus restrictions but the later lockdown has impacted plans further.\nThe later lockdown has meant that Diwali celebrations have been severely impacted and that families will not be able to see each other on this auspicious day. All of this was avoidable if more shorter-term restrictions had been brought in earlier.\nCllr Hirani said,\n“It is a shame that we will not be able to celebrate key festivals in the same way but I applaud local Temples and organisations for making sure that people can still celebrate in a Covid secure way using technology. I urge people to follow the law and guidance.”\nCllr Hirani has been working with organisations across Brent to help coordinate and support their plans for festivities and also work with them to promote public health guidance on Covid-19.",

  "https_krupesh_co_uk_/https_krupesh_co_uk_news_page_2/content_7.html": "New data shows Mayor’s ULEZ expansion is working better than expected, bringing cleaner air to five million more Londoners\n- Data shows ULEZ expansion is working better than predicted, with London’s air quality continuing to improve at a faster rate than the rest of England and pollutant emissions in 2023 reducing dramatically, compared to a scenario without the London-wide expansion.\n- PM2.5 exhaust emissions from cars in outer London are estimated to be 22 per cent lower than without the expansion.\n- Within the outer London ULEZ area, NOx emissions from cars and vans are estimated to be 13 and seven per cent lower than a scenario without the expansion. This is equivalent to removing 200,000 cars from the road for one year.\n- Overall, NO2 concentrations in outer London are estimated to be 21 per cent lower than without the ULEZ and its expansions.\n- 96 per cent of vehicles seen driving in London as a whole are now compliant, with a 53 per cent reduction in non-compliant vehicles in only six months.\nNew data from City Hall has revealed the expansion of the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) across the whole capital last August is working – driving down emissions and bringing cleaner air to millions more Londoners.\nIn London, around 4,000 premature deaths are attributed to toxic air each year as well as increased risks of asthma and cancer and emerging evidence of links between air pollution and dementia.\nThe ULEZ is the centrepiece of a range of measures the Mayor is implementing to tackle London’s toxic air, including putting a record number of zero-emission buses on the roads. These additional measures are making a difference, but all the evidence shows that clean air zones like the ULEZ are the most effective tool available to quickly and meaningfully cut air pollution in big cities.\nToday’s report, which covers the first six months of the expansion across all London boroughs, shows that pollutant emissions in 2023 with the London-wide ULEZ expansion in place are dramatically lower, compared to a scenario without it:\n- Within the outer London ULEZ area, NOx emissions from cars and vans are estimated to be 13 per cent and seven per cent lower than a scenario without the expansion. This is equivalent to removing 200,000 cars from the road for one year.\n- PM2.5 exhaust emissions from cars in outer London are estimated to be 22 per cent lower than without the expansion (six per cent more than expected).\n- Across all measures, these impacts are aligned with, and in many cases greater than, what TfL estimated in the consultation for the outer London expansion.\nNOX emissions savings in outer London now represent over 90 per cent of the total emission reductions seen in London as a result of the London-wide expansion.\nThe report also shows that, compared to what roadside NO2 concentrations are estimated to have been in different parts of London without the ULEZ and its expansions:\n- Levels in Outer London are estimated to be 21 per cent lower\n- Levels in Central London are estimated to be 53 per cent lower\n- Levels in Inner London are estimated to be 24 per cent lower\nThe report shows that London’s air quality at the roadside is continuing to improve at a faster rate than the average for the rest of England. In 2014, the gap in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels between London and the rest of England was 20 µg/m3, whereas now it is less than 5 µg/m3. The expansion brought five million more Londoners into the ULEZ, and today’s report shows that outer London – which has historically had worse air quality than the rest of England average – now has levels of pollution much closer to levels in the rest of the country.\nEven in the short six-month timeframe covered by the report, roadside NO2 concentrations in outer London have dropped by up to 4.4 per cent compared to what would have been expected without the London-wide expansion of the scheme. Given the size of outer London, every percent makes a huge difference.\nCompliance levels have also increased further than expected, with 96.2 per cent of all vehicles subject to the ULEZ recorded driving in London now compliant, up from 90.9 per cent in June 2023. This has been aided by the Mayor’s £210m scrappage scheme, launched in January 2023 to support Londoners to switch to cleaner vehicles, with 53,351 applications approved so far and over 300 donated to humanitarian and medical efforts in Ukraine.\nThere are now fewer older, more polluting vehicles driving in London, with 90,000 fewer non-compliant vehicles detected on an average day in February 2024 compared to June 2023, representing a 53 per cent reduction in non-compliant vehicles in the first six months of operation.\nToday’s preliminary data reveals significant progress, with a further report expected in early 2025 which will examine the first full year of the London-wide ULEZ expansion. The one-year report will be supported by an independent advisory group of experts and provide an even more comprehensive analysis of the air quality and traffic impacts of the scheme.\nTfL makes £80 million of funding available to boroughs to help make streets safer and improve bus journey times\n- Funding includes up to £50 million available over the next three years for boroughs to deliver significant safety improvements to their local area\n- £30m also available to deliver transformational bus infrastructure and operational improvements in three successful boroughs\n- London’s 33 boroughs are responsible for around 95 per cent of streets across the capital and are vital partners in making them safe, accessible and reliable for all\nTransport for London is making up to £50 million of funding available for boroughs to improve road safety on borough roads, as well as £30 million of funding to improve bus journey times and increase bus ridership. London’s boroughs play a key role in the planning and delivery of schemes that transform local areas and support the Mayor’s Vision Zero goal of eliminating death and serious injury from the transport network, as well as improving opportunities for safe and active travel in local communities. They also help ensure that the capital’s bus service is comfortable and easy for all to use, offers attractive journey times and provides the connections people need.\nThis funding is in addition to the £80.4 million of Local Implementation Plan funding allocated to London’s boroughs in 2024/25 and will help boroughs to continue their vital work making the capital’s roads safer and more attractive for people using public transport, walking and cycling.\nTfL is providing a fund of £50 million available to boroughs over the next three years to deliver significant safety improvements in their local area by reducing speeds and tackling the city’s most dangerous roads and junctions. The fund will be open to projects between £0.5 million and £5 million. Examples of schemes TfL will consider funding through Borough Safer Streets include:\n- Projects that look to improve safety by reducing speeding and help to reduce the risk and severity of collisions\n- Projects that develop improvements to protect vulnerable road users and improve safety for people walking and cycling\n- Road safety improvements in high-risk locations\nTfL is also providing £30 million in funding to a new programme called Better Bus Partnerships, which will make up to £10 million available for three successful boroughs to deliver transformational bus infrastructure and operational improvements. This includes new bus priority measures to improve journey times, better management of road works to reduce delays to buses, improvements to stops and stations to make it easier to change between buses and other modes of transport, and improvements to streets to make it easier to walk to bus stops and stations.\nMore than a billion Hopper journeys made on TfL\nMore than a billion Hopper journeys have made on a bus or tram since the scheme was introduced in September 2016.\nFigures show how effective Hopper fares have been since their introduction, reaching a total 1,005,000 hopper fare journeys.\nElly Baker, London Assembly Labour spokesperson for transport, has said the figures demonstrate the success of the scheme, saving Londoners £1.75 each time they do not have to pay a second bus fare.\nIn the last year, Londoners’ savings equate to more than £300 million over 176 million journeys.\nHopper fares allow passengers unlimited free transfers between buses and trams if they touch on within an hour. The scheme was introduced by London Mayor Sadiq Khan so those who change buses to get to their destination are not charged more than those with a direct route.\nTransport for London has maintained over 100 million journeys a year every full year since its introduction except for 20/21, when it fell to 80 million journeys due to the pandemic.\nAs well as the Hopper fare, the Mayor of London has frozen fares on TfL to save Londoners money and has piloted “off-peak Fridays”, in which all journeys on a Friday are charged at an off-peak rate.\nTaylor Swift’s record-breaking The Eras Tour to generate £300m for the capital’s economy – as London confirms status as the world-leader for music\n- London is hosting more performances of Taylor Swift’s record-breaking The Eras Tour than any other city in the world, with nearly 700,000 people attending\n- Tourists attending the London gigs are set to boost the capital’s economy by £300m\n- New poll shows more people would consider travelling to London for a music event than other international or UK cities\n- Capital celebrates Taylor’s first performance at Wembley Stadium on Friday night with murals, a special Tube map, a Taylor trail and a wide series of events across London’s fantastic venues\nAcross London there are a huge range of special events and celebrations to mark the performances:\n- Wembley Park is hosting two new public artworks, including a giant mural on the Spanish Steps, which are being temporarily renamed the ‘Swiftie Steps’. The steps, which connect Wembley Stadium and the OVO Arena Wembley, will feature ‘Auras’ by Frank Styles which is compiled digitally from over 30 separate physical paintings. Below the steps will be the ‘…Ready For It’ mural by MurWalls & HUMOR which features a portrait with lyrics interwoven across the installation.\n- Transport for London (TfL) has reimagined the Tube map in her honour with an exclusive pull-out in Friday’s Evening Standard. London (Taylor’s version) sees each line named after a different album and drawn in sequin colours to match, with stations named after songs, and gemstones to reflect key locations with links to Taylor that fans can visit.\n- A Taylor trail (#LDNTaylorsVersion) launched on Friday will celebrate places across the capital that are referenced in her music, with venues displaying new vinyl stickers in their windows to welcome Swifties and share other locations of interest. They include the West End, Soho, Bond Street, Camden Market, Highgate, Hampstead Heath, Vauxhall, Shoreditch, Hackney, Brixton and Kentish Town. The trail will be available on the Visit London website and through QR codes at participating venues from Friday.\n- Visit London, the official visitor guide to London, has created an online guide for Swifties to make the most of London, including brunches, singalongs and quizzes that are taking place across the capital’s venues.\nBrent benefits from new VRU funding from the Mayor giving young people positive and meaningful opportunities to succeed\nMayor announces record additional £14.5m investment in Violence Reduction Unit’s flagship approach to tackle violence in key hotspots\n· Sadiq to fund expansion of VRU’s community-led MyEnds programme from eight areas to 11 to deliver youth work and preventative activities\n· Remaining 21 areas to receive an allocation for borough-led activity\n· Funding boost will mean hyper-local approach to tackling violence will for the first time operate in all 32 London boroughs\n· Evidence shows backing communities and a neighbourhood approach is crucial in tackling violence and providing positive opportunities for young people\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has today announced he is investing a further record £14.5 million in a major expansion of his Violence Reduction Unit’s (VRU) flagship prevention programme to tackle violence. New funding will be used to expand the VRU’s MyEnds programme and its neighbourhood-focused approach to every borough in London, for the first time ever.\nThe Mayor’s increased investment will ensure the successful programme continues and expands into a community-led approach in 11 of the top neighbourhoods affected by violence. From next month, groups of local youth leaders, grassroots organisations, young people, and parents and carers, will begin delivering youth work, positive activities and targeted interventions, to support young people and to drive down and prevent violence.\nFor the first time, and delivering on a manifesto commitment, this hyper-local approach will be carried into all boroughs in London, learning the lessons from the award winning MyEnds and its community-led, neighbourhood-focused approach. Funding will go to the remaining 21 areas of London that are without MyEnds community-led groups. It means boroughs starved of investment due to Government cuts can form partnerships with small community organisations to put a real focus on tackling violence at a hyper-local, neighbourhood level, working alongside local people and communities to deliver prevention and diversionary work in areas they live and know best.\nThe VRU’s successful award-winning MyEnds programme brings networks of local people together to deliver meaningful change. Evidence shows that a community-led approach, by those who know their area and its challenges best, is the most effective way to prevent violence. MyEnds provides communities with the tools and resources to deliver their own prevention measures, including support networks for parents and carers, after-school activities, youth work in neighbourhoods and youth clubs, as well as sport, music, arts and drama activities.\nOver the next two years, targeted investment from City Hall will support local MyEnds groups to tackle violence through prevention in neighbourhoods and estates in Barking and Dagenham, Brent, Croydon, Haringey, Islington, Lambeth, Lewisham, Southwark and Tower Hamlets. Funding will also help two existing consortiums, in Newham and Hackney, to continue their community-led approach. Every other borough will receive a share of a £6.7m funding pot for their own local preventative activities.\nToday’s funding announcement builds on the work of the MyEnds programme which has operated in eight neighbourhoods over the last three years. Since it was set up in April 2021, MyEnds has:\n· Supported more than 50,000 young people and community members\n· Delivered targeted interventions and activities to more than 48,000 young people\n· Held nearly 600 community events each year\n· Provided small pots of funding for almost 70 grassroots organisations to carry out youth work and prevention measures this year alone\nThis community-led approach has contributed to tackling risk factors associated with violence and exploitation, including improved mental health and wellbeing of young people, better engagement with support services and improved behaviour and engagement in education.\nSince the Mayor set up the VRU, the first of its kind in the country, in 2019, it has invested in 350,000 interventions, opportunities and diversionary activities for young people most affected by violence.\nAlongside the MyEnds community-led approach, this includes support for families, work to keep young people in education, and funding youth work in schools, neighbourhoods and youth clubs, in sport, in hospitals and police custody suites.\nToday, the Mayor joined VRU Director Lib Peck in visiting a new MyEnds consortium partner in Brent, which is working to tackle violence across three estates through detached youth work, school-based interventions and parental support.\nKrupesh Hirani pledges to make Brent and Harrow safer, fairer and better-connected following victory in London Assembly elections\nKrupesh Hirani has promised to help make Brent fairer, safer and better connected following being elected as London Assembly Member for Brent and Harrow.\nLast week’s elections to the London Assembly saw Mr Hirani elected to represent the boroughs of Brent and Harrow, alongside Mayor Sadiq Khan, who was elected for a historic third term.\nHe has thanked voters for putting their faith in him and promised to push for investment in northwest London so it gets its fair share of the investments promised by Mayor Khan, including:\n- Employing 1,300 more police officers\n- Building 40,000 council homes by the end of the decade\n- Ending rough sleeping by 2030\n- Introducing baby banks to provide essentials to families who cannot afford them\n- Investing in youth clubs to create 250,000 new opportunities for young people – steering them away from gangs and crime\nIn Assembly Member Hirani’s last term in office, he successfully advocated for the Superloop to connect Harrow, Kenton and Kingsbury, along with supporting the introduction of free school meals for primary-school children across London. The scheme ensured no child is going hungry in the classroom and saves parents up to £1,000 per child over two years.\nMr Hirani has successfully campaigned for numerous improvements to community safety in Brent, seeing an uplift in police numbers by three police constables and four police community support officers dedicated to the Kilburn area as a result of his campaigning for a greater police presence in the neighbourhood.\nHe has promised to continue to campaign on combatting hate crime – including Hinduphobia, which is currently not given the recognition that statistics suggest that it should be given. Home Office figures show Hinduphobia and anti-Hindu hate crimes are increasing across England and Wales. He will continue to work with police and community leaders to help prevent London’s Hindu community from being subject to a recognised hate crime.\nHe will also continue campaigning to tackle London’s housing crisis, supporting the Mayor’s plans to build 40,000 new council homes. Councils in London currently spend £90 million each month on temporary accommodation to house, for example, those leaving violent relationships or who have been made homeless. Mr Hirani has supported greater provision of council housing to save the public money, take pressure off of the private rented sector and, crucially, keep people off the streets.\nKrupesh Hirani AM, London Assembly Member for Brent and Harrow, said:\n“Under Mayor Sadiq Khan, City Hall has done a great job of protecting London from the damage the government has done to the rest of the country.\n“City Hall has stepped up to help Londoners through the cost-of-living crisis by providing, for the first time ever, free school meals to all state primary children. On top of this, mayoral funding has made sure that the Metropolitan Police have the resources they need to properly support our communities and keep Londoners safe.\n“Thank you to voters for putting their confidence in me. I will be the champion for Brent and Harrow at City Hall. The Mayor’s plans will make London fairer, safer and better connected over the next four years – and our area must be a part of that.”\nMayor of London makes call to Londoners as world-leading Friday off-peak fares trial begins: Let’s Do Fridays\n- The Mayor encourages Londoners back into the city as groundbreaking three-month off-peak Fridays trial launches\n- Starting today, pay as you go with contactless and Oyster fares on Tube and rail across London and parts of the Southeast will be off-peak all day on Fridays\n- Restaurants, museums, landmark attractions and theatres announce exciting offers to encourage Londoners to make the most of the city’s great offering – with more expected over the coming weeks\n- Trial will also benefit 60+ and Freedom Pass holders who will be able to use their passes all day on Fridays\nThe Mayor of London has today announced that the pioneering three-month trial of Off-peak travel on Fridays is live, as he makes the call to Londoners: “Let’s do Fridays”. From today, Tube and rail fares on pay as you go with contactless and Oyster will be off-peak all day on Fridays until the end of May.\nThe trial follows the announcement that the Mayor has again frozen TfL fares until March 2025, which is providing more support to Londoners struggling with the cost of living, and aiding London’s recovery from the pandemic.\nLondon & Partners, London’s business growth and destination agency, has created a new webpage – https://www.visitlondon.com/fridays – where Londoners can see a range of exciting offers from restaurants, museums, theatres and landmark attractions available on Fridays during the trial, to encourage Londoners back into the city. More exclusive offers will be announced as the trial progresses, with different offers each Friday of the trial.\nExamples of these Friday offers include:\n· 20% off your bill at Gaucho restaurants on Fridays (until 31 March)\n· Off-peak Friday prices to see hit musical Wicked\n· Half-price tickets on Fridays for ‘‘Turn It Up’ exhibition at the Science Museum\nTfL and London & Partners have also been working with local businesses across London and key stakeholders to help promote a range of activities to further encourage people to make the most of their Fridays.\nPeak pay as you go fares ordinarily apply between 06:30 and 09:30 and between 16:00 and 19:00 on both TfL and National Rail services. Making pay as you go journeys on Fridays off-peak all day will make it cheaper for people to travel throughout the day. This could potentially support economic growth by encouraging more people back onto public transport and into the office, and the city, on a day that is currently quieter than other weekdays.\nTfL and the Train companies have agreed to the trial, making all pay as you go journeys made using contactless and Oyster (with the exception of journeys to/from Heathrow airport via Zone 1) off-peak on Fridays. The daily cap will also be amended during the trial to cap at an off-peak rate on Friday, helping those who make multiple journeys through the day save even more. Bus and Tram fares across London will not change during the trial as they are set at a flat rate of £1.75 regardless of the time of travel.\nThe trial will also see 60+ London Oyster photocard and Older Persons’ Freedom Passes allowed to be used on TfL and National Rail services before 9am, helping Londoners with these passes to travel for free all day on Fridays.\nTo fund the trial, £24m has been allocated from the Mayor of London’s recently approved budget, which will be used to compensate TfL and rail operators for lower fares revenue during the trial and cover the costs for running it.\nOff-peak Friday fares could give a much-needed boost to London’s businesses and commuters as the cost-of-living continues to bite. As an example, someone commuting in from Romford (Zone 6) into Bond Street (Zone 1) would have paid £5.60 for travelling on the Elizabeth line during peak hours. Under the trial, this fare will be reduced to £3.60 – saving £2. Someone commuting from Morden (Zone 4) to Vauxhall (Zone 2) in peak hours would have paid £2.80 for the trip. This fare will now be reduced down to £1.90 – saving 90p. On National Rail, someone commuting using pay as you go with contactless from St Albans City to London Blackfriars would pay £12.90 midweek, but will pay £9.50 on Fridays during the trial – saving £3.40. These savings will be doubled if the return journey is also made during evening peak hours.\nThe Mayor hopes that having off-peak fares on Fridays could help encourage more people into the city to make the most of London’s offering of bars, restaurants, live music venues and theatres.\n89,018 children to now breathing clean air at school thanks to London’s Ultra-Low Emissions Zone\nAlmost 90,000 children across London will now be breathing clean air on the playground thanks to the new Ultra-Low Emission Zone (ULEZ), new data shows.\nThe expansion of the ULEZ means that the air surrounding 144 schools with a total of more than 89,000 students will meet the World Health Organisation (WHO) target for the amount nitrogen dioxide particles.\nULEZ is taking the most polluting vehicles off the streets, bringing cleaner air to five million more people and is also expected to reduce carbon emissions in outer London by a further 27,000 tonnes.\nSince 29 August, all of Greater London has become covered by the scheme. This expansion will result in 144 schools with a combined total of 89,018 students facing a drop in their exposure to nitrogen dioxide so substantial the air will reach the standards advised by the WHO.\nToxic air is leading to children growing up with stunted lungs and an increased risk of asthma, with older Londoners facing greater risk of cancer and dementia. These factors contribute to around 4,000 premature deaths every year in London.\nTo help transition to the new scheme, all Londoners with non-compliant vehicles can now get £2,000 for scrapping a car or £1,000 for scrapping a motorcycle. Small businesses and charities can now receive increased grant payments of between £6,000 and £11,500. Eligible charities, businesses and sole traders can now apply for up to three vans or minibuses to be scrapped or retrofitted in total. And the payment for wheelchair accessible vehicles has increased from £5,000 to £10,000, with grants of £6,000 available to retrofit a van to ULEZ standards.\nA number of mitigations have also been made for different groups, including exemptions for disabled people and wheelchair accessible vehicles until October 2027 – and new six-month grace periods also recognise that small businesses and charities are doing the right thing and adapting to the ULEZ but may face a delay with receiving their new vehicle or retrofit appointment.\nThe total amount the Mayor has invested in the scrappage scheme for the ULEZ expansion is £160m, the most generous scrappage scheme in the UK which has been funded without any support from central Government.\nThe ULEZ has already proven to be transformational in inner London, where it has cut harmful nitrogen dioxide by nearly half in central London and by a fifth in inner London, helping to reduce the number of air pollution-related asthma admissions for children by a third, and saving 800,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions since 2019 (the equivalent of 1.1 million flights from London to New York).\nAny net revenue raised through the ULEZ will be reinvested back into public transport, including on the expansion of bus services in outer London. The ULEZ is expected not to raise any net revenue by the 2026/2027 financial year as the percentage of compliant vehicles continues to rise.\nEvery child has the right to clean air when they’re travelling to school, learning in the classroom or having fun on the playground. For too long they have been exposed to higher risks of stunted lung growth and chronic illnesses, such as asthma, lung and heart disease.\nThe ULEZ expansion means almost 90,000 of London’s children will no longer have to breathe poisonous air during their school days.",

New funding will be used to expand the VRU’s MyEnds programme and its neighbourhood-focused approach to every borough in London, for the first time ever.\nThe Mayor’s increased investment will ensure the successful programme continues and expands into a community-led approach in 11 of the top neighbourhoods affected by violence. From next month, groups of local youth leaders, grassroots organisations, young people, and parents and carers, will begin delivering youth work, positive activities and targeted interventions, to support young people and to drive down and prevent violence.\nFor the first time, and delivering on a manifesto commitment, this hyper-local approach will be carried into all boroughs in London, learning the lessons from the award winning MyEnds and its community-led, neighbourhood-focused approach. Funding will go to the remaining 21 areas of London that are without MyEnds community-led groups. It means boroughs starved of investment due to Government cuts can form partnerships with small community organisations to put a real focus on tackling violence at a hyper-local, neighbourhood level, working alongside local people and communities to deliver prevention and diversionary work in areas they live and know best.\nThe VRU’s successful award-winning MyEnds programme brings networks of local people together to deliver meaningful change. Evidence shows that a community-led approach, by those who know their area and its challenges best, is the most effective way to prevent violence. MyEnds provides communities with the tools and resources to deliver their own prevention measures, including support networks for parents and carers, after-school activities, youth work in neighbourhoods and youth clubs, as well as sport, music, arts and drama activities.\nOver the next two years, targeted investment from City Hall will support local MyEnds groups to tackle violence through prevention in neighbourhoods and estates in Barking and Dagenham, Brent, Croydon, Haringey, Islington, Lambeth, Lewisham, Southwark and Tower Hamlets. Funding will also help two existing consortiums, in Newham and Hackney, to continue their community-led approach. Every other borough will receive a share of a £6.7m funding pot for their own local preventative activities.\nToday’s funding announcement builds on the work of the MyEnds programme which has operated in eight neighbourhoods over the last three years. Since it was set up in April 2021, MyEnds has:\n· Supported more than 50,000 young people and community members\n· Delivered targeted interventions and activities to more than 48,000 young people\n· Held nearly 600 community events each year\n· Provided small pots of funding for almost 70 grassroots organisations to carry out youth work and prevention measures this year alone\nThis community-led approach has contributed to tackling risk factors associated with violence and exploitation, including improved mental health and wellbeing of young people, better engagement with support services and improved behaviour and engagement in education.\nSince the Mayor set up the VRU, the first of its kind in the country, in 2019, it has invested in 350,000 interventions, opportunities and diversionary activities for young people most affected by violence.\nAlongside the MyEnds community-led approach, this includes support for families, work to keep young people in education, and funding youth work in schools, neighbourhoods and youth clubs, in sport, in hospitals and police custody suites.\nToday, the Mayor joined VRU Director Lib Peck in visiting a new MyEnds consortium partner in Brent, which is working to tackle violence across three estates through detached youth work, school-based interventions and parental support.",

For example, the Hub signposts disabled Londoners to disability benefits, older Londoners to Pension Credit, which is not taken up by nearly 100,000 eligible older Londoners, and low-income families to childcare entitlements.\nWith inflation set to hit at least 8 per cent and energy costs rising by 54 per cent this April, more Londoners face an impossible choice between heating their homes and paying for other basic essentials like food.\nSome Londoners are already experiencing the impact of being moved off fixed tariffs and onto variable rates as a result of energy supplier failure. Adding a further overnight average increase of £693 will be incredibly difficult for many in the capital to deal with.\nPolling earlier this year showed that 34 per cent of Londoners have struggled to pay their household bills in the previous six months. The Survey of Londoners also showed that fuel poverty disproportionally affects Black Londoners, single parents, social renters and disabled Londoners.\nThe knock-on effects of increased energy bills coupled with benefits not rising in line with inflation will risk more Londoners being plunged into poverty. The cost of living in London was already a challenge before the pandemic with prices seven per cent higher than the UK average, housing costs taking up a higher proportion of income and average weekly pay 5.9 per cent lower than in 2010 when accounting for inflation. This was in stark contrast to a 0.9 per cent fall of 0.9 across the UK.\nIn February, City Hall provided £200,000 to extend Debt Free London’s helpline for Londoners struggling with debt to become a 24-hour service until May. The free confidential and impartial advice helps Londoners with a range of problem debts, including rent arrears, council tax arrears, utility bills, credit card debt, and loan repayments.",

  "https_krupesh_co_uk_/https_krupesh_co_uk_fines-for-red-route-contraventions-in-london-set-to-increase/content_135.html": "|\nTransport for London (TfL) is moving forward with plans to increase the level of the penalty charge for road contraventions on double red lines from £130 to £160. The changes will come into effect from 17th January 2022 following a public consultation held between 5th August and 19th September 2021. Penalty charge notices (PCNs) are issued to the small number of drivers who fail to follow the rules on London’s network of red routes, putting the safety of themselves and other road users at risk and causing disruption and delays on some of the capital’s busiest and most important roads. The penalty charge will still be reduced by 50 per cent if paid within 14 days and increased by 50 per cent if paid after 28 days. Overall, there has been a 26 per cent increase in the number of PCNs issued for parking, loading, bus lane and moving traffic offences between 2016 and 2019. The penalty charge level increase is being introduced to deter contraventions of the road rules and support TfL’s Vision Zero aims to reduce road danger, improve public transport reliability and increase active travel. London’s red routes are roads managed by TfL. They make up five per cent of roads but carry 30 per cent of the capital’s traffic. Red routes exist to allow traffic to move safely and efficiently along some of the busiest roads in London. Stopping is generally prohibited on these roads, outside of designated locations and times clearly marked by signs. Failing to follow the rules and signs at junctions creates safety risks, disrupts traffic and creates congestion for everyone. Vital deliveries can be obstructed and buses and the emergency services can be delayed. Increasing the level of the penalty charge is about improving compliance, not penalising drivers. It should deter motorists from contravening essential rules and safety restrictions. PCNs are an important way of encouraging road users to follow the rules of the road and are only issued to the small number of drivers who contravene these rules. PCNs can be issued for contraventions such as:\nThe cost of a PCN for contraventions on the red route network has not increased for more than ten years. The last increase was in April 2011 when it rose from £120 to £130. TfL’s increase to £160 is in line with inflation since the last increase. The increase will also bring the charges in line with the penalties for non-payment of the Congestion Charge and the Ultra-Low Emission Zone, which are also currently set at £160. Any revenue raised through these penalty notices is invested back into London’s transport network, which includes investing in its road network to improve safety for all road users. |",

Assembly Member Shah has publicly endorsed Cllr Hirani’s candidacy, backing Brent’s Cabinet Member for Health, Culture & Leisure to replace him at next year’s election.\nBorn, raised and educated in Brent, Krupesh has represented Dudden Hill ward since 2010, and has served as the Lead Member for Health since 2012. He previously worked for the Harrow-based spinal injury charity, Aspire, before joining the MS Society as their Regional Officer for London in 2015.\nOutlining his priorities for Brent and Harrow, Cllr Hirani has highlighted the need to protect police numbers, improve the accessibility of public transport and lead the fight against cuts to local health services. Other commitments include the introduction of a Young People’s working group to facilitate better youth engagement across the two boroughs to bring issues forward to the Mayor, as well as improving air quality in some of the area’s most polluted neighbourhoods.\nEndorsers of Cllr Hirani’s campaign include MPs Dawn Butler (Brent Central) and Gareth Thomas (Harrow West), as well as the leaders of both Brent and Harrow councils, Cllr Muhammed Butt and Cllr Graham Henson. He is also backed by the GMB trade union.\nAnnouncing his intention to stand, Cllr Hirani said:\n“I’m standing to be Labour’s candidate because I believe Brent and Harrow deserve a representative who really understands the challenges facing our communities. Our area has seen enormous change over the past decade, and I am committed to giving local residents a strong voice in City Hall – a voice that will fight to protect the things we all care about.\n“Over the past decade, we have seen huge changes across Brent and Harrow that have helped to unlock new opportunities. I want to make sure that everyone is able to take advantage of those opportunities, and am committed to working closely with residents from every corner of Brent and Harrow to help our communities realise their full potential.\n“It would be an honour to serve the people of Brent and Harrow, and an opportunity to give back to a community that has given me so much.”\nGareth Thomas, Member of Parliament for Harrow West, said:\n“Krupesh is well-known across communities in both Harrow and Brent. He is the ideal candidate to represent Labour at the London elections and I am proud to support him as our candidate for 2020.”\nDawn Butler, Member of Parliament for Brent Central, said:\n“Krupesh works tirelessly for Brent and as his MP I am always confident when I refer people and issues to him that he will deliver.”\nBarry Gardiner, Member of Parliament for Brent North, said:\n“Krupesh represents the future of the Labour Party. I believe he has the vision and commitment to represent diverse boroughs like Brent and Harrow. He has a record of delivery and is 100% committed to the area he is proud to call home.”\nNavin Shah, London Assembly Member for Brent and Harrow said:\n“I first met Krupesh as a community activist in Harrow rather than through the Labour Party.

The central London ULEZ had a clear impact – in its first 10 months of operation, it helped reduce road transport nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions by 35 per cent and CO2 emissions by 6 percent in the zone. Today’s landmark report shows that the ULEZ expansion has built on these benefits, with harmful nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels 46 per cent lower in central London and 21 per cent lower in inner London than they would have been without the scheme. Thanks to the expansion of the ULEZ in inner London, NOx emissions have reduced by 23 per cent (13,500 tonnes) across London cumulatively since 2019 compared with what they would have been without the ULEZ. Within the existing ULEZ area, emissions have dropped by 26 per cent (5,000 tonnes) over the same four-year period, compared with what they would have been.\nThe number of older, more polluting vehicles in the zone has also continued to reduce significantly, dropping by 60 per cent since the inner London expansion came into operation in October 2021– an average reduction of 74,000 polluting vehicles every day seen driving in the zone. Overall, there were nearly 50,000 fewer vehicles seen in the zone on an average day – a reduction of almost five per cent compared to the month prior to the expansion.\nThe Mayor announced last November that the ULEZ will be expanded across all London boroughs in August 2023 to help bring the air quality and associated health benefits to the five million people living in outer London.\nToday’s new report shows how vital further action is as average pollution concentrations at background monitoring sites in outer London have remained constant since 2021, with over half of deaths attributable to air pollution in outer London. The whole of London still exceeds the World Health Organization’s guidelines for air quality and there is no safe level of exposure.\nOther key findings in the report include –\n- Harmful nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations are revealed to have reduced further than originally predicted, and are estimated to be 21 per cent lower in inner London and 46 per cent lower in central London than they would have been without the ULEZ. This is a reduction of 34 µgm-3 in central London and 8 µgm-3 in inner London, compared to the modelled scenario for the same month without ULEZ.\n- Crucially, NO2 levels have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, indicating that even as traffic levels have risen, cleaner vehicles have had such positive impacts on emissions that air pollution levels continue to be far below what they would have been without the ULEZ and other policies that the Mayor has implemented.\n- The boundary roads have seen a reduction in NO2 concentrations of between 19 per cent and 27 per cent compared to without the ULEZ\n- Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels have also continued to reduce across London with a 41 per cent reduction in average concentrations in central and inner London since 2017.\n- Alongside the air quality benefits, the ULEZ has also had carbon reduction benefits. Cumulatively since 2019 it is estimated the ULEZ has led to a reduction of around 800,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions from vehicles across London over the four-year period compared to without the ULEZ, a saving of three per cent. Within the ULEZ area this is a saving of 290,000 tonnes, a reduction of four per cent over the same period. The reduction in emissions is a vital step closer to achieving the Mayor’s aim of reaching Net Zero by 2030.\n- The ULEZ has had an enormous positive effect on the share of compliant vehicles seen driving in the zone, jumping from just 39 per cent when the scheme was announced in 2017, to 94.4 per cent in October 2022.\nThe Mayor has launched a further scrappage scheme worth £110m to support businesses, charities, Londoners on lower incomes and disabled Londoners to replace their old, heavily polluting vehicles with greener options. This is on top of the £61m scrappage scheme launched in 2019.\nLondoners receiving certain means-tested benefits and non-means-tested disability benefits can now apply for cash grants of up to £2,000 to scrap their non-compliant cars or motorcycles. Alternatively, for the first time ever, applicants can also choose to receive up to two bus and tram passes, instead of a grant to scrap or retrofit their vehicle. Charities, sole traders and businesses with 10 or fewer employees can also apply to scrap or retrofit their vans and minibuses, with an option to receive up to £9,500 to help cover the cost of a replacement vehicle.\nAbout the report\n- This report is an evaluation of the impacts of the ULEZ and the LEZ schemes, focusing on one year following the ULEZ expansion to inner London and for the LEZ, over a year and a half on from the enforcement of tighter LEZ standards for buses, coaches and lorries. The report, including the methodology for assessing impacts on air pollutant concentrations, underwent independent peer review.\n- Emissions are the amount of pollution directly emitted from a particular source, e.g vehicles. Concentration is the amount of pollution in the air at a certain location. Improving health by reducing air pollution concentrations is a key aim of expanding the ULEZ. The policy does this by disincentivising the use of older, more polluting vehicles within the zone which in turn reduces the emissions of pollutants in the area. This leads to a reduction in pollution concentration within the zone. As most vehicles do not drive solely within the zone this positive impact will also benefit those outside the zone.\nThe ‘central London zone’ constitutes the Congestion Charge area and ‘inner London zone’ extends to the North and South Circulars.\nRead the report here",

Sadiq would become the first Mayor of London to issue green bonds in this way and at this level – raising funds for new and existing projects which deliver environmental benefits, and a more sustainable economy.\nSadiq’s plans will accelerate London’s push to net-zero by helping to tackle rising energy bills and the climate emergency. The Mayor is committing a record £90 million of GLA funds to support the ambition, with £4 million to develop high-impact green investment opportunities for the public and private sector; and £86 million to support a substantial GLA Green Bond programme, financing direct decarbonisation investment by the GLA Group and its strategic partners as part of the Mayor’s Green Financing Facility.\nThis investment will support projects making social housing and public buildings energy efficient, as well as clean, local energy projects providing solar PV, heat pumps and district heating across London. By leading the way and committing an initial £90 million the Mayor will help unlock over £500 million to finance such low-carbon projects.\nImprovements to social housing will help tackle inequalities exposed and exacerbated by the pandemic and the cost of living crisis. London has some of the highest levels of fuel poverty in the country with one in nine* London households unable to meet the cost of heating their homes. Low-carbon heat projects help reduce energy bills and improve living conditions for thousands of Londoners. They will also support Londoners with the skills they need for jobs in the green economy, rebuilding the capital post-COVID so that it’s cleaner, greener and fairer.\nThe Mayor’s proposals are estimated to support more than one million tonnes of carbon savings over the lifetime of the projects and lower energy use by 328,638 MWh a year, the equivalent to the energy used by nearly 85,000 homes in a year, while supporting jobs in London.\nLondon continues to be a world leader in green finance, this new funding builds on the £30 million he committed to the Mayor’s Energy Efficiency Fund at COP26 in Glasgow which is expected to leverage up to £150 million of investment into London projects. This latest announcement shows a clear acceleration of efforts to achieve his net-zero ambitions, building on his Net Zero pathway report launched in January.\nThe Mayor has announced this record new funding ahead of publishing his final Budget for the Greater London Authority (GLA) Group for 2022-23 on Wednesday. The final Budget takes into account that council tax and business rates returns from local authorities are higher than were forecast in the Mayor’s consultation Budget proposals last year.",

The number of Londoners contacting the service has more than tripled over the last year and the Mayor, Sadiq Khan, has now pledged £200,000 in support to ensure it can meet rising demand. Mr Hirani is expressing concerns that with rising energy bills, food costs and rents that Harrow’s 65,187 Universal Credit claimants “will be placed at the sharp end” of a growing debt crisis in the capital.\nRecent YouGov polling has revealed that over a third of Londoners have found it difficult to keep on top of their household bills in the last six months.\nCity Hall expects that the Government’s changes to taxes and benefits could plunge another 130,000 Londoners below the breadline, bringing the total number living in poverty in the capital to 3.7 million.\nMr Hirani has also criticised the Government for forcing council tax rises after it has failed to adequately fund the police, fire brigade, adult social care, transport and other public services in the capital.\nRecent increases in energy bills have also pushed an estimated 75,000 Londoners into fuel poverty.\nThe latest figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) show that in 2019, 33,336 households in Harrow were living in fuel poverty.\nThis week, The Trussell Trust revealed that nearly half of people referred to food banks in their networks are in debt to the Department of Work and Pensions due to the benefits system.\nAt the latest Plenary meeting at City Hall, the London Assembly passed motions calling for the weekly £20 Universal Credit uplift to be reinstated, the removal of the benefit cap, an increase in the National Living Wage and for the Government to reconsider its planned hike to National Insurance.\nLocal London Assembly Member, Krupesh Hirani AM, said:\n“So many in our community are facing a perfect storm of a surge in the costs of essentials, rents and household bills, stagnating wages, the upcoming increase in National Insurance and a welfare system that is not fit for purpose.\n“On a national level, we just haven’t seen the leadership needed to help households and families on the lowest incomes navigate this cost of living crisis. Thousands in our borough, especially those on Universal Credit, will be at the sharp end of this.\n“The Government’s failure to fund vital public services, our police, firefighters and our transport network means that the costs of these are being passed onto hard-pressed Londoners through council tax rises.\n“The cold, hard reality is that without urgent and robust Government action, thousands more in our borough are going to be plunged into debt.\n“For those struggling, there is help and advice at hand and I would encourage them to reach out to Debt Free London’s helpline which is being supported by the Mayor”.\nCall 0800 808 5700 for support",

Each successful applicant will receive up to £8,000 over two years with an opportunity to extend their project for another year and receive an additional £2,000. Walking and Cycling Grants London (WCGL) aims to enable more people to walk and cycle, addressing the barriers that prevent people from getting active and helping to make London a more sustainable, inclusive, and healthy city. All projects give participants the chance to connect with their local communities, learn new skills, get active and improve their physical and mental health. Funded by TfL in partnership with The London Marathon Foundation, and administered by Groundwork London, the programme offers two types of grants for applicants. Walking and Cycling Grants can provide successful candidates with up to £8,000 over two years with an opportunity to extend their project for a further year with an extra £2,000. Applicants will be considered on the potential of their idea to benefit the local community and boost walking and cycling levels, particularly among communities who do not tend to walk or cycle. Applications for Community Ideas Grants are also open to help kickstart smaller projects across London that are based on previous successes in other communities. Potential applicants to the scheme will be able to browse successful former projects on the Community Ideas Hub, and then apply for funding of £5,000 for a single year to replicate these in their local community. Applicants for both types of grant will be given help and support throughout the application process and further support will be given to successful groups during delivery of their projects. Applications for both grants can be accessed at wcgl.london and the application window for both programmes is open until 17:00 on 9 September 2024. Successful applicants are set to be announced in November 2024. Applicants can visit wcgl.london to find out more about the programme or contact [email protected].",

These upgrades are essential to ensure the line is ready for the first new Piccadilly line trains which will arrive in London later this year for testing, and then be introduced as a fleet of 94 new trains from 2025. The new trains are part of a £2.9bn investment to modernise the line, to help it run more reliably, safely, inclusively and sustainably. The scale of the upgrade, which will take place on one of London’s deepest Tube lines with some of the oldest track and signaling infrastructure, means that a series of closures is required. The longest of these is a 16-day planned part closure of the Piccadilly line (Wood Green to Cockfosters and Rayners Lane to Uxbridge) between Saturday 17 August and Sunday 1 September, with a reduced service expected on other parts of the Piccadilly line due to the unavailability of trains. Rail replacement buses will serve all stations between Wood Green and Cockfosters although customers travelling to central London may find it quicker to use local bus services to connect to nearby alternative Tube and rail stations. Customers who use Piccadilly line services to Uxbridge are advised to change at Rayners Lane for the Metropolitan line. For all of these part closures, Piccadilly line customers are advised to plan ahead by using TfL’s real-time travel information tools including TfL Journey Planner and TfL Go, to check before travelling and to allow more time for their journeys. A dedicated travel advice webpage, which also lists the upcoming, confirmed weekend closures on the Piccadilly line so customers can plan ahead, is available on TfL’s website, here: https://tfl.gov.uk/status-updates/major-works-and-events/piccadilly-line-upgrade",

This is equivalent to removing 200,000 cars from the road for one year.\n- Overall, NO2 concentrations in outer London are estimated to be 21 per cent lower than without the ULEZ and its expansions.\n- 96 per cent of vehicles seen driving in London as a whole are now compliant, with a 53 per cent reduction in non-compliant vehicles in only six months.\nNew data from City Hall has revealed the expansion of the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) across the whole capital last August is working – driving down emissions and bringing cleaner air to millions more Londoners.\nIn London, around 4,000 premature deaths are attributed to toxic air each year as well as increased risks of asthma and cancer and emerging evidence of links between air pollution and dementia.\nThe ULEZ is the centrepiece of a range of measures the Mayor is implementing to tackle London’s toxic air, including putting a record number of zero-emission buses on the roads. These additional measures are making a difference, but all the evidence shows that clean air zones like the ULEZ are the most effective tool available to quickly and meaningfully cut air pollution in big cities.\nToday’s report, which covers the first six months of the expansion across all London boroughs, shows that pollutant emissions in 2023 with the London-wide ULEZ expansion in place are dramatically lower, compared to a scenario without it:\n- Within the outer London ULEZ area, NOx emissions from cars and vans are estimated to be 13 per cent and seven per cent lower than a scenario without the expansion. This is equivalent to removing 200,000 cars from the road for one year.\n- PM2.5 exhaust emissions from cars in outer London are estimated to be 22 per cent lower than without the expansion (six per cent more than expected).\n- Across all measures, these impacts are aligned with, and in many cases greater than, what TfL estimated in the consultation for the outer London expansion.\nNOX emissions savings in outer London now represent over 90 per cent of the total emission reductions seen in London as a result of the London-wide expansion.\nThe report also shows that, compared to what roadside NO2 concentrations are estimated to have been in different parts of London without the ULEZ and its expansions:\n- Levels in Outer London are estimated to be 21 per cent lower\n- Levels in Central London are estimated to be 53 per cent lower\n- Levels in Inner London are estimated to be 24 per cent lower\nThe report shows that London’s air quality at the roadside is continuing to improve at a faster rate than the average for the rest of England. In 2014, the gap in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels between London and the rest of England was 20 µg/m3, whereas now it is less than 5 µg/m3. The expansion brought five million more Londoners into the ULEZ, and today’s report shows that outer London – which has historically had worse air quality than the rest of England average – now has levels of pollution much closer to levels in the rest of the country.\nEven in the short six-month timeframe covered by the report, roadside NO2 concentrations in outer London have dropped by up to 4.4 per cent compared to what would have been expected without the London-wide expansion of the scheme. Given the size of outer London, every percent makes a huge difference.\nCompliance levels have also increased further than expected, with 96.2 per cent of all vehicles subject to the ULEZ recorded driving in London now compliant, up from 90.9 per cent in June 2023. This has been aided by the Mayor’s £210m scrappage scheme, launched in January 2023 to support Londoners to switch to cleaner vehicles, with 53,351 applications approved so far and over 300 donated to humanitarian and medical efforts in Ukraine.\nThere are now fewer older, more polluting vehicles driving in London, with 90,000 fewer non-compliant vehicles detected on an average day in February 2024 compared to June 2023, representing a 53 per cent reduction in non-compliant vehicles in the first six months of operation.\nToday’s preliminary data reveals significant progress, with a further report expected in early 2025 which will examine the first full year of the London-wide ULEZ expansion. The one-year report will be supported by an independent advisory group of experts and provide an even more comprehensive analysis of the air quality and traffic impacts of the scheme.",

The vital support comes as Londoners face an unprecedented cost of living crisis, with Ofgem now estimating bills will increase by another 40 per cent, or £800 in October.\nThis week, the Mayor and local councils are writing to eligible households inviting them to register for the scheme, which will make grants of between £5,000 to £25,000 available to low-income households to make homes warmer, greener and cheaper to run. Warmer Homes has successfully secured match funding from energy suppliers through the Energy Company Obligation and from boroughs.\nFunding is available for low-income households living in low energy efficiency homes. Including grants available for measures like:\n- Heat pumps\n- Insulation for walls, lofts and floors\n- Heating system improvements or repairs\n- Draughtproofing\n- Solar energy installations\nWhile the Mayor welcomes the Government’s U-turn on introducing a windfall levy on energy companies – something he has called for repeatedly – he believes the Government must urgently take further action to help the most vulnerable with more money off their energy bills to pay the £800 increase; raise benefits by the actual level of record inflation as soon as possible and restore the universal credit £20 a week uplift.\nThe £43m of Warmer Homes funding comes on top of £20m delivered through the scheme since 2018, which was a mixture of Mayoral and government funding. The dramatic increase in City Hall support shows Sadiq’s clear commitment to ensuring Londoners live in warm, insulated homes, and ensuring which is crucial as energy bills rise.\nAs part of the programme, the Mayor offers a Warmer Homes Advice Service which provides fuel poverty advice and referrals. To date, it has supported over 14,700 households, across all 33 boroughs in London.\nFuel Poverty is also a major environmental health challenge in London. One in ten households in the capital are struggling to afford to pay their energy bills and heat their homes during the winter months. To help tackle this, the Mayor set up the Fuel Poverty Partnership, working together with experts across the health, social justice and environment sectors to guide London’s work on fuel poverty.\nTo find out more and apply for the Warmer Homes programme please visit: https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/improving-quality/warmer-homes",

Every London football club in the Premier League has pledged their support for the campaign.\nLaunching today (Monday 14th March), the Mayoral initiative aims to challenge the sexist attitudes and inappropriate behaviours exhibited by some men in order to tackle the epidemic of misogyny and violence against women and girls. Research by UN Women UK indicated that 71 per cent of all women have experienced some form of sexual harassment in a public space with this number rising sharply to 86 per cent among 18-24 year olds.\nDetermined to lead the way in ensuring men take greater responsibility for ending violence against women and girls, the Mayor joined Patrick Vieira, the manager of Premier League club Crystal Palace, Byron Webster, captain of Bromley Football club, and Marcus Gayle, former footballer and now Brentford coach and ambassador, at Selhurst Park to reveal details of the new initiative. The hard-hitting campaign – backed by the clubs – carries the message: “Male violence against women and girls starts with words. If you see it happening, have a word with yourself, then your mates.”\nThe campaign message will be screened on public billboards and online, with football and rugby clubs showing their support by installing graphics in their stadiums across the city.\nA campaign video will premiere at half time of the Crystal Palace vs Manchester City game at Selhurst Park tonight. It depicts a scenario all too familiar to women and girls across the country by focusing on an interaction between a group of men and a lone woman waiting for a taxi home. The video demonstrates how men’s words and actions can make women feel unsafe and calls on men not to be bystanders, but to call out their friends, whenever they see harassment happening.\nTop London football clubs, from Chelsea to Crystal Palace, Arsenal to West Ham as well as rugby giants from Harlequins to Saracens, will install the campaign message on mirrors in the men’s bathrooms in their stadiums, directing men to reflect on their own behaviour and to challenge the harmful behaviour of those around them. Nineteen football and rugby clubs will also feature an open letter from the Mayor to their fans in match day programmes, which will ask men to reflect on the way they personally view, treat and talk about women.\nCity Hall’s website will provide more information on the practical steps men can take to become allies and play a more active role in ending violence against women and girls. It will also provide guidance on how to safely challenge the potentially harmful attitudes and behaviours of other men around them.\nThis ambitious campaign is part of the Mayor’s refreshed strategy for tackling all forms of violence against women and girls (VAWG) The newly updated strategy is due to be published in the coming weeks.\nMillions of women and girls are subjected to violence and abuse every year, and data shows that the vast majority of the perpetrators are men. Between 2009 and 2019, on average, one woman was killed by a man every three days in the UK. In 2020, 99 per cent of adult offenders sentenced or cautioned for sexual offences in London were men. Nearly all perpetrators of domestic abuse during the pandemic were men.",

The lifting of the borrowing cap for local authorities will help to some degree but work with the GLA is crucial in tackling the housing crisis and more can be done to coordinate and link the GLA to Brent and Harrow. The GLA has considerable housing powers when it comes to large scale developments. I will work to bridge the gaps between communities, the GLA and Local Councils to ensure housing is built that is affordable and fit for all.\nAt the same time there is immense pressure on outer London boroughs to build more. With green spaces being so crucial to our environment, it is important that we do protect our vital green spaces. We also need to ensure that we build housing that is future proofed in terms of supporting the transport network with bike storage, shared car schemes and charge points for e-cars.\nWe all know about the lives impacted and lost by the Grenfell fire in 2017.

This includes children who have been excluded from school or college, those who are impacted by exploitation, young Londoners who are impacted by domestic violence or living in poverty, and those involved in the care system. Overall, there are roughly 100,000 young people in London who face these kinds of challenges.\nSadiq is kickstarting the action by announcing £7.2 million of investment from City Hall. The new funding will expand the mentoring offer in the capital now, helping young Londoners most in need get the help and support they deserve to reach their potential.\nThe new fund consists of £4.8 million for three programmes that will boost mentoring capacity and build on the incredible work already happening across London. It will expand mentoring for young people, including in science, technology, engineering, arts and maths, and support local organisations to provide training and work experience.\nAlongside this, the Mayor has announced today that London’s Violence Reduction Unit, which he set up in 2019, will invest £2.4m in a three-year mentoring programme. The new investment will build on the VRU’s determination to tackle school exclusions by investing in effective mentoring programmes to keep pupils in Pupil Referral Units, engaged in their education, motivated and supported to achieve their goals.\nYoung Londoners have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with a third either losing their jobs or being furloughed, compared to one in six older adults.\nFar too many young people are working in insecure jobs with many on temporary or zero-hour contracts. Many more have seen training, education and employment opportunities reduce significantly in the last 20 months, making the need for support more important than ever to prevent increasing numbers of young Londoners being left vulnerable to exploitation or getting sucked into gangs and violence.\nThroughout the pandemic, through City Hall, London Councils and London boroughs’ networks, young people and youth practitioners have championed the importance of a trusted personal relationship in transforming a young person’s life.\nResearch shows that young people will be adversely affected by the impact of COVID-19. The Resolution Foundation found that one-third of 18-24-year-old employees (excluding students) have lost jobs or been furloughed, compared to one-in-six older adults. Resolution Foundation: ‘Young workers in the coronavirus crisis’\nYoung people have been hit hard by Covid-19 and are a top priority for the Mayor, London Councils and the London Recovery Board. Young Londoners have told us about the transformational impact that mentors and role models can have on their lives.\nThe New Deal for Young People has committed that by 2024 all young people most in need of support will be entitled to a personal mentor and all young Londoners have access to quality youth activities.\nFunding for the expansion of mentoring for young people was made available from three separate programmes1 with grants ranging from £50,000 to £500,000 for groups who deliver mentoring direct or support organisations which do.\nTwo separate grants worth a total of £300,000 will also be made to support local organisations to provide employability, training and work experience opportunities for young people.\n- Leaders Programme: 7-12 grants available of between £100,000 and £500,000 who are able to expand mentoring for young people and provide support to other organisations delivering mentoring;\n- Headstart Action programme: Two grants available of up to £150,000 to support local organisations to provide employability, training and work experience opportunities for young people\n- Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Maths (STEAM) Mentoring programme: 5-12 grants of between £50,000 and £100,000 to expand quality STEAM mentoring for young people and to support STEAM employers who want to expand or introduce mentoring programmes.\nThe VRU has listened to feedback from the education sector and invested £2.4m in a London PRU Mentoring programme for a three-year period. PRUs serve pupils who have been excluded from mainstream education; a cohort of children and young people who are disproportionately vulnerable. The VRU wants to reduce the likelihood of poor life outcomes associated with being excluded by investing in effective mentoring programmes to keep pupils in PRUs engaged in their education, motivated and supported to achieve their goals.",

At this time no charges have been brought.\nA post-mortem examination was held on 28 November, 2019 at Northwick Park mortuary.\nOfficers are not releasing a cause of death for operational purposes, but can confirm the death is not thought to have been the result of a stab or gunshot injury.\nIn a statement, Justin’s family, said: “It has been almost a year since so-called humans robbed us of our son, father, brother, uncle, nephew and friend in the most frightening and inhumane way imaginable. The tidal wave of pain their actions caused has almost destroyed the lives of so many people because Justin was truly loved by everyone who ever met him.\n“Our family's pain will never, ever go away, and we struggle on for our children because we must show them that justice exists in life. So we must find the people who did this, find out why they thought they had the right to end our Justin's loving, fulfilling and purposeful life.\n\"These people are still out there, living their lives among us in our communities, somewhere. There are people who know what happened, who know who did this or why - maybe it is you reading this right now, or, perhaps you are friends with people who talk about knowing things the police don't, perhaps you have laughed with them, shared food with them all the while knowing or suspecting they may have the blood of a beautiful human smeared on their conscience. The question is: can you live with this knowledge, our Justin's blood on yours?\n“Please, if you have any information or suspicions, however insignificant you feel it might be, if you loved Justin, if you didn't know him but understand right from wrong, if you sympathise with this never-ending nightmare these people have put Justin's family and loved ones through, then perhaps you agree we need to take these people off our streets before they do it again - and we pray next time it isn't your family, your child, your brother.\n\"Please, call the police, even anonymously if you fear for your own safety, but please do not allow our family to continue having to live with this life-destroying silence from the community any longer. Please come forward, clear your conscience and help us to find these sickening excuses for humans before they think they've got away with it and do it again.”\nDetective Chief Inspector Pete Wallis, of the Met’s Specialist Crime Command, said: “Justin’s family have implored anyone with information to come forward, and I would do the same.\n“We have a team of detectives ready to take your call, but we also understand that some people may not wish to speak to us directly. If this is the case, please call Crimestoppers without delay.\n“They key to achieving justice for Justin is in the community.”\nA number of other arrests have been made in connection with the investigation:\nA 41-year-old man [A] was arrested in Norfolk on 29 November on suspicion of murder.\nA 48-year-old man [B] was arrested in Cricklewood on 30 November on suspicion of murder.\nA 47-year-old man [C] was arrested in Gipsy Hill on 5 December on suspicion of assisting an offender.\nA 51-year-old man [D] attended an east London police station on 11 December and was arrested for assisting an offender.\nA 26-year-old man [E] attended a south London police station on 17 December and was arrested for assisting an offender.\nA 37-year-old man [F] attended a north London police station on 24 December and was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.\nA 34-year-old man [G] was arrested in Upper Norwood on Friday, 24 January on suspicion of murder.\nA 31-year-old man [H] was arrested in Woolwich on the same day on suspicion of murder.\nAll have been released under investigation.\n[I] A 48-year-old woman and [J] a 38-year-old woman were arrested on Wednesday, 1 July and Wednesday, 8 July, respectively on suspicion of assisting an offender and perverting the course of justice. They were subsequently bailed to return pending further enquiries to a date in late September. Following this, they were released under investigation.\nA 39–year-old man [K] was arrested in Brixton on Friday, 23 October on suspicion of murder and was released under investigation.\nAnyone with information that may assist the investigation, including anyone who saw suspicious people or vehicles in the area at the time of the attack, is asked to call the incident room on 020 8358 0400 or police on 101 quoting CAD 1446/Nov25/2019.\nTo remain anonymous call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.",

The proposed change would have hit the poorest young Londoners hardest and been a major blow to families already struggling due to the pandemic.\nThe Mayor of London also slammed the Government's plans, describing them as a ’slap in the face’ for Londoners, who were being asked to pay for the crisis through cuts.\nAs a result of the pandemic, TfL’s finances were hit hard as fares income fell by 70 per cent - as Londoners followed the Government's rules and stayed at home.\nLast month, the Mayor of London managed to reach an eleventh-hour agreement with the Government on a funding deal to keep Tube, bus and other TfL services in the capital running until March 2021. In doing so, he succeeded in killing off the very worst Government proposals, which were set out in writing by the Transport Secretary during the negotiations and included Government plans for a huge extension of the Congestion Charge Zone and the removal of free travel for older and younger Londoners.\nHowever, the Tory Government is still determined to punish Londoners. They have said that if London wants to keep concessions for older and younger Londoners in future years, City Hall will have to raise the revenue itself - which Sadiq has committed to doing.\nTfL has relied heavily on income from fares to cover the cost of running its services since the last Tory Government cut the transport authority’s £700m annual grant in its entirety, leaving London as the only major city in Western Europe not to receive direct Government funding to run day-to-day transport services.\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said:\n“I am pleased that we have succeeded in killing off the very worst Government conditions, but it should never have come to this. Free travel is a lifeline for under 18s travelling to school or college, or to see friends and family.\n“Removing it during a global pandemic when struggling families need our support, not cuts, wasn’t something I was ever prepared to let happen. It was absolutely crucial that we fought and defeated this unfair proposal.\n“The final deal is far from ideal, but because we pushed back hard against the Tory Government’s original plans we were able to vastly improve the offer on the table. The reality is the only reason TfL needs Government support is because almost all our fares income has dried up since March, as Londoners have done the right thing and stayed at home during lockdown.\n“In the face of a hostile Tory Government that is determined to punish our city - and make the poorest in our communities bear the cost of the coronavirus crisis - I will continue standing up for London.”\nKrupesh Hirani, Assembly Member candidate for Brent and Harrow, said:\n“Scrapping free travel for under-18s was a shameful proposal from the Tories, and it was crucial that we had a Mayor who was standing up for London throughout the negotiations.\n“It is simply not right to make the poorest children pick up the cost of this pandemic. Households are already suffering because of the economic shock and the last thing struggling families need now is more Tory cuts that would lead to further financial difficulties for them.\n“The fact Sadiq has managed to save these concessions shows how important it is to have a Labour Mayor in City Hall.”",
  "https_krupesh_co_uk_/https_krupesh_co_uk_news_page_9/content_136.html": "Help us win like Joe by signing up for an Early Vote\nPRESS RELEASE: Diwali pain was avoidable\nPain experienced by the Hindu community in the UK could have been avoided if the Government had listened to its own scientific advice according to Brent Councillor Krupesh Hirani.\nEarlier last month, documents revealed that the Government’s Sage committee of scientific experts urged ministers to impose a circuit breaker lockdown on 21 September. These calls were not followed by the Government and instead they have had to impose a longer lockdown this month. If the original advice had been followed, Covid-19 would not have spread as much and we would be out of the ‘circuit break’ period by now. If timed with half-term holidays, the impact on children and schools would have also been less severe.\nDiwali is the largest celebration in the Hindu, Sikh and Jain calendars and over the festive period and the Hindu New Year, Temples celebrate the festival of lights and families meet and greet each other to welcome the New Year. This year Diwali will be on Saturday 14th November with the New Year commencing on Sunday 15th November. It would have already been impacted by Coronavirus restrictions but the later lockdown has impacted plans further.\nThe later lockdown has meant that Diwali celebrations have been severely impacted and that families will not be able to see each other on this auspicious day. All of this was avoidable if more shorter-term restrictions had been brought in earlier.\nCllr Hirani said,\n“It is a shame that we will not be able to celebrate key festivals in the same way but I applaud local Temples and organisations for making sure that people can still celebrate in a Covid secure way using technology. I urge people to follow the law and guidance.”\nCllr Hirani has been working with organisations across Brent to help coordinate and support their plans for festivities and also work with them to promote public health guidance on Covid-19.\nResponse to the Government’s lockdown announcement\nThe Government's scientific advisors recommended the implementation of a short term Circuit breaker lockdown on 21st September.Taking action then would've meant short term restrictions but would have made the need for a harsher lockdown like we will see now avoidable.Today's announcement by the Government was avoidable if they had listened to their own scientists. Instead they wanted to 'keep the country moving.' Now their failure to act means they are doing the exact opposite.Serial incompetence.\nMayor sees off Government plans to extend Congestion Charge to Brent\nThe Mayor of London has today reached an eleventh-hour agreement with the Government on a funding deal to keep tube, bus and other TfL services in the capital running until March 2021.\nSadiq Khan said the deal was \"not ideal” but added: \"We fought hard against this Government which is so determined to punish our city for doing the right thing to tackle Covid-19. The only reason TfL needs government support is because its fares income has almost dried up since March.”\nThe Mayor has succeeded in killing off the very worst Government proposals, which were confirmed in writing by the Transport Secretary during the negotiations. The Mayor had rejected the extension of the £15 daily Congestion Charge to the North and South circular roads as ministers had wanted – in a proposal which would have hit four million more Londoners hard. The Government has now backed down from this condition.\nThe Government also wanted to scrap free travel for under-18s and over-60s. These proposals have also been successfully defeated. The Government also wanted TfL fares to rise by more than the previously agreed RPI+1 per cent This has also been successfully fought off.\nThe deal makes around £1.8 billion of Government grant and borrowing available on current projections to TfL in the second half of this financial year. Transport for London will itself make up through cost savings the £160million gap the deal leaves from the nearly £2 billion the organisation projects it will need to run the tube, bus & other TfL services for the remainder of this financial year.\nAs part of the deal, London will also have to raise extra money in future years. Decisions about how this additional funding will be raised are yet to be made by the Mayor, but some of the options that he and the government have agreed to be looked at include a modest increase in council tax, pending the appropriate consultation, as well as keeping in place the temporary changes to the central London Congestion Charge that were introduced in June 2020, subject to consultation.\nDespite providing the private rail operating companies with 18 months of funding with no conditions attached, the Government has refused to give TfL more than a six-month deal and even this has come with conditions. This means another financial agreement will have to be negotiated just before next year’s mayoral election, a far from ideal time to negotiate a fair long-term deal for London.\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said:\n“These negotiations with Government have been an appalling and totally unnecessary distraction at a time when every ounce of attention should have been focused on trying to slow the spread of Covid-19 and protecting jobs.\n“The pandemic has had the same impact on the finances of the privatised rail companies as it has had on TfL and the Government immediately bailed them out for 18 months with no strings attached. There is simply no reason why the same easy solution could not have been applied to London, which would have allowed us all to focus on the issues that matter most to Londoners, which are tackling the virus and protecting jobs.\n“I am pleased that we have succeeded in killing off the very worst Government proposals.\n\"These proposals from the Government would have hammered Londoners by massively expanding the congestion charge zone, scrapping free travel for older and younger Londoners and increasing TfL fares by more than RPI+1. I am determined that none of this will now happen.\n\"This is not a perfect deal, but we fought hard to get to the best possible place. The only reason TfL needs Government support is because almost all our fares income has dried up since March as Londoners have done the right thing.”\nThe context behind the Government’s London transport interferences\nTo say that recent negotiations between the Government and London have been tense over the finances of Transport for London would be putting it mildly.\nTransport for London’s main source of income is fares. It is the least subsidised major transport system in the world. 72% of it’s funding comes from Passenger fares. Before the Coronavirus period, TfL’s finances were in a good condition as verified by independent auditors. With failed projects such as the Garden Bridge which was never built and the phasing out of a Government Grant to TfL, Boris Johnson left TfL with a £1.5bn deficit when he left the Mayoral office in 2016. In addition, a legacy of his deal with the David Cameron Government means that from 2021, the £500m raised every year from Londoners paying Vehicle Excise Duty (more commonly known as the Road Tax) will be collected by central Government and not given back to London – thereby only invested in roads outside the Capital.\nUnder Sadiq Khan’s mayoralty, TfL’s operating deficit before the Covid 19 period hit was reduced by 71%.\nThe Coronavirus lockdown and the continued message to stay at home and work from home as much as possible has led to a drastic reduction in people using London’s public transport system. At the peak of the pandemic, TfL's passenger income was reduced by more than 90 per cent compared to last year. TfL kept running trains and buses throughout the pandemic period to ensure that essential workers such as NHS staff could get to work. This has had a devastating financial impact on the essential public service.\nTransport for London is not alone. Transport networks in other cities such as Manchester, Tyne and Wear, Nottingham, the West Midlands and Sheffield for example have also been impacted. However these transport networks have all been given debt free bailouts.\nLondon has been treated differently. In order to receive a bail out, the Government has set conditions on receiving bailout funding. Within the first round of bail out negotiations, those conditions included;\n- Stopping free travel for under-18s\n- Stopping freedom pass holders from traveling at peak hours\n- Increasing the congestion charge\n- This was part of a short-term deal to keep TfL going to October.\nAs part of fresh negotiations, the Government is proposing further conditions as part of a bailout deal. These include;\n- Extending the Congestion Charge Zone to the North and South Circular Roads and increasing its charge further\n- Increasing Council Tax for all Londoners\n- Increase public transport fares\nThis approach from Government is very political and quite clear they are more interested in political elections rather than dealing with urgent and emergency issues. However in trying to hurt or attack the Mayor of London, they are in fact hurting people and businesses in London.\nTest and Trace Support Payments Available in Brent and Harrow\nIf you have tested positive for coronavirus or have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive, you may be entitled to a new Test and Trace Support Payment of £500. This is for residents on lower incomes who cannot work from home and have lost income as a result. Self-isolation is a legal duty for all those who test positive for COVID-19 or are identified by NHS Test and Trace as a close contact since 28 September 2020.\nTo be eligible for the Test and Trace Support Payment, an individual must:\n- have been asked to self-isolate and been provided a with an 8 digit number by NHS Test and Trace either because they’ve tested positive for coronavirus or have recently been in close contact with someone who has tested positive;\n- be employed or self-employed;\n- be unable to work from home and will lose income as a result; and\n- be currently receiving Universal Credit, Working Tax Credit, income-based Employment and Support Allowance, income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, Income Support, Housing Benefit and/or Pension Credit.\nAPPLY FOR A TEST AND TRACE SUPPORT PAYMENT IN BRENT\nAPPLY FOR A TEST AND TRACE SUPPORT PAYMENT IN HARROW\nLondon in Tier 2: Covid-19 level high\nThe number of COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly across London and we are now in danger of losing control of this deadly virus.\nThis means new local restrictions are necessary to get this under control to protect you, our NHS and the local economy. From Saturday 17 October all of London, including Brent and Harrow, were moved into the high level of alert.\nThe most significant new rule is that you must not meet socially with friends and family indoors, unless you live with them or have formed a support bubble together. This applies in your home, and at pubs or restaurants.\nYou can continue to see friends and family, who you don’t live with, in outdoor spaces, such as parks, but you must not meet in a group of more than six – including children.\nPlease work from home if you can and reduce the number of journeys you make. To help stop the spread of coronavirus it is vital that we all continue to:\n- Wash hands regularly\n- Wear a face covering\n- Keep a safe distance from anyone not in your household or support bubble.\nLook out for the symptoms of coronavirus which are: a high temperature; a new, continuous cough or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. If you have these symptoms, stay at home and apply for a test.\nThis is a difficult and worrying time for many of us. I know how many sacrifices you have made, to protect your loved ones, friends and neighbours. But a big effort from us at this moment can save lives, protect the local economy and stop the big growth in cases seen in other parts of the country.\nBy following the rules together, we can all play our part in keeping ourselves, our families and communities safe.

From today, Tube and rail fares on pay as you go with contactless and Oyster will be off-peak all day on Fridays until the end of May.\nThe trial follows the announcement that the Mayor has again frozen TfL fares until March 2025, which is providing more support to Londoners struggling with the cost of living, and aiding London’s recovery from the pandemic.\nLondon & Partners, London’s business growth and destination agency, has created a new webpage – https://www.visitlondon.com/fridays – where Londoners can see a range of exciting offers from restaurants, museums, theatres and landmark attractions available on Fridays during the trial, to encourage Londoners back into the city. More exclusive offers will be announced as the trial progresses, with different offers each Friday of the trial.\nExamples of these Friday offers include:\n· 20% off your bill at Gaucho restaurants on Fridays (until 31 March)\n· Off-peak Friday prices to see hit musical Wicked\n· Half-price tickets on Fridays for ‘‘Turn It Up’ exhibition at the Science Museum\nTfL and London & Partners have also been working with local businesses across London and key stakeholders to help promote a range of activities to further encourage people to make the most of their Fridays.\nPeak pay as you go fares ordinarily apply between 06:30 and 09:30 and between 16:00 and 19:00 on both TfL and National Rail services. Making pay as you go journeys on Fridays off-peak all day will make it cheaper for people to travel throughout the day. This could potentially support economic growth by encouraging more people back onto public transport and into the office, and the city, on a day that is currently quieter than other weekdays.\nTfL and the Train companies have agreed to the trial, making all pay as you go journeys made using contactless and Oyster (with the exception of journeys to/from Heathrow airport via Zone 1) off-peak on Fridays. The daily cap will also be amended during the trial to cap at an off-peak rate on Friday, helping those who make multiple journeys through the day save even more. Bus and Tram fares across London will not change during the trial as they are set at a flat rate of £1.75 regardless of the time of travel.\nThe trial will also see 60+ London Oyster photocard and Older Persons’ Freedom Passes allowed to be used on TfL and National Rail services before 9am, helping Londoners with these passes to travel for free all day on Fridays.\nTo fund the trial, £24m has been allocated from the Mayor of London’s recently approved budget, which will be used to compensate TfL and rail operators for lower fares revenue during the trial and cover the costs for running it.\nOff-peak Friday fares could give a much-needed boost to London’s businesses and commuters as the cost-of-living continues to bite. As an example, someone commuting in from Romford (Zone 6) into Bond Street (Zone 1) would have paid £5.60 for travelling on the Elizabeth line during peak hours. Under the trial, this fare will be reduced to £3.60 – saving £2. Someone commuting from Morden (Zone 4) to Vauxhall (Zone 2) in peak hours would have paid £2.80 for the trip. This fare will now be reduced down to £1.90 – saving 90p. On National Rail, someone commuting using pay as you go with contactless from St Albans City to London Blackfriars would pay £12.90 midweek, but will pay £9.50 on Fridays during the trial – saving £3.40. These savings will be doubled if the return journey is also made during evening peak hours.\nThe Mayor hopes that having off-peak fares on Fridays could help encourage more people into the city to make the most of London’s offering of bars, restaurants, live music venues and theatres.",

TfL is introducing new buses to the north-south route 63 that have a range of innovative features aimed at making them an even more attractive, green alternative to the car. In development over the last couple of years, the first buses came into service in December, with the whole route transformed in the coming weeks. It comes as ridership between on the route, between King’s Cross and Honor Oak, has returned to close to pre-pandemic levels.\nThe new route 63 buses were manufactured by ADL, the country’s largest bus and coach manufacturer, in Scarborough. ADL employs 2,000 people in skilled jobs, as well as supporting a successful apprenticeship scheme.\nOther London buses are produced around the UK in places such as Ballymena and Falkirk, demonstrating how investment in the capital’s transport network helps level up the whole country.",

  "https_krupesh_co_uk_/https_krupesh_co_uk_mayor-sees-off-government-plans-to-extend-congestion-charge-to-brent/content_316.html": "The Mayor of London has today reached an eleventh-hour agreement with the Government on a funding deal to keep tube, bus and other TfL services in the capital running until March 2021.\nSadiq Khan said the deal was \"not ideal” but added: \"We fought hard against this Government which is so determined to punish our city for doing the right thing to tackle Covid-19. The only reason TfL needs government support is because its fares income has almost dried up since March.”\nThe Mayor has succeeded in killing off the very worst Government proposals, which were confirmed in writing by the Transport Secretary during the negotiations. The Mayor had rejected the extension of the £15 daily Congestion Charge to the North and South circular roads as ministers had wanted – in a proposal which would have hit four million more Londoners hard. The Government has now backed down from this condition.\nThe Government also wanted to scrap free travel for under-18s and over-60s. These proposals have also been successfully defeated. The Government also wanted TfL fares to rise by more than the previously agreed RPI+1 per cent This has also been successfully fought off.\nThe deal makes around £1.8 billion of Government grant and borrowing available on current projections to TfL in the second half of this financial year. Transport for London will itself make up through cost savings the £160million gap the deal leaves from the nearly £2 billion the organisation projects it will need to run the tube, bus & other TfL services for the remainder of this financial year.\nAs part of the deal, London will also have to raise extra money in future years. Decisions about how this additional funding will be raised are yet to be made by the Mayor, but some of the options that he and the government have agreed to be looked at include a modest increase in council tax, pending the appropriate consultation, as well as keeping in place the temporary changes to the central London Congestion Charge that were introduced in June 2020, subject to consultation.\nDespite providing the private rail operating companies with 18 months of funding with no conditions attached, the Government has refused to give TfL more than a six-month deal and even this has come with conditions. This means another financial agreement will have to be negotiated just before next year’s mayoral election, a far from ideal time to negotiate a fair long-term deal for London.\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said:\n“These negotiations with Government have been an appalling and totally unnecessary distraction at a time when every ounce of attention should have been focused on trying to slow the spread of Covid-19 and protecting jobs.\n“The pandemic has had the same impact on the finances of the privatised rail companies as it has had on TfL and the Government immediately bailed them out for 18 months with no strings attached. There is simply no reason why the same easy solution could not have been applied to London, which would have allowed us all to focus on the issues that matter most to Londoners, which are tackling the virus and protecting jobs.\n“I am pleased that we have succeeded in killing off the very worst Government proposals.\n\"These proposals from the Government would have hammered Londoners by massively expanding the congestion charge zone, scrapping free travel for older and younger Londoners and increasing TfL fares by more than RPI+1. I am determined that none of this will now happen.\n\"This is not a perfect deal, but we fought hard to get to the best possible place. The only reason TfL needs Government support is because almost all our fares income has dried up since March as Londoners have done the right thing.”",

Online courses will train teachers to run classes and workshops in every school\n- The move comes as research shows that young people are increasingly being exposed to misogynist influencers on social media – with one in three young males having a positive view of ‘self-proclaimed misogynist’ Andrew Tate and one in ten children having watched pornography by the time they are nine\n- The Mayor has today written to every primary school in London to highlight the importance of pupils learning about equality and respect\n- Today the Mayor warned there has never been a more important time to counter the pernicious influence of those who preach misogyny online, saying ‘young people must learn about respectful relationships before they start seeing content from individuals like Andrew Tate online.’\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, today launched a new landmark toolkit for every primary school in London to teach pupils about healthy and respectful relationships, as part of his work to tackle violence against women and girls.\nSadiq has written to every primary school in London explaining the importance of young boys and girls learning about equality and respect.\nThe new innovative £1million toolkit, funded by the Mayor and developed by educational experts Tender, uses workshops, drama and interactive sessions in the classroom to engage with young Londoners aged between 9-11 and champion healthy and respectful relationships and attitudes.\nTender is a pioneer in educating primary schools about healthy relationships and this is the first time they have put that knowledge and experience into a toolkit specifically for primary schools. Funding from the Mayor has allowed them to put their knowledge and experience into a toolkit to run classes and workshops empowering young people to confidently recognise, call out and help stamp out inequality and sexism among their own peer groups.\nThe move comes as research shows that young people are being increasingly exposed to misogynist influencers on social media – with one in three young males having a positive view of ‘self-proclaimed misogynist’ Andrew Tate. Young people are also being exposed to pornography online from as young as nine years old and this is having a negative role in shaping children’s understanding of girls and relationships.\nThe toolkit will help educate the next generation of Londoners on what harmful behaviour looks like, and why it is not ok. It will be delivered by primary school teachers and supported by specially trained workshop leaders.\nIt builds on work already delivered by the Mayor’s Violence Reduction Unit, which has pioneered a public health approach to tackling violence. It’s £2million funding includes investing in Tender to deliver work with 15,200 children and young people taking part in arts and drama-based healthy relationships sessions. This work has led to 90 per cent of pupils having a better understanding of healthy relationships and 80 per cent now able to spot red flags in a friendship or relationship.\nThe action is the latest part of the Mayor’s approach to tackling the underlying causes of violence against women and girls (VAWG). It will build on the success of his multi award-winning #HaveAWord campaign and allyship training in secondary schools which is working to educate and empower young Londoners to take a stand and help prevent violence against women and girls.\nThe launch of the new toolkit, following a successful trial, is based on the Mayor’s early intervention and prevention approach to tackling VAWG which places a stronger emphasis on partnership working, prevention and education across a wide range of services in London.\nThe Mayor is clear that it is never too early to start educating young Londoners about the need to treat one another fairly and kindly. And that education from a young age is key to strengthening the resilience young people have to toxic influences and attitudes towards women and girls in society and those proliferating on social media.\nIt is part of the Mayor’s record £233million investment to tackle violence against women and girls in all its forms – as well as its underlying causes. This funding is working to educate young people about harmful attitudes and behaviours, save lives, reduce waiting lists, keep doors open for vital specialist support services for victims and supporting the police and agencies to go after the worst perpetrators of violence.",

Voting will be from 5th February to noon on 19th February 2020. Members will receive their ballots by email on 5th February. Members who have not submitted email details to the Party as part of their membership application or do not have one will be sent a physical postal ballot.\nKrupesh Hirani made it on to the ballot after securing the most nominations from Constituency Labour Parties and trade unions and affiliated socialist societies over the 2019 summer period. The selection campaign was then paused by the Labour Party following the general election and the understandable priority given to select MPs for the December 2019 elections.\nIf you would like to volunteer for Krupesh’s email contact the team by email on [email protected].\nAny press queries should also be sent to the above email address.\nKrupesh Hirani launches City Hall campaign\nCllr Krupesh Hirani will seek the Labour nomination for the seat of Brent and Harrow in next year’s Greater London Authority elections.\nCllr Hirani’s announcement follows the decision by the Labour incumbent, Navin Shah, to stand down after twelve years in the role. Assembly Member Shah has publicly endorsed Cllr Hirani’s candidacy, backing Brent’s Cabinet Member for Health, Culture & Leisure to replace him at next year’s election.\nBorn, raised and educated in Brent, Krupesh has represented Dudden Hill ward since 2010, and has served as the Lead Member for Health since 2012. He previously worked for the Harrow-based spinal injury charity, Aspire, before joining the MS Society as their Regional Officer for London in 2015.\nOutlining his priorities for Brent and Harrow, Cllr Hirani has highlighted the need to protect police numbers, improve the accessibility of public transport and lead the fight against cuts to local health services. Other commitments include the introduction of a Young People’s working group to facilitate better youth engagement across the two boroughs to bring issues forward to the Mayor, as well as improving air quality in some of the area’s most polluted neighbourhoods.\nEndorsers of Cllr Hirani’s campaign include MPs Dawn Butler (Brent Central) and Gareth Thomas (Harrow West), as well as the leaders of both Brent and Harrow councils, Cllr Muhammed Butt and Cllr Graham Henson. He is also backed by the GMB trade union.\nAnnouncing his intention to stand, Cllr Hirani said:\n“I’m standing to be Labour’s candidate because I believe Brent and Harrow deserve a representative who really understands the challenges facing our communities. Our area has seen enormous change over the past decade, and I am committed to giving local residents a strong voice in City Hall – a voice that will fight to protect the things we all care about.\n“Over the past decade, we have seen huge changes across Brent and Harrow that have helped to unlock new opportunities. I want to make sure that everyone is able to take advantage of those opportunities, and am committed to working closely with residents from every corner of Brent and Harrow to help our communities realise their full potential.\n“It would be an honour to serve the people of Brent and Harrow, and an opportunity to give back to a community that has given me so much.”\nGareth Thomas, Member of Parliament for Harrow West, said:\n“Krupesh is well-known across communities in both Harrow and Brent. He is the ideal candidate to represent Labour at the London elections and I am proud to support him as our candidate for 2020.”\nDawn Butler, Member of Parliament for Brent Central, said:\n“Krupesh works tirelessly for Brent and as his MP I am always confident when I refer people and issues to him that he will deliver.”\nBarry Gardiner, Member of Parliament for Brent North, said:\n“Krupesh represents the future of the Labour Party. I believe he has the vision and commitment to represent diverse boroughs like Brent and Harrow. He has a record of delivery and is 100% committed to the area he is proud to call home.”\nNavin Shah, London Assembly Member for Brent and Harrow said:\n“I first met Krupesh as a community activist in Harrow rather than through the Labour Party. Brent and Harrow will be in capable hands with Krupesh as its Assembly Member.”",

From there it will turn left onto Pall Mall, pass the St Patrick’s Day Festival in Trafalgar Square and is due to end in Whitehall by 2pm.\nDetails of the full programme will be updated at: www.london.gov.uk/st-patricks\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, today unveiled the celebrations planned for St Patrick’s Day in the capital, which will showcase the very best of Irish arts, performance, culture, food and dance.\nThis year’s theme is one of celebration and bringing the community back together, and Londoners and visitors can look forward to an exciting programme of events happening across the city on March 12th and 13th to mark the festival’s return. Events including busking on the Underground, the iconic parade and vibrant celebrations in Trafalgar Square were postponed for the past two years due to the pandemic but will return to the capital this year.\nOn Sunday 13th March London will see the return of the spectacular annual parade of Irish marching bands, dancers and pageantry, which will start at 12pm and wind its way from Green Park to Trafalgar Square.

  "https_krupesh_co_uk_/https_krupesh_co_uk_green-new-deal-for-london/content_289.html": "I previously reported on the announcement of an initial £10m investment from the Mayor of London on a Green New Deal. The investment will be broken down into three areas:\n- Decarbonising the Built Environment\nTackling emissions from heating and powering London’s buildings. Programmes will make homes more energy efficient and ensure London is supplied with more green energy through district energy networks and other clean sources such as solar. - Green Transport and Public Realm\nTackling transport emissions and encouraging walking, cycling and electric vehicles. Projects will also improve access to green spaces and the natural environment while increasing London’s resilience and adaptation to climate change impacts. - Green Foundations\nSupporting growth of new and existing businesses in the green economy. Projects will create job opportunities and develop skills for Londoners to exploit the opportunities that the transition to a low carbon circular economy represents.\nHere is what that means in turn;\nDecarbonising the Built Environment\nNorth London District Energy\nBuilding on £30 million of investment already secured, the funding provides the capacity to capture a further 20MW of waste heat from the Edmonton Energy Recovery Facility to enable the supersizing and extension of the heat network from Enfield into Hackney and Haringey, providing near zero carbon heating to a further 8,000 properties, an increase of 50 percent on the original project.\nLondon Community Energy Fund\nThe fourth phase of the London Community Energy Fund will support community energy projects such as solar panels on schools and community centres and electric vehicle charge points. The new fund includes up to £500,000 for community energy groups to deliver projects, as well as £165,000 for project development. The previous rounds of funding enabled 48 community energy projects across 81 buildings, saving up to 1,500 tonnes of carbon per year. Applications for grants will be open by the end of this month.\nOld Oak and Park Royal Solar PV programme\nThis programme will develop and deliver solar panels on rooftops across the Old Oak and Park Royal industrial estates over a three-year period.\nPhase one will install around 10,000 m2 of solar panels across ten business premises on the Park Royal estate. The wider opportunity across industrial roofs in the OPDC area has been assessed as capable of providing 213 MW of power, which could save up to one million tonnes of CO2e over 25 years and creating 820 installation jobs over a five year period. It will also support further EV charging points for other vehicles\nSolar Together London\nSolar Together has so far successfully supported the installation of solar panels on almost 1,000 London homes. It uses a group-buying model to unlock significant savings from suppliers (up to 35 per cent in previous rounds) which makes solar more affordable for Londoners. This round of funding will drive a London-wide programme which will also include up to £60,000 to support installers to boost their training and employment opportunities and grow the supply chain.\nGreen Transport and Public Realm\nBus electrification and electric vehicle charging\nThe project will invest in the design and delivery of power infrastructure for bus garages in London, which will ultimately enable the transformation of London’s 9,000 buses into a zero-tailpipe emission fleet.\n2030 Future Neighbourhoods\n2030 Future Neighbourhoods will support exemplar projects that transform whole neighbourhoods in the capital into zero emission neighbourhoods but also providing benefits across a range of environmental priorities. The programme will support projects that include:\n- retrofitting homes and commercial and public buildings\n- decarbonising energy systems\n- zero emission transport including walking and cycling\n- supporting green spaces and public realm that is climate adapted, resilient, supports fairer access to green space and supports health\n- zero waste, circular economy and driving behavioural change Particular attention will be given to ensure underrepresented groups are included in design and benefit from outcomes. Project areas will look and feel different to other neighbourhoods, showcasing what can be achieved, attract other sources of capital investment and have clear costed delivery plans to 2030.\nGreen Foundations\nAdvance London\nThe Advance London programme managed by the London Waste and Recycling Board (LWARB) has supported over 200 SMEs over the last 3.5 years to transition to circular business models and scale their circular economy ventures, resulting in a combined turnover of £50m.\nAdditional funding will broaden the existing Advance London programme by supporting start-ups and SMEs to launch and pilot circular economy ventures that will protect jobs and enable good quality businesses to be part of a green recovery. It will prioritise support to businesses in either geographic areas or sectors impacted most severely by the pandemic.\nBetter Futures\nTailored support to SMEs to improve the success rate and speed of low-carbon enterprises supporting London’s transition. By expanding the existing Better Futures programme, funding will provide additional and enhanced, tailored business and technical development, with a proactive focus on under-represented groups in the Cleantech sector whilst supporting internships to access the sector.\nNew programmes also launched\nLocal Energy Accelerator\nA brand new £6m programme to provide expertise and support organisations to develop clean and locally generated energy projects. These projects will include district energy networks that use renewable heat sources (including river water and waste heat from London Underground), and energy technologies such as heat pumps, solar panels, batteries and smart electric vehicle charging to transform the way London generates, supplies and uses clean local energy in buildings and transport.\nRetrofit Accelerator - Innovation Partnership\nSocial landlords are committed to decarbonising their housing stock, but current approaches to procuring deep retrofit works are cumbersome, expensive and to date have not driven the expansion of the market required to meet London’s climate change targets.\nTo address this, the Mayor’s Retrofit Accelerator – Homes programme has developed an ‘Innovation Partnership’ model. This new procurement approach brings together social landlords and the supply chain together in order to develop scalable solutions that accelerate the pace of deep, whole-house retrofit while driving down costs and growing jobs in the supply chain.\nGrow Back Greener Fund\nCOVID-19 has shone a spotlight on the importance of accessible green space for Londoners’ health and wellbeing, but it has also highlighted that not everyone has easy access to green spaces. To help address this the Mayor has provide an additional £650,000 to support greening projects through his Grow Back Greener fund, on top of the £1.1 million he allocated at the beginning of this year to green urban areas, including those with limited access to green space. Charities and community groups affected by the crisis were able to apply for funding, helping them retain jobs and support people to develop their skills, while delivering new greening projects in areas of need. Successful projects will be announced in the coming weeks.",

  "https_krupesh_co_uk_/https_krupesh_co_uk_new-lifts-installed-at-harrow-on-the-hill-tube-station/content_85.html": "Harrow-on-the-Hill Underground station on the Metropolitan line has become step-free, helping customers with reduced mobility to access the station and the wider Transport for London (TfL) network.\nFour new lifts have been installed at Harrow-on-the-Hill station, providing a step-free route between the street and Metropolitan line trains. In addition, station signage has been enhanced to assist with wayfinding. Boarding ramps will continue to support customers boarding or alighting Chiltern trains, and with TfL’s Turn-up-and-go service, staff will be on hand to assist customers if required.\nWith the completion of step-free access schemes on the wider TfL network, the average additional journey time required for step-free journeys has now been reduced to around 6.7 minutes. This compares to 9.5 minutes in 2016, meaning significant progress has been taken towards the Mayor of London’s aim of halving 2015’s additional journey time of 11 minutes by 2041. Without long-term capital funding from Government, TfL will not be able to make further progress on delivering step-free stations across its network, which will mean disabled people will continue to have to take longer journeys to travel in an accessible way.\nThe completion of the step-free scheme at Harrow-on-the-Hill increases the total number of step-free London Underground stations to 91, meaning that one third of the 272 stations on the Tube network are now step-free – a 33 per cent increase since 2016, when Sadiq Khan was first elected as Mayor of London.\nIn 2021, step-free access schemes were completed at Sudbury Hill (in December), Osterley (in October), Battersea Power Station and Nine Elms on the Northern Line Extension (in September), Wimbledon Park (in August), Ickenham (in June), Debden (in April) and Amersham (in February). In addition, Ealing Broadway was made step-free in May 2021 in preparation for the Elizabeth line, and Whitechapel became step-free when the original station entrance on Whitechapel Road re-opened in August 2021.\nThis year, TfL will complete a range of step-free projects that are currently under construction and began prior to the pandemic. These include step-free access to the Northern line at Moorgate, which became step-free to the Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines last year. TfL is also progressing step-free access work that will make busy Zone 1 stations partially step-free in 2022. These are at Bank (Northern line and DLR Interchange only) and Paddington (Bakerloo line only). The current proposed designs for the redeveloped Euston station as part of High Speed 2 will also deliver step-free improvements to Euston and Euston Square station.\nTfL is currently reviewing the results of its recent public consultation to help shape future step-free access priorities, with final outcomes of the consultation communicated in the summer. However, a ‘managed decline’ scenario would mean that without sufficient long-term capital funding from Government, further improvements to step-free access at stations across London – outside of those already underway or funded by third parties – would be impacted. Such investment is essential to future accessibility improvements and to ensuring an efficient and reliable public transport service for all Londoners.\nThis was a long fought campaign by previous London Assembly Member for Brent and Harrow Navin Shah and was one of the schemes cancelled by the previous Mayor of London Boris Johnson.",

  "https_krupesh_co_uk_/https_krupesh_co_uk_calls-for-construction-worker-temporary-visa-scheme-to-help-deliver-the-homes-londoners-need/content_207.html": "The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan has today called on Government to create a temporary visa scheme for construction workers to alleviate the debilitating double impact of Brexit and the pandemic on the building industry.\nIn September 2021 the UK-wide vacancy rate in construction rose to its highest recorded level since 2001 (1) and vacancies in construction were 40 per cent higher in summer 2021 than in the three months before the pandemic (2). Last year the Government instigated a temporary visa concession for EU lorry drivers and poultry workers to come to the UK.\nThe Mayor is proposing that ministers create a Coronavirus Recovery Visa to help sectors that are struggling with shortages of workers, including construction. The visa should offer at least 12 months to work in the UK and be appropriately tailored to sectors like construction where many workers prefer to work on a self-employed basis.\nSome of the labour shortages in this sector could have already been addressed had the Government implemented the recommendations from the Migration Advisory Committee’s October 2020 review to add ‘Bricklayers and masons’ and ‘Electricians and electrical fitters’ to the Shortage Occupation List. The Mayor is also calling for a regional shortage occupation list that allows London and other cities to attract and retain staff in sectors with acute labour shortages.\nPrior to Brexit, the capital was dependent on migrant building workers with more than half the workforce being from the EU and beyond. ONS figures show that the number of construction workers in London from the EU fell 54 per cent between April 2017 and April 2020. Furthermore, the UK-born construction workforce is ageing, with an estimated 10-20 per cent reaching retirement age in the next five years.\nThe Mayor has hit his affordable housing target every year since taking office; 13,318 genuinely affordable homes were started in London last year alone, and in 2019/20 record numbers were started. The capital is also undergoing a council housing renaissance with boroughs starting more homes last year than at any time since the 1970s. However, this progress could be put at risk if construction sector employers cannot access a site-ready workforce to help build the homes Londoners need.\nWhilst a temporary visa scheme would provide a short-term fix, the Mayor is determined that young Londoners see the building industry as a positive and viable career, allowing them to benefit from the wide range of opportunities available in the sector whilst building the homes and infrastructure London desperately needs. This was the impetus for the Mayor to set up his Mayor’s Construction Academy (MCA) in 2018, connecting Londoners to training in the skills they need to access vacancies in the capital’s developments, in trades, professions and management. Since the MCA programme’s launch, more than 24,500 Londoners have completed construction training.\nThe Mayor is also aware of the need for best practice in the construction industry and is a signatory to Unite the Union’s Construction Charter which sets out to improve the city’s construction standards protect workers and outlaw poor construction practices. The charter ensures building contractors and sub-contractors under the control of local authorities provide apprentice training, a safe working environment, and the industry rate of pay to workers.\nCity Hall’s official assessment of housing need in London found that the city now requires around 66,000 new homes a year to provide enough homes for current and future Londoners.",

Once complete, customers will be able to make calls wherever they are on the Underground, check the latest travel information, keep on top of their emails, catch up on social media and live stream videos, transforming the passenger experience and securing London’s transformation into a smart city.\nBAI’s neutral host mobile network will also host the new Emergency Services Network (ESN), which will give first responders immediate access to life-saving data, images and information in live situations and emergencies on the frontline.\nWork on delivering 4G coverage across the Tube network is well underway, following the successful transfer of the previous pilot section on the eastern end of the Jubilee line to BAI earlier this year. Positive progress now means that the next five stations to get coverage – Bank, Oxford Circus, Tottenham Court Road, Euston, and Camden Town – will go live within the next six months. The additional connectivity within these stations will help customers visiting the city to make plans for shopping, events and socialising with friends and family in Central London across the festive season.\nAll stations and tunnels across the Tube network remain on course to have high-quality and uninterrupted mobile coverage. Some sections of Tube network will go live by summer 2023 – including parts of the Central line including stations and tunnels through the City and West End. TfL and BAI are also continuing to progress with delivering mobile coverage across the recently opened central section of the Elizabeth line between Paddington and Abbey Wood.\nMobile operators will also ensure continued and improved coverage via Wi-Fi on the London Underground and Elizabeth line when the network transfers to BAI in April 2023.",

  "https_krupesh_co_uk_/https_krupesh_co_uk_new-google-technology-in-place-to-help-combat-mobile-phone-theft/content_14.html": "The recent announcement of Google’s new security features for Android phones marks a significant step forward in the battle against mobile phone theft. As the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, rightly pointed out, this issue has become a pervasive problem in our cities, with criminals increasingly targeting high-value devices.\nThe new features, which include automatic screen locking and remote device control, are designed to make Android phones less attractive to thieves and provide enhanced protection for users’ data. This is a welcome development, as it demonstrates a growing recognition among technology companies of their responsibility to address the social and economic consequences of their products.\nWhile these measures are undoubtedly helpful, it is important to acknowledge that they are not a silver bullet. The illegal trade in stolen mobile phones remains a complex issue with deep-rooted connections to organized crime. To effectively combat this problem, a multi-faceted approach is required, involving law enforcement, technology companies, and policymakers working together.\nOne promising avenue is the exploration of ways to disable stolen devices worldwide, regardless of location. This would significantly reduce the resale value of stolen phones, making them less attractive to criminals. Additionally, stricter regulations and enforcement of existing laws are needed to crack down on the illicit trade in stolen parts and accessories.\nUltimately, the fight against mobile phone theft is a battle that we must win. It is a matter of public safety, economic justice, and the protection of individual rights. By working together, we can create a safer environment for all and ensure that the benefits of technology are enjoyed by everyone, without fear of theft or exploitation.",
  "https_krupesh_co_uk_/https_krupesh_co_uk/content_1.html": "About Krupesh\nKrupesh was born at Central Middlesex Hospital, was state school educated in Brent and has spent my whole life in North West London. He went to Braintcroft Primary School in Neasden and completed High School and Sixth Form at Preston Manor in Wembley.\nKrupesh Hirani was elected to the London Assembly representing the Brent and Harrow Constituency in 2021 and re-elected at the 2024 London elections. He has extensive public political experience having been elected as a Councillor in Brent in 2010, 2014 and 2018. He has served in Cabinet posts covering Adult Social Care, Public Health, Sport and Leisure, and Culture. He oversaw Brent's year as the London Borough of Culture and is was the Chair of trustees at the Kilburn based education and arts charity Metroland Cultures. He stepped down from Brent Council in May 2022.\nOutside of Politics, He has worked extensively in the voluntary sector. He worked for the Harrow based disability charity Aspire for seven years and then the MS Society for four years. He has also actively volunteered at the Stanmore Hindu Temple in Harrow.\nHe is a keen runner and takes part regularly in local Park Runs and also plays 5-a-side football.\nHe lives in Neasden with his family with his wife and two daughters in a multi-generational family household. His family came over to the UK in the 1980s from East Africa.\nHe is passionate about making sure his children's generation has better opportunities to succeed than those previous and that they also live in a cohesive and peaceful society and community.\nLondon Assembly Elections\nOn 6th May 2021, Londoners voted for the Mayor of the capital along with London Assembly Members. Krupesh won the Brent and Harrow 2021 London Assembly election. At the 2024 London elections he was successfully re-elected. He is immensely proud to be serving the community which he is part and parcel of and has been living, working and volunteering with his whole life.\nThe London Assembly Explained\nThe London Assembly examines decisions and actions to ensure promises to Londoners are delivered.\nThat work is carried out by the 25 London Assembly Members, who Londoners elect at the same time as the Mayor. Eleven represent the whole capital and 14 are elected by constituencies. Brent and Harrow is one of those 14 constituencies.\nAssembly Members who represent constituencies strive to get the best out of the Mayor’s resources for the local areas that they represent.\nAs the most powerful directly-elected politician in the UK, it is important the Mayor of London is held publicly and democratically accountable. The Assembly holds the Mayor and Mayoral advisers to account by publicly examining policies and programmes through committee meetings, plenary sessions, site visits and investigations. The Mayor should respond to Assembly motions and formal recommendations.\nIn addition, the Assembly questions the Mayor ten times a year at Mayor’s Question Time. The Mayor must also consult Assembly Members before producing statutory strategies and the multi-billion pound budget for the GLA Group. The Assembly can reject the Mayor’s strategies and amend the draft budget if a majority of two-thirds agree to do so.\nAssembly meetings are open to the public so Londoners can stay informed about the activities of the Mayor and the Assembly can publicly review their performance.\nAs well as examining the Mayor’s actions and decisions, Assembly Members act as champions for Londoners by investigating issues that are important to the capital - from improving the economy to how to tackle alcohol misuse by young Londoners.\nAssembly investigations are carried out by cross-party committees which cover vital areas like transport, policing, housing and planning, the economy, health and the environment. The Assembly can press for changes to national, Mayoral or local policy.",

This expansion will result in 144 schools with a combined total of 89,018 students facing a drop in their exposure to nitrogen dioxide so substantial the air will reach the standards advised by the WHO.\nToxic air is leading to children growing up with stunted lungs and an increased risk of asthma, with older Londoners facing greater risk of cancer and dementia. These factors contribute to around 4,000 premature deaths every year in London.\nTo help transition to the new scheme, all Londoners with non-compliant vehicles can now get £2,000 for scrapping a car or £1,000 for scrapping a motorcycle. Small businesses and charities can now receive increased grant payments of between £6,000 and £11,500. Eligible charities, businesses and sole traders can now apply for up to three vans or minibuses to be scrapped or retrofitted in total. And the payment for wheelchair accessible vehicles has increased from £5,000 to £10,000, with grants of £6,000 available to retrofit a van to ULEZ standards.\nA number of mitigations have also been made for different groups, including exemptions for disabled people and wheelchair accessible vehicles until October 2027 – and new six-month grace periods also recognise that small businesses and charities are doing the right thing and adapting to the ULEZ but may face a delay with receiving their new vehicle or retrofit appointment.\nThe total amount the Mayor has invested in the scrappage scheme for the ULEZ expansion is £160m, the most generous scrappage scheme in the UK which has been funded without any support from central Government.\nThe ULEZ has already proven to be transformational in inner London, where it has cut harmful nitrogen dioxide by nearly half in central London and by a fifth in inner London, helping to reduce the number of air pollution-related asthma admissions for children by a third, and saving 800,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions since 2019 (the equivalent of 1.1 million flights from London to New York).\nAny net revenue raised through the ULEZ will be reinvested back into public transport, including on the expansion of bus services in outer London. The ULEZ is expected not to raise any net revenue by the 2026/2027 financial year as the percentage of compliant vehicles continues to rise.\nEvery child has the right to clean air when they’re travelling to school, learning in the classroom or having fun on the playground. For too long they have been exposed to higher risks of stunted lung growth and chronic illnesses, such as asthma, lung and heart disease.\nThe ULEZ expansion means almost 90,000 of London’s children will no longer have to breathe poisonous air during their school days.",
