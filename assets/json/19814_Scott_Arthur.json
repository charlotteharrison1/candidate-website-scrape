  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_02_25_key-facts-extending-the-tram-to-newhaven/content_671.html": "Last week I shared my “key facts” on the proposed tram extension. To rival this, the Council has issued it’s own factsheet… below.\nTrams factsheet\n- This is not Edinburgh’s first tram. Edinburgh’s first tram was introduced in 1871. By the time they were removed in 1957, there were 47 miles of network.\n- Edinburgh Trams was named ‘Global Light Rail Operator of the Year 2017’ and the UK’s best transport operator for customer satisfaction.\n- Our trams are among the most advanced in Europe, offering a fast, safe, and reliable service that connects the city and the airport with zero on-street carbon emissions.\n- There are 27 trams operating along the current 14 kilometres (8.5 miles) of twin lane tram track from York Place to the airport.\n- The trams have a top speed of 70 kph (43.5 mph). Each tram is 43 metres long, with a capacity of 250 passengers (three times that of a bus).\nTrams to Newhaven Full Business Case FAQs\nWhy has the cost gone up from £165.2m to £207.3m?\nTotal construction costs are now estimated in the Final Business Case (FBC) to be £196m. This includes a significant risk allowance to take account of any foreseen and unforeseen risks to the project.\nOver and above the risk allowance included in the £196m, a further uplift for optimism bias has been added in accordance with government guidelines, taking the total project cost to £207.3m.\nThe initial estimate of £165m in the updated Outline Business Case did not include the uplift for optimism bias and reflected the information available at that point in time. It was always the case that the Council would market test the pricing before making any final decision. As well as market testing there have been other changes which are set out below.\nAs it is approximately 18 months since the updated Outline Business Case was finalised, inflation has been added to the cost plan.\nSince the Outline Business Case was published, we have seen the collapse of Carillion leading to changes in the way risk is analysed and priced by contractors tendering for major infrastructure projects. This is reflected in the tendered prices received.\nThere have also been significant changes made to the design based on feedback received from the community during consultation. This has led to changes in the construction costs to reflect the outcome of the consultation.\nIn order to ensure the team hit the ground running when construction commences, a period of Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) will commence, should the project be approved. This will allow the Council team, contractors, designers and utility providers to co-locate for a period of six months to plan the delivery methodology and phasing in finer detail. This is considered best practice in the industry and is consistent with all other major projects in the UK. This additional six month period is now reflected in the cost plan.\nFinally, following feedback from the public and business community in Leith, the Council have devised a comprehensive package of support measures to help business throughout the works. This includes a business continuity grant fund to help alleviate short-term cash flow issues, dedicated business development champions, business upskilling, logistics hubs, customer service officers, extra help to keep the area clean and attractive and technological solutions to help local business connect more easily with each other and their customers. The total value of this package is approximately £2.4m (including contractor contributions) and is included in the updated costings for the project.\nTaking account of the above, the Council is confident that the project can be delivered within the updated project cost of £207.3m. The FBC outlines that the project remains both affordable and deliverable. This has taken account of various economic, social and environmental factors, with the city set to benefit in all these areas following completion of the line to Newhaven via Leith.\nHow long will construction take?\n- The ECI process will be complete before the end of 2019 and construction will then commence\n- Construction will be split into distinct geographical areas with works lasting anything up 18 months per area. A number of work sites will be open at any one time\n- Once construction in a work area is complete the temporary traffic management will be removed and the street will be handed back for operational use. Any further work to complete an area will be done under localised traffic management with no need to close the entire area again\n- It is anticipated that all construction work will be complete by summer 2022 with testing and commissioning then taking approximately 6 months\nWhen do you expect the Tram to be operational?\nPassenger services are projected to begin in early 2023.\nHas the £20m extraordinary dividend been confirmed by Lothian Buses?\nYes. The dividend has been confirmed over a period of 11 years.\nWhat input has Lothian Buses had to the final business case in terms of the impact on their business?\n- The Council have worked closely with Lothian Buses during the development of the final business case.\n- The Council will continue to work with Lothian Buses closely in developing traffic management arrangements, including the implementation of bus priority measures to speed up journey times to minimise the impact on Lothian buses and its customers by keeping the city moving and placing the provision of public transport high on the agenda.\nHow supportive are the residents of Leith to the tram?\n- Early in 2018, the Council commissioned Progressive Partnership – an independent polling company based in Edinburgh – to carry out an on-street survey on attitudes towards tram. The methodology used ensured that the 370 people who were interviewed were a fair reflection of the demographics of the local area.\n- The outcomes of the survey were very encouraging, especially considering that this research exercise was carried out ahead of the extensive public consultation and engagement with the local community.\n- When asked, unprompted, to suggest what form of transport improvements could be made to the street, the largest number said tram (37%), followed by an improved bus service (28%) and a further 23% who would like to see an improvement in cycling/walking infrastructure.\n- Respondents were also asked whether they believed that the tram would benefit the local area with 59% agreeing (41% strongly agreed) versus 30% who said it would not. Stripping out those who answered ‘neither agree nor disagree’, 66% agree that the area will benefit vs 34% who said it would not.\n- On how likely respondents were to use the tram, 56% said they were likely to use the service, with 25% of all respondents saying they would definitely use the service.\nHow extensively did you consult with the local community and did their input have any effect on the project?\n- During our consultation exercise throughout 2018 with the community, we spoke to thousands of people at our many public information events. As well as this the Council hosted a number of community design workshops which were well attended by a cross section of stakeholders.\n- In doing so the Council have been able to produce an updated set of plans that better reflect the aspirations of the local community. In autumn 2018 the Council presented the updated plans to the public via a series of information events and an online consultation. The results were encouraging, with the majority of people agreeing that they were an improvement on the plans we published earlier in 2018.\nHow did the community respond to the chnages made to the design during the second round of consulation?\n- When asked “to what extent do you agree that the updated plans have given better consideration to active travel provision?”, 80.8% of those expressed a preference agreed.\n- On the updated designs for Elm Row, 76.3% who expressed a prefernce agreed that the new plans have created a better public space for all.\n- Access to and from side streets for motor vehicles was highlighted as a concern during the early stages of consultation. When asked if the new plans had improved access to and from side streets 80.5% who expresses a preference agreed.\n- The permeability of Leith Walk or, in simpler terms, the ability to cross the street easily and safely was improved upon following feedback received. This is demonstrated by 85.1% of all respondents whi expressed a preference agreeing that permeability and crossing points had improved versus previous proposals.\n- The final question focused on a new location for the proposed Balfour Street stop. In all, 86.1% who expressed a preference agreed that moving the stop 60m towards the city and introducing a signalised junction has remedied previous concerns.\nWhat Council services are being reduced to pay for Tram to Newhaven?\n- The tram project will not put additional pressure on existing Council services\n- The Trams to Newhaven project will be paid for through tram fares and a £20m extraordinary dividend from Lothian Buses.\nWhat resources will be put in place to deliver the project should it get the go ahead?\n- The cost plan allows for a project team reporting directly to the Council’s Senior Responsible Officer for the Trams to Newhaven project. This team will provide all required project, contract, commercial, risk, technical and communications management.\n- The contractors will also be mobilising project teams and working in collaboration with the Council’s project team.\nWhat is happening with the Hardie Inquiry?\n- The Council continues to support the Hardie Inquiry\n- The Council has adopted a robust and thorough process in developing the FBC and has incorporated a number of lessons learned from the first phase of tram, including:\n- The use of industry standard contracts to govern the project\n- Rigorous project governance with highly qualified key personnel with experience of delivering light rail projects in the UK and abroad. A number of the project team successfully completed phase 1 of the trams after mediation\n- Setting up cross-industry networks with other cities including Manchester, Birmingham and Dublin to ensure best practice is being adopted at each stage of project development\n- Adopting traffic management plans that provide the contractor with expanded sites to ensure that works can continue in the event that problems are encountered during construction, as well as adopting a “one-dig approach”, ie only opening up roads once and completing all works prior to reinstatement – no double-dig\n- Carrying out robust quantitative risk analysis and ensuring substantial/sufficient? contingency is set aside in the budget for unforeseen events\n- Ensuring robust measures are incorporated into the construction contracts to ensure build quality, with a strong client team present on site to monitor build quality\n- Carrying out comprehensive formal consultation with the market to road-test the overall delivery strategy for the project and encourage strong competition\n- Developing a Support for Business scheme to maintain the vibrancy, desirability and accessibility of the streets affected by the project during construction. Measures include logistics hubs, open for business campaign, on street customer service officers, business skills development and a business continuity fund\n- Ensuring all works are carried out in accordance with the Code of Construction Practice\n- Ensuring that the work underpinning the analysis set out in this report has been robustly scrutinised\nWhat are projected passenger numbers for the Tram to Newhaven project?\nExpected passenger numbers for the first year of operation is 15.7m. This is almost double the projected number of passengers on the line if the Newhaven section is not completed\nWhat is optimism bias?\n- Optimism bias is a percentage added to an overall project cost in order to mitigate potential under-estimation of risk by a project team.\n- In line with government guidance the £207.3m project cost includes an uplift for optimism bias on top of the other risk allowances.\nIndependent survey\nAs part of our consultation, we commissioned an independent survey to understand local behaviours and attitudes towards taking the trams to Newhaven. The research was carried out by Progressive Partnership, an Edinburgh-based market research company. This involved a ten-minute on-street interview with a representative sample of 368 people at three locations along the proposed route.\nWhat people said:\n- 59% agreed that the line would benefit Leith\n- 58% said it would be easier to get around\n- 42% said it would be good for local business\n- 91% were satisfied with current transport provision on Leith Walk\n- When asked what would improve public transport provision in Leith Walk, the most popular response at 38% was ‘introduce a tram service’ NB most respondents currently used buses or walking to get to and around Leith\n- 56% said they were likely to use the new line",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_12_24_speed-survey-data-for-the-edinburgh-20-mph-scheme_comment-page-1/content_506.html": "Below is an update on the data the Council holds in relation to the 20 mph scheme – including a number of streets in my Ward. Keep in mind these are the average speeds, so some vehicles will be going faster.\nSpeed surveys were undertaken by the 20mph team, both before and after the implementation of new 20mph speed limits, at 82 locations (66 new 20mph streets and 16 streets where a 30mph speed limit had been retained) as part of the pre-planned monitoring programme (the summary of these is not included in the attachment).\nIn addition, two further batches of monitoring surveys have been undertaken by the road safety team following the implementation of the citywide 20mph roll out. These covered 198 more locations, where concerns about perceived non-compliance with the 20mph limits had been raised by members of the public, elected members and council officers. We also have a third batch under preparation, currently consisting of 67 locations, where surveys will be undertaken in spring 2020.\nThe locations and results of the surveys undertaken in Batches 1 and 2 can be found below. The Batch 3 table lists lists the 67 locations to be included in Batch 3. Each traffic survey recorded all vehicle movements, 24 hours a day, over a 7 day period and therefore the full results for each survey include recorded speeds for thousands of individual vehicles. The resultant size of the data files mean that it is not practical to circulate the full results of each survey nor to publish this information on the Council’s website. We have therefore provided the average free-flow speeds and traffic volumes recorded at each location.\nThe Committee report can be viewed here. Following the Committee, it became apparent that, due to an administrative error, the appendix did not contain an exhaustive list of all streets about which concerns had been raised. This has now been rectified, and all streets that have been brought to our attention, from 2016 onwards, should now be included within the 3 batches listed.\nOn streets where an average speed of above 24mph has been recorded, the Council’s Road Safety team will carry out an investigation to determine what additional measures are required to support the reduced speed limit.\nPlease note that the traffic surveys listed in the attached are those that have been specifically carried out by the road safety team following the 20mph roll out, at locations where compliance concerns have been raised. If you request a traffic survey, you may be advised that one has already been undertaken recently for another purpose and, in this case, we will share the results of that survey with you. To ensure the best use of our resources, unless there has been a significant infrastructural or environmental change, we will not re-survey a location if it has been surveyed within the last 3 years.\nMonitoring Surveys – Batch 1 (March – April 2019)\n| STREET | LOCATION | AVERAGE SPEED – FREE FLOW | DAILY AVERAGE VOLUME – TWO WAY TRAFFIC |\n| Abbey Mount | north of Abbeyhill | 24.4 | 4152

Out with the City Centre, town centres serve as a focal point for local communities providing a diverse mix of shopping facilities and other commercial and community services.\nOn 18 June the Scottish Government confirmed that, from 29 June, shops with outdoor entrances can reopen. To support this positive change, we are proposing an initial phase of measures targeted to quickly address some of the most pressing issues that people and businesses have told us about. These relate to the narrowness of pavements and street clutter which cause difficulties in achieving safe physical distancing.\nIn this first phase of proposals we aim to create additional space on routes within Morningside and Bruntsfield town centres by widening footways, removing guardrails and street clutter. To widen footways we need to suspend all parking places (apart from loading bays and Disabled persons’ parking places). The streets being considered for these proposals are illustrated in the attached map.\nThe second phase of proposals, which we will share in the coming weeks, will focus on more strategic and complex measures relating to traffic reduction and aiding cycling and public transport provision. Proposals will also align, where possible, with further announcements around the opening of food and drink establishments. We will continue to work with business representatives and individual businesses on how measures can best support town centres as part of the city’s economic recovery. It is essential that the needs of residents and businesses are taken into account as we progress measures benefitting the health, wellbeing and prosperity of the city and region.\nThe proposed measures are part of an overall emergency requirement to re-designate key parts of the road network to facilitate safe travel while meeting physical distancing requirements. Such measures are required urgently to help prevent people from becoming ill or coming to harm by infection from COVID-19 whilst implementing physical distancing requirements.\nThese measures will be implemented under emergency delegated decision-making powers using a Temporary Traffic Regulation Order.\nGiven the urgent nature of these works, normal expectations about community consultations cannot be fulfilled. We urge you to get in touch within five working days or earlier should you want to raise any issues. If you do not have any concerns it would be beneficial if you could also email to let us know. This means we will have responses from all stakeholders and this helps to inform the process.\nPlease note that the deadline for submitting comments is 5.00pm on Friday 26 June 2020.\nIf the proposal is agreed for implementation, formal publicity will then be undertaken so that local people are aware of the changes. A dedicated inbox will help us to manage any feedback around proposals.\nAll comments will be reviewed and summarised in the assessment feedback note to the Council Incident Management Team. Please note that we will not be able to respond to individual emails.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_11_24_making-woodhall-road-safer-for-everyone/content_264.html": "People will be aware that a young girl was hit by a car near 100 Woodhall Road on the 9th of November. I understand she will make a full recovery and is now back at school, but her parents and their neighbours remain concerned about general road safety in the area.\nI met with a resident on the 11th of November to discuss his concerns. Following this, I met with more residents (inc a parent of the injured child) on the the 14th of November.\nBelow is a response from Edinburgh’s Road Safety and Active Travel Manager in relation to matters which arose from these meetings.\nAlthough there is nothing to suggest to me that vehicles accessing either CitiDogs or Tiphereth were involved in the accident, I have contacted both these organisations. Both are committed parts of the local community, and have confirmed that they were already acting to remind people accessing their sites to drive carefully. Although I understand vehicle speed was not the cause of the incident, I have spoken to Police Scotland and asked that they increase enforcement in the area.\nResponse from Edinburgh’s Road Safety and Active Travel Manager\nI can advise you that a desktop study has been completed; it identified that Woodhall Road presents some specific challenges because of its differing characteristics and overall length of some 2.63kms. Consequently, it has three designations in terms of Edinburgh Street Design Guidance – the section from Bridge Road to Bonaly Road is termed as a Retail/High Street, Secondary, the section from Bonaly Road to a point west of the City Bypass is termed as a Low Density Residential Street, Secondary and the section from there westwards from the Bypass to its conclusion is termed as a Rural Road/No Frontage Street, Secondary.\nTherefore, it currently has a mix of 20mph roundels on rural sections and 20mph repeater road signs elsewhere to manage vehicle speeds. The developing plan is to introduce more roundels to support the road signs and introduce locations for Vehicle Activated Speed Signs, to provide consistency along Woodhall Road. However, the proposed speed management measures do not include reducing the road width at any point.\n[name redacted] suggested that traffic calming was required at the junction of Woodhall Road and Torphin Road. The Council’s current approach to the installation of speed reduction measures, including physical traffic calming measures, was set out in a report to the Transport and Environment Committee on 11 October 2019, titled Evaluation of the 20mph Speed Limit Roll Out. Further details were provided within a subsequent report to the Committee on 27 February 2020, titled Approach to Extension of 20mph Limits.\nThe use of physical traffic calming measures will generally only now be considered where there is either a significant history of speed related collisions or where average vehicle speeds remain excessively high following the use of other speed reduction measures.\nThe Council’s Road Safety Team undertakes regular collision investigations into all streets within the city, using the collision details supplied by Police Scotland; which is responsible for the collection of all personal injury road traffic collision data within its force area. From this analysis, it is possible to determine locations where the collision rate is giving cause for concern and where road safety remedial works may require to be implemented.\nIn the latest available three year period (to the end of June 2021) there were no personal injury collisions reported to the Police in Woodhall Road. Please note that the collision retrieval undertaken and any data provided is accurate as of 18 November 2021 and will not yet include the collision to which [name redacted] refers. The current collision history does not support the introduction of physical traffic calming measures in Woodhall Road.\n[name redacted] also referred to challenges crossing Woodhall Road, near its junction with Torphin Road. Each year the Council receives a far greater number of requests for pedestrian crossings than we are able to provide. In order to manage these requests, we have developed a priority system to evaluate locations and the crossing type most suitable for each location. This priority system was approved by the Council’s Transport, Infrastructure and Environment Committee on 28 July 2009.\nThe base data which is used to assess if a location is suitable for a crossing is known as the PV2 value. This is a nationally recognised value that indicates the number of passing vehicles and crossing pedestrians. Pedestrian and vehicle counts are taken over the peak hours of a weekday, from 7am to 10am and 3pm to 6pm, and avoiding school holidays or any other factors which might cause an abnormal result.\nThis base PV2 value is then adjusted to take account of local factors such as the age of those crossing, the composition and speed of passing traffic, the road width, the number of pedestrian accidents and the presence of nearby trip attractors such as schools, doctors’ surgeries, shops etc.\nA location with an adjusted PV2 value of 1 or higher (2 or higher on a dual carriageway) would be considered for a puffin crossing, locations with a value of 0.3 or higher would be considered for a suite of measures that includes a zebra crossing, refuge island or pavement build-outs. If a very low PV2 value is achieved, no additional crossing facilities may be recommended.\nLocations are batched and assessments are carried out when a suitable number are required. The next batch of assessments are programmed to be undertaken in Spring 2022. I will add Woodhall Road, at Torphin Road, to the list and I will advise you of the results as soon as they are available.\nYou subsequently raised a question regarding Woodhall Road being a cul-de-sac beyond Torphin Road. All of the streets beyond the junction of Woodhall Road and Fernielaw Avenue are “No Through Roads” and I will therefore ask my colleagues in our Traffic Signs team to investigate this further and respond to you on potential signs to highlight this.\nI then asked two questions:\nQ1. The speed of vehicles on Woodhall Road is too high (data in file below), and the Council is due to bring forward plans to try to deal with this. Would it be possible to set up a community meeting to allow the residents to see the plans and provide feedback?\nAnswer: The Road Safety team frequently receives requests to meet with members of the public and, unfortunately, we are not generally able to accommodate these without unduly impacting on other work commitments. We can, however, share the proposals with you and the community, via Colinton Community Council perhaps. This would not, however, be a consultation on the types of measures that will be taken forward. The Council’s approach to the installation of speed reduction measures, including physical traffic calming measures, was set out in a report to the Transport & Environment Committee on 11 October 2019, titled Evaluation of the 20mph Speed Limit Roll Out.\nFurther details were provided within a subsequent report to the Committee on 27 February 2020, titled Approach to Extension of 20mph Limits. The types of measures identified in these reports were signage, road markings and vehicle activated speed signs, as well as the potential use of safety cameras and installation of physical traffic calming measures.\nHowever, the use of physical traffic calming measures would generally only be considered where there is either a significant history of speed related collisions or where average vehicle speeds remain excessively high following the use of other speed reduction measures. In all cases, officers will consider the available evidence and use their experience and professional expertise to decide on the most effective solution.\nQ2. The residents are keen to get involved in dealing with the issue… they even mentioned paying for a speed bump! Are there any schemes available to support residents who want to run their own road safety campaign?\nAnswer: An online community toolkit is available at http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/20mphtoolkit with activities and resources to support residents bring speeds down in their local area.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_09_13_we-cant-let-the-car-lobby-stop-the-city-centre-transformation_comment-page-1/content_564.html": "As a new Councillor in Edinburgh I am always grateful for the work that those that came before me undertook to make our city what it is today. There is much to be proud of in terms of our culture, our built environment and our natural heritage.\nFrom a transport perspective we are lucky, the city is well connected with the outside world and we have a publicly owned bus service which is second to none.\nNonetheless, we live in a time of change and challenge where transport is concerned. The combined forces of economic growth, climate change, air pollution and congestion are placing real pressures on our city and those that live in it. The era of the car may not be over, but the notion that we can drive our way out of the challenges our city faces has no future.\nEdinburgh’s solution to the challenges we face is the “Edinburgh City Centre Transformation Strategy“, which aims to move the design of our city centre away from cars and towards people. The emphasis is on creating a city (not just a city centre) where it is easier for people to move around on public transport, foot and bike.\nThe temporal and spatial scale of the proposed change is daunting, but also energising. It’s called a transformation, but it is really a revolution. Indeed, I am reminded of the Edinburgh Bicycle Co-Operative slogan – “The revolution will not be motorised”.\nSo it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are, but our city was not built by those who wanted to wait or look backwards. Those who came before us made certain that this city rode the first waves of the Enlightenment, and this generation can’t founder in the backwash of others where creating a liveable city is concerned.\nTo be clear, the proposed end result will not be revolutionary, it is the process of getting there which is. The end result will be normal if you’ve been to places like Vienna and Copenhagen. To be sure, we are behind these cities right now, and will be behind for some time. But we should not intend to stay behind, and in the next decade, we have a chance to catch up and move ahead.\nSuch a Breath-taking strategy, however, creates new challenges as it dispels old. Key amongst these is ensuring that the accessibility of the city centre continues to improve as the plans develop. More work is also needed to better define the costs and benefits, particularly around public transport connectivity, emissions and air quality.\nCurrently, the costs are estimated to be £314.6m and the benefits £420m, and as this is just a strategy at this stage the optimism bias is 44%. It will be difficult (essentially impossible) for the Council to fund this, so resources will be sought via the Scottish Government (who think £120m for rebuilding Sheriffhall Roundabout is good value) via their STPR2 scheme. This would be part of a regional scheme focussed on connecting the city centre with the suburbs and surrounding towns via world class public / active transport links.\nPolitically, there is strong support in the Council for the strategy with only 3 of the 11 Councillors on the Transport Committee yesterday opposing it – Cllr Susan Webber, Cllr Graeme Hutchison & Cllr Nick Cook. Cllrs Webber and Hutchison admitted at the meeting they knew little (both were substitutes) of the history of the development of the strategy and the massive public consultation exercise which informed its development. It was also suggested that their ringleader, Cllr Nick Cook, had only attended 1 of 8 working groups meetings where it was possible to discuss and steer the project. Instead he chose to describe the strategy as a “plan to strip away pay & display parking and free movement of vehicles in the city centre”. I can’t be convinced anyone wants the “free movement of vehicles in the city centre”, or that introducing it will help manage the combined forces of economic growth, climate change, air pollution and congestion.\nOnce the gang of three lost the argument, however, they did manage to delay the further development of the strategy by demanding it is considered by all 63 Councillors at Full-Council next week. I expect they will repeat the same failed arguments, and lose again.\nWhilst this delay is limited, it is a sign that we all have to do more to convince others of the scale of the challenges we face. In the blog I have borrowed a few phrases from JFK (not for the first time), but I am reminded that in his “Moon Speech” he quoted William Bradford to convey the scale of the challenge. Although the challenge Edinburgh faces is different, the quote is still apt: “all great and honourable actions are accompanied with great difficulties, and both must be enterprised and overcome with answerable courage”.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_10_27_briefing-consultation-on-edinburghs-links-to-slavery-and-colonialism/content_80.html": "Below is a briefing from the Council on the work of The Edinburgh Slavery and Colonialism Legacy Review Group, chaired by Professor Sir Geoff Palmer OBE. As Black History Month draws to a close, the Group has launched a survey to allow people in Edinburgh to inform its work.\nWe have a duty to be open and honest about Edinburgh links with slavery and colonialism, and to understand what the perception is now and what could make it better. This need not be about destroying our heritage, but we have to reflect on how it is funded and ensure everyone feels valued, welcomed and safe in our city.\nBriefing\nCitizens are being encouraged to have their say on the Capital’s historical links to slavery and colonialism and how they should be remembered and addressed in today’s Edinburgh.\nIn 2020, the Black Lives Matter movement brought international attention to important issues relating to ongoing racism in society. As part of a wider response to the movement, the City of Edinburgh Council committed to ensuring that commemorations of Edinburgh’s history are appropriate for society today – and future generations. The Council therefore commissioned an independent review of the City’s historic links with Slavery and Colonialism in the public realm.\nAs part of its work, the Edinburgh Slavery and Colonialism Legacy Review Group is seeking the views of Edinburgh residents and stakeholders about a selection of prominent features which it considers representative of the many aspects of Edinburgh life and society shaped by this legacy. It wants to hear thoughts about the most constructive ways that the City could address this history for the benefit of all in the future.\nWhilst there are a significant number of monuments, buildings, street names and other features in the public spaces of the Capital today which could be considered, this consultation does not try to reference every one of these. Instead, it provides a representative selection of 41, separated into different themes or relating to a particular aspect of this history. For example, international trade and the profits from slavery and colonialism, the role of the military in sustaining slavery and colonialism and inspiring individual stories.\nThe Group hopes that this approach will help to illustrate the many different elements of Edinburgh life which have been touched by the legacy of slavery or colonialism.\nThe online consultation is hosted on the Council’s website here. It is open for 12 weeks from 27 October 2021 to 19 January 2022.",

I support this despite the following reservations with respect to the schemes that touch on my Ward:\n- The public should be involved in the further review of the Braid Road and Comiston Road schemes, and these should be considered together.\n- Many will welcome the removal of the Lanark Road scheme, but I would have preferred greater dialogue with the local community about this as there may be some aspects they want retained.\n- I’m concerned that a way could not be found to do more to improve the environment for pedestrians.\nThere has been a lack of clarity for some time regarding the aims the Braid Road and Comiston Road schemes. The reviews need to clearly define this, and work with residents to establish the best way forward.\nI can’t say if the amendment below will be accepted, but I do hope that it is part of the discussion at the Transport & Environment Committee and that all the Councillors there can reach consensus on a way forward that meets Edinburgh’s needs.\nAmendment as agreed by the Labour Group in Edinburgh.\nCommittee:\n- Welcomes the high level of public engagement through the consultation and recognises the complexity of competing needs expressed around road space allocation, particularly in ensuring accessibility.\n- Notes that officer recommendations are based on:\n- Public consultation\n- Market Research\n- Stakeholder surveys\n- Assessment against previously agreed criteria\n- Assessment in light of existing transport policy and direction\n- To better reflect the consultation responses of residents and businesses, in particular where feedback has been fairly definitive in the views of respondents, Committee agrees to:\n- Remove the scheme at Lanark Road, as one of this scheme’s main purposes was to relieve lockdown pressure on the water of Leith paths. However requests officers retain the speed limit at 30mph which has improved safety for all residents and consider any actions to minimise conflict on the water of Leith path-users at this section.\n- Ask officers to further engage with the local residents and community reps ahead of an ETRO to further address resident parking pressure along the Longstone Corridor.\n- Bring a report to the next Transport and Environment Committee on options for modifications to Silverknowes Road South, including the removal of the scheme.\n- Bring a report to the next Transport and Environment Committee on options for Comiston Road, to improve public transport connectivity and reduce impacts on local residents.\n- Bring a report to the next Transport and Environment Committee on options for modifications to Drum Brae North based on the concerns expressed through the consultation.\n- Bring a report to the next Transport and Environment Committee on options for retaining Forrest Road and George IV Bridge, based on the support identified in the consultation, until the permeant scheme can be implemented- including options to accelerate the delivery of those schemes.\n- Bring a report to the next Transport and Environment Committee on Braid Road, with options for the reopening of the road in both directions, including analysis of impacts on traffic levels, resident connectivity and vulnerable road users walking, wheeling and cycling.\n- Improve signage at West Harbour Road/West Shore Road to more clearly inform motorists of the closure and increase disabled parking bays at the closer point to improve disabled access.\n- Agree the remaining recommendations for schemes as set out in the report however also agrees to:\n- Continue to work with Living Streets, local businesses and the access panel to explore long term replacements for the Shopping Streets schemes being removed to give adequate safe space for pedestrians.\n- Continue to make any changes required to improve safety and accessibility for residents and disabled people for all other schemes progressing to an ETRO through those statutory processes.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_08_29_update-on-the-traffic-signals-at-fairmilehead-crossroads_comment-page-1/content_282.html": "Below is an update on the traffic signals at Fairmilehead Crossroads. A few years ago I was promised that this junction would be completely overhauled, and that this could address the issues vehicles turning right from Buckstone Terrace on to Oxgangs Road face. This has now been “reprioritised”, but after a bit of fuss the Council has agreed to upgrade the signals infrastructure. As part of this the junction will be improved for pedestrians (esp those with visual impairments) and changes to the right turn on to Oxgangs Road will be considered.\nI am also in the process of asking the Council about the very short green man time of the Biggar Road leg of the junction.\nFairmilehead Crossroads Update\nThank you for your enquiry of 18 August 2021 on behalf of your constituent regarding the introduction of a right turn filter into the traffic signal sequence at the above location. I was sorry to hear of the issues your constituent is experiencing whilst traversing through the junction.\nThe traffic signal sequence currently has a right turn filter for vehicles turning from Biggar Road into Frogston Road West. This movement has a very high flow with the opposing vehicles turning right into Oxgangs Road relatively low.\nTo allow for the introduction of two opposing right turn manoeuvres, they would need to be separately signalled on a red/amber/green signal and the north/south movements stopped to allow for this to happen.\nAlternatively, the north/south movements would have to operate separately as per the current east west movement. However, the current road layout does not allow for the separate signalling of the right turners. If the north/south movement was to run separately this would lead to lengthy delays on all arms of the junction and an increase to pedestrian waiting times.\nAlthough there are junction improvement works programmed for this location we are only upgrading the traffic signal infrastructure and not the actual junction constraints or road layout.\nLike many junctions across the UK vehicles turning right into Oxgangs Road are expected to do so in gaps when it is safe to do so or at the end of the stage during the safety period from one stage leaving green to the next stage receiving a green signal (intergreen). As a measure of comfort, the intergreen period for this manoeuvre has been increased by 40%.\nAs part of the junction improvement works, the junction timings will be looked at in detail to try and find any efficiency measures that can be introduced to improve the overall operation of the junction. However, it should be noted that the current constraints of the junction layout may mean that it is operating as efficiently as it can.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_06_12_being-honest-about-who-is-cutting-edinburghs-budget/content_610.html": "Of course, SNP Council Leader Adam McVey is correct to highlight the impact “Tory Austerity” is having on Edinburgh (Opinion, 11-06-18). Their ideological squeeze on public spending combined with their assault on the welfare system makes it harder for Edinburgh to be all it can be.\nThat, however, is only part of the story. We know that in the five years since 2013-14, funding for day-to-day council funding from the Scottish Government has decreased by 7.1% but the UK Government only cut the Scottish Government’s revenue budget by 1.8%. On average across Scotland, the SNP have cut Council spending by £148 per person but in Edinburgh the cut has been even bigger – £226 per person.\nIt is within that context that services in Edinburgh are being cut, charges are rising, projects are delayed, services are failing and that people in our Capital will soon be forced to pay to have their garden waste collected. This should anger us all.\nEdinburgh’s Labour Councillors have responded by spearheading the debate on introducing a modest “hotel tax” to help fund services for visitors and tourists alike. This has massive public support, but the SNP and the Tories continue to oppose giving Edinburgh this power – they are hand-in-glove on holding us back.\nThis is not the only area where the SNP Government is holding back Edinburgh. On everything from Airbnb to Uber, they simply will not give out Capital the powers to act.\nThe SNP spent their conference in Aberdeen last week spouting the tired old line about being “Stronger for Scotland”, I just wish their Edinburgh branch office would stand up for our Capital. The first step in doing that must surely be to be honest about who is cutting our budget.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_12_19_only-progressive-parties-in-holyrood-can-now-protect-edinburghs-budget/content_632.html": "Last month COSLA reported that the Scottish Government had cut Council funding 10 times more than Tory austerity over the past five years. Although this highlighted the fact that SNP cuts to council funding were politically driven, the recent increase in Scotland’s block grant coupled with Holyrood’s substantial revenue raising powers meant there was hope that the nationalists would choose a different path for 2019/20.\nIt is now clear, however, that Edinburgh’s budget has been cut by £10m more than anticipated – meaning that Scotland’s capital has £39m of “savings” to make (report, 20/12/18). Anyone who thinks that can be done without impact on Edinburgh’s schools, parks, footpaths, waste collection and social care system needs to think again.\nIndeed, even Edinburgh’s Green Councillors, who backed the cuts to our capital over the past two years, have raised concerns. Cllr Gavin Corbett was clear: “I can’t recall a bleaker financial outlook in my seven years of working on budgets”.\nThe size of the cut raises serious questions about Edinburgh’s nationalist Council Leader’s strategy of having quiet chats with his masters in Holyrood to ensure our capital gets a fair deal. This cunning plan has failed spectacularly.\nThe SNP’s Finance and Resources Convenor appears to be taking a more realistic approach, he said there is “still a chance that the SNP’s negotiations with other parties to get the budget passed at Holyrood would result in more money becoming available” (report. 19/12/18).\nThat’s right, that SNP Councillor is actually hoping more progressive parties in Holyrood can lever a better deal out of his own party!\nThe truth is that the Finance and Resources Convenor is correct. Progressive opposition parties are now the key to protecting vulnerable people in Edinburgh, and I hope none backs these cuts.\nThe Scottish budget must deliver investment to cut poverty, grow the economy and ensure proper funding for public services. Labour’s key demands are as follows:\n– Proper funding for councils to stop the cuts to schools and services\n– A £5 per week increase in Child Benefit and an end to the two-child cap on tax credits\n– A freeze on ScotRail fares in the New Year\n– A women’s health fund to further research and support for women-specific conditions\n– A £10million cash injection into discretionary housing payments to help tackle the roll out of Universal Credit\n– A £20million Community Policing Fund to reverse local police cuts",

The regrettable introduction of charging for garden waste and the move to restrict waste collection to four days per week (Tuesday to Friday) has clearly put huge demands on Council Officers. Nonetheless, mailing out almost 100,000 letters with errors is a costly mistake, I estimate it will have cost £50,000, and will cause further reputational damage. It is becoming increasingly clear to me that major changes to the waste system should be robustly piloted if we are to avoid some of the problems we have witnessed over the past 6 months.\nAs part of the 2018/19 budget setting process, approval was given to introduce a new kerbside collection shift pattern in the waste collection service. This new shift pattern (working from Tuesday to Friday each week) will mean that night time collections of individual bins will no longer be required, residents will have the benefit of having a more consistent collection schedule and there will be less impact on Bank/Public Holiday Mondays as there will be no requirement for collections to be scheduled on these days. This change will affect approximately 175,000 properties.\nAs part of the changes to bin collection days across the city, officers identified that some properties would experience what was felt to be an unacceptable period of time between their normal frequency of collection. A decision was made to offer additional collections this weekend (6 and 7 October) and next weekend (13 and 14 October) for properties that would have a change of more than seven days between the collection date on their old and new calendars.\nAs a result of a data error, in what has been a complex process, a number of properties were given incorrect information about their additional collection in a letter they received last week. We have now written to all affected properties and they will receive letters with the correct information about their additional collections from Wednesday, ahead of the new calendars coming into effect on 8 October. Of the 95,124 properties affected:\n- 52,149 were not told about an additional collection they are due\n- 39,440 were incorrectly told about an additional collection where there isn’t one for their service\n- 3,535 were given incorrect information about the bin type that is due for an extra collection\nIn addition, a small percentage of the properties which had signed up for our new garden waste service received information meant for residents who hadn’t registered for the service. We are quickly contacting all these affected residents and ensuring they receive permits and calendars ahead of the new service starting.\nWe have additional resource in our contact centre to deal with the changes to our bin collection services and residents are encouraged to contact us if they have any questions or issues. They can get in touch by emailing waste@edinburgh.gov.uk or calling us on 0131 608 1100 (option 1, then option 9).",

Of the 7 Councillors along the route, the following took part: Cllrs Doggart, Rust & Watt. Cllr Main joined the discussions just as they concluded, and Cllrs Cook & Ross could not make it. The Transport Convener, Cllr Lesley MacInnes, also could not make it.\nThe tone adopted by the Council Officers was conciliatory and they recognized that there was some unease about what is planned. They stated that the consultation generated 36 supportive comments, but were less clear on how many were against (a claim “100 plus” went unchallenged).\nGeneral points:\n- Once this route is complete, they hope to connect Greenbank Church to the Meadows using “quiet streets”.\n- They have no cycle / pedestrian data for Comiston Road.\n- They have tried to limit the loss of parking spaces.\n- It was stated that placing a cycle path between the footpath and parking spaces is “uncommon” in Edinburgh.\n- Lothian Buses were not consulted, but a meeting was held yesterday and they were reported as being “content”. Some details on the size of bus stops is being clarified – this is for busy stops and for wheelchair users.\n- Phase 1 will see the cycle lanes stop 15m before bus stops.\n- The waste team have been consulted (bin collections) as well as the road gritting team.\n- It was clear that the Council does not plan to undertake a “Road Safety Audit” until after Phase one of the works are compete(!).\n- Once complete, the scheme will be reviewed on a three week cycle.\n- It was asserted that the measures may become permanent in some form.\nThe issues I focused were the lack of detailed risk assessments, plans for Braid Road & the failure to address safety concerns of residents living along the route.\nI was clear that the Council needs to undertake a Road Safety Audit and meet with residents along the route before the plans are finalized. There was no vote, but I think most (if not all) Councillors agreed with this (as did the Fairmilehead Community Council Rep). This request will be discussed with the Director of Place on Monday.\nBraid Road was due to be considered today but the meeting was cancelled due to ill-health. However, we were told “all options are on the table”.\nUseful links:\nComiston Road Consultation\nComiston Road Consultation Report\nComiston Road Phase 1 & 2",

Of course, I was too nervous to even speak so failed to invite her to my Ward(!). I performed the same duty two further times, and each time I was impressed by her attention to detail, and the grace with which she conducted herself.\nThe 2022 ceremony was one of her last public events. I had read reports of her failing health, but was reassured when I saw her bright eyes and broad smile.\nI accepted the news of her death with great sadness, but I also felt grateful for the many years of service HM The Queen gave the UK and the Commonwealth. The 48 hours she spent in Edinburgh so soon after her death, however, also left me feeling immensely proud that Edinburgh did not let down HM The Queen when the whole world was watching. I have never been prouder to say I am a citizen of Edinburgh.\nIn my time as a Councillor I have attended three street parties associated with HM The Queen and her reign. These were not gatherings of ardent monarchists where God Save the Queen was sang, but a chance for communities to come together. At these events, HM The Queen was like some sort of distant relative that we all shared and gave us all something in common. What we have seen across the UK since her death reinforced this view.\nThroughout her reign HM The Queen encouraged us to focus on what we had in common, not what divided us. Her death has only amplified that message. It may sound hopelessly naïve, but I hope that can be her lasting legacy.",

It is great that this action has been suspended, but huge damage to Edinburgh’s international reputation could have been avoided if the SNP/Green Government had tabled this “fair pay deal” offer 3 weeks ago. We have known from the start that only the Scottish Government had the cash available to end this crisis.\nBelow is the latest briefing on the recovery from the strike – many thanks to everyone who provided feedback on this issue! Like many people in my Ward, I am very happy that my grey bin will be getting collected next week!\nGenerally, the recovery is going well but backlogs remain regarding communal bins and litter bins outside the city centre.\nCouncil Briefing\nTrade Unions have suspended planned strike action from 6 – 14 September while their members vote on whether or not to accept the most recent national pay offer.\nWe have updated our recovery plan to take account of this and are now advising the following.\nKerbside collections\n- Kerbside collections will run according to their normal schedules next week, except for garden waste and blue box glass collections, which remain suspended but will recommence from 13 September.\n- Residents should put their bins out for collection by 6am on their normal collection day. If their bin is not collected on its scheduled day, they should leave it out and we’ll get to it as soon as we can.\n- Gull proof sack and red box collections will also be collected on their usual days and should be put out by 6am.\n- Extra waste will be collected and should be bagged and left neatly beside the bin. If possible, put extra mixed recycling in a clear bag.\nThe suspension of garden waste and blue box glass collections will allow us to divert resources to cleansing and waste collections. We apologise for any inconvenience this causes and will be in touch with garden waste customers with details of how we’ll compensate for any missed collections caused by strike action.\nCommunal collections\nWe will continue to collect excess waste and residents are being advised to bag it and place it beside the bin. If possible, they should put mixed recycling in a clear bag.\nLarge bulky items, like furniture and mattresses, should not be left beside bins. We are advising people to book an appointment to take these to a recycling centre.\nStreet cleaning\nOur street cleaning teams have made good progress in the city centre, as well as working with waste collection teams to clear excess waste. They will continue to focus their work in town centres, areas with high footfall and high-density areas\nAdditional information\nThere may be some delays to collections, and it may take a while to get back to normal.\nWe’re collecting recycling and non-recyclable waste bins separately. Unfortunately, in some cases recycling bins will have too much non-recyclable waste in them. This means we will not be able to recycle the contents of those. We will recycle as much as we can.\nThis information will be shared with media, on social media and with our partners. I would appreciate it if you’re able to share the guidance with your residents and networks.\nYou can find full details of bin collection days, the recovery plan and advice on dealing with waste on the Council website.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_08_15_wearing-a-cycle-helmet-it-makes-sense_comment-page-1/content_407.html": "I cycled a lot as a child after learning to ride on a friend’s Raleigh Chopper. This was mainly with a second hand bike an auntie obtained from her neighbour, but then a Raleigh Grifter (my brother’s) and a Halford’s Vitesse road bike. By the time I left Kirkcaldy for university in Dundee in 1987, however, these bikes were past their best and replacements were unaffordable.\nOnce I started my PhD in 1992, I bought a bike – a Diamondback Curaca. What had changed in the intervening 5 years was that cycle helmets had become more common. I bought one with my new bike as it made sense, but found it was not unusual to be pointed at by pedestrians in Dundee where I lived. We moved to Edinburgh in 1996 and I found that cycle helmets were more common (and the drivers were less aggressive).\nI have cycled a lot since then – mostly commuting, but I have toured Scotland (inc the Outer Hebrides), England, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. The vast majority of the time (99.9%) I wore a helmet because it still made sense to me, and when my kids came along they wore them too.\nSince 1992 I think I’ve had 6 proper accidents on my bike: two due to ice, one in my drive, two with cars (their fault, one driver was charged) and one on the canal towpath in Edinburgh. I don’t think my helmet was damaged in any of these, but there was one broken arm and a few scraped knees. Nonetheless I was glad I was wearing it.\nOn the 10th of August 2021 I spotted this tweet:\nI saw this and thought of a recent incident in my Ward where a SUV driver had pulled out in front of cyclist using a Spaces for People lane (the junction has now been made safer). The cyclist’s bike was destroyed but a trip to A&E showed that he had been relatively lucky in terms of physical injuries. Like Storm Huntly above, he was clear that he thought his helmet had saved him – an uncontroversial observation which I accepted. In responses to Storm Huntly’s tweet, I retold his story on Twitter and encouraged people to wear a helmet – “Wear a helmet!” I said.\nI did not get quite the response I expected. Three replies stand out:\n- “As there are, overall, many more pedestrian, car driver and bath/shower user injuries do you recommend helmet wearing for them too Scott?” – Cllr David Key\n- “I’m in the business of selling helmets and I don’t recommend wearing a helmet. It’s a personal choice. I doubt this ‘saved Storm’s life’. Probably saved a bump or an abrasion, though.” – Hart’s Cyclery\n- “There is no evidence that cycle hats reduce either mortality or morbidity for transport cyclists. This is due to risk compensation by riders, increased aggression from motorists and a few cases where a cycle hat causes injury in a fall. Hats are not the answer – segregation is.” – Overlander\nNow, it is important to note that none of these people are saying that people should not wear helmets. They are however trying to say that the risk of an accident while cycling is low compared to other everyday activities, and that investing in cycle lanes is the best way to reduce the risks associated with cycling. Nonetheless, I found the scepticism about the benefits of wearing a helmet interesting.\nOf course, it is possible to argue for changes to road network which reduce the likelihood of incidents whilst also making the case for measures which reduce their consequences. Indeed, this is entirely sensible as we know that around 16% of fatal / serious cyclist incidents reported to the police do not involve a collision with another\nvehicle, but are caused by the rider losing control of their bicycle. Furthermore, peer reviewed research has concluded that helmet wearing is beneficial “especially in situations with an increased risk of single bicycle crashes, such as on slippery or icy roads”.\nIndeed, in many places in the UK we are a million years away from having safe cycling networks to get us from A to B. Even where they so exist they tend to make the safest section safer, but offer little support at junctions (see Lanark Road).\nI think RoSPA sums up my feelings pretty well:\nIn 2018, 99 cyclists were killed, 4,106 were seriously injured and 13,345* were slightly injured on Great Britain’s roads. Although cyclists suffer a number of different types of injury during accidents, head injury has been identified as an important cause of death and serious injury in cycling collisions. One way in which cyclists can prevent or reduce the extent of a head injury in a cycle accident is to wear a cycle helmet… …we strongly recommend that cyclists wear a cycle helmet. However, it is important to remember that cycle helmets do not prevent crashes from happening. It is therefore vital that through infrastructure improvements, supported by education and training that we reduce the primary risk factors.\nThe Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents\nOf course, we live in an era where we have instant access to information and misinformation. If you don’t believe the earth is spherical, the Covid-19 vaccines are safe or the the Climate Emergency is real there are websites which will cater for your views. The debate about cycling helmets is no different, but is based on the perceived uncertainty regarding the benefits of wearing a helmet rather than conspiracy theories.\nA quick look at Google Scholar suggests that there is a fair bit of work being undertaken in this area. I searched for “cycle helmet” from 2000 – 2021 and ranked the return by relevance, and these were the top 20 results:\n- Non‐legislative interventions for the promotion of cycle helmet wearing by children – This observed that “helmets reduce bicycle‐related head injuries, particularly in single vehicle crashes and those where the head strikes the ground”, and that “non‐legislative interventions appear to be effective in increasing observed helmet use, particularly community‐based interventions and those providing free helmets”.\n- The impact of compulsory cycle helmet legislation on cyclist head injuries in New South Wales, Australia – This concluded “we have identified evidence of a positive effect of compulsory cycle helmet legislation on cyclist head injuries at a population level such that repealing the law cannot be justified”.\n- Emotional reactions to cycle helmet use – This found that “cycling with a helmet did not lead to increased speed, or to changes in emotional reactions as would have been expected from a risk compensation perspective”, but did note “those who use helmets often cycle more slowly when not wearing a helmet“.\n- Performance analysis of motor cycle helmet under static and dynamic loading – Not relevant.\n- The impact of compulsory cycle helmet legislation on cyclist head injuries in New South Wales, Australia: A rejoinder – This paper challenges the conclusion of Paper 2 above and suggests the helmets “protect at best 10%-15% of cycling related head injuries”, and concludes “Bicycle helmets may provide a small benefit for some types of low speed crashes, but the conclusion that there needs to be mandatory helmet legislation for all adults and children is not justified”.\n- Cycle helmet ownership and use; a cluster randomised controlled trial in primary school children in deprived areas – This observes that “bicycle helmets afford protection against head and brain injuries to wearers of all ages involved in all types of crash, whether or not another vehicle is involved. Although childhood cycle injuries appear to be reducing in incidence, there were still more than 7500 children under 16 admitted to NHS hospitals between 1991 and 1995 with bicycle related head injuries… There is a steep social class gradient in mortality from pedal cycle injury, with children from social class V having a mortality rate four times higher than children from social class I.”. This paper concludes that “an educational pack plus a form to order a free cycle helmet is an effective way of increasing bicycle helmet ownership and use and reduces inequalities in helmet ownership among children in deprived areas”.\n- Demographic, socioeconomic, and attitudinal associations with children’s cycle-helmet use in the absence of legislation – Behind paywall.\n- Inequalities in cycle helmet use: cross sectional survey in schools in deprived areas of Nottingham – This concludes that “programmes aimed at preventing head injury among child cyclists will need to address the inequality in helmet ownership that exists between children residing in deprived and non-deprived areas”.\n- Cycle helmet wearing in 2002 – See Paper 10.\n- Cycle helmet wearing in 2004 – This is a regular report which has been published since 1994. It shows that cycling helmet usage has been increasing amongst adults, but less so with children.\n- Increasing cycle helmet use in school-age cyclists: an intervention based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour – This observed that “helmets reduced the risk of head and brain injury by 63%-88%” and studied measure to increase the numbers of children wearing helmets.\n- Systematic reviews of bicycle helmet research – This article concluded that “there is good evidence that bicycle helmets are effective in reducing head and facial injury in the event of a crash, and that helmet legislation is also likely to be effective at a population level, although high quality controlled research must continue. We know that non-legislative interventions are effective in increasing helmet wearing rates in children, particularly community-based programs that provide free helmets.”\n- Changes in head injury with the New Zealand bicycle helmet law – This questions the efficacy of making helmets compulsory at a time when the number of people wearing helmets is increasing. It concludes that “the large increases in wearing with helmet laws have not resulted in any obvious change over and above existing trends, helmet laws and major helmet promotion campaigns are likely to prove less beneficial and less cost effective than proven road-safety measures, such as enforcement of speed limits and drink-driving laws, education of motorists and cyclists and treatment of accident black spots and known hazards for cyclists.”\n- Cycle Helmet Performance in the Real World – Not peer reviewed(?) and contains no references. It concludes that the “clearest outcome of promoting helmet use has been to increase the public’s perception of cycling as a dangerous activity, leading many people to forego the overall health benefits they might otherwise enjoy. Research has shown that helmet promotion campaigns are linked strongly to a decrease in the number of people cycling”.\n- Head injuries to bicyclists and the New Zealand bicycle helmet law – This paper concludes that “the helmet law has been an effective road safety intervention that has lead to a 19% reduction in head injury to cyclists over its first 3 years.”\n- The impact of mandatory helmet-use legislation on the frequency of cycling to school and helmet use among adolescents – This concludes that “the implementation of the helmet-use law did not have a negative impact on the frequency of cycling to school.”\n- A computational simulation study of the influence of helmet wearing on head injury risk in adult cyclists – This paper concludes that “bicycle helmets are effective in reducing the severity of head injuries sustained in common accidents.” and that helmets were effective over the entire range of cycle speeds studies, up to and including 14 m/s (31.2 mph)”.\n- The impact of mandatory helmet law on the outcome of maxillo facial trauma: a comparative study in Kerala – Not relevant.\n- Application of Reverse Engineering and Impact Analysis of Motor Cycle Helmet – Not relevant.\n- MADYMO simulation of children in cycle accidents: A novel approach in risk assessment – This paper concluded that “wearing a cycle helmet was found to reduce the probability of head injuries, reducing the average probability of fatality over the scenarios studied from 40% to 0.3%.”\nI then searched for “bicycle helmet” from 2000 – 2021 and ranked the return by relevance, and these were the top 20 results:\n- The risk compensation theory and bicycle helmets – This paper suggest that when wearing a helmet cyclists may take more risk. The paper explains why this may be the case, but offers no empirical evidence. The authors note “The empirical difficulty with establishing the relevance of risk compensation to cycle helmets is that, compared with other activities such as motoring, there is a shortage of reliable data.”\n- Effect of legislation on the use of bicycle helmets – This paper documents how in Canada the “rate of helmet use rose dramatically after legislation was enacted” in 1997 and that the “proportion of injured cyclists with head injuries in 1998/99 was half that in 1995/96”\n- Risk compensation and bicycle helmets – These researchers observed 35 volunteers cycling down a short hill with and without helmets. They found that “routine helmet users reported higher experienced risk and cycled slower when they did not wear their helmet“. However, for “cyclists not accustomed to helmets, there were no changes in speed, perceived risk, or any other measures when cycling with versus without a helmet“. The paper concludes that the “findings are consistent with the notion that those who use helmets routinely perceive reduced risk when wearing a helmet, and compensate by cycling faster”.\n- Oblique impact testing of bicycle helmets – This paper concluded that the “current helmet designs provide adequate protection for typical oblique impacts onto a road surface, in terms of the peak linear and rotational head accelerations“.\n- Bicycle helmets–A case of risk compensation? – This paper is from the same authors as Paper 3 in the first list and Paper 3 in this list. The researchers conclude: “The results give less support to a risk-compensation explanation, in particular because the speeding behaviour of the speed-happy group is more connected to other types of equipment than to bicycle helmets. The helmet is more or less just one element in the total equipment package. So it is not because of the helmet that these cyclists ride fast; they use all the equipment (including helmets) because they want to ride fast.”\n- Bicycle helmets–To wear or not to wear? A meta-analyses of the effects of bicycle helmets on injuries – There are three key conclusions here – (1) Bicycle helmets reduce head injury by 48% and serious head injury by 60%; (2) Bicycle helmets reduce face injury by 23% and do not increase cervical spine injury; and, (3) Bicycle helmet effects are larger in single bicycle crashes than in collisions. The final sentence in the paper – “Thus, for an individual cyclist, the results suggest that wearing a helmet can be recommended, especially in situations with an increased risk of single bicycle crashes, such as on slippery or icy roads.”\n- Bicycle helmets – Behind a paywall, but the abstract notes “the bicycle helmet is a very effective device that can prevent the occurrence of up to 88% of serious brain injuries.”\n- Bicycle helmets work when it matters the most – This paper concludes that “injury prevention programs should advocate the use of helmets in bicycle riders especially in the teenage group where least compliance with bicycle helmet use was observed.”\n- Protective effect of different types of bicycle helmets – This is behind a paywall but recommends the use of hard shell helmets over foam ones.\n- The efficacy of bicycle helmets against brain injury – this paper re-analysed data from 1987–1998 which was used by a separate study to conclude that cycle helmets prevent serious injury to the brain. This paper concluded that the “analysis does not provide scientific evidence that bicycle helmets, not being tested for capacity to mitigate the main factors that cause serious injury to the brain, do reduce it” and that “the Australian policy of compulsory wearing of helmets lacks a basis of verified efficacy against brain injury”.\n- Bicycle helmets and risky behaviour: A systematic review – this paper built on the the work of Paper 3 and 5 in this first list, and Paper 3 the first list. The researchers conclude: “review found little to no support for the hypothesis bicycle helmet use is associated with engaging in risky behaviour”.\n- The Cochrane Collaboration and bicycle helmets – This is from the same researcher as Paper 10 and again critiques the work of others. This time it is noted that the Cochrane review Helmets for preventing head and facial injuries in bicyclists took no account of the “scientific knowledge of types and mechanisms of brain injury”.\n- Differences in impact performance of bicycle helmets during oblique impacts – This research evaluated 10 helmet designs and noted significant variations in performance.\n- Heat transfer variations of bicycle helmets – Not relevant.\n- Increasing the use of bicycle helmets: lessons from behavioral science – This paper focused on measurers to encourage younger people to wear cycle helmets.\n- Protection performance of bicycle helmets – This study presents a helmet test method that considers oblique impact in addition to drop tests, as well as brain tolerance limits based on recent biomechanical research.\n- Bicycle helmets: a review of their effectiveness: a critical review of the literature – This is a DoT report which considered the case for making cycle helmets mandatory. It made this observation – “There is now a considerable amount of scientific evidence that bicycle helmets have been found to be effective at reducing head, brain and upper facial injury in bicyclists. Such health gains are apparent for all ages, though particularly for child populations.”\n- Bicycle helmets and the law – Behind a paywall.\n- Testing of bicycle helmets for preadolescents – This is not peer reviewed(?). This study aims to provide guidelines for a helmet testing procedure especially designed for preadolescents.\n- Nonuse of bicycle helmets and risk of fatal head injury: a proportional mortality, case–control study – This study concludes that “not wearing a helmet while cycling is associated with an increased risk of sustaining a fatal head injury. Policy changes and educational programs that increase the use of helmets while cycling may prevent deaths.”\nSo what do these 40 papers tell us? Firstly, it is broadly accepted cycle helmets are effective at reducing the likelihood of death or head, brain and upper facial injury – this makes sense. This finding fuelled studies considering how to increase the the number of children using helmets, particularly from more deprived areas. It also appears that the cyclists wearing helmets tend not to take more risks – i.e. there is scepticism about the “risk compensation”.\nThe main controversary in the field appears to be whether not making helmets mandatory is justified. This issue is that it makes it is just another barrier to people starting to cycle (some studies contradict this). This is understandable as most novice cyclists will buy a cheap bike, and then are stung for the extras – lights, lock & helmet. At a minimum, this will come in at £50, but could easily be double that.\nI guess the other question is how dangerous is cycling really? Is cycling really safer than driving as some suggest? In 2019 alone, 100 pedal cyclists were killed, 4,333 seriously injured and 12,451 slightly injured in the UK (2020 was far higher). However, based on time spent travelling a cyclist is 500% more likely to have a fatal accident than a car driver – they are vulnerable road users. However, that’s still only one fatality every 9,000,000 bike rides and let’s not forget that for individuals shifting from cars to bicycles the estimated beneficial effects of increased physical activity are “substantially larger than potential mortality due to increased air pollution exposure and traffic accidents“.\nIs cycling more dangerous that walking? This is an odd question as pedestrian already have the segregated lanes cyclists want (i.e footpaths!). FullFact looked at this, and concluded: “The overall and KSI casualty rate per billion kilometres travelled is greater for cycling than walking, suggesting that the former is more dangerous on this measure”.\nCycling being more dangerous than walking and driving is why we need to invest in well designed and maintained cycling infrastructure in the UK and elsewhere. We have seen progress on this in recent years in Edinburgh, but the flawed approach since Covid-19 has polarised the debate here.\nThere is a also a growing case for for 20mph schemes in the UK. The European Transport Safety Council notes – “At speeds of below 30 km/h, cyclists can mix with motor vehicles in relative safety.” and that “Traffic calming measures in 30 km/h zones are essential to discourage drivers from exceeding the speed limit.”\nWe also should not pretend that investing in cycling infrastructure can lead to a situation where we have no incidents . In the Netherland where levels of cycling are far higher than the UK and the infrastructure is far better, the number of cyclists being killed there is very similar to here despite that country only having about a third of the population. The story is worse for for Denmark. Indeed, in the Netherlands and Denmark 5-6 people per million each year when cycling (in the UK it is 1.6 people per million), and most of these deaths are due to collisions with vehicles (see the chart at the bottom of this page). The higher number of deaths is explained by the fact that people cycle far more in these countries – the death rate per kilometre cycled is 50% higher in the UK.\nNonetheless, the Dutch Road Safety Research Foundation (in a report commissioned by the Dutch Transport Ministry) predicts that if cyclists in the Netherlands always wore a helmet, there would be 85 fewer road deaths a year.\nThis means that whilst improving the safety for cyclists in the UK is essential, even when we achieve the level of the Netherlands and Denmark incidents will still occur. It is therefore important that we think about how we reduce the impact of the incidents that will continue to occur with or without a step change in the provision of high quality cycling infrastructure in the UK. This is why it makes sense to wear a helmet.",

On the 8th of June Nicola Sturgeon was sent a message on IndyRef2, but Mr Salmond also heard it loud and clear when his constituency booted him out of office. Indeed, the kick up the backside he received was so hard he landed lock, stock and barrel, like some kind of human cannonball, in a show in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\nWhilst Mr Salmond may have heard the message, it is not clear that he understood it. The truth is that the people of Scotland don’t want a second divisive referendum, they want politicians of all parties to get on with the day job. In Edinburgh, that means building homes and creating good quality jobs.\nAlex Salmond, however, is not interested in that. He’s only interested in breaking up the UK. Like Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP MPs, MSPs and Councillors representing Edinburgh, he fervently hopes Brexit will be bad for the UK and help drive Scots off his independence cliff edge.\nThat’s right, the SNP want jobs to be lost and mortgages to go unpaid in the hope that Scots will eventually think “surely breaking up the UK can’t be worse than this?”. Forget that no independent expert thinks we’d be better-off outside the UK. Fear is the only card the SNP have left.\nThe SNP’s “Ministry of Grievance” exaggerates any potential negative Brexit impact at every opportunity. With all this fearmongering from the SNP, it is little wonder Scotland’s long-term economic growth is lagging behind the UK as a whole.\nI’m glad, however, that Scots are starting to see what nationalism really is – an overpriced and ill-conceived Fringe Show. In pubs and cafes across Scotland, the conversation is moving away from flags and currency and on to how we make our great country work for the many, not the few. So let’s let Salmond be a Fringe curiosity, whilst the rest of us deliver the progressive vision Scotland needs.",

SNP Councillor Adam McVey claimed to have “a mandate to lead the city” despite his group having just 19 of Edinburgh’s 63 Councillors and his party’s share of first preference votes fell to 25.9%.\nThis kind of outlook perhaps explains why the Greens, Labour, Lib-Dems and Tories all appear less than keen to work with Edinburgh’s nationalist Councillors.\nIn the article he rightly mentions the “cost of living crisis” as being one of the biggest challenges facing people in Edinburgh today, but he failed to mention his party’s role in making it worse. From driving up rents by allowing short term lets to run riot in Edinburgh for a decade to increasing our water bills to help fund Scottish Water’s boss taking a bonus of £227,000, the SNP have much to answer for.\nIndeed, the SNP’s failure to stand up for ordinary people in Edinburgh is a key part of why Labour can’t support them in running our city.

To safely facilitate this work, a change to traffic management arrangements in the area is proposed. This includes changes to traffic priorities, pedestrian access and bus stop arrangements. A temporary traffic regulation order (TTRO) will be advertised shortly, with temporary arrangements expected to be in place for approximately 2 years.\nThe TTRO will come into effect on 24th June 2024. Below is a copy of the South St. David Street traffic management layout plan for your information. This layout requires us to move the Airlink buses from South St. David Street for the duration of the works. In order to provide an alternative bus stop for this service the TTRO will introduce a bus gate on Waverley Bridge, reopening the bridge for to the airport bus services provided by Lothian and McGill’s buses. Bus operators are aware of this change, and they are in the process of applying to the Traffic Commissioner for permission to amend their services for this period. Bus operators understand that the reopening of Waverley Bridge is a short-term measure, and that the expectation is that they will return to their current stops once the work at Jenners is complete. No other traffic will be permitted to access Princes Street from Waverley Bridge.\nThe Placemaking, Events and Public Safety teams have been consulted about this change to ensure that we can safely facilitate pedestrians, cyclists and maintain the functionality of the area for the summer and winter festival periods. The new design will incorporate footway widenings at the north and south pedestrian accesses to Princes Street Gardens, bus access points and the flexibility to install hostile vehicle mitigation apparatus when required. The design for the new layout is still being progressed but once ready, will be circulated.\nProvisions contained within the TTRO include:\n- No Waiting Loading Unloading\nSouth St David Street from its junction with St Andrew Square to its junction with Princes Street on both sides.\nRose Street (between South St David Street and Hanover Street) from the east side of its westerly junction with Rose Street North Lane to its junction with South St David Street (approx. 110m) on both sides.\nRose Street South Lane (between South St David Street and Hanover Street) from its eastmost junction with Rose Street southbound for approximately 25 metres. - Road Closure\nRose Street South Lane (between South St David Street and Hanover Street) from its eastmost junction with Rose Street southbound for approximately 25 metres.

This gives us a chance to seek clarification or perhaps even raise concerns.I received the (incomplete) 49 page Spaces for People report yesterday at 9:41am and it went in the public domain at 2:38pm.\nI knew it would possibly contain a plan for cycle lanes on Braid Hills Drive (not my Ward). Inspection of the report, however, reveals that the Council is considering closing the road. It was argued that it was an “important safe link to areas of exercise in the Hermitage of Braid and Braid Hill area“.\nFour options are presented:\nOption 1 – Braid Hills Road / Drive remain open to vehicular traffic and segregated cycle lanes are provided. The segregated cycle lanes would be provided from the junction of Braid Road / Braid Hills Road to the junction of Liberton Road / Liberton Brae.\nOption 2 (pictured above) – Provision of segregated cycle lanes from the junction of Braid Road / Braid Hills Road to a closure point just east of the junction with Braid Hills Avenue. A closure point will also exist at the junction of Braid Farm Road and Braid Hills Road. From here Braid Hills Road / Drive would remain closed until the junction with Liberton Tower Lane. East of this closure point a segregated cycle lane will be provided on the southern edge of the carriageway until the junction with Alnwickhill Road and east of this, segregated cycle lanes will be provided until the junction with Liberton Brae.\nOption 3 – A closure point will be situated on Braid Hills Road just east of the junction with Braid Hills Avenue. A closure point will also exist at the junction of Braid Farm Road and Braid Hills Road. From here Braid Hills Road / Drive will remain closed until the junction with Liberton Tower Lane. East of this closure point a segregated cycle lane will be provided on the southern edge of the carriageway until the junction with Alnwickhill Road where the scheme will terminate.\nOption 4 – As above closure points will be created at Braid Hills Road east of the junction with Braid Hills Avenue. A closure point will also exist at the junction of Braid Farm Road and Braid Hills Road. From here Braid Hills Road / Drive will remain closed until the junction with Liberton Tower Lane.\nPersonally, I feel Options 2-4 are so significant that they should be subject to meaningful consultation with the community around this road. Instead, the report simply says: “A decision needs to be taken internally on the preferred alignment / extent of the scheme”. Once this happens, only “key stakeholders” will be consulted.\nPersonally, I find it unlikely that the emergency services will agree to the closure of Braid Hills Drive.",

We’re encouraging people to put out only one blue box and to store any excess glass for the next collection, as boxes may become too heavy to lift, posing a health risk to crews.\nGarden waste collections and special uplifts are currently suspended while Household Waste and Recycling Centres remain closed though we’re working hard to reintroduce these services as soon as it is safe to do so.\nAnyone with symptoms of coronavirus is encouraged to follow the guidance on how to dispose of waste correctly to help protect the safety of bin collection crews.\nAdditional measures taken to safeguard waste and cleansing workers’ health have included the increased provision of hand sanitiser supplies, in addition to hot water handwashing points in a number of vehicles, the washing down of lorries at the end of shifts and efforts to encourage social distancing in depots.\nFurther information on changes to bin collections and other services can be found on the Council website.",

I visited the school on Monday morning to observe the pupils and traffic, and I could see that the queuing system at the main entrance was orderly and efficient, and that staff were working hard to create a welcoming atmosphere by playing Christmas music and wearing festive clothing.\nAlthough the stated focus of this scheme is the response to Covid-19, road safety issues around the school are well known. Although the Covid trigger for the scheme is not noted, I understand the issue is the risk of cars hitting one of the many children queuing to enter the school. This is a particular concern at the Buckstone Loan East / Buckstone Circle junction. I counted 10-20 parents driving cars (often quite large SUV type) around this junction. Can the Spaces for People Team confirm what the trigger is for the use of Covid powers is in this instance, and explain why this scheme was not progressed sooner given that it is labelled “urgent” and “emergency”?\nThe comments I have received from residents/parents can really be separated into two types – uncertainty about what’s proposed inside the cordon, and concerns about what the impact may be outside it\nI chatted face-to-face with 10-15 residents living inside the cordon on Sunday. I could see that the Council could have benefited from engaging with these people before drawing up the plans. There was uncertainty about the following:\n- Are the plans for peak time only, or 24/7?\n- Can Blue badge holders visit at any time?\n- Can deliveries be made at any time?\n- What arrangements are in place for visitors/taxis/carers/tradespeople? Will these people and residents be issued permits?\n- Can school staff still use the car park? I understand teachers do normally have a plan in place to use their own cars to transport children in the case of an emergency.\n- How will the “residents only” access on Buckstone Circle be enforced?\n- Will any parking spaces be lost?\n- Will the closure barrier be well designed – will it compromise planters or cones?\nAdditionally, any impact on gritting and waste collection will have to be carefully considered. These large vehicles will find it difficult to turn in the restricted area. This and points 1-8 above need to be clarified, and based on this the residents should be given a further chance to comment.\nThe concerns outside the cordon largely reflect the pre-existing road safety issues around the school. Normally, there are three areas of concern: (1) the area within the proposed cordon, (2) the hill access to the school on Buckstone Lea and, (3) the raised table crossing adjacent to the junction of Buckstone Loan East / Buckstone Gate. Residents are justifiably concerned that this plan will exacerbate the latter two problem areas and also worsen problems on Buckstone Close. Has this been anticipated?\nIf the plans are to proceed, I feel the following should happen to reduce this impact on the surrounding area:\n- Parking should be prevented at the Buckstone Loan East / Buckstone Gate junction (in line with the Highway Code).\n- The raised table crossing adjacent to the junction of Buckstone Loan East / Buckstone Gate should have its markings refreshed.\n- The following giveway markings should be refreshed: Buckstone Loan East / Buckstone Gate, Buckstone Loan East / Buckstone Lea, Buckstone Loan East / Buckstone Close, Buckstone Loan East / Buckstone Circle, High Buckstone / Buckstone Circle, Buckstone Loan / Buckstone Circle and Buckstone Gate / Buckstone Road. The Council should ensure dropped kerbs are in place at these junctions where appropriate.\n- Homes on Buckstone Loan East, Buckstone Circle, Buckstone Close, Buckstone Lea and Buckstone Gate should be provided with access protection markings for their driveways, or have any existing markings refreshed.\n- Steps should be taken to discourage parents from using cars to drop-off/pick-up children on Buckstone Lea.\n- Steps should be taken to remind Buckstone residents of the hazard parked cars and overgrown hedges (etc) pose to pedestrians and those with buggies/wheelchairs/guide dogs. This is particularly important on the arterial routes through Buckstone and the streets surrounding the school. Likewise, a reminder should be issued regarding speeding on the estate.\nIn terms of accessibility, many disabled people depend on cars (both to drive and as a passenger) and taxis. Road changes shouldn’t prevent disabled people from being able to stop near the school. Changes to usual travel patterns can add to anxiety for all of us, but to some disabled people in particular. The scheme should therefore be seen in this context – continual changes should therefore be avoided where possible, and should be effectively communicated to the public (including disabled people).",

Cuts to education funding in Scotland have led to a national decline in standards in absolute and relative terms. Indeed, the SNP Government response to news that Scotland was falling down international educational league tables has been to pull out of them!\nThe reasons for this decline should be easy for a man of George Gordon’s intellect to see. Cuts implemented by his party have seen 4,000 teaching jobs lost. These cuts, a 24% real terms pay cut since 2008, and the bungled introduction of the Curriculum for Excellence in Scottish schools has led to unacceptable stress levels in the body of teachers that remain.\nIt’s no wonder that the EIS is balloting on strike action.\nOn top of all this, Edinburgh now faces a further £106m of cuts and reports suggest education is in the sights of the SNP led administration. Indeed, SNP Council Leader Adam McVey tweeted yesterday that Nicola Sturgeon was focusing on “partnership between national & local government”. For the SNP, this is a partnership where council budgets are slashed and those that oppose cuts to education are attacked in the Evening News by nationalist Councillors.\nCouncillor George Gordon could have stood in solidarity with teachers in his ward. He could have asked Adam McVey, the SNP Finance Convenor or the SNP Education Spokesperson to publicly oppose cuts to Edinburgh’s budget because of the impact they would have on a whole generation of Edinburgh school children. He chose loyalty to his party, not our city.\nInstead, he chose to wage a personal attack on me for opposing these cuts. Worse than that, he also tried to blame the cuts on Edinburgh’s Education Convenor simply because he’s a Labour councillor. It would be the easiest thing in the world for Councillor Ian Perry to walk away from the education brief and hand it to the SNP, but he knows he’s the last line of defence against the cuts Edinburgh faces.\nGeorge Gordon needs to quit defending the SNP Government, and start defending our schools.",

Despite the fact that the area the developers are keen to build on delivers benefits which range from enhancing biodiversity to supporting wellbeing, their argument is that development is needed if Edinburgh’s housing needs are to be met.\nFor some time the argument has been made at city level that housebuilding should focus on the redevelopment of “brown field” land. Surely we must now also prioritise bringing empty homes back into use before we destroy more green space like that under threat in Winton?\nIf the council, which has been subject to cuts by the Scottish Government, can’t afford to encourage the owners of empty properties to act, perhaps this could be done in partnership with developers?\nWhere there is evidence that investors are holding properties empty for longer term financial gain, I really to hope that their council tax is being surcharged to reflect the impact empty properties have on communities.",

However, whilst he and Cllr Cathy Fullerton may both feel “tough decisions will have to be made”, I do wonder if both nationalists feel the same should apply to their party’s actions in Holyrood? I assume that as members of the SNP, both back the cuts their party’s elite have been imposing on Scotland’s capital rather than make “tough decisions” like richest Scots tio pay a fair rate of tax?\nWhen it comes to charging for garden waste, I don’t know anyone that doubts that this will result in more fly-tipping, the return of garden bonfires and the misuse of the other waste streams. Before anyone shrugs their shoulders at this, I know from work I have undertaken in Belfast that fly-tipped garden waste makes a significant contribution to culvert blockages, and so increases flood risk.\nThere are many that argue, however, that charging for garden waste collection is “fair” as many people in Edinburgh don’t have gardens and so should not be subsidising those that do. That’s an argument that does not hold water. It takes us down the road where only those with children in school pay for education, or where only those who are ill pay for the NHS. No thanks!\nThe demographic nobody talks about in this debate, not least Steve Cardownie, are people on low incomes. The SNP Government are already forcing the City to raise the most regressive tax (Council Tax) because they won’t use the most progressive tax (income tax). On top of that, are we seriously suggesting that people who are struggling to feed and clothe their children should pay £25 to have their hedge clippings collected? Why should the poorest pay the same as the richest? Why should the many subsidise the few?\nThat’s why I think this proposal should be binned, but the alternative can’t be to cut something else instead. The alternative must be for the SNP Government to fairly fund Scotland’s capital. The alternative is real change.\nWhether you agree or disagree with me, please take part in the Budget Consultation.",

Indeed, it is too easy to view Edinburgh as a city where a few property developers and private landlords accumulate wealth whilst the many that work in the retail, tourism and service industry struggle to make ends meet on low wages.\nIndeed, the Convenorship of the Council’s “Housing and Economy Committee” recently swapped from one of Edinburgh’s seven Councillors who happen to be a private landlord to another. I’m sure that both treat their tenants well, but Edinburgh is a city that has industrialised exorbitant rents and “holiday lets” whilst simultaneously presiding over a housing crisis. The latest estimate is that up to 10,000 properties have been converted to holiday lets – with many, thanks to the Scottish Government, paying zero Council Tax or Business Rates. Somebody is making serious money out of this, and it’s not the people cleaning the properties between lets.\nIt’s not just housing where we need to do more. The “FUSE Academy” was recently enthusiastically launched in Edinburgh by Keith Brown MSP (Cabinet Secretary for the Economy, Jobs and Fair Work) to underpin the new St James Quarter development. FUSE aims “to help drive a world-class customer care experience in Edinburgh and to promote the value and appeal of careers in the retail and hospitality sector”. The problem is that the St James Quarter’s owner won’t guarantee businesses within the development will pay the living wage. It is outrageous that this developer is demanding staff offer “world-class customer care”, but not guarantee a fair rate of pay.\nLet’s be honest, however, the retail, service and tourism sectors are a huge part of Edinburgh’s economy but these are often jobs which offer poor pay and conditions. As Donald Anderson says, if Edinburgh is to remain a prosperous city, more people must benefit from that wealth and the Council must engage with the Scottish Government, Developers and Landlords to make sure that happens.\nWe need to re-balance Edinburgh’s economy for the many, not the few.",

The Tories had their best result since the 80’s and Labour had its worst result since the 30’s. People across the UK from Peterhead to Plymouth have been slipping into poverty under the Tories since 2010, and that may accelerate if Brexit is now implemented by Boris Johnson and his Eton chum Jacob Rees-Mogg.\nAs an MP Ian Murray lost friends last night (and their staff lost their jobs), and many voters right across the UK lost hope. I knocked on hundreds of doors for Labour in Edinburgh South and found that Jeremy Corbyn was a bigger issue for voters than Indyref & Brexit combined. Yes, some voters were supportive of Jeremy Corbyn but the vast majority simply did not trust him. It is now clear from media reports that this was not an uncommon experience.\nYes, voters don’t trust Boris either, but it is clear they put a Tory Brexit before a radical Labour Manifesto. With just one result to be called, Labour is on 32.2% nationally and the Tories won 43.6% on a nationalist ticket.\nIn Scotland the situation is more complex. Tactical voting for the SNP took the nationalist vote here to 45% of the vote, with Labour on 18.6% (an 8.5% drop on what Kezia Dugdale achieved in 2017) and the Tories on 25.1%. Whilst much of the local SNP campaigns avoided talking about independence, Nicola Sturgeon is claiming that pro-UK parties only winning 54% of Scottish votes is a mandate for a further referendum. She has said that next week her Nationalist Government will publish a “detailed democratic case” for letting her decide on whether there should be a second independence referendum.\nDon’t expect that “detailed” case from Nicola Sturgeon to answer fundamental questions on the deficit, currency or even EU membership. Instead she’ll argue that Scotland should walk away from those slipping in to poverty south of the border, without really providing answers on what Scotland’s financial position would be.\nSo people north and south of the border face a bleak future one way or another despite Labour offering some fantastic policies in our manifesto. The problem is that the lack of trust in Jeremy Corbyn meant our manifesto did not connect with voters. This loss of trust, of course, started with how the party dealt with the Brexit result – the party equivocated when leadership was required. A different leader may well have been able to bridge the remain and leave positions, but neither camp were willing to trust Jeremy Corbyn due to his record on the EU. The EU election was possibly our last chance to regain trust, but we wasted that opportunity.\nA second issue which undermined trust in Jeremy Corbyn is the issue of anti-Jewish racism. Although seldom raised on the doorstep, those that brought it up always had heartfelt concerns.\nSoon Labour will face the challenge of fighting the 2021 Holyrood elections. These elections approach us at a time when the public in Scotland is openly questioning the state of key public services like education and health. Before we can respond to that challenge, however, we need to rebuild trust in our party, and its leadership.\nDespite the best efforts of the SNP, Brexit will continue to dominate UK politics in the coming weeks. That’s why I welcome the fact that Jeremy Corbyn has said he will soon stand down and I hope we can enter the next sitting of parliament with an acting leader that has been clear and unequivocal on the issue.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_10_16_ediburghs-bike-hire-scheme-is-a-bit-of-joined-up-thinking-needed/content_730.html": "Eddie Tait from the excellent Boardwalk Beach Club in Cramond has a bit of a point when he said he was “stunned” after being asked for £3,000 to host Edinburgh’s bike hire scheme outside his award winning diner (Report, 15/10/18).\nI have only heard good things about the scheme. Yes, it was maybe a mistake to let a fast food company sponsor the bikes but apart from that I think most people see it as a wholly positive step. Indeed, it must be good as most of Edinburgh’s political parties appear keen to take credit for it from Labour’s Lesley Hinds.\nHowever, the aim must be bigger than having a bike hire scheme for the sake of it, or to compare ourselves with other cities. We have to think about how the scheme can be used to do much more than get us from A to B. I’d suggest four key aims should drive the future of the scheme.\nInclusion – We have to use the scheme to encourage people from deprived areas to live healthier and happier lives. Right now, not one single docking station is in a deprived area. Bizarrely, the station at the City Chambers is the one in the lowest area of deprivation.\nEconomy –We must use the bikes to drive our economy by using them to get tourist out the city centre and to places like Colinton and Cramond.\nActive Transport – We must use the scheme to encourage people out of their cars. They should be a stepping stone to full bike ownership. In a city like Edinburgh, why can’t my son use his bus pass to hire the bike? Why are none of the stations west of Stockbridge or south of Edinburgh University?\nBetter Infrastructure – Parts of Edinburgh have some fantastic cycle lanes. With more people cycling, I hope they will demand fantastic cycle lanes right across this city.\nThat’s my strategy, but the question is what are Just Eat Cycles basing their plans on? I asked them, and they said “as we are in the early days of the scheme, we will be expanding where we can”.\nI fear some joined up thinking is needed.",

As the announcement was not made until last week, people will have to apply to be reimbursed for the October break.\nIt should not take a pandemic for Scotland to ensure food is on the table of the poorest households – see my pre-Covid Council motion here.\nFull briefing from the Council below.\nBriefing\nThe Scottish Government confirmed last week that £6.95m is being made available to local authorities to provide Free School Meals (FSM) to eligible families during the holidays throughout the winter months.\nFinal allocations are still to be confirmed but Edinburgh is expected to receive £330,000. This includes covering provision for the October holidays, with the option for Councils to provide retrospective cash payments – which we are doing.\nScottish Ministers have also offered funding for the Easter holidays in 2021, which will be agreed in the next financial year – Edinburgh’s allocation has still to be confirmed.\nAs of today (Monday 26 October) we have made 6,435 retrospective payments (£13.50 per child) for the 2020 October holiday period direct to bank accounts for eligible families.\nThe payments are paid to the parents and carers of P1 to S6 children who receive a School Clothing Grant. As with the previous FSM payments over the school closures/summer holidays, children in P1 to P3 are not automatically entitled to FSM payments even though they receive the meals under Scottish Government legislation. In order to get the FSM holiday payments, they must have received a clothing grant/or have an income-based entitlement to FSM for the current term (2020/21).\nA letter is also being issued to parents/carers who have been identified as being entitled to FSM with full details of how to send us their payment information securely using our online form before the end of November (30/11/20).\nParent and carers who were in receipt of FSM before the October holiday do not have to contact the Council as they will automatically receive the FSM holiday payment. Parents and carers who applied for FSM before the October holiday do not have to contact the Council as they will automatically be considered for the FSM holiday payment when their application is processed.\nResidents making enquiries about FSM payments will be directed to the online application form where the eligibility criteria is set out: https://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/xfp/form/221.",

Kids from poor backgrounds tend to do less well at school. This key factor is part of why we see poverty being passed down from generation to generation in Scotland.\nWe know that under the SNP this problem is getting worse in Scotland. Their cuts and indifference are holding back a generation – this can only result in worsening inequality in Scotland.\nI grew up in one of the most deprived areas of the UK – a council estate in Kirkcaldy during the 1980’s miner’s strike. My route out of that was to work hard at school and go on to complete a degree and eventually a PhD. This solid educational base has led me to a career which has taken me right around the world – from Australia to Brazil, Japan and Dubai.\nIt breaks my heart to say that I had a better deal under Margaret Thatcher than kids growing up in my old street in Kirkcaldy have today. That’s utterly depressing.\nMy experience tells me that education is fundamental to reducing inequality in Scotland and elsewhere in the world. As a lecturer who manages one of the UK’s leading engineering programmes at a Scottish university I continually come across students who must leave university because they simply cannot afford to support themselves.\nWhen elected in 2007 the SNP abolished the “graduate endowment”, a £2,000 fee paid by students after graduation, and Alex Salmond quickly claimed “The rocks will melt with the sun before I allow tuition fees to be imposed on Scottish students”. In a typically modest move, he even had his words literally carved in stone and unveiled in the grounds of one of Scotland’s best universities.\nThe problem is that fees are only part of the cost of attending university, the second part of the equation is living costs. If you come from a wealthy family, there’s a good chance that the “bank of mum and dad” will help with living costs. Poorer students, however, must rely on a bursary from the Scottish Government.\nCurrently the SNP offers the very poorest students a bursary of just £1875 per year. In comparison, ten years ago Labour offered the poorest students a bursary of £2,455 (~£3,000 today).\nThis means that whilst all students benefit from abolition of the £2,000 graduate endowment, the books have been balanced by cutting £4,500 from the bursary awarded to the poorest students on a typical 4 year degree programme. Poor students must fund their studies via debt and/or work.\nThis movement of money from the poorest to the richest at a time of “austerity” is the action of a government that says its number one priority is cutting the attainment gap.\nA few years ago I came across a student from one of the most deprived areas in Edinburgh who as well as studying full-time also managed a small supermarket full-time. He was one of the very best students I have encountered, and was evidence that whilst Scots growing up in poor communities may lack opportunity, they don’t lack commitment, intelligence or ambition. As a country, we must do more to support them.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_12_02_council-briefing-note-coping-with-winter-weather-in-edinburgh/content_706.html": "Below is a briefing I received from Council Officer in their preparations for “winter weather”.\nTOPIC: WINTER MAINTENANCE SERVICE (gritting and snow clearing) 2018/19\nDate: 20/11/18\nThe City of Edinburgh Council has a statutory duty (under Section 34 of the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984) to take such steps as it considers “reasonable to prevent snow and ice endangering the safe passage of pedestrians and vehicles over public roads”. The intention of this duty is not that the Council will take immediate and simultaneous steps to clear and/or treat every road whenever ice or snow exists. It is recognised by the Courts that this would be impossible and beyond the limits of available resources.\nWINTER WEATHER ACTIVITY – IN NUMBERS\n- 14,000 tonnes of salt stockpiled for use across the city; initial resilience of 38 days of continuous heavy treatment\n- 19 mini-tractors, based at depots across Edinburgh, used for high ground pavements, city centre routes, cycle paths and local priority routes.\n- 12 up to date hired gritting and snow plough lorries\n- 10 CEC multi use gritting and snow plough lorries\n- 1050km of priority 1 road network\n- 300 kilometres of priority pavements and cycleways\n- 96 Edinburgh Roads Services staff working three shifts to treat roads and park and rides\n- 60 staff from across the Council working three shifts to treat priority footways and cycle routes with mini-tractors\n- Place Management staff to treat Local Priority routes\nEdinburgh Road Services (ERS) leads the Winter Maintenance Service for the City of Edinburgh Council in conjunction with other teams within Place Management. The purpose of this service is to allow pavement, cycle way and road users’ safe movement over Priority routes during wintry weather.\nMAKING THE TREATMENT DECISION\nERS receives weather forecast information from the Met Office on a daily basis. This includes a detailed 24-hour weather forecast and a 2 to 5 days weather forecast for planning purposes.\nDetailed current and historical information on road conditions, at selected points on the network, are received by means of a web-based road monitoring system. Road Sensors record road surface conditions (such as road temperature and residual salt levels) as well as air temperature and wind speed/direction.\nThe Met Office forecasts and roadside information are analysed and modelled against the thermal maps of Edinburgh’s road network. This is then presented on a web platform that displays the minimum forecast road surface temperature and the likelihood of ice forming.\nThe Duty Manager makes a treatment decision at mid-day each day with later updates if required due to forecast changes. The decision could be for no action, a pre grit starting at 17:00 or treatment all night. Later decisions may call for treatment at 05:00 or all day treatment.\nFollowing thermal mapping and route optimisation, Duty Managers are now able to make route based decisions. Following the forecast with the map image above of 26 October, 4 priority 1 road routes were required to be gritted. Prior to thermal mapping, the forecast information presented would have led to a decision to treat the whole city; on this occasion 80% of variable resources were saved.\nIf you would like a demonstration or further explanation of thermal mapping and route based decision making, please get in touch (contact details below).\nGRITTING\nERS has 12 hired in, fixed body gritter lorries and 10 CEC owned multi body gritters (the body can be changed to eg a flatbed) available for the treatment of roads and snow ploughing.\nMini-tractors and pick-up/3.5t trucks are available for the treatment of cycle paths and pavements both on the priority 1 network and Local priority routes.\nStandby arrangements ensure that staff are available 24/7 throughout the winter months. ERS also has a Contract with a local Farmer, for the treatment of roads in the Balerno area.\nAs part of a Plant Framework Agreement, ERS can access additional gritters with drivers to supplement the in-house resources.\nPriority 1 routes will be covered within 4 hours of treatment starting, although ERS aim to complete them in around 3 hours. Weather conditions, traffic and technical issues will impact timings. When possible, surfaces will be treated before it freezes. This is not always possible and the public MUST be aware that at times, a Priority 1 surface may have ice on it for up to 4 hours before it can be treated.\nOnly Priority 1 Pavements, Cycleways and Roads are treated outside normal working hours.\nCEC has mutual agreements with the adjoining Lothian Councils for the treatment of roads that cross the City boundary, to ensure full coverage of the road network. The Scottish Executive’s agent for the maintenance of the trunk road network (A720 City Bypass, M8 and M9) including the slip roads is Amey. CEC has an agreement with Amey for the treatment of roads that interface with the trunk road network\nSALT BINS\nTo enable people to carry out self-help treatment of roads and pavements, salt bins are positioned throughout the City. These bins are checked and refilled, based on area treatment decisions, throughout the winter months. Requests for new bins or reports of empty bins can be made to Clarence on freephone 0800 23 23 23 or through the Council website.\nIn an ‘emergency’ situation the Council will deploy a number of 1tonne bags of salt at strategic points throughout the City.\nGo to http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/homepage/239/gritting_and_salt_bins for:\n- Gritting routes and grit bin locations\n- Advice on clearing snow/ice\n- How to report an empty, damaged or missing grit bin\n- How we prioritise which streets get gritted first\n- Request a new grit bin\nEXTREME WEATHER\nWhen severe ‘emergency’ weather is forecast, the Resilience Team will call a meeting with key staff from across the Council and Partners to consider the possible impact on the City and to draft a probable first stage action and resource plan to address potential needs and demands.\nA move from ‘normal’ to an ‘emergency’ situation will be taken by a member of the Council’s Management Team. This decision will be communicated to the Council’s Winter Weather Silver Commander who will advise key staff.\nThis prompt will result in the Council’s Silver Command team becoming established and this team, under the control of the Council’s Silver Commander, is responsible for the Winter Maintenance response until the situation reverts back to ‘normal’. The Silver Command team has a base in Bankhead depot alongside the ERS Duty Officer.\nThe Council has a Contingency Framework Agreement for contractors who can be contacted in the event of Edinburgh experiencing a spell of severe winter weather. This agreement makes provision for an emergency 4-hour response and for Contractors to carry out severe weather operations 7days a week and through holiday periods. This supplements the Winter Maintenance Service provided by Council Services and is managed through the Council’s Silver Command structure.\nGo to the Severe Weather page www.edinburgh.gov.uk/winterweather for:\n- Emergency road closures due to weather warnings\n- Gritting routes, grit bin locations and guidance on clearing paths\n- Realtime updates on traffic and travel delays\n- Support for older, disabled or isolated people\n- School closures due to severe weather or other emergencies\n- What to do to be prepared in case of a storm\n- Report a flood or find out who to contact for help\n- Current delays to rubbish and recycling collections",

It came with the usual negativity that we have become used to, but on the points he made about housebuilding it omitted a fundamental truth.\nOn the very day in February that his SNP/Green Government set the budget in Holyrood, Shelter Scotland was protesting outside because the social housing budget was being “slashed”. This came just a few days after Shelter Scotland said the SNP/Green Government were choosing “to deprioritise social housing in their spending plans by disproportionately slashing that budget”.\nJust last month Shelter Scotland intervened again when data was published showing that homelessness was rising across Scotland taking the total number of homeless children to 16,263. Shelter Scotland were again clear on their position by saying the situation was “utterly shameful” and that “there is no mystery surrounding the solution to this emergency, no need for more summits or round tables to puzzle out an answer”. They told the SNP/Green Government “we need more social housing, and we need it now”.\nCllr Nols-McVey would have us believe that this was all Labour’s fault and neither SNP/Green cuts nor Edinburgh’s position as Scotland’s worst funded local authority has anything to do with it.\nThe reality is that Edinburgh’s Labour Councillors are open to working with all parties in our city to take our capital forward. This approach is slowly changing the culture in the City Chambers, and is delivering results every day for the people in Edinburgh – we are making a great city better.\nCllr Nols-McVey’s SNP can join us or he can continue to carp from the sidelines with no positive vision for Edinburgh to counter the change Labour has on offer. The first step in that journey, however, may be to accept the damage his party’s cuts are doing to people looking for affordable housing in Edinburgh.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_11_17_briefing-water-flowing-on-to-oxgangs-green/content_772.html": "Below is a briefing on the water flowing on to Oxgangs Green I received from Manor Estates Housing Association (see image I took earlier in the year). The plans show the route of the fresh water pipe through the area. At the current time, the problem is not believed to be related to the Hunter’s Tryst School site (housebuilding starts in March 2020) – but it is suspected the pipe itself emanates from within the historic/listed well heads within the old school grounds. I have made everyone involved aware that the water froze this week and posed a real risk to pedestrians.\nWe were first made aware of this problem during mid-August 2019 when David Hood Consultants working in the adjacent old school ground informed Manor Estates they were attempting to repair water leakage from what appeared to be a historic fresh water underground supply pipe discharged from the historic well head within the old school grounds.\nThe consultant informed us they had employed a specialist drainage contractor to video the underground pipe from the old school ground downhill to a manhole located in Manor Estates communal ground at corner of road junction with Oxgangs Green & Oxgangs Avenue.\nWe believe the route of this underground pipe passes underneath the communal estate grass area adjacent to 2 Oxgangs Green.\nUnconfirmed information provided by the specialist drainage contractor who previously carried jetting of the pipe followed by a video survey indicated the fresh water pipe appeared to be broken with collapse somewhere between the adjacent church hall boundary lines and downstream towards the manhole located close toward the roadway junction.\nAfter some discussions and at our persistence Scottish Water did attended site on Friday 8 November 2019 and had taken a water sample from water on the entrance footpath of your block, results from the water testing confirmed this water is non chlorinated fresh water therefore not water that could be leaking from any Scottish Water pipe network.\nWe are currently in negotiations with Scottish Water to establish who is responsible for maintenance and repair to this section of pipe.\nI propose to keep you informed again by letter once further clarity over ownership & who may be responsibility for repair becomes known to the Association.",

Our crews are working hard to clear as much waste and litter as they can across the city. However, it’s looking increasingly likely that strike action will commence again from Tuesday 6 September. Unfortunately, this means we’ve had to update our operational plans. To allow our crews to focus on grey and green wheelie bin collections we will be suspending garden waste collections this Thursday and Friday (1 and 2 September) and changing our advice for residents.\nAs such, and in line with the contingency plan for two strike periods, we are putting the following advice in place:\n- Residents who are due any bin collections today, Wednesday 30 August, will still have these collected as normal.\n- Anyone due a bin collection on Thursday or Friday should:\n- Put both their green AND grey wheelie bins, and bagged extra waste, out by 6am on their normal collection day and we will aim to empty them BOTH. There may be some delays and they may not be collected on the same day as each other, so they should leave them out until the end of the day on Monday 5 September.\n- If they’re due a food waste collection, they should put this out as usual, by 6am.\n- Garden waste collections will be suspended on these days. Brown bins should not be put out for collection on Thursday or Friday – they will not be collected. We’re very sorry for this and will be in touch with garden waste customers with details of how we’ll compensate them for any collections missed because of strike action.\n- The glass collection service remains suspended. We’ll provide an update when this is due to restart.\nThis approach will mean that there are no kerbside properties that have been more adversely impacted by the two strike actions than any other. It avoids some of the criticism that other councils are facing for not helping out residents that have accumulated waste over a longer period of time than other households.\nYou can find full details of bin collection days, the recovery plan and advice on dealing with waste on the Council website: www.edinburgh.gov.uk/binstrike.\nThis information will be shared with media, on social media and with our partners. I would appreciate it if you’re able to share the guidance with your residents and networks.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_01_23_briefing-note-braid-road-road-closure-spaces-for-people_comment-page-1/content_405.html": "Below is a briefing on why Braid Road is opening to southbound vehicles. I’ve asked for this to be updated by the SfP team to respond to the following questions:\n- Is it not incorrect to suggest traffic on Braid Road is zero? It’s on my running route, and there are still a lot of vehicles using the southern end to access Braid Hills Drive. Certainly not 9,486, but I expect there are still thousands of vehicles per day using Braid Road either side of the closure.\n- Can the air quality results be explained? The LEZ proposed by the Council is based on the premise that fewer vehicles will result in improved air quality.\n- It is noted that Lothian Buses have expressed support for reopening the road southbound. Were they asked about reopening the route to northbound traffic? Can northbound bus transits time data also be shared?\n- Can it be confirmed who provided the “anecdotal” cycle use data for Braid Road?\n- No explanation or justification is given for the continued closure of Braid Road. I normally run through the Hermitage 2-3 times a week as part of a longer circuit, and normally see around 10-20 people between Braid Road and Kirk Brae – a distance of around 2.7km. Sunday mornings are busier (maybe 30-40 people), but there are no issues with social distancing at the Braid Rd entrance. Ironically, the inadequate footpath at the Kirk Brae end (see image below) actually causes more issues. Does this observation align with your data? If so, would a more proportionate response not be simply to widen the footpaths at both the Kirk Brae and Braid Road ends?\nBriefing on Braid Road\nIntroduction\nA section of Braid Road was closed to all traffic between the junction of Braidburn Terrace and the Braid Hills Hotel in May 2020 to provide safer pedestrian, cyclist and wheeling access to the Hermitage of Braid park.\nDuring the period of the closure the Spaces for People (SfP) team have on a regular basis considered the impact of the road closure on adjacent routes, the possible negative impact on air quality on Comiston Road and any delays experienced by Lothian Buses on the A702 routes.\nThis briefing note is intended to provide information gathered as part of the formal review process and make reference to the Review Recommendation to be considered at the Transport and Environment Committee on 28th January 2021.\nImpact on Traffic on Comiston Road\nTraffic Counts have been carried out on Comiston Road at the junction with Greenbank Crescent. These have been compared with baseline counts from 2018 and results are shown in the table below.\nTraffic on Comiston Road is currently around 9.5% higher than the pre-Covid baseline – around 17,000 vehicles per day, compared with 15,500 vehicles per day – the increase on the A702 corridor is far smaller than the amount of traffic previously recorded using Braid Road – 9,486 vehicles per day.\nThe overall level of traffic on these two corridors is significantly less than pre-Covid levels (approx. 32% less on these two routes). The general level of traffic which has returned to these corridors (68% of pre-Covid) is less than the general level across the city (80 – 90%), suggesting the closure has achieved a level of traffic reduction on this route. Though it is possible traffic has moved to other routes in the surrounding area.\nAir Quality\nConcerns have been raised regarding the impact of the Braid Road closure on air quality on the A702, especially on Comiston Road between Greenbank Crescent and Morningside Station. There are two diffusion tube monitoring stations in the area, one at South Morningside Primary School (116 Comiston Rd) and the other further north at the Canny Mans Pub (Morningside Rd). Results from June to October 2020 period, varied between 10-20μg/m3 of Nitrogen Dioxide, which is both lower than the previous year and significantly lower than EU legal limits. This is shown in the graph below.\nIt is worth noting that these are uncorrected monthly recordings. Normally annual measurements are used for comparison, however these will not be available until later in 2021.\nThe monthly measurements suggest the closure of Braid Road has not led to poorer air quality on the A702.\nBus Journeys on the A702\nThe Council has liaised closely with Lothian Buses on a regular basis to determine the impact of the Braid Road closure on A702 bus routes. Lothian Buses have noted that delays have been minimal since the week of August 10th however, in mid -December southbound delays increased as shown in the graph below.\nLothian Buses have noted that traffic routing through residential streets (Cluny Drive to Comiston Road etc) are feeding on to Comiston Road impacting journey times at peak times.\nLothian Buses have expressed support to re-open Braid Road to Southbound traffic to reduce the amount of traffic emerging on to the A702 from side roads between Morningside Station and Greenbank Crossroads. Alternatively, the introduction or additional measure to reduce through traffic from the residential roads between Cluny Drive and Comiston Road could be considered.\nLevel of Cycle use\nCycle counts were carried out on Braid Road shortly after the closure between Thursday 7 May and Wednesday 13 May 2020. During this time an average of 579 cycle journeys used Braid Road each day. Unfortunately, pre-lockdown counts are not available, however, anecdotal evidence suggests that cycle and pedestrian numbers are still significant, even during the winter period, compared to pre-lockdown levels. The most recent count was undertaken between Thursday 10th and Friday 11th December 2020, indicating an average of 168 cycle journeys on Braid Road each day.\nConclusion\nTraffic levels at Greenbank Crossroads remain fairly static at around 17,000vpd, and evidence suggests there has been no negative impact on Air Quality on the A702, southbound bus delays were recorded in mid-December 2020.\nJourney times will continue to be monitored in early 2021.\nThe country is now in a stricter lockdown period and traffic levels across the city have again fallen. Lothian Buses have advised journey times on the A702 routes have returned to normal. However, when the current lockdown eases we may see delays return as traffic levels increase.\nFinally, the recommendation offered to the Transport and Environment Committee is to reopen this route in a southbound direction to mitigate the negative impact of traffic and public transport delays and reduce the level of intrusive traffic using residential streets including Cluny Drive and Braid Crescent etc.\nIt is known that re-opening Braid Road would reintroduce additional traffic into the area. The volume of traffic returning to Braid Road would likely be greater than the corresponding decrease in traffic on Comiston Road. However, there is also a risk that as traffic across the city returns to normal, the level of traffic on Comiston Road will continue to grow in 2021, with likely negative outcomes for public transport journey times and air quality.\nAt the time of completing this briefing the decision to reopen Braid Road is still to be made, the final timing and layout of the proposed Braid Road reopening is still to be finalised.",

The alternative locations are listed below – all were found to be less suitable by Vodafone. Please get in touch if you would like more details – Scott.Arthur@Edinburgh.Gov.UK.\n| Option: | Site Type: | Site Address: | Reason for not choosing site: |\n| A | Existing Streetworks | TEF Site Ref 9327, Redford Road SW, Edinburgh, EH13 9PW | Although currently a shared structure providing 2G, 3G and 4G coverage for both operators, there is no comparable streetworks style solution that can accommodate 5G antennas for both Vodafone and Telefonica. It would require significant redevelopment and a completely new mast of substantial width and height, as well as taking up the majority of land at its base. Therefore it is considered that redevelopment would be inappropriate within the streetscene, compromise pedestrian movements and impact on highway safety. |\n| B | Streetworks | Redford Road SW, Edinburgh, EH13 9PW | To avoid network interference there needs to be vertical and horizontal separation between masts. In this instance 16 metres of horizontal separation is required between the existing streetworks style mast that will continue to be operated by Telefonica and the proposed Vodafone mast. Therefore co-location within this 16 metre radius is not technically viable and so is discounted. |\n| C | Streetworks | Oxgangs Farm Grove, Oxgangs Farm Drive, Oxgangs Farm Avenue, Redford Road, Dreghorn Drive, Dreghorn Gardens, Dreghorn Place, Dreghorn Park, The Gallolee, Edinburgh, EH13 | There are houses fronting both sides of this road, the pavements are narrow and there are regular driveways and pathways for some of the properties. Given the purely residential setting, we consider there are no opportunities to site a street works style proposal on this road as any proposal would compromise pedestrian movements, access arrangements to properties and would also likely impact on highway safety. In addition, the scale of this proposed installation would be out of keeping with the scale of this street. |\n| D | Existing Telecoms Site | EE and 3 Site Ref 57566: Travel Lodge, 47 Dreghorn Link, Edinburgh, EH13 9QR | This location is too far removed from the search area to provide the required level of coverage and capacity in which it would impact upon the neighbouring base station sites in the wider network. Therefore, this site has to be discounted as it does not meet the operator’s technical requirements. |\n| E | Rooftop | Cairndean House, 185 Redford Road, Edinburgh, EH13 9PN | This building was considered, however was determined to be too low to host a sensitively designed base station. When taking into account the roof shape, overall building height, as well as its surrounding context, a rooftop proposal of significant height would be required to meet the operator’s technical requirements. It is considered that such a proposal would be out of keeping with the host building. |\n| F | Streetworks | Street Works on South Pavement of Redford Road SW, Edinburgh, EH13 9PN | There is insufficient space available on this stretch of pavement as the siting and dimensions of a street works style base station would restrict pedestrian movements to unacceptably low levels. |\n| G | Streetworks | Dreghorn Link SW, Edinburgh, EH13 9PN | Given the height and maturity of the trees found next to this site, this natural clutter would prevent the effective propagation of radio signals towards the target area and so this location had to be discounted. |\n| H | Greenfield | Dreghorn Barracks, Redford Road, Edinburgh, EH13 9QW | Given the height and maturity of the trees found next to this site, this natural clutter would prevent the effective propagation of radio signals towards the target area and so this location had to be discounted. |",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2023_08_26_swanston-traffic-comments/content_292.html": "Many thanks to those who completed my recent survey on the speed and volume of traffic cutting through Swanston.\nThere has been a little scaremongering about the survey online, so I wanted to assure you that it was undertaken in good faith following feedback from local residents as a way of understanding the views of the local community. The survey’s outcomes have no binding authority and there is no “secret plan” to close roads in the area etc and I have played no part producing any plan (secret or otherwise). Nonetheless, the scaremongering about some sort of “plan” has left some older residents feeling worried. It’s sad that someone can be so concerned about me trying to understand the views of local residents.\nThe survey is still open, but so far the responses fall into three broad categories:\n- Those that feel there may be an issue, but are concerned about the negative consequences of dealing with it.\n- Those that feel there is an issue and want it addressed.\n- Those that feel there is no problem.\nI give a summery of the comments below, and will post the full results in 2-3 weeks.\nComment Group 1 – People with concerns about the volume and/or speed of vehicles in the area.\n- Swanston Avenue Resident – There is an increase in young families with children in the area and are regularly out playing on their bikes and scooters, fast traffic is a danger\n- Swanston Avenue Resident – Working from home, I see the speed and volume of traffic coming along Swanston Avenue – On a daily basis I am genuinely terrified of my kids accidentally getting hit by some of the cars speeding along the street well in excess of 30mph. Something has to be done to decrease both the speed and number of cars/vans/lorries using the road as a shortcut. Also the road is still often used by HGVs despite signs advising against this.\n- Swanston Gardens Resident – Traffic volume is rarely an issue. Traffic speed is a daily issue.\n- Swanston Place Resident – I wrote to the council around 15 years ago (when my daughter was little) raising concerns about people using Swanston Avenue as a short cut and speeding, but their response was along the lines of they had higher priorities.\n- Swanston Avenue Resident – I would like to see a no right turn from Swanston Avenue onto Biggar Road. Also many cars are dodging parked cars at high speed & cutting the corner so a middle white line painted on Swanston Avenue. Anti skid onto Swanston Avenue to prevent further crashes in winter\n- I live outside the area – Speed bumps or similar measures would be very welcome\n- Swanston Avenue Resident – More children living and playing with bikes and scooters in the estate.\n- Swanston View Resident – In particular the speed of delivery vans and even the councils own waste vehicles is ridiculous. They speed up Swanston View at 40mph. It’s only a matter of time until a child is run over\n- Swanston Avenue Resident – Speed reducing measures, maybe lane limiting, and also enforcing fellow residents to stop parking on corners would all make a difference.\n- Swanston Avenue Resident – Better police enforcement (when there are roadworks) at the restricted time as that’s when the issue is\n- Swanston Avenue Resident – I would support slowing traffic down. Speed restrictions are not effective\n- Swanston Grove Resident – Speed reduction measures are required with double yellows on corners and junctions.\n- I live outside the area – I have no problems with speed restrictions and enforcement.\n- Swanston View Resident – This area has an increasing number of small children whose safety needs to be protected. There are speeding vehicles pretty much all day. At midnight last night I witnessed a chase between a Fiesta ST and a Golf on the Avenue. As a residential area there’s a lot of cats around as well who are at risk.\n- Swanston Grove Resident – Traffic calming measures can be taken to reduce speed and traffic rather than a sledgehammer approach of shutting the roads.\n- Swanston Grove Resident – Lots of kids out playing around the grove & avenue , speed bumps or other speed reducing measures would be reassuring\n- Swanston Gardens Resident – Swanston is a rat run,i have sat in traffic jams from Swanston Avenue trying to access my property due to residents parking and rat runners not being courteous drivers. I have had bad experiences driving on the Avenue with cars speeding and my young children walking around the local streets going to and from school have commented on speeding vehicles and the fact some vehicles are quieter but still speeding! I would suspect with Sainsburys coming into the area will also increase traffic flow, especially delivery vehicles and waste collection, coming into the estate from Swanston Drive.\n- Swanston Avenue Resident – We need a traffic calming system\n- Swanston Avenue Resident – Far too much traffic is coming through\n- Swanston Drive Resident – Many elderly people and families in Swanston Drive / Grove/ Avenue. Too many rat runners for over 25 years. Anything that can be done should be.\nComment Group 2 – People who are content with the status quo.\n- Swanston Terrace Resident – The only time traffic through the estate is an issue is when there are roadworks at the Fairmilehead crossroads. In the last 30+ years I’ve lived here that crossroads has been dug up multiple times. Surely there is nothing left to do under there?\n- Swanston Grove Resident – The increase in traffic is caused by the problems due to roadworks at Fairmilehead crossroads.\n- Swanston Grove Resident – No change is required.\n- Swanston Gardens Resident – I really don’t think there is a big problem of rat runs, except when roadworks as now. A 20 mph enforced speed limit with camera would work.\n- Swanston Place Resident – Whilst traffic coming through the estate can be an issue this only really happens when there is congestion due to road works or bypass issues.\n- I live outside the area Resident – Mostly used by locals when the queue at the lights is problematic\n- Swanston Avenue Resident – Slow people down on the corner, anti slip on the corner. Bollards would make the road horrific in winter – need the two options to get out of the estate. Speed bumps are not needed\n- I live outside the area – The main solution is to better manage roadworks at Fairmilehead crossroads as there have been far too many over the last few years which have a knock on effect for Swanston. As it is a crossroads on a major artery then contractors should be forced to carry out work quicker including night time and weekend work.\n- Swanston Drive Resident – The problem is always worse when there’s an issue on Biggar Road. There’s as much problem trying to get out from Swanston ONTO Biggar Road due to there being continuous flow from the bypass\n- Swanston Avenue Resident – I agree with view that there is no issue unless there are issues elsewhere, e.g. gas works on Oxgangs Road, closure of City Bypass, resurfacing of Biggar Road / Comiston Road.\nComment Group 3 – People who are concerned about the negative impact of any changes (this includes people from Comment Group 1 & 2).\n- I live outside the area – Please do NOT restrict cars going through Swanston\n- Swanston Grove Resident – Blocking off Swanston Avenue would cause chaos.\n- I live outside the area – I lived in Swanston drive until recently. I would not want to see traffic blocked from moving through the estate if it meant having to go out into biggar road up the crossroads and then left simply so I could go to Morrisons or Tesco (for example).\n- I live outside the area – I live locally on Biggar Road so use the Swanston estate regularly. Any measures to reduce traffic in Swanston would mean even more traffic on Biggar Road and Oxgangs Road\n- Swanston Avenue Resident – We definitely do not want to lose resident access to both entrances / exits by creating culdesacs or no entry etc.\n- Swanston Grove Resident – Blocking roads will make residents lives much harder getting in and out. Living on Swanston Grove I often drive along Swanston Avenue and out to Oxgangs Road instead of coming out onto Biggar Road because a right turn can be very dangerous there. As such, would really not welcome any blockages from the lower to top half of Swanston.\n- Swanston View Resident – The left turn from biggar road is great for us, we use it to get home from work every day, it would be very frustrating to lose that and have to sit in traffic at the crossroads every evening\n- Swanston Avenue Resident – As an elderly driver , i need my car to help me maintain my independence. I would not support closing one of the accesses to Swanston avenue as in icy road conditions, i choose access to my road depending on road condition.\n- Swanston Gardens Resident – The plans effectively stop cars entering Swanston Avenue completely from Biggar road. This can’t be fair to residents. I live in Swanston Gardens, parallel to Oxgangs Road, meaning I have to enter by The Avenue all the time.\n- Swanston Grove Resident – I am against the suggestion of stopping traffic coming all the way through the estate. Turning right into the estate from Biggar road is dangerous with the current speed of the traffic. Forcing people who live at the Grove end of the estate to use the Biggar road entry will also increase congestion at the Fairmilehead cross roads.\n- Swanston Avenue Resident – A block at the entrance side of the Bigger Road junction would make life more awkward for people living at that end of the estate. But other places appear to have managed fine enough, eg near the Barnton junction.\n- Swanston Gardens Resident – I believe road closers would cause more problems than it solves. I do not want my only entrance and exit to my home being on to a busy duel carriageway.\n- Swanston Grove Resident – Don’t want streets permantly closed as stated in plans as this would impact my access in and out of Swanston on to oxgangs road. Local access only if roadworks happening on biggar road or oxgangs rd nth”\n- Swanston Place Resident – No speed bumps please! They are ineffective and simply add to noise pollution. Top and bottom access to Swanston estate is necessary to facilitate expedient access for emergency vehicles, so please consider essential and often critical vehicle access as part of the overall assessment.\n- I live outside the area – Turning onto Swanston Drive gives access to visiting friends on or just off Swanston Drive ie in Swanston estate. For those of us too old to cycle, please don’t block all car access to Swanson Drive as some would seem to want. How can I pick up friends to gout somewhere if I can’t drive to their house?\n- Swanston View Resident – Access at both Biggar and Oxgangs Roads is necessary for emergency services. During snowy and icy conditions we need access to both roads as often it’s impossible to get out of the estate.\n- Swanston View Resident – Access at both Biggar and Oxgangs Roads is imperative for ambulances and other emergency vehicles especially during snow and ice conditions. It is also a must to have top and bottom access for residents during snow and ice conditions.\nComment Group 4 – Other relevant comments (this includes people from Comment Group 1, 2 & 3).\n- Swanston View Resident – Swanston View / Avenue – You need to drive down the wrong side of the View and visibility round onto the Avenue is reduced. Equally dangerous is the junction of Swanston Avenue / Gardens when you come in from Oxgangs Road, due to cars parked right to the corner. Yet again today I had to reverse round the corner back onto the Avenue.\n- I live outside the area – Restricting access leads to congestion on other roads. Delivery drivers and tradesmen often have to make unnecessary detours. If you stop left turns at both junctions, then a resident living on Swanston Drive or a delivery driver coming from Biggar Road would need to do a long detour turning left at Fairmilehead traffic lights and accessing Swanston Avenue from Oxgangs Road, passing through other Swanston roads. Also if a resident or delivery driver is not using the road as a cut-through but to reach a destination in the Swanston area, it seems sensible that they can make these left turns. The council seldom look at knock-on effects of road closures. I never use these left turns myself. Well done not restricting the consultation to Swanston residents; it affects others.”\n- Swanston View Resident – Stop irresponsible parking at corners especially Top of Swanston avenue – oxgangs rd turning left Biggar rd turning into Swanston avenue. Swanston avenue turning into Swanston gardens Kids crossing at oxgangs road at caiystane is a concern. No crossing attendants in the area for school kids\n- Swanston Gardens Resident – We also need a no entry box to vehicles at the Swanston Avenue to Biggar Road junction as cars never let traffic in or out at peak times.\n- Swanston Grove Resident – If money is tight would it not be better to utilise this money in other places. As a parent of young children at Pentland primary school we use the swanston avenue route to get to school. It is already hard to turn onto Biggar road and with the change in use of the Craigdon building it will become harder and quite frankly more dangerous for us to use this route.\n- The real problem is parking especially where you turn off Biggar Rd onto Swanston Ave. If someone is waiting to get out you can’t get off the main Rd due to parked cars. Yellow lines are needed to the crest of the hill. Parking on the road and pavement is a problem in the whole estate. People need to use their drives. Adding speed bumps or narrowing the street will just make things worse.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_01_12_briefing-planned-work-along-the-water-of-leith-walkway-by-scottish-water-between-baberton-loan-and-colinton-dell/content_576.html": "This post provides information relating on the works Scottish Water (via their contractor Amey) will be carrying out which affect the Water of Leith Walkway between Baberton Loan and Colinton Dell from January 27th.\nAs many people may know, a trunk sewer runs along the Water of Leith. When it is full it overflows (normally raw sewage diluted with rainwater) into the Water of Leith via devices known as “Combined Sewer Overflows“. This work is focussed on the Combined Sewer Overflows. The table at the foot of this page outlines the planned work.\nWhilst undertaking works at Baberton Loan Scottish Water will look to keep the pedestrian access open as much as possible, so the gates will normally be closed for the construction traffic, when traffic movements are required a Banksman will open the gate (which will temporarily close the path for Pedestrians), to allow the vehicles to pass, and then close the gate once through. Essentially when there are no traffic movements the pathway will be clear for Pedestrians to cross. Scottish Water are advising the residents of Woodhall Mains of these access arrangements.\nOnce Scottish Water have completed this work, the Council will then take forward work already planned to improve sections of the path. From them:\nThe following is the latest position I have received from Sustrans on this project. As envisaged, funding has been restricted to design work with construction delayed until the completion of the Scottish Water sewer outflow construction works within Colinton Dells.\n“Sustrans have supported the design work on this route upgrade project to be shovel ready this year. It is our intention to fund the delivery of capital works following the Scottish Water works planned on the site for the first 6 months of 2020. We therefore intend to identify capital funds to deliver the route upgrade from our Network Development grant programme for 2020/2021.”\nOnce we have a clearer timescale for the completion of the SW works and Sustrans have confirmation of their 2020/2021 budgets we will be in a position to finalise the timescale for delivery of this project.\n| Water of Leith – Project | Brief Project Scope |\n| WATER OF LEITH UIDs – BATCH 1 – South Gyle, Gogarloch SPS EO | New Emergency Overflow, 6mm letter box type bar screen with Launder channel to be installed within existing wet well, as well as Telemetry Mods if required. |\n| WATER OF LEITH UIDs – BATCH 2 – Currie, Old Mill Off Lanark Road CSO and Juniper Green | Original Scope was to Retro fit 2 No. Static Screens to the existing CSO chambers, new chambers are to be provided.

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_02_06_briefing-challenges-in-recycling-hard-plastics-in-edinburgh/content_568.html": "Hard plastics are predominantly bulkier type items like storage boxes, kids toys, garden furniture, plant pots etc. Below is a briefing from the Council on the problems it faces recycling them.\nQuestion (1) – Why has the Council stopped accepting “hard plastic” as a recycling stream?\nAnswer (1) – There are significant challenges with recycling hard plastics and the Council has been unable to find a reprocessing contractor willing to accept these materials. The hard plastic containers which had been located at Seafield and Bankhead Recycling Centres were removed over the course of December 2019 to January 2020. The hard-plastic container at Craigmillar Recycling Centre will be removed shortly. This issue is not unique to Edinburgh and other local authorities have made similar changes as a result of the difficulties in reprocessing hard plastics.\nQuestion (2) – What implication does this have for plastic recycling for kerb side and communal bin collections?\nAnswer (2) – None. Whilst the council has in place various collection systems which directly collect materials for recycling or which otherwise divert materials, it is not always directly involved in selling to end use markets. Hard plastics are not collected as part of the kerbside or communal waste collection service. Until recently, hard plastics could only be recycled at the Household Waste Recycling Centres, where it would then go on to a reprocessor contractor who would clean and shred to sell as raw material. Hard plastics can still be put into general waste and will be converted into energy at our Millerhill Site.\nQuestion (3) – What steps are being taken to increase the possibilities for plastic recycling for the Edinburgh public?\nAnswer (3) – Markets for plastics are ever changing. Council currently uses a contract which covers dry mixed materials and we encourage plastics recycling such as bottles or milk cartons. The Council will continue to monitor the demand for all plastics and will reintroduce containers in Household Waste Recycling Centres if there is demand for hard plastics and options for reprocessing become available. In addition:\n- A Council officer will attend a meeting in February on an innovative scheme for recycling hard plastic materials, based in Perthshire. At present, there is no guarantee that this scheme will progress to market or that an outlet will be secured but progress will continue to be monitored;\n- A procurement exercise is currently underway to secure a new supplier for dry mix recycling (i.e. plastics that are disposed of in green bins). The successful tenderer will be expected to maximise recycling all dry mixed recycling materials; and\n- A campaign to improve the quality of the plastics which can be recycled (e.g. reducing the plastic materials which are deposited for recycling, but which are contaminated by food) is planned.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_04_26_edinburgh-airbnb-a-briefing-on-the-problem-and-the-powers-edinburgh-needs-to-deal-with-it/content_749.html": "I received this today – It’s concerning to see the impact on the homes available for rent.\nPurpose\nThis briefing note provides a summary of the impact of Short Term Lets (STLs) on Edinburgh and an update on the Council current enforcement and proposed regulatory powers.\nMain Briefing\nImpact of short term lets on supply and housing costs\nRecent analysis (using Airbnb data) published in April 2019 by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) has shown that were over 12,000 registered Airbnb properties in Edinburgh in 2018. This figure is a significant increase from research available to the Council where the overall number was calculated at approximately 9000 registered properties in 2017. The increase of Airbnb properties has continued to grow each year from 2009 when there were a total of 8 registered properties in the city. Airbnb reports that 21% of the 9,000 properties (1,890) registered in 2017, operate in excess of 90 days or more, which would indicate they are no longer being used on a residential basis\nThe research available indicates that short term lets are predominately located within the City Centre and adjoining areas. Analysis from the Chartered Institute of Housing identified that there are two Airbnb lets for every 13 homes within City Centre Ward 11.\nAnalysis of the housing market impacts in Edinburgh carried out in 2018 showed that the rapid growth in short term lets over a short period was having an impact on both supply and rent levels. There are over 60,000 private rented sector (PRS) homes in Edinburgh, which represent a quarter of the city’s housing. Presently there is an estimated loss of 10% of the PRS sector attributed to short term lets. The loss of traditional PRS properties is more prevalent in the city centre and in the north of the city, with the loss of stock running at up to 30% in some northern parts of Edinburgh.\nAcross the city, PRS stock levels fell c.5-6% between 2014-2017 which may be attributable to a number of factors including changes in taxation and regulation of PRS. However, it should be noted that over the same period the city saw 2,700 more properties per year listed as available on Airbnb, while PRS stock fell 560 per annum. Research continues to take place to better quantify the loss of PRS properties to short term lets industry.\nThe speed and size of rent increases within the city continue to be a substantial issue which the city encounters. Research indicates rising rents occurring in those areas bordering a high concentration of Airbnb, suggesting a displacement of demand. In those areas bordering the city centre, rents have increased around 20-27% over the period 2014-17.\nExisting powers available to the Council\nA Short Term Lets Virtual Team has been created to co-ordinate action using existing powers across several services. The Regulatory Services Manager leads this team, with a team leader from Planning acting as a day to day manager. The following resources in terms of front line staff contribute to the team:\n- Trading Standards;\n- Environmental Health;\n- Private Rented Services;\n- Planning;\n- Community Safety;\nThe virtual team review all complaints received about short term lets and, where possible, identify and implement a response to address poor practice through any powers available to the Council. The team also encourage good practice and assist in collecting intelligence on how the short term industry responds to this approach.\nThe team prioritises enforcement activity in relation to those short term lets believed to be operating on a commercial basis.\nMost of the cases investigated by the team have involved consideration of planning enforcement action. Since July 2018, 126 new cases have been opened and while 71 are ongoing, 22 have been subject to enforcement action. When investigating the cases, it must be established whether the use of a residential premises for short term holiday lets is a material change of use. The question of materiality is one of fact and degree having regard to a number of factors such as the character of the property, the frequency of arrivals and departures, the number of people occupying the property, disturbance to neighbouring residential amenity. Evidence gathering can be a very difficult process. Case officers must consider each of the above factors. This can involve a number of visits to check levels of occupation and to collect corroborative evidence to support any claims of noise and nuisance.\nSince 2018, 22 enforcement notices have been served, 8 have been appealed and all 8 have been upheld by Scottish Government reporters. There has been legal challenges in respect of the reporters’ decisions at Chancelot Terrace and Baxter’s Place. Chancelot Terrace was withdrawn and Baxter’s Place is due to be heard at the Court of Session. During this period there has also been planning appeal decisions against refusals to grant planning permission and certificates of lawfulness for short stay let uses. These decisions have typically allowed short term let uses in main door properties.\nThe reporters’ decisions have informed an understanding of when a change of use may be material but, also through the planning appeal decisions, when a short stay let use may be acceptable. This makes it easier to know when to take action moving forward and should lead to action being taken more quickly. This is reflected in the fact that 11 notices have already been served in the first 3 months of this year, the same number for the whole of 2018. In addition in-house training is being put in place to ensure that the officers take a more consistent and robust approach to investigations moving forward.\nThe virtual team is looking at new ways of working in response to the growth of short stay lets. It is trialling the use of an impact warning letters to tackle a large concentration of short stay lets at Western Harbour. Working with residents and the property factor, over 40 letters have been sent out to the owners of the flats in question to highlight the permissions and other various legal requirement they may be breaching and requiring that the use cease. The owners have until the 30 April 2019 to reply but responses so far indicate that the trial may be worth pursuing.\nA Checklist of Best Practice has also been produced to inform owners of their legal obligations in terms of permissions, safety at the property and managing visitors. This guidance is aimed at educating owners and prospective operators to their obligations to not only their tenants but also the wider community. This form of self – regulation can have an important role to play in limiting the growth of inappropriate forms of short term let uses.\nThe planning service has also piloted taking enforcement action against key safes on listed buildings. This resulted in the enforcement notice for the removal of 11 key safes attached to a listed building at 1 Upper Bow being upheld on appeal. The success of this pilot highlights that in certain circumstances it can be appropriate to take action against multiple key safes on a single property.\nAhead of the summer period, the virtual team have been making arrangements to deal with an anticipated increase in the number of complaints. It is hoped this proactive approach will help to identify and tackle the most troublesome cases and provide residents with a satisfactory service.\nProposals for further regulatory powers\nTaking into account the issues and proposed actions outlined above, it remains clear that the Council lacks specific regulatory powers which would allow it to effectively respond to all the issues currently faced by the City. Previous research has been reported to a number of committees offering comparison with how other major cities and tourist destinations have dealt with similar issues.\nIt is clear that, as pressures from the operation of short term lets mount on a city or region, the vast majority of major destinations have resorted to new or additional statutory powers. These powers typically impose a cap on the total number of properties used as short term lets, and/or a cap on the number of days that an individual property can be used as a short term let. The motivating factors are very similar to the issues faced by this council, namely a desire to protect the supply of residential homes and to minimise the disruption to local communities.\nThe Council has therefore requested that the Scottish Government introduces a discretionary licensing system for operators of short term lets. The Council would expect that each individual local authority could consider the relevance of the licensing system and choose whether to adopt the scheme in its area. At a minimum the licensing system must be capable of the following:\n- A licence will be for both the individual property and the owner or operator of that property;\n- Any owner or operator shall be fit and proper;\n- The local authority shall have the discretion within the licensing system to control or otherwise cap the number of properties licensed either across the local authority area or in specific areas of the local authority;\n- A licensed property must meet certain safety standards, e.g. gas appliances must be safety checked;\n- The location, character and suitability of properties will be relevant;\n- A licence will be required for anyone either operating a property on a commercial basis or in excess of 45 days.\nThe exact scope of any licensing system would ultimately be the decision of the local authority, and after consultation it is anticipated that a policy would be adopted to set out a local position. It is recommended that the preferred method of introducing a licensing system is by means of regulations introduced by Scottish Government under Section 44 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982. Amending the licensing system for HMOs under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 is the least preferred option, as this could have wider implications for unrelated housing matters, and the licensing scheme under the Act applies Scotland-wide. Failing this the Council would ask for fresh legislation as an alternative.",

A lot has happened since then, but frustratingly the city still has no administration.\nIf newspaper reports are to be believed, however, before the end of the month Edinburgh will have an SNP led minority administration, with the Labour Party being their junior partner.\nAs a Labour Councillor, I have found it very difficult to support this deal. This was not because I somehow “hate” the SNP. My opposition is based on the fact that I feel Edinburgh deserves to be governed by a majority administration due to the stability that would provide.\nThere are also many concerns regarding the extent to which the deal reflects the manifesto I based my election on. Indeed, I have not yet heard from anyone living in my Ward that supports the deal – although I accept there will be support for it locally.\nI now accept, however, that the deal is all but inevitable and once the new administration is in place I have a duty to work with all other Councillors, including those representing Ward 8 (Colinton/Fairmilehead) with me, to make it work.\nI am in no doubt that in the coming years Edinburgh’s budget will be cut further. I hope that Labour’s involvement in running the Council will mean that the vulnerable are protected from these cuts. That will be my aim along with ensuring that Ward 8 receives its fair share of resources. Above all else, I want to focus on bringing good quality jobs and affordable housing to our capital.\nThis is a fantastic city, but I want to make it a better place to live, work and bring up a family.\nNote: The map is from here.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_02_16_edinburgh-labour-budget-statement/content_474.html": "Our City Still Faces a Reduced Budget\nListening to the SNP and the Green Party you would think that funding for the city is increasing. The truth is that recent announcements from the Scottish Government have reduced the level of cuts originally anticipated. But fewer cuts is not the same as an increased amount of funding.\nBetween 2013 and 2017 the funding from Westminster to Holyrood reduced by 1.6% but the funding from the SNP Scottish Government to local government reduced by 6.9%. Subsequent cuts to local services have affected the lives of all of us. For example in Edinburgh at the end of January we had 1791 people waiting to be assessed for social care, and 766 people whose assessment has been carried out but who are still waiting for a care package to be put in place. A backlog of 8,699 hours a week of care remains to be provided due to the failure of current arrangements. In addition 233 people are delayed in hospital. Lack of pavement maintenance creates hazards especially for the less mobile among us.\nIn 2016 the SNP fought an election opposing Labour’s plan to use Scotland’s revenue raising powers progressively. Edinburgh Labour therefore welcomes the fact that this year the SNP Government, after have their hand forced by the Greens, has finally decided to use Holyrood’s powers. However the SNP has not gone far enough and our capital is facing a 3.6% real terms cut in its budget this year.\nNonetheless, Edinburgh Labour has fought to deliver its manifesto commitments. In particular we have secured additional funding for social care, homelessness and have reversed a proposed cut to public library opening hours. We have championed the increase in school uniform grants and the provision of school meals during holidays, which will help many of the very poorest families in the city facing the impacts of austerity.\nBut this is still a budget settlement that reduces overall funding to the Council. Cuts have still had to be made and a 3% rise in Council Tax is needed to reduce the impact of funding shortfalls .\nScottish Labour’s budget proposals would have increased funding to local government by using Holyrood’s revenue raising powers, reforming Council Tax and giving Edinburgh the power to introduce a “tourist tax” of 1% on hotel stays. This and other powers such as a being able to introduce a workplace parking levy would have given our Capital the funding it needs to help ensure every citizen can reach their full potential.",

I am mindful that military personnel based in my Ward served in Afghanistan, and some gave their lives (there is a memorial inside Dreghorn Barracks). These service men and women may well have worked with the refugees previously employed by the British Services detailed below. Helping these families is the very least we can do.\nBriefing\nMembers will be aware of the recent deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan and press reports of the various ways in which the UK Government is responding to its humanitarian implications.\nOfficers are in regular contact with both the UK and Scottish Governments to develop plans for how best the Council and our partners can offer support and housing to as many Afghan refugees as possible.\nTwo options are currently being progressed:\n- Permanent resettlement for a cohort of Afghans (and their families) previously employed by the British Services in Afghanistan is being explored. They would be housed in surplus MOD property. Agreement on leasing from the MOD is still to be reached but is being progressed as a matter of urgency.\n- The Home Office has indicated (via COSLA) that, due to the pressure of numbers now being resettled, it intends to move forward with plans to procure hotel accommodation in Edinburgh.\nDue to the speed with which plans are being developed, details – including exact numbers and locations – are still to be confirmed.\nWork will continue with the Home Office and partners and particularly services such as education and health to coordinate arrival and support planning.\nWe’ll provide a further update once more details become available.",

The main focus is safety issues associated Bus Stop Boarders (I wrongly called these floating bus stops previously), the new Bus Lane, the Biggar Rd speed limit and an issue at the Fairmilehead crossroads.\nBus Stop Boarders\nMe: See attached (tweet in header image) from Living Streets on Bus Stop Boarders. Are these also off the table for the A702?\nCouncil: “Bus Stop Bypasses are still proposed on the A702. These will be part of Phase 2”\nMe: “Why are the bus stop boarders being removed from other schemes but not the A702?”\nCouncil: We have decided to omit Bus Stop Bypasses from some schemes, this is primarily to reduce costs associated with delivering these. Broadly, the criteria we have applied are as follows:\nIf a road is: 20mph AND local or secondary AND serves less than 10 buses per hour, we will not generally use Bus Stop Bypasses. On these roads it will be reasonably safe for someone cycling to overtake a stopped bus. You will note that each of these applies for Pennywell Road; Causewayside and Buccleuch Street.\nIf however a road is 30mph (or more), OR; Strategic, OR; serves more than 10 buses per hour, we generally will use Bus Stop Bypasses.\nThere are some exceptions to the above and there will always be consideration of the site conditions – especially gradient. For example, we are not proposing Bypasses at bus stops in lay-bys on a downhill grade where people cycling do not need to change direction in order to overtake a stopped bus.\nComiston Road is a busy strategic route, has a speed limit of 30mph and at times a steep grade. Expecting people cycling to move into traffic in order to pass a stopped bus on a road like this – especially when travelling uphill – will significantly increase the risk, and limit the attractiveness of using this route by bike, especially to less confident and beginner cyclists.\nThe detail of our Bus Stop Bypass design will make clear to people cycling that they should give way to pedestrians, and that they should reduce their speed on the approach to bus stops.\nYou may be interested in the attached research reports looking at the operation of the Bus Stop Bypasses that have already been installed on Leith Walk between Pilrig Street and Macdonald Road. This research has been circulated to Transport Spokespersons for each party as well as relevant stakeholders (SPOKES; Living Streets; Edinburgh Access Panel; Edinburgh Bus Users Group).\nThe first is a report produced by Edinburgh Napier University which considers specifically the nature of the interactions between Pedestrians and Cyclists at these Bus Stop Bypasses during November 2017.\nThe second is a report produced by AECOM Ltd which considers several elements of the Leith Programme, including the Bus Stop Bypasses, Albert Place cycle-priority crossing, and Middlefield continuous footway. This report considers these elements against various indicators to provide an overall picture, across three assessment periods: November 2017; May 2018, and November 2018.\nYou will note that this monitoring demonstrates several interesting findings:\n- The overall number of people walking and cycling increased over the study period\n- The proportion of cyclists entering the footway, and pedestrians entering the cycleway decreased over time\n- The frequency, of interactions between people walking and cycling at the Bus Stop bypasses was very low with the vast majority of users not being involved in any form of interaction,\n- The typical severity of the interactions that did occur between people walking and cycling at bus stops was also very low, with most conflicts which did take place being minor in nature\n- These outcomes are consistent with other studies within the UK\n- Those conflicts which did occur were most often when cyclists and pedestrians were facing the same way and a pedestrian stepped into the cycleway. It is anticipated that installing cycleways with a level difference will reduce this type of conflict, and others, to even lower levels\nI hope this is helpful, please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.\nMe: Can you confirm which of the studied stops use the same design as proposed on Comiston Road? If the answer is “none”, does CEC have any data which explains specifically the nature of the interactions between pedestrians and cyclists? When you say “we have decided to omit Bus Stop Bypasses from some schemes”, can you be clear about who “we” is? I understand there was a meeting with the Edinburgh Access Panel and Living Streets etc last week. Were their views on these stops discussed? Can the notes from the meeting be shared?\nCouncil: [awaiting reply]\nNew Bus Lane\nMe: I am getting lots of general e-mails from constituents about the A702, but the new bus lane at Fairmilehead crossroads is an issue that keeps coming up. I had a look at it yesterday, and I could see that southbound drivers were quick to merge (in the rush for the lights) alongside cyclists where the cycle lane ends. I feel the original proposed design was safer for cyclists, but making the bus lane 24/7 would be an improvement. Local residents are requesting off-peak parking in the bus lane. Can these three options be considered?\nCouncil: We will look into extending Bus Lane operation hours to 7am – 7pm on both bus lanes on the affected section of the A702 (northbound and southbound) to protect cyclists outside peak hours. We will not be introducing off-peak parking as this would be incompatible with the bus lanes being safe for use by cyclist\nTraffic Lanes on Biggar Road\nMe: Northbound traffic on the Biggar Rd still forms in two lanes (see header image). This leads to a sudden merger of traffic as it enters Buckstone Terrace. Making the left-hand lane for left turning traffic only would be safer. Can this be considered?\nCouncil: This is already part of the designs. I believe this will be don\nBiggar Rd Speed Limit\nMe: This must be the shortest section of 40mph road in Edinburgh and zero protection is offered to cyclists. Can we make it 30mph?\nCouncil: I will liaise with our Road Safety Team. If this section is already proposed to be reduced to 30mph then I will look into delivering this as part of SfP.\nMe: Yes, Biggar Rd was scheduled to be 30mph.",

SNP Councillor Adam McVey claimed to have “a mandate to lead the city” despite his group having just 19 of Edinburgh’s 63 Councillors and his party’s share of first preference votes fell to 25.9%.\nThis kind of outlook perhaps explains why the Greens, Labour, Lib-Dems and Tories all appear less than keen to work with Edinburgh’s nationalist Councillors.\nIn the article he rightly mentions the “cost of living crisis” as being one of the biggest challenges facing people in Edinburgh today, but he failed to mention his party’s role in making it worse. From driving up rents by allowing short term lets to run riot in Edinburgh for a decade to increasing our water bills to help fund Scottish Water’s boss taking a bonus of £227,000, the SNP have much to answer for.\nIndeed, the SNP’s failure to stand up for ordinary people in Edinburgh is a key part of why Labour can’t support them in running our city. We will, however, work with progressive people in every party who put our city first to help tackle the combined challenges of the cost of living crisis, the climate emergency and the Covid recovery.",

The local walking campaign, Living Streets Edinburgh Group [1], has discovered through a Freedom of Information request by one of its members [2] that the Council plans to introduce 1,206 more parking spaces on city centre streets. The campaigners say that this will undermine confidence in the ability to deliver a safer, cleaner city, its Convenor, Don McKee, commenting:\n‘We’ve been strongly supportive of the Council’s visionary plans for a more walking-friendly city centre. But this revelation – adding the equivalent of 5.5 kilometres of car parking space on our streets – is either breathtakingly hypocritical or it suggests that the Council’s left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is trying to do.’\n‘Extra parking takes valuable public space away from walking, cycling and buses – and it means more traffic on the roads, directly conflicting with the Council’s stated vision. Yet walking is designated as the top priority in the Scottish Government’s planning policies [3]. It’s time for the Council to properly recognise this in its programmes and projects for the city. ‘Business as usual’ – with the car as king – is simply not an option when we’re trying to tackle the climate emergency.’\nAnalysis of the FoI reply indicates that parking spaces in some streets will be boosted far beyond the 12% average – examples being Grove Street (30%), Mayfield Terrace (34%) and Blenheim Place (38%). Full street-by-street details can be found here: http://bit.ly/3bm3yq3\nNOTES FOR EDITORS:\n[1] Living Streets Edinburgh Group is the local volunteer arm of Living Streets, the national charity for ‘everyday walking’, see: http://www.livingstreetsedinburgh.org.uk\n[2] The Freedom of Information request asked, in relation to Traffic Regulation Order TRO19/29 for detail of (i) number of parking spaces added and removed per street, and (ii) distance in meters of parking space added and removed per street. See: https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/traffic_regulation_order_tro1929?nocache=incoming-1511839#incoming-1511839\n[3] Paragraph 273 of ‘Scottish Planning Policy’ states that: ‘Plans should identify active travel networks and promote opportunities for travel by more sustainable\nmodes in the following order of priority: walking, cycling, public transport, cars. The aim is to promote development which maximises the extent to which its travel demands are met first\nthrough walking, then cycling, then public transport and finally through use of private cars.’ See: https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-planning-policy/",

The work will start on the 14th of February.\nUpdate from Senior Engineer, Traffic Signs\nI had a meeting with CEC Road Safety Tuesday this week and Hunter Tryst roundabout was discussed further.\n[To protect the privacy of those concerned, I’ve removed details of an incident which took place just after 3pm on Monday, April 26 – the cause appears unknown]\nThe following highway maintenance work is required to be carried out in due course and will bring the junction up to current ‘well maintained highway’ regulation standards however, the maintenance work required to be carried out is not considered to be a contributory factor of the road traffic accident:-\n- Road Operations to ensure any faded road markings are refreshed and consider the installation of ‘slow’ road markings on all approaches if not so already.\n- Traffic Signs to ensure any faded sign faces are replaced (there would appear to be one faded roundabout sign at New Swantson junction approach but can still be read)\n- Lighting to ensure the x lights on the roundabout traffic signs and adjacent lighting columns are working.\n- Other issues raised and considered in the interests of public safety.\nThe installation of a warning sign on the Oxgangs Road south approach was considered but could not be justified as there is adequate driver visibility 45 meters in advance of the roundabout traffic sign at the give way line on Oxgangs Road south approach to the roundabout at Hunters Tryst.\nThere is no justification to consider any junction realignments taking account of the above information and nature of the road traffic accident.\nQuestion – Taking account of current commitments when do you estimate the signs maintenance work will be carried out on site, please update Vivian direct thanks?\nThe signs work is being organised for week ending 18 February 2022- PK Traffic Signs",

Below that is a update from the gully team from a couple of weeks ago on the progress they were making in my Ward.\nFlooding in Edinburgh – 4th July 2021\nYou will no doubt be aware of the localised, but significant, surface water flooding that we experienced in a number of areas of the city yesterday afternoon and evening.\nI thought it would be useful to provide you with an update on action taken to date and some background information on our operations.\nThe Gully Team worked throughout last night and today to respond to reports of flooding. This team has also been supported by additional resource from the Roads Operations service in order to respond to as many reports as possible, as quickly as we could.\nUnfortunately, the significant rainfall intensity that we experienced was way beyond the capacity of the road drainage system. There were a number of examples across the city where road drains were surcharging due to the Scottish Water sewer network also being at capacity. As you would expect, we are working with Scottish Water to identify these locations and any potential solutions to prevent future recurrences.\nMuch of the flooding subsided relatively quickly after the rainfall intensity reduced, which would indicate a lack of capacity in the drainage network as opposed to blocked road drainage. At the time of writing, there is no known location where there is still standing water.\nIn addition to responding to the flooding and any clean ups that are required, Roads Operations have also been responding to damaged manhole covers. Where these covers are the responsibility of Scottish Water, we have been making them safe and then passing them on to Scottish Water for fuller repair or replacement.\nMembers will be aware that we operate a target schedule of every two years for gully emptying. In addition, we have an enhanced six monthly emptying frequency for the sensitive locations in the city where there are known hotspots for surface water flooding. I can report that the sensitive location routes had been completed in advance of the adverse weather event. In addition, over 10,500 gullies had been attended to in the last four months alone in line with our wider maintenance schedule.\nI appreciate that you may be contacted by constituents who have, unfortunately, experienced water damage to residential or commercial properties. If this is the case, we recommend that these constituents are advised to contact their insurance company as a priority. If you do feel that there is a complaint that you feel warrants further investigation then please email Roads.GullyCleansing@edinburgh.gov.uk.\nIf you would like to discuss any of the content of this note, or any other related matter, then please feel free to contact me directly.\nWard 8 Gully Maintenance (15th June 2021)\nWe are making progress all be it slowly, I am not sure any of us knew the extent of the backlog and issues we would face when we applied for the drainage team and it does certainly have it’s challenges but we are starting to seeing a difference.\nWe now have two of our three new vehicles, one old one and one on hire. We are working through the back log of add hoc reports as well as making inroads into the scheduled routes.\nThe works supervisor advises the ward 8 reports have all been done with the exception of any that had parked cars and the ones I have just raised that he hasn’t seen yet, the scheduled routes in ward 8 are being done and once we have a list of any gullies that could not be accessed a Traffic Order will be raised to ban the parking to allow any left to be cleaned. We have even cleaned the gullies and poly channels on the Colinton Bridge.\nThis progress is being echoed across the city where we are starting to see less reports coming in which is letting us keep the lorries on routes. We can see up to 50 gullies cleaned a day per vehicle on a route as appose to as few as 10 if the lorry is on add hoc reports as these can be scattered over several areas.\nThe repair team have also been very busy and we are working through some very long standing issues that have been repeatedly causing flooding issues for some time. One such job we have just completed near Ratho, Scottish Water had sent a mole up a footway to pull a new main through, this ran up a gully line for about 50m. This had been left to flood each time it rained for a number of years. We now have a new line in and no flooding and Scottish Water will be recharged for this.\nI am not under any illusions we are there yet or that things will ever get quiet but it is moving in the right direction.",

If the Council are serious about mitigating the impact of #climatechange, they have to manage their assets way better than this.\nSince reporting these again (1st of July), I received the response below from the Council on the 4th of July:\nI have now investigated the matter and have arranged for the gullies between Fairmilehead Crossroads and Colinton Mains Tesco to be prioritised for attendance. Some were attended last night with the remaining to be carried out shortly. Gullies not accessible due to parked cars will require a temporary parking restriction order to be promoted.\nI would reassure you that the reporting system is monitored and faults/defects/gullies will be attended to. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to address issues quickly due to resources but they will not be ignored. I would still encourage your constituents to continue reporting blocked gullies or any gully related issues via section of the Council’s web-site, at the following link.\nThere are over 55,000 gulleys adopted and maintained by the Council and there is a rolling programme of inspection and maintenance. We do prioritise sensitive locations that we become aware of, through inspections and reports from members of the public.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_09_09_briefing-edinburghs-cycle-hire-scheme/content_575.html": "Below is a brief from Council Officers on Edinburgh’s cycle hire scheme.\nInformation Briefing\nWe are reaching out to you to ensure that you have the relevant information to hand, should your constituents have any questions and to inform you of the process we have been through to get to where we are today.\nScheme Context:\nThe Concession Agreement between TfE and Serco was signed on 10 May 2018, after which Serco commenced the activities it had set out in its bid to implement. The Scheme’s aim is to launch with a meaningful and coherent network of locations and a fleet of quality UK manufactured bikes with an innovative hybrid technology platform in September 2018.\nYou may have noticed that ‘Your Bike’ is presented on the current test bikes in the City. ‘Your Bike’ is Serco’s new consumer facing cycle hire brand, and underpins our aspirations to make cycling accessible to all.\nAs you will have seen we have now announced that Just Eat are sponsoring the Edinburgh Cycle Hire Scheme for the next 3 years. This scheme from launch will be known as Just Eat Cycles, with associated branding replacing the current ‘Your Bike’ branding on the bikes.\nAs part of the scheme development process, Serco’s team engaged with City Planners to determine the exact approach needed to install cycling infrastructure onto the city streets.\nCritical criteria included ensuring locations are attractive to the 4 key markets TfE identified:\n- People who live in Edinburgh.\n- People who work in Edinburgh.\n- People who study in Edinburgh.\n- People who visit Edinburgh.\nSerco proposed a network comprising between 40 and 80 locations around the City that would ultimately support a scheme of 1000 bikes by the end of 2018. To support 1000 bikes, industry best practice suggests a ratio of circa 1:1.6 capacity is required (c.1600 hire scheme spaces) to enable bikes to move freely around the network and provide an excellent customer experience. This is quite a challenge in a compact and historic city like Edinburgh. This volume of Cycle Hire Point spaces will be delivered through a mixture of physical and virtual Cycle Hire Points. The initial roll out for the official launch on Monday 17 September will predominantly consist of physical Cycle Hire Points.\nAs part of the Concession Agreement Serco will also be providing 100 e-bikes during 2019. The physical Cycle Hire Points will also be able to accommodate these bikes, ensuring compatibility for all bikes across the whole scheme.\nPlanning Approach\nSerco took advice and guidance from TfE, CEC City Spacial Planning Team, CEC Active Travel Team, CEC Roads Department, CEC Locality Managers, Edinburgh World Heritage and other Stakeholders, either directly or through feedback to TfE, to establish the appropriate route to progressing formal approvals for putting infrastructure on the streets.\nThis is the first time Edinburgh has procured and delivered this service, so there was no established route to permissions for cycle hire infrastructure. There are two types of Cycle Hire Points: physical and virtual. Physical Cycle Hire Points are created using a modular approach with no invasive construction requirements. Virtual Cycle Hire Points will be clearly marked on the ground and will be ‘geo-fenced’ to ensure that bikes cannot be ‘off-hired’ outside of the defined Cycle Hire Points. This solution is designed to allow the Scheme to react to demand requirements over the long term. Serco has been very impressed, however, at the good will and positive attitude of CEC Officials and Leaders to support the identification of a path to approvals that reflects both the spirit of existing rules to protect the City from poor development, and to enable this exciting new citywide transport solution.\nA review of relevant legislation and City byelaws by CEC’s legal team led to agreement to the following planning approach:\n- Locations to be delivered on publicly owned land and not in a conservation area fall within Permitted Development guidelines.\n- Location to be delivered on publicly owned land in a conservation area fall within Permitted Development guidelines.\n- Locations to be delivered on private land, not in a conservation area fall within Permitted Development guidelines subject to Private Landowner consent.\n- Locations to be delivered on private land in a conservation area will require a Planning Application.\nSerco agreed with the CEC Planning Officers that the Permitted Development approach could be formally verified through an application for a Certificate of Lawfulness for one site (Lauriston Place). This can then be used as an exemplar approach that is referenced in other Permitted Development notifications.\nFor locations that require full Planning Approval, this has been applied for in the standard way. For locations where private landowner approval is needed, we have engaged with each one directly to agree a location and installation approach.\nSerco, together with TfE has collaborated to engage with many Stakeholder groups in relation to the development of the cycle hire network. These have included the Access Panel, RNIB, Edinburgh Bike Station, the Universities, Spokes, Edinburgh Leisure, Marketing Edinburgh, large employers, Network Rail, Scotrail, Scottish Government, private developers, Edinburgh Trams and others. We recognise the value of comprehensive community and Stakeholder engagement and it will be an ongoing and integral part of the scheme delivery going forward. To date, Stakeholders have provided valuable insight into where and how the scheme can develop across the city, from our initial network at launch to a ‘long list’ of options running to well over 100 potential future sites.\nFocused effort and a supportive environment has enabled Serco to be in a position to reach the launch date on time and with a starting network that will include over 250 spaces at 19 Cycle Hire Points across the city, with others quickly following on to build capacity and reach as the number of bikes also increases between September and December.",

Of course, all three policies are a reminder of an era when Scotland had governments that “got on with the day job”, and did not focus on grievance and division.\nPeople visiting our Capital, however, should not blame the City of Edinburgh Council for the situation whereby older people from outside Edinburgh can’t use the Capital’s trams for free. This situation is entirely the making of the Scottish Government. Despite repeated requests from City Chiefs, the SNP Government refuse to extend concessionary travel to Edinburgh’s trams. The only reason Edinburgh’s older residents can use the tram for free is due to the actions of Labour’s Lesley Hinds (with some encouragement from an Evening News campaign!).\nPeople approaching 60 should not assume, however, that they will be travelling anywhere on trams or for free. The Nationalist Government is currently consulting on substantially cutting the eligibility for concessionary travel. They plan to base the cut to the provision on age, not income. One option is to “raise the age of eligibility for both men and women in one step from 60 to the State Pension age”. I would urge those who have concerns about this to respond to the consultation (closes on the 17th of November).\nOne interested party may be City of Edinburgh Council as the SNP cut would save them the money it would otherwise pay to Edinburgh Trams to support free use. Edinburgh Trams may however, lose income if there is a resultant reduction in usage. Indeed, the Outline Business Case for completing the tramline to Newhaven states quite clearly that with respect to concessionary travel: “the model assumes that these arrangements will continue”. I have written to Council Officers to ask for clarity on this point.",

The School Estate Planning Team will begin an engagement process with\nthese schools and if statutory consultations are required, draft papers will be\npresented to a future Committee for consideration. “\nOf key interest to me here is inclusion of Firrhill High School as it serves a large part of my ward.\nFirrhill has a notional capacity of 1150, but currently has 1180 pupils enrolled and will rise to 1222 next year. Potentially a review of Firrhill’s catchment could conclude transferring one of the feeder primaries to another high school catchment would solve the problem.\nThe options for a transfer, however, are limited and we know from last year that school communities don’t always embrace attempts to tinker with catchments.\nThe elephant in the room with the Firrhill roll is Redford Barracks. This facility is scheduled to close in 2022 and it is likely at least some of the site will be redeveloped as housing over the following decade (on average every 100 houses generates 23 secondary school pupils). It’s therefore right to look seriously at Firrhill’s capacity.\nData published by the Council suggests that WHEC, Forrester & Tynecastle all have spare capacity to take part of Firrhill’s catchment. Forrester must be excluded, however, as future development in its catchment will consume much of its spare capacity. Nonetheless, by 2028 WHEC and Tynecastle combined will have spare capacity of 535. Indeed, Tynecastle or WHEC alone could easily accommodate Longstone pupils to help Firrhill return to its notional limit until the Redford development comes online.\nRunning in parallel to this Boroughmuir – a new school that was full the day it opened which now has an extension planned which will also be full the day it opens. Again, Tynecastle could take the pressure off Boroughmuir after its extension opens.\nUsing Tynecastle or WHEC in this way may not be popular, but it will save the Council money and help it meet its climate change targets (construction consumes a lot of energy). However, that may be balanced by increased travel costs and road safety issues.\nThe big uncertainty remains Redford Barracks – this may prove to be the catalyst for real change. There are only two real options to deal with this as far as I can see:\n- The creation of a new school to accommodate Buckstone, Pentland & Oxgangs Primaries. This would leave the existing Firrhill building to accommodate Colinton PS, Bonaly PS, Longstone PS & Redford Barracks. This would solve the problem at both Firrhill & Boroughmuir.\n- Converting Firrhill to a “super school” to accommodate Redford Barracks in addition to the existing catchment (and perhaps even Buckstone PS).\nAgain, these options would not be universally popular and both would need significant space (and funding). If only a building was nearby with a listed parade ground which could be converted to a fantastic school…\nConclusion\nI don’t have one. Whatever happens next, it is important that school communities are consulted and we have to respect the fact that school catchments have evolved over time to become an important part of what defines our neighbourhoods.",

A sign noting the hours of operation may help.\n- Entering the cycle lane heading north after Pentland View is not easy due to the narrow/angled entry.\n- There are no “wands” in place on the approach to Greenbank junction.\n- . The wands make it far harder to merge with traffic when turning right.\nThe Council say it is committed to listening to suggestions from residents, drivers, cyclists, pedestrians and businesses on how the scheme can be improved.

Reading about the pressure staff are under there today (report, 25-04-17) both angers me and breaks my heart.\nEven in 2015, however, it was very clear that the staff and systems in NHS Lothian were stressed. The nurse who took me to theatre did so in her lunch break. I saw a doctor offer to take casework off an overloaded ECG specialist. These acts of good will typified my experience. Every member of NHS staff I met during my 24 hours in the ERI was absolutely dedicated to their job and willing to go the extra mile to help patients and colleagues, but it was clear that they were stretched. Without their goodwill, our NHS would be on its knees.\nAt the core of the problem that NHS Lothian faces under the SNP is “delayed discharge”. Indeed, an Astley Ainslie ward in the process of being closed permanently, was forced to take fresh admissions last week.\nTo be fair to the SNP’s Health Secretary, Shona Robison, she said cutting the number of people stuck in hospital waiting for a care package to be arranged is an “absolute key priority” for the Scottish government and committed to eradicating it… by the end of 2015.\nIt’s time the SNP took this seriously. Both the NHS and Scotland’s councils need the adequate resources to genuinely end delayed discharge and enable patients to be treated with the dignity they deserve. Without this, I fear we will test the patience of those working so hard in our NHS.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_01_12_briefing-three-problems-on-the-water-of-leith-walkway/content_456.html": "May 2020 Update\nThe blog below is from January, I have now had this update from teh Council:\nUnfortunately our funding application to the FCC Communities Foundation has been unsuccessful. Obviously there is little we can progress at present however, later in the year (after the Covid-19 crisis) we will be investigating options and seeking funds elsewhere. If anything, it is more likely that we will be able to obtain funding for the Pipeline Bridge in the first instance. Due to the limited access and costs we may have to think differently for the bridge over the river at Redhall Weir. Options which have been discussed include:\n- Removing the bridge and replacing it with a downgraded structure i.e. a much narrower pedestrian only footbridge.\n- Removing the bridge deck and replacing from one side part way across to create a view point in the middle of the river – initial thoughts are that this would not cost effective and we may be able to get a replacement bridge for around the same cost.\n- Removing the bridge deck but not replacing it – obviously this is not a desirable option however, it depends on funding available.\n- Leaving the bridge as a closed asset. This would be far from ideal as the structure would remain an eyesore and a burden to continually check the barriers/signage, again not a desirable option.\n- Prior to the installation of this bridge (which I am led to believe was the 1970’s) there were large boulders which people used as stepping stones. This was mentioned to me by the Water of Leith Conservation Trust, after discussion it is thought this would not be safely achievable.\n- I have also briefly discussed the potential for crowd funding with the Water of Leith Conservation Trust. We are looking at a substantial amount of money to replace the bridge and I don’t know if this would be seen as achievable via crowd funding.\nPlease note no decisions have been made nor will they be made without further investigation and discussion later in the year.\nJanuary 2020 Blog\nOn the 31st of December 2019 the Evening News carried an article about the long-term closure of the Water of Leith path between Sunbury Bridge and the steps at Dean Path. In the article Ian Johnston made the point that:\n“…the Water of Leith is a particularly wonderful part of Edinburgh – something I appreciated more on my return to the city – and it would be a terrible shame if the path continues to remain in its current truncated state for much longer.”\nI have spoken to Council’s Natural Heritage Officer about this and was given this response:\n- The Council (“CEC”) has raised legal proceedings against a number of parties in respect of the landslip at the Dean Path.\n- Before steps can be taken to reopen the path, the causes of the slippage require to be identified and measures to prevent further slippage implemented.\n- Public safety and future amenity of the area remain paramount.\n- CEC have authorised the use of funds to jointly meet the cost of specialist engineers to design and provide costings for the retaining works.\n- Technical experts appointed by CEC and other parties respectively have now identified potential engineering solutions.\n- Legal proceedings remain paused while parties explore resolution.\n- Discussions are on-going with a view to agreeing these between CEC and the neighbouring owner(s).\nSo it looks like there is no immediate solution to the problem.\nI also raised the complaints I have received about two closed bridges in Colinton Dell. Both are outside my Ward but lots of my constituents use them – below is the response I received from the Council:\n“With regard to the two bridge closures in the Dells, referred to in points one and two of your email, we do not have a timescale for the reopening of these. However, I can confirm a grant application has been submitted to FCC Communities Foundation, included in the application is improvements to the path/steps/drainage on the access path to/from Dell Road (by Colinton Kirk), the installation of a new Pipeline Bridge, the removal and installation of a new bridge over the river parallel to Redhall Weir. The application should be considered by the Board of Directors on 04 March 2020 who will decide whether the project should be funded. A capital bid has also been applied for internally and we should receive an answer regarding any potential funding by the end of February 2020.”\nSo it looks like there is no immediate solution to these issues either.",

ERS are currently carrying five vacancies for Approved Electricians and are experiencing difficulties in recruiting suitable staff.\nPerformance\nMost recent Figures (for September ’17) highlight the following performance:\n| Performance Indicator | Target | Performance |\n| % of Street Lighting Emergency Repairs made safe within 4 hours | 95% | 96.1% |\n| % of Street Lighting Priority Repairs completed within 24 hours | 75% | 74.1% |\n| % of Street Lighting 5-day Repairs completed in time | 70% | 55.9% |\n| % of Street Lighting 28-day Repairs completed in time | 95% | 97.8% |\nOwing to the low level of performance (especially in response to Street Lighting 5-day Repairs), the Edinburgh Road Services Manager has issued the following statement:\nDue to the volume of Street Lighting repairs, it is currently taking an average of 20 working days to attend Street Lighting reports.\nWe are improving this, but in the meantime apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.\nRecruitment\nExternal recruitment is being repeated, Employment Agencies have been engaged to source suitable staff, an existing Professional Services Framework is being used to source labour and the temporary contracting of a street lighting repair service is being explored.\nScottish Power Faults\nWith around 40% of the Council’s street lighting assets connected directly to a Scottish Power supply, power supply problems are outside the control of the Council.\nAs such, Scottish Power Networks’ target response times are:\n| Service | Performance Level |\n| Emergency Fault Repair Response | Attend site within 2 hours |\n| High Priority Fault Repair – Traffic Light Controlled | Within 2 calendar days |\n| High Priority Fault Repair – non-Traffic Light Controlled | Within 10 working days |\n| Multiple Unit Fault Repair | Within 20 working days |\n| Single Unit Fault Repairs | Within 25 working days |\nEnergy Efficient Street Lighting Programme\nThe Council is currently procuring a Contract for the conversion of its existing street lights to energy efficient lanterns. It is anticipated that the 35-month Contract will be awarded in January 2018, with the Contract being completed by 31 December 2020.\nThe Contract includes the introduction of a Central Management System, which will allow the street lights to be remotely monitored and improve responsiveness to lantern failures.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_07_18_briefing-21-22-edinburgh-garden-waste-registration/content_172.html": "Below is a briefing from the Council on the “Garden Tax”. The key change is a 40% price hike, but the exemptions I argued for have been retained. There will also be more flexibility for some people on how registration works. Promoting the scheme as outlined in Section 5 will cost £70,000.\nEdinburgh Garden Waste Collection Briefing 2021/22\n1.0 Introduction\nThe paid garden waste collection service is approaching its fourth year, with the main registration window opening on 22 July. This briefing note provides background on the service, the registration window, how we are communicating with customers and the key dates around this.\n2.0 Key Dates\n| Date | Event |\n| 2021/22 Main registration opens | 22 July at 10am (runs for 6 weeks) |\n| 2021/22 Main registration closes | 1 September at 2pm |\n| Letter, with permit and calendar, land | Between 25 October and 3 November |\n| Current 2020/21 collection year ends | 7 November |\n| New 2021/22 collection year starts | 8 November |\n| Missing letters (permits) to be reported | As soon as possible after 3 November and before 3 December |\n| Mid-year window opens | 1 December at 10am |\n| Service suspended | From 20 December until 16 January |\n| Mid-year registrations processed | Monthly (see section 4 below for more details) |\n| Mid-year registration closes | At least 31 May 2022 (longer is being investigated, see section 4 below for more details) |\n| 2021/22 collection year ends | 6 November 2022 |\n3.0 The Service\nAny residential household within Edinburgh can register for the garden waste service during the registration windows.\nCustomers who sign up receive a fortnightly collection. The service runs from 8 November 2021 until 6 November 2022, with no collections between 20 December and 16 January. The festive break in service allows us to divert resources to other recycling and waste streams during the busy festive period.\nThe cost of the service is £35 per bin. This is a price increase from the previous £25. This is the first price increase since the charge was introduced in 2018 and is required to ensure the Council can cover its costs for delivering this collection service. The price increase was approved at Council in February 2021.\nA customer can sign up during the mid-year registration window however the cost will remain at £35 and the permit will run until the end of this service year, which is 6 November 2022.\n3.1 Exemptions\nExemptions from paying were established at the introduction of the charge and these continue. A customer can request an exemption if they receive Council Tax Reduction (formerly called Council Tax Benefit) or are classed, or live with someone who has been classed as, severely mentally impaired. Other council tax discounts, such as single occupancy or disabled person discount, don’t qualify for this reduction. Households that pay for garden aid are not exempt from paying for the service.\nIf a customer is eligible for an exemption they must still register during the sign up windows in order to receive the service. Exemption eligibility is checked before the subscription is progressed, if this check highlights that the customer doesn’t qualify the registration is cancelled and the customer is contacted advising them of this and how to pay if they still want to receive the service. Where this happens close to the registration closing, the customer is given a short extension to call and pay over the phone.\n3.2 Permits\nOnce the registration window closes, and the required eligibility and data quality checks are complete, the registrations are processed onto the waste collection systems and new routes are created.\nDuring the two weeks ahead of the service commencing the customer will receive a letter, with an attached permit sticker (and additional permit stickers if more than one bin has been registered for the property), and the collection calendar for the garden waste service address. The customer’s name will also be added to the letter where it is feasible to do so.\nFrom this year, customers will now have the opportunity to select whether they want this letter to be sent to their home address or their garden waste service address if they are registering for a different property. This has been a highly requested option from customers, in particular those supporting individuals with care needs and landlords registering their properties.\nCustomers are advised that if they do not receive the permit by a specific date, they should report this as soon as possible, and no later than 28 days after this date. For those registering in the main window, this would be if it has not arrived by 3 November and should be reported no later than 3 December.\nCustomers are advised to attach the permit to a clean and clear part of the bin below the handles; this allows the collection crews a quick way of confirming registered bins as the colour of the permit changes each year. If the bin does not have the permit attached it will not be emptied.\nThe permit is a tamper-proof permit meaning that, if a permit was to be ripped off the bin, it would leave behind evidence the customer had paid for that year’s collections and the part taken off becomes void.\n3.3 Tiphereth Customers\nTiphereth undertake garden waste collections in the Colinton area of Edinburgh through a long-running agreement. Customers on the streets serviced by Tiphereth would still register for the service via the Council however they would receive a weekly bag collection carried out by Tiphereth.\n3.4 Internal site and other organisations\nWe don’t offer a commercial garden waste service however internal Council sites, and a limited number of other organisations (namely bowling clubs, lawn tennis courts, and croquet clubs), can register for the garden waste service.\nThe charge remains the same as residential customers, and the registration process and timescales also remain the same.\nThe key difference for these sites is that a Waste Transfer Note (WTN) covering the collection year must also be signed before the permit is sent out and the details of this are outlined at the point of registering. The WTN is a legal requirement to ensure the Council and the business is compliant with their duty of care. Where it has not been possible to get a signed WTN back within the deadline the subscription is cancelled and the business is refunded, it is possible for them to sign up again in the next registration window.\n4.0 How to Register\nThe quickest and easiest way to register and pay is on our website at www.edinburgh.gov.uk/gardenwaste\nSigning in to a MyGov account is now optional in order to make the process easier, however registering without signing in will mean the customer will not see the history of their garden waste subscription on their account.\nResidents can ask a family member, friend or neighbour to register and pay on their behalf online if they’re unable to do it themselves.\nCustomers eligible for an exemption can register using the online form, or by using the phone number below if they don’t have access to the internet or someone who can register on their behalf.\nAnyone without access to the internet can call us on 0131 357 2800. Phone lines are open Monday to Thursday between 10am – 4pm and Friday 10am – 3.40pm.\nIt’s not possible for a resident to register in person at one of our locality offices. They will need to register online or by telephone instead.\nA one-off payment of £35 (per brown bin) will be taken by debit or credit card. There is no limit to how many garden waste bins a property can have but there will be a charge of £35 per bin.\nAligning to corporate policy, we don’t accept cheques or cash payments.\nResidents can share a bin with their neighbours, but they’ll need to agree on one resident acting as the lead for booking and paying for the service against their property. If there are any service issues with the shared bin (e.g. a missed collection), then this must be reported against the property with the permit.\nResidents are encouraged to sign up early once the registration window is opened.\nRegistrations cannot be made outside of the sign-up windows.\n4.1 Main Registration Window\nTo receive the service for the full collection year, (and have a continuous service if they are already a customer) residents must register during the main registration window using the method outlined above. This window runs from 10am on 22 July until 2pm on 1 September.\n4.2 Mid-Year Registration Window\nIf a customer moves into the area after the main windows closes (or they changed their mind or missed the summer window), we operate a mid-year registration window. Previously this was two weeks held around January/February, however as of this year this window will be greatly expanded opening from 1 December 2021.\nThe approach to the mid-year window was approved at Transport and Environment Committee in June 2021, with an amendment to continue the mid-year window beyond 31 May 2022 (the originally proposed close date for the mid-year window) with details of this to be reported to Transport and Environment Committee in March 2022.\nSimilar to previous years, a further Members Briefing will be circulated ahead of the mid-year window opening with specific details on this registration process.\n5.0 Communication\nA comprehensive communications campaign is being implemented to raise awareness of garden waste registration and to encourage sign up during the main registration window (between 22 July and 1 September).\nThe communications approach is using multiple channels to raise awareness to as many residents as possible and encourage sign up. The following communication channels are being used:\n- Lamppost wraps – targeted at areas people visit regularly such as supermarket\n- Radio/Spotify adverts o Social media posts (including sponsored adverts)\n- Press (press releases and reactive press statements as required)\n- Council website\n- Adverts in supermarkets\n- Billboards on key arterial routes\n- Mailing to existing customers and those that have registered an interest for this registration window, to advise of the registration window.\n- Customers who we have an email address for, will be sent emails from 22 July and those without email addresses will receive a letter. Both the email and letter will explain to customers what they need to do and about the rate change.\n6.0 Summary of Key Points\nThe main registration window opens at 10am on 22 July closing at 2pm on 1 September. Registrations after this time will not be processed.\nThe rate will now be £35 per bin, as approved by Council, to ensure full cost recovery of the collection and subscription management service.\nThe registration window will be supported by a multi-channel, comprehensive, communication campaign.\nResidents are encouraged to register online (or have a family member, friend or neighbour register on their behalf). The other option to register is via phone.\nResidents cannot register in person at one of our locality offices, and cheque/cash payment will not be accepted.\nThe mid-year registration will open from 1 December; however, the charge will remain at £35 and the service year ends 6 November 2022.\nDetails of the full terms and conditions can be found here: www.edinburgh.gov.uk/gardenwaste.",

At the foot of the blog are the notes from the Community Council workshop and the slides which informed the discussion. It looks like an interesting meeting, with two stand-out quotes:\n- The Council appears to be considering allowing parking in the cycle lanes: “it is proposed to remove the Loading restrictions along most of the length of the scheme, and provide gaps in the cycle lane defenders where possible, to provide additional loading opportunities.”\n- There is an acceptance that the road network is now less resilient when road traffic incidents occur: “Accidents can happen anywhere but they are occasional events and should not be the primary concern when planning a road network.”\nThe next step is for a survey of local people to take place. I have asked for an opportunity to comment on the questions and the area included in the survey.\nCouncil Update – Braid/Comiston Road Spaces for People Scheme Review\nAs you will be aware we recently completed a consultation exercise on the potential retention of Spaces for People measures. This was followed by the publication of the report on keeping these measures, which was considered at the meeting of the city’s Transport and Environment Committee on 17 June. The decision to retain or remove measures was based on consultation results, independent market research, a review by technical officers and consideration of how well such changes fit with the Council’s long-term transport policy objectives.\nAt this meeting it was agreed that a final decision on moving forward with the schemes should be made at the 24 June meeting of the City of Edinburgh Council.\nCouncil motion on Braid Road\nThe Council voted to approve the report, with requests from Councillors to review the Comiston Road Scheme and consider options for reopening Braid Road in both directions. Officers have been asked to engage with local residents and local Community Councils to consider:\n- options for Comiston Road, to improve public transport connectivity and reduce impacts on local residents\n- options for the reopening of the Braid Road in both directions, including analysis of impacts on traffic levels, resident connectivity and vulnerable road users walking, wheeling and cycling\nTo help us make more informed decisions, we are also currently monitoring traffic through the area, using cross-modal counters. You can read the full motion here.\nWe have commenced with the required engagement with Community Councils and Local Residents – this engagement will continue over the coming weeks through the following means.\nMeeting with Community Councils\nCouncil officers developed initial proposals which were discussed with representatives from the relevant Community Councils at a workshop on 25 August. Notes from this meeting, along with the slides which were presented, are attached.\nResidents’ Survey\nThe outcomes of this meeting in terms of proposals will be detailed in a survey on the Council’s website. Information regarding this survey will be circulated to residents on affected streets via letter drop. This will allow us to gather a good sample of opinion in the local area in relation to the changes proposed.\nThe results of survey will help us to mitigate the concerns which have been voiced regarding this scheme and will sit alongside the results from the previous consultation when elected members decide on whether this scheme should be retained in the longer term.",

He’s quick to play “Project Fear” and blame the job losses on Brexit in a clumsy attempt to drive us off is independence cliff-top. If he’d actually read what Heriot-Watt said he’d find that whilst Brexit is a factor, cuts he voted for in Holyrood are perhaps a bigger issue.\nHeriot-Watt, which is actually in his constituency, said: “We have seen year-on-year real-term reductions in the finance we receive from the Scottish Funding Council in the price per funded place. Universities Scotland cite this as being a 13% reduction during the last five years.”\nIndeed, last year Mr MacDonald voted for a £30 million cut to university budgets – a brutal action which was described as “deeply worrying” by the University and College Union. Four of Scotland’s biggest universities faced the largest reductions, but there was a 3.3% cut for universities across the board – including Heriot-Watt.\nAlmost as soon as Mr MacDonald pressed his voting button in Holyrood, Robert Gordon University announced it would be looking to save £4 million by cutting around 100 jobs, and Aberdeen University soon followed.\nUniversities are being hammered by the double SNP whammy of cuts and strict limits on places. It’s not just the universities that are being cut however. Currently the SNP offers the very poorest students a bursary of just £1875 per year. In comparison, ten years ago Labour in Scotland offered the poorest students a bursary of £2,455 (£3,000 today).\nMr MacDonald needs to stop stoking fear and start arguing that Scotland’s universities and students get a fair deal from the Scottish Government.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_02_12_update-city-of-edinburgh-council-budget/content_713.html": "The Evening News headline claiming the Council Tax rise would be used to fund new schools in Edinburgh (Report, 10.02.20) is nothing more than a cynical piece of spin. The reality is that Council Tax is going up and school budgets are going down due to Scottish Government cuts.\nThe Scottish Government has forced £590m of new commitments on to Councils, but have given them only £495m to undertake the work. Edinburgh has a £35m black hole to fill.\nIt is heart-breaking that the poorest people in Edinburgh will feel the impact of this most. The Oxgangs area of my Ward alone will see:\n- Over ninety-thousand pounds slashed from school budgets;\n- A threat to nursery teacher posts;\n- Community policing cut,\n- Local library opening hours cut; and,\n- The unfair Council Tax will rise by almost 5%.\nThe cuts in schools kids in my Ward attend are roughly as follows:\n- Bonaly Primary – £17,000\n- Buckstone Primary – £18,000\n- Colinton Primary – £7,000\n- Juniper Green Primary – £13,000\n- Oxgangs Primary – £10,000\n- Pentland Primary – £14,000\n- St Mark’s Primary – £4,000\n- St Peter’s Primary – £15,000\n- Boroughmuir High School – £75,000\n- Currie High School – £45,000\n- Balerno High School – £45,000\n- Firrhill High School – £70,000\n- St. Thomas of Aquin’s High School – £45,000\nA cut to libraries is a cut to education and well-being, and will only increase social isolation. When I was elected in 2017 I pledged to voters in my ward that I would protect library opening hours, and I don’t see that changing.\nHow can the head-teacher at Firrhill High School in my Ward raise attainment when Scottish Government cuts will mean his budget is cut by £70,000?\nThe SNP Government must think again. Please write to your MSP and ask him/her to block this budget. For people in my Ward, that’s Gordon MacDonald MSP and he plans to back the cuts.\nThe draft Council budget overview is here.",

I hope the Firefighter makes a full and rapid recovery, but my thoughts are also with those that live and work in the area.\nCouncil Briefing\nAs you will probably be aware from local media, fire fighters have spent much of today tackling a large blaze on George IV Bridge.\nIt is believed to have begun in the Patisserie Valerie café early this morning and at least one of the floors in the building has collapsed as a result.\nRegrettably, one firefighter from the scene was hospitalised, although we have subsequently been updated that they are okay.\nCouncil officers continue to work closely with the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, along with Police Scotland and the Scottish Ambulance Service, to respond and to minimise any disruption.\nRoads officers have put a safety cordon around the affected areas and effected necessary road closures, which are likely to remain in force for the remainder of today and are likely to continue into tomorrow.\nThe closures are as follows:\n- George IV Bridge from junction with Royal Mile to junction with Chambers Street\n- Chambers Street to Guthrie Street\n- Victoria Street\n- Candlemaker Row\n- Merchant Street\nUnfortunately, the Central Library will remain closed for as long as the cordon is in place.\nThe Resilience and Communications teams are continuing to liaise with the relevant agencies and Shared Repairs officers are on site to offer structural engineering advice.\nThere has been no request to open a rest centre and we are advised that the residential lets affected by the cordon have now been reallocated to alternative properties via the lettings agent.\nGroup Leaders and City Centre Ward Councillors have been kept updated on the incident.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_10_25_the-scottish-government-must-act-to-deal-with-edinburghs-funding-crisis/content_142.html": "The scale of the budget cuts facing Scotland’s capital were made clear in an e-mail that welcomed all of the City of Edinburgh Council’s staff to work yesterday. It outlined how over the past five years we’ve faced cuts amounting to £240m and over the next five years we’ll have to deal with a further £140m.\nDespite the problems facing education, social care and waste collection, these budgets will be further squeezed. Readers should ask themselves how we can hope to improve these key services by cutting their budget?\nThe discussions surrounding the latest round of cuts have been protracted and difficult. Although I was openly critical of the decision my Labour colleagues made to enter a deal in Edinburgh with the SNP, I can say now that the cuts facing Edinburgh would have been worse without our progressive voices being around the table arguing for the many, not the few.\nWhilst as much as possible we argued to protect services used by the vulnerable and those who need a helping hand to have the best start in life, these cuts have sacrificed non-statutory services to protect what we are legally obliged to deliver. Notwithstanding this, everything from waste collection to education is being cut.\nThe good news is that if you can afford it, you can pay to have your garden waste collected or even hire a music tutor to ensure your talented youngster reaches their full potential. If you are on a low income, the story is a little different however.\nBe in no doubt, this is just the start. If continued, the Council will only provide basic statutory services and those who want something better will have to pay if they can afford to do so.\nOne piece of non-statutory provision, however, will not be consulted on. Because policing in the capital is not adequately funded, the City of Edinburgh Council contributes around £2.6m to pay the salaries of well over 50 police officers of various ranks. So not only is Edinburgh dealing with its own funding crisis, it is also making up for the underfunding of Police Scotland by the Scottish Government.\nThe SNP Council Leader Adam McVey said about the latest round of cuts this week that the “consultation will go live soon” and he wanted to “hear what you think”. Well I think these cuts to basic services are unacceptable and it is time this his party’s elite in Holyrood used its powers and gave Edinburgh the funding it deserves. It needs funding not only to reverse these cuts, but also bring social care back from the brink, close the attainment gap and actually get the bins collected on time.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_07_24_edinburgh-is-facing-a-primary-care-crisis-manufactured-by-the-snp-government/content_495.html": "Sometimes I wonder what Edinburgh has done to upset the SNP Government. In addition to insults like cutting the Capital’s budget more than elsewhere (£226 per person compared to a Scottish average of £148) and ignoring us on things like the Tourist tax, the latest insult will see ambulance staff replace GPs in some instances (report, 23/07/18).\nI don’t doubt the dedication and professionalism of Edinburgh’s paramedics, but their training is no match for that of a GP. Providing healthcare on the cheap like this in our capital will no doubt put lives at risk.\nIt’s not only training that is an issue, we know that the ambulance service in the Lothians is stretched to the limit. Last year alone, 2,000 people had to wait over an hour for an ambulance. Indeed, there were 15 call-outs in 2017 where paramedics took longer than five hours to respond. Furthermore, we know that average response times in Scotland have increased from just under eight minutes in 2013-14 to over 15 minutes in 2017-18.\nAnyone that doubts the pressure the Scottish Ambulance Service is under should remember that Jeane Freeman MSP, the new SNP Health Secretary, was recently urged to review ambulance provision across Scotland after it was revealed that the number of minibuses responding to 999 emergencies had trebled in four years.\nIt’s bonkers to think the GP recruitment crisis the SNP created can be resolved by loading even more pressure on our already stretched paramedics.\nThe only meaningful way to take pressure off GP’s in the short-term is to recruit more practice nurses to work in partnership with them under the same roof. The problem with that is that nurses have been in short supply since Nicola Sturgeon ignored the RCN and cut nurse training places – agencies are now getting up to £1,900 a shift for nursing staff.\nWe now have a perfect storm where the SNP’s strategic decisions on nurse training, GP recruitment and the funding of the Scottish Ambulance Service are putting lives at risk in our Capital.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_09_13_why-are-we-demeaning-and-undervaluing-the-teaching-profession/content_246.html": "It is really concerning to read that a head teacher in Scotland’s capital city has been forced to write to parents begging for their help to teach Maths and, failing that, ask if they know “anyone who might be able to do so”. Surely this is the equivalent of calling on a friend for help on the “Who Wants to be a Millionaire” TV show?\nBut let’s be clear, however, Edinburgh does not face this problem alone. The head teacher in Nationalist Education Secretary John Swinney’s own constituency did the same in March.\nNo wonder people are turning away from teaching in Scotland. The OECD found that Scottish teachers have one of the highest teaching workloads in the developed world, and their salaries are far below that of England. Under the Nationalists, teachers are £6,000 worse off, with pay being squeezed as workloads continue to increase. Indeed, I know two excellent teachers that recently left the profession.\nMr Swinney’s response to this teacher shortage crisis is to adopt the Tory model whereby graduates can teach kids after just 6 weeks of training. Not only is that high risk, it completely undermines the teaching profession.\nI wouldn’t cross a bridge designed by an engineer with only 6 weeks of training. Likewise, I expect GPs, Dentists, Police Officers, Car Mechanics and Vets all to be rigorously trained before being trusted to undertake their duties. Why demean and undervalue the teaching profession by suggesting they should be different?\nLast month Nicola Sturgeon said “I want Scotland to be the inventor and producer of the innovations that shape the future – not just a consumer of them.” That won’t be done without attracting the best Scots into the teaching profession, and to do that we must value the role they play in inspiring our children and grandchildren.\nWe must start by tackling the teacher shortage by improving pay. We should also fund bursaries for graduates to train to teach key subjects – starting with Maths. Only by addressing the workforce crisis and investing in education can we make Scottish schools the best in the world.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_11_22_eis-school-briefing-the-pressures-are-not-just-unrelenting-but-building/content_232.html": "Below is an email from the EIS Local Association Secretary, Alison Murphy. It details some of the pressures school staff are feeling right now after an impossible year or two.\nEIS Email\nOver the last few weeks, I have become increasingly concerned about what I am hearing from EIS members, and others working to support education in Edinburgh. The pressures are not just unrelenting, but building – and the more worrying thing is that, whilst some are due to the ongoing realities of dealing with the pandemic, too many others could be avoided. I would hope that you also have been talking to teachers, and particularly headteachers, in your ward, and that this is giving you an idea of the scale of the crisis, and a desire to work with schools to ensure the core work of education can be maintained. However, I am afraid to say that many school leaders tell me that they feel there is little insight from politicians, parents or the public about the day to day reality in schools, and that this is leading to totally unrealistic demands being placed on them, and to them feeling isolated and unsupported. The following are just some of the things with which schools are having to contend.\nI assume councillors are informed of the numbers of staff and pupils who are testing positive in schools? I hope you are giving thought to what that means.\n- Dozens of staff members becoming infected is leading to increased anxiety amongst colleagues who worry about the same happening to them.\n- More pressure on schools to provide absence cover. Demand far outstrips the availability of supply teachers. There are few schools where SLT are not providing in-class cover (thereby further reducing the time available to undertake their strategic leadership roles) and even where teachers are not having to go over their statutory maximum contact time, they are having to put in time to prepare work for classes other than their own.\n- In addition to staff who are absent because they are testing positive, huge numbers of staff are having to self-isolate whilst awaiting results of tests. Even if those tests end up being negative, the time out of school is having a huge impact.\n- On top of this, we have all the usual illnesses that develop over the winter months. Further, many staff who kept going during the initial stages of the pandemic are now succumbing to the stress, musculoskeletal and other problems that they fended off last year.\n- The large number of pupil absences (positive cases are in the 1000s) leads to yet more work – staff will often be trying to prepare work for pupils who are self-isolating and, even if those requirements are not excessive (which they often are – some parents seem to think it reasonable for teachers to provide a full suite of online learning for their child, even though that teacher is still having to teach all the rest of the children who are still in class), staff will be very conscious of the need to support those children when they return. This concern is further exacerbated when the pupils are ones sitting national qualifications this year (I will not, here, elucidate all the issues related to National Qualifications and SQA, but would be happy to have further discussions with any councillor who wants to be better informed about this).\nCEC has prioritised keeping schools open, and pupils in class. This is something that most would agree with – no one wants a return to blended learning, still less full-blown school closures. However, I wonder if you are fully aware of the reality of what this means?\n- I have already said that HTs and others are having to do increasing amounts of class cover. This is in addition to other things they are taking on to help with covid mitigations (many schools, in an effort to reduce infections, are maintaining staggered breaks and lunches etc – all of which require supervision, and it is often only SLT who are available to do this). Yet, despite all the extra hours they are having to put in to keep their school open, they are not seeing a comparable diminution in other demands being placed on them. School recovery plans, data requests, parental requests, HMIE planning, audit and quality improvement work – all these and more are continuing, and are resulting in SLT doing enormous, and utterly unsustainable, numbers of extra hours. I have never spoken to as many HTs who are considering early retirement, or resigning, or who are on the verge of signing off sick, as I have done this term. I ask you to seriously contemplate the impact on Edinburgh’s children if even a fraction of them do end up leaving.\n- Not only are school leadership teams spending more time in class, many of the central team (QIOs, SEOs etc) are going into schools to help alleviate the most acute pressures. Fairly obviously, this means that the amount of support they can give school leadership teams is reduced – yet those leadership teams are fielding huge demands around the attainment agenda, pupil wellbeing, results etc. Without sufficient access to support, how can they manage these demands?\n- As I hope you know, CEC decided that, in an effort to keep special schools open, Educational Psychologists (EPs) and members of the Additional Support for Learning Service (ASLS) would be deployed into those special schools on a rota basis. Again, I emphasise that we all understand the reasoning behind this decision – the pupils in our special schools are very vulnerable and we all want them to be properly supported. However, I again ask if you have properly understood the reality of what this decision means:\n- Pupils in some special schools are seeing different staff on a daily basis. Many of these children need stability and continuity, and they are not getting this.\n- The staff who are being asked to go into the schools have, in many cases, absolutely no expertise or training in this area. Many of the EPs have never been teachers and are not GTCS-registered. Thus, in most cases, the best that they can do is act as a support to the class team – they cannot lead learning, let alone give the specialist teaching support these pupils need. Not only are pupils getting less expert support than they need, the staff in the special schools are having to do extra work to try to support these colleagues.\n- In addition to thinking about the workload implications for the special school staff, perhaps it might be worth considering what it feels like to be a PSA, effectively being asked to lead an EP or ASLS teacher in how to carry out tasks that would normally be done by another PSA? Yet we all know that the PSAs are paid a fraction of the salary of their teaching and EP colleagues, and that, despite the unions raising this for years, little to nothing has been done to ensure more security of employment, career progression and appropriate salary structures for our PSAs.\n- Pupils who are not receiving appropriate support are far more likely to exhibit dysregulated behaviours. In many cases, this manifests as violent outbursts. With large numbers of staff in special schools who do not know the pupils, and are not trained in how to work with them, the risks of such behaviours escalating are greatly increased. I hope I do not need to spell out the possible consequences of this?\n- This “repurposing” is having a very big impact on the EPs and ASLS themselves. Many do not feel confident to undertake the work they are being asked to do. They worry about their ability to function in the special schools, the consequences should they not be able to properly support the pupils with whom they are working, and about their own health, safety and wellbeing. They also worry about the impact on the pupils they cannot support, and on the mainstream schools who are not receiving the usual level of input. And, naturally, they worry that they will be expected to pick up tasks and just, somehow, manage to deliver a normal service, despite spending time working in other settings.\n- The pupils and staff in the mainstream schools are also feeling the impact of this decision. By definition, EPs and ASLS teachers work with pupils who are vulnerable, yet the capacity of the services to support these children is being reduced – and it was already struggling to meet demand. Schools are endeavouring to make up for this lack, but they have neither the resources nor the expertise. Some pupils will, because of the lack of support to meet their individual needs, withdraw, or struggle on in silence. Others will lash out. Whatever the case, the pupils, their families, and the schools will be left trying to cope.\nSchools are receiving constant criticism over the impact of mitigations. Often, these criticisms seem to be coming from the same people who complained most vociferously about schools being closed – and who will be most vocal if current mitigations don’t work, and pupils do have to be sent home. Yet, to many in schools, it feels like those are the only voices being heard by the media and politicians. Please consider the following:\n- Face coverings – I haven’t spoken to anyone who wants to wear a mask. And for teachers, who rely so heavily on clear communication, they are even more draining. Yet, when schools are in the midst of a full-blown staffing crisis, and when there is much peer-reviewed evidence to show that face coverings can reduce transmission, surely it behoves us all to encourage compliance with this mitigation?\n- Trips and visits – again, none of us want to stop these. They can be one of the most enjoyable aspects of education, as well as being of huge benefit to pupils. I take on board the argument many make that parents can choose to take their own children to the theatre, museums etc, so that to deny schools the ability to do this disadvantages those pupils who do not have families that can do this – and, in normal times I would be making that same case. But we are not in normal times. Suppose a school sanctions a trip that involves 4 teachers (this would be a reasonable number for a fairly small trip) and, as is not improbable, all 4 of those teachers are named as contacts as a result of that trip and have to self-isolate. As things stand, if those 4 absences are added to the other absences most schools are enduring, the likely consequence will be classes being sent home. What would be the public reaction then? What criticisms would school and CEC management be facing?\n- A similar argument applies when considering the risks around having parents come into schools. If we are serious about saying that the most important thing is keeping schools open, then surely something that risks a large number of staff and pupils simultaneously being declared contacts has to be avoided?\n- The sudden change in arrangements around school staff being given flu jags (from in-school provision to staff having to make their own arrangements) whilst probably unavoidable (and certainly outwith CEC’s control) added to many staff feeling that the talk about prioritising education is entirely rhetorical. The fall off in pupil vaccination rates is adding to these concerns.\nThe above are just some of the issues with which schools are contending. I haven’t even touched on problems with ICT, nor the increasing levels of distressed and dysregulated behaviours being exhibited by pupils in mainstream classes, nor the work schools continue to do to support families in poverty, nor the way many parents do not seem to recognise that schools are under huge amounts of pressure, and are making utterly unreasonable demands of staff, nor the massive pressures on school budgets, nor…\nGiven all the above, I would ask several things of you.\n- Please be aware of these pressures. Where you can do so without adding further to their workload, reach out to school staff, and particularly school leaders, to find out what things are like on the ground, and to ask what you can do to help.\n- Bear all this in mind when talking to parents, the press etc. Of course parents want the best for their children, and of course you want education in Edinburgh to be the best – so do we, and so does everyone working in Edinburgh’s schools. Surely it is clear that unless the educational workforce feels valued and supported, then it cannot deliver the best outcomes? If what we feel is undermined, undervalued, overworked and overstretched, then the system will be less and less resilient and crises will be magnified. As councillors, you are leaders in the city, and also have a duty of care to employees – what you say and do matters. The tone of your statements make a huge difference – please use your voice to show your value for the work being done in schools and please be realistic when talking to parents about what schools can deliver under current circumstances.\n- The same realism is needed when you are undertaking your work of support and challenge around the work of schools, officers, council reports etc. We are very much in a recovery phase – indeed, many would say that calling it recovery is too early, and we are still in the midst of the pandemic, with some pressures being worse now than they were last year. Expecting schools to be able to deliver all the improvements that were highlighted as needed before covid hit is impossible. We need a phased approach that is responsive to current burdens. Further, we need to make efforts to dramatically reduce the burden on staff, and particularly, HTs, and CEC must do all in its power to make sure that its decisions\n- This will be particularly true when you are making decisions around budgets. Speak to HTs in your wards about the many costs they are having to bear – supply, ICT etc, and the funds they have to meet those costs, and use that information when thinking about further cuts to schools. Remember, too, the cuts that have been made to all the supports to schools, and the fact that they are having to compensate for the loss of those services.\n- Whilst much around teacher pay, terms and conditions are outwith CEC’s control, the same is not true for PSAs. Many teachers have said that having stability in PSA staffing; PSAs who have time to undertake appropriate training; and PSAs who are properly paid and valued, so that they stay in role, doing hugely valuable work supporting pupils, would make a massive difference. CEC has long spoken about addressing recruitment, pay and career structures for PSAs and other support staff (Business Managers and other administrative support staff are similarly overburdened). Seeing serious commitments around this, including the proper funding, would go a long way towards starting to relieve pressures in schools, and Edinburgh EIS would welcome this being made a priority.\n- I assume you are aware that Education Scotland has announced that school inspections are restarting? There are many reasons why many of us feel this is an appalling decision (I recommend you read this article, for a very thoughtful take on the situation by a HT https://www.tes.com/news/why-school-inspections-dont-make-sense-right-now). On Friday, in response to motions brought by the Edinburgh Local Association, the EIS has agreed to a national campaign in opposition to this decision. Given the staffing pressures in Edinburgh schools, we would welcome a strong commitment from CEC to back such a campaign, and to do all in its power to prevent inspection activity in Edinburgh schools. The idea that, at the same time as EPs, ASLS and others are rolling their sleeves up and going into schools to simply keep the doors open, someone else is going to stand in the back of a classroom with a clipboard is insanity. If Education Scotland has the capacity to scrutinise, surely it also has the capacity to send staff in to work directly with children and help in core pandemic mitigations? Again, I would be more than happy to talk to any councillor about the impact the announcement of the resumption of inspections has had on staff morale and wellbeing.\nMy apologies for such a lengthy email, but I hope you can appreciate why I felt it is necessary to email you all individually. The unions have been raising many of these concerns in JCG and other forums for some time now, but I wanted to be sure all councillors understand that it is not back to normal in schools and that, to the contrary, many schools and many staff are close to breaking. I would welcome the opportunity to talk further about all this to all councillors, either individually or on a party basis.\nIn the early stages of the pandemic there was much talk of valuing key workers, and of showing kindness. Right now your staff are not feeling valued, nor experiencing much kindness from others, and anything that can be done to shift that narrative would be welcomed.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_05_09_a-mandate-for-safer-travel-for-all-in-colinton-oxgangs-fairmilehead/content_335.html": "Introduction\nThe Scottish Government have given Councils £10m to improve travel safety during the Covid-19 crisis and in the recovery phase. In addition to this, the UK Government has launched £2bn fund which will also support safer travel. These investments are really to solve two problems:\n- Lots of people have embraced healthier lifestyles – more walking, jogging and cycling. However, footpaths are often too congested for people to keep a safe distance from others when walking and many cyclists are finding the roads unsafe.\n- As the lockdown lifts, it appears unlikely (in the short term at least) that people will go back to using the bus as they did before. The Council therefore wants to make the city safer to walk and cycle.\nThe City of Edinburgh has received some criticism for failing to consult on how this money is being spent. This blog is about how I have consulted people in my Ward on the way forward.\nAlthough the Council has done nothing in my ward yet to make walking and cycling safer, I have received many ideas from local residents for making travel easier for everyone. In short, these focus on making residential areas safer and improving safety for cyclists on key arterial routes through (and into) my Ward. Rather than take the proposals straight to the Council I wanted to give people a chance to rate the ideas and make further suggestions of their own. This is important as, hopefully, it will make the Council more likely to take the proposals seriously.\nThe Survey\nI complied a survey of all the ideas on Google Forms and issued it on my Blog and via my mailing list at around 8pm on Tuesday (5th of May). I did not share the blog post until 8pm on Wednesday (via Twitter – see below). I posted it on my Facebook page at around 8pm on Thursday.\nReleasing the survey on this phased way meant that if it was somehow hijacked on social media, I would know the first 24 hours would not be impacted. The responses were as follows: Day 1 – 179, Day 2 – 63 and Day 3 – 50.\nThe people responding to the survey were encouraged to give their postcode and 175 did so. When plotted, it can be seen that the vast majority of the respondents live in my Ward.\nRed = one response from the postcode zone, and blue = more than one. In addition to the responses shown, there were 3 from places outside the area mapped. The full map is here.\nLet me be clear, I think this is the most authoritative survey of the public in Edinburgh on how we improve safety on our footpaths and roads within the context of the Covid-19 crisis.\nResults\nThe survey focused on three key issues:\n- Safer streets for residents – blocking rat runs.\n- Extra protection for cyclists on key routes.\n- Reviews of parking in key areas\nSafer streets for residents – The focus of these proposals was making it safer for people in residential areas to move around by stopping drivers cutting through the area. People were asked if is this was a “Good Idea”, “Bad Idea” or if they were “Unsure”.\nThe results showed that there was overwhelming support for stopping vehicles using Oxgangs Road North as a local shortcut. When unsure responses were removed, there was also clear support for addressing the other local rat-runs.\nExtra protection for cyclists on key routes – The focus of these proposals was making it safer for people using bikes to commute to elsewhere in the city. Again people were asked if is this was a “Good Idea”, “Bad Idea” or if they were “Unsure”.\nThe results showed that there was overwhelming support for improving routes for people on bikes. Even with “Unsure” responses included, there was a clear desire for cycle lanes to be introduced on key routes.\nThis question also asked if there was support for immediately reducing the speed limit on all 40mph roads in my Ward to 30mph – the response was clear.\nAfter “Unsure” responses are removed, support for this proposal sits at 80%.\nReviews of parking in key areas – The focus of these proposals was dealing with parking problems – those generated by the crisis (e.g. people driving to beauty spots to take exercise), and planning for the recovery phase.\nThe results showed that there was overwhelming support for reviewing parking around all schools in my Ward to ensure social distancing can be maintained when they reopen, with 95% of people backing the measure.\nSupport for reviewing parking elsewhere, however, was dominated by uncertainty. Nonetheless, when “Unsure” responses were removed, there was a clear majority in favour of dealing with some of the problems these communities are facing.\nCrossing Points – I also took the opportunity to ask if there were any road crossing points where it may be difficult for pedestrians to maintain social distancing. The word-cloud diagram below shows the responses, but crossing points in Colinton Village were mentioned by 18 people, with one saying:\nColinton Village Pedestrians crossing outside Coop supermarket: path width either side is 1.5m, and southern footpath is not suitable for physical distancing. Worse, the guardrail steals up extra space, pushing pedestrians into live traffic.\nColinton resident\nMany others raised Fairmilehead crossroads:\nThe Fairmilehead crossroads (where the A702 meets the B701) is terrible for pedestrians. The metal barriers make distancing really difficult, and the lights are very unfriendly to pedestrians. It really needs an “all-cross” mode in the sequence. A lot of people cross on red,, but vehicles can travel fast around the bend.\nFairmilehead resident\nA number also raised Oxgangs Avenue:\nThe end of Oxgangs Ave leading onto Oxgangs Road North. The island for pedestrians is very close to where cars are trying to turn – often groups of school children trying to cross at the same time.\nOxgangs resident\nNarrow Footpaths – The last question asked people to identify areas where the footpath is simply too narrow. The word-cloud diagram shows the responses, but Braid Road (just outside my Ward!) was mentioned 20 times. The narrow footpath at the crest of Braid Road was a common concern:\nBrow of hill on braid road – pedestrians always having to walk in the road and can’t be seen by cars and pedestrians can’t see cars either. Lots of families walking that route to access braid hills entrance there.\nBuckstone resident\nBoth road and footpath narrow as Braid Road reaches its high point.\nOthers raised concerns about the Walkway beside the Braid Burn:\nThe path along the Braid Burn from Oxgangs Road North up to Colinton Mains Road, continuing up to Redford Road alongside the care home is narrow and fenced in by flood management defences so not currently a usable alternative to the road if trying to socially distance.\nColinton Mains resident\nWoodhall Road was mentioned by 11 people:\nWoodhall Road after Bonaly Road. Several times I have seen children having to go onto the road to allow people past who have chosen the ‘wall’ side, with traffic travelling well over the 20mph limit.\nColinton resident\nThe width of footpaths in Colinton Village was also a concern:\nAlmost all footpaths are not wide enough to maintain social distancing. Key trip generators and busy roads need to be prioritised. Significant areas that draw in people that are inadequately supported is Colinton Village centre ( this public realm and provision for access by non motorised users is already poor and does not cater well for those with protected charteristics and any area where services are positioned by carriageway.\nColinton resident\nConclusion\nWith almost 300 people completing the survey over a three day period, the the results offer the most credible understanding of the extent to which the community wants the Council to take action to improve everyone’s safety in my Ward. The survey gives the Council the mandate to develop a six point plan to:\n- Reduce rat-running in residential ares;\n- Improve cycle safety on key routes;\n- Review parking in key hotspots;\n- Cut 40mph speed limits to 30mph;\n- Bring forward measures to enable social distancing at key crossing points; and,\n- Review locations where the footpaths are not wide enough for pedestrians to safely pass each other.\nWhat Next?\nI shall be forwarding this blog to the Council and request a formal response. In the interim, if you have not done so already, please complete my survey.\nCllr Scott Arthur, 9th of May 2020",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_02_01_briefing-mid-year-garden-waste-collection-registration_comment-page-1/content_263.html": "Below is a briefing from the Council on the mid-year garden waste collection registration. This is essentially for people who missed the registration period last year. Registration opens tomorrow.\nBRIEFING NOTE: GARDEN WASTE REGISTRATION – MID YEAR 2021\nWhat’s happening?\n- The next registration window for the garden waste service opens on Tuesday 02 February at 10am and will close at 2pm on Tuesday 16 February.\n- Residents can sign up to receive fortnightly garden waste collections for £25 per brown bin.\n- Residents who sign up in February will be sent their permit(s) between 15-26 March and the service will run from 30 March until 07 November 2021 (date of first and last collection will vary depending on calendar for their address however they will be within this date range).\n- Residents will need to renew their permit again in the summer to continue receiving collections after 07 November.\n- Information on the start and end dates of the garden waste service and when residents will receive their permit sticker(s) with a garden waste calendar is available at www.edinburgh.gov.uk/gardenwaste. Residents should keep an eye on this page for updates.\n- Due to current safety measures in place because of Coronavirus, residents will only be able to register online or by telephone. It won’t be possible to register in person at any of our locality offices as they’re being used as community resilience centres during the pandemic. This is a change from previous registration windows and means cash or cheque payments will not be possible.\n- A communications campaign is also planned to raise awareness of permit extensions, renewals, any changes to the way people can register and to encourage sign up.\nHow to register\n- The quickest and easiest way to register and pay is on our website at www.edinburgh.gov.uk/gardenwaste. We’ve simplified the online sign up process by making it optional to register using the MyGov account. If a resident chooses not to use their MyGov account, the process will be quicker, but it means that they won’t be able to see the history of their garden waste permit on their MyGov account.\n- Anyone without access to the internet can call us on 0131 357 2800. We may have reduced staffing due to Coronavirus and phone lines may be busy. Telephone lines are open Monday – Thursday, 10am – 4pm and Friday 10am – 3.40pm.\n- Residents can ask a family member or friend to register and pay on their behalf online if they’re unable to do it themselves.\n- A one-off payment of £25 (per brown bin) will be taken by debit or credit card.\n- It’s not possible for a resident to register in person at one of our locality offices. If they usually register and pay this way, then they will need to register online or by telephone instead.\n- We don’t accept cheques or cash payments.\n- Once a resident has signed up and payment has been received, they’ll be sent a garden waste calendar along with a permit sticker(s) between 15-26 March to put on their brown bin(s). If they don’t receive these at their registered address by 29 March, they should email waste@edinburgh.gov.uk. If the resident has not received their permit within 28 days of the service start date they should email waste@edinburgh.gov.uk – for this registration window that would mean customers must report this by 26 April.\n- The service is available to a limited number of other organisations, such as lawn sport clubs. Bowling, tennis and croquet clubs must register for the service over the phone and not online and it is their responsibility to ensure that they have a waste transfer note in place.\nDoes everyone need to pay?\n- Signing up to receive the garden waste service is optional. If a resident chooses not to sign up, then they won’t receive garden waste collections.\n- Residents who receive Council Tax Reduction (formerly called Council Tax Benefit) or are classed, or live with someone who has been classed as, severely mentally impaired, do not need to pay for the service, but they do need to register to receive it. Other council tax discounts, such as single occupancy or disabled person discount, don’t qualify for this reduction. Households that pay for garden aid are not exempt from paying for the service.\n- A small number of residents in the Colinton area have their garden waste collected by Tiphereth (Colinton Compost) and they also need to register and pay to continue receiving the service. Tiphereth customers receive weekly collections of their bagged garden waste.\nHow does the service work?\n- We’ll empty brown bins once every two weeks until this service year ends on 07 November 2021\n- Permits are not prorated for residents who sign up in February 2021. It is the same service year end for residents signing up in February 2021 even if they didn’t sign up at the start of the service year in Summer 2020.\n- Residents need to renew their permits every year before they expire to continue receiving the service.\n- We’ll only empty brown bins with valid permit stickers.\n- Permits are sent to the house the registered garden waste address; permits cannot be sent to another property.\n- There is no limit to how many garden waste bins a property can have but there will be a charge of £25 per bin.\n- Residents can share a bin with their neighbours, but they’ll need to agree on one resident acting as the lead for booking and paying for the service against their property. If there are any service issues with the shared bin (e.g. a missed collection), then this must be reported against the property with the permit.\n- If a resident moves to a new house they can transfer their permit to their new address. They’ll need to give us six weeks’ notice to update our system and will need to take their brown bin and permit sticker to their new address.\n- Terms and conditions are available on our website www.edinburgh.gov.uk/gardenwasteterms\nBudget proposal to increase the charge\n- A budget proposal around garden waste has been put forward for consideration as part of the Council’s budget setting process.\n- This proposal is to ensure we achieve full cost recovery for the garden waste subscription and collection service (note this does not include the disposal costs due to legislation on what can be charges)\n- Should this proposal be agreed it will take effect in the summer registration, for the 2021/22 collection year. This will not affect registrations made in this mid-year window and the charge will continue at £25\n- The reasons for the increase are to ensure we are fully recovering our costs, and investment in administration support and system development to allow the mid-year sign up window to be greatly expanded addressing the high levels of complaints from residents and Councillors on the restriction of the current window timescales and the inability to join if these are missed\nKey Points\n- Service provision may need to be reviewed depending on the future impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic.\n- Residents cannot register in person at one of our locality offices. If they usually register and pay this way, then they’ll be required to register online or by telephone instead.\n- Cheques or cash payment will not be accepted.\n- The deadline for residents to register for garden waste is 2pm on Tuesday 16 February. Registrations after this time will not be processed.\n- Residents who register in this window will be joining the service mid-year and the permit will expire 7 November 2021, the cost isn’t pro-rated.\nFurther information\nIf a resident needs further information, or has a question to ask, direct them to waste@edinburgh.gov.uk who will assist or log their enquiry.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_06_12_checking-the-small-print-on-scotlands-proposed-pavement-parking-ban_comment-page-1/content_640.html": "I was delighted to read that the Scottish Government is at last considering giving Scotland’s councils the powers to deal with Pavement Parking and Double Parking (Report, 12/06/18).\nPavement Parking in particular is a real problem across our Capital. As well as causing problems to people with mobility issues and parents with buggies, it also causes significant damage to our footpaths. Based on the regular correspondence I receive from constituents on this issue, I expect the ban will be warmly welcomed by many in Edinburgh.\nIt is worth looking in more detail, however, at what is actually being proposed. Like any rule, there are exceptions. Unsurprisingly, the Police and other emergency services are exempt. It also appears that the Royal Mail, AA, RAC and bin lorries are also worthy of special consideration where there is no “reasonable” alternative.\nMost surprisingly, Subsection C of Clause 6 on Page 58 makes provision for exemption where vehicles are “parked for no longer than is necessary for the delivery, collection, loading or unloading and in any event for no more than a continuous period of 20 minutes.” This basically means that vehicles of unlimited size can continue to cause a hazard to pedestrians and damage to the pavement as long as goods or people are being loaded or unloaded.\nIt appears the only targets of this Bill are householders.\nOf course, the “reasonable” test is important. It is, however, rather subjective and has to be viewed within the context of a culture where everyone who currently parks on footpaths feels it is reasonable to do so – even where it is outside a primary school!\nAn issue secondary to these exemptions is the cost of enforcement and the associated public education campaign. Budget cuts mean the city is already struggling to enforce the current parking regime, so let’s hope these new powers come with the resources to enforce them.",

I was, however, surprised to read that Councillor Cammy Day had threatened to ignore the advice of Labour’s ruling Scottish Executive Committee in order to empower the SNP.\nIt’s important to note that neither his reported threat* nor the meeting he reportedly had with Kezia Dugdale** were endorsed by the party locally or Edinburgh’s Labour Councillors.\nNotwithstanding this, it’s evident that Edinburgh needed to have an administration in place in order to set the priorities for our capital’s future development. It’s clear to me, however, that many local Labour Party members and voters have real concerns about the deal that is being proposed.\nThe focus for Edinburgh’s Labour Councillors must be to regain that lost trust by seeking to deliver as much of our manifesto as possible. That will mean that everything we do must be focused on supporting job creation and the construction of affordable homes.\nI’ve yet to see the deal that Councillor Cammy Day signed with the SNP, but I expect it will also reflect the themes at the very core of our manifesto:\n1. strong opposition to any cuts imposed by Westminster/Holyrood; and,\n2. strong support for protecting jobs in Edinburgh by campaigning to secure our access to UK and EU single markets.\nIf these themes are at the foundation of the fully costed programme Councillor Adam McVey puts before Edinburgh’s Councillors, I’m sure they’ll gain wide support both inside the chamber and outside in the real world.\nPut simply, this can’t be an administration where Labour is left implementing Nicola Sturgeon’s cuts whilst nationalist Councillors dance around the city telling people things would be better if Scotland left the UK.\n*Cammy Day is now saying he did not make the threat.\n**I understand Kezia did not meet him.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_04_20_edinburghs-cash-cow-housing-crisis/content_416.html": "Every time I hear the Council say they have an “ambitious” plan to build 20,000 affordable homes before 2027 (report, 20/04/18) I ask myself who can actually afford them and will it help the 21,000 waiting on a council house in Edinburgh?\nIn 2016/17 just 283 of the 1176 (24%) affordable homes built were for social rent. The remainder of the affordable housing built were simply unaffordable for many people. It was either “mid-market rent” (for households earning up to £39k!) or “Low Cost Home Ownership” (this lets people with deposits of up to 75% buy new homes at a modest discount).\nToo many people in Edinburgh are being squeezed by a lack of housing and rising rents in the private sector. Edinburgh has become a city where a minority of private landlords profit from a housing crisis cash cow. Indeed, the Convenorship of the Council’s “Housing and Economy Committee” recently swapped from one of Edinburgh’s seven Councillors who happen to be a private landlord to another. I’m sure that both treat their tenants well, but Edinburgh is a city that has industrialised exorbitant rents and AirBnB type “holiday lets” whilst simultaneously presiding over a housing crisis.\nThe latest estimate is that up to 10,000 properties have been converted to holiday lets – with many, thanks to the Scottish Government, paying zero Council Tax or Business Rates. Somebody is making serious money out of this, and it’s not the people cleaning the properties between lets.\nLabour in Edinburgh has been pushing hard for more of the affordable housing built to be for social rent. We were disappointed that as part of the City Deal our Capital will get not one penny for council housing from the ScottishGovernment and that they also cut funding for affordable housing by £3.2m.\nReal change is needed. We need to stop talking about ambitious plans and start delivering a step change in social housing. Our Capital needs Council housing, so that should be our focus.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2024_01_02_2024-getting-edinburgh-ready-for-the-future/content_90.html": "As we enter 2024 I have been reflecting on the progress Edinburgh has made in 2023. Last year was my first full one as interim Convener of the Transport and Environment Committee, and I have used it to work cross-party to focus on getting the basics right whilst also showing ambition for the future.\nOur roads and waste staff do a fantastic job, but for too long they have not had the resources needed to do the job. I hope that’s now changing. Having inherited a situation where road and footpath maintenance was underfunded in Edinburgh, I was proud to have secured £11M of additional funding to fix the problem in our capital. We have even invested in a state-of-the-art “pothole killer” machine. We are listening to the public, and will resurface whole streets rather than take a piecemeal approach. We won’t get footpaths and roads back to where we want them to be in one year, but this investment will help halt the decline.\nAround £1m is also being spent giving the Capital a long overdue deep clean, including establishing a graffiti task force, to make sure Edinburgh continues to look at its best for residents, visitors and businesses. Partners such as Police Scotland and business leaders will be invited to discuss how as a city we can come together to improve the situation for residents and businesses.\nWe also saw the completion of the tramline to Newhaven, and Lothian Buses placing a £24M order for electric buses. To boost public transport, we have also won £2.3M of funding to look at installing bus priority measures on key arterial routes, with the aim of cutting journey times by 25%. I’ll publish more details at the end of the month on how these routes will look and operate.\nIn 2024 this pace will increase as we move towards the implementation of plans to cut congestion, reduce climate emissions and accommodate the tens of thousands of homes which will be built in and around Edinburgh in the coming decade.\nBefore the end of January we should see the pavement parking ban come in to force, and no street will be exempt. This will be transformative for those that use wheelchairs or buggies, or those that have visual impairments. I accept, however, that this will be a change which will take time to get used to.\nSoon after that, I will table plans to cut the amount of non-essential traffic in the city centre. A key challenge will be improving public transport and accessibility whilst also supporting businesses and city centre residents.\nAlso in the spring we will consult on a new tramline which will link Granton to the Bioquarter and beyond. This line perhaps should have been Edinburgh’s first – it will have stops at the Western General, Edinburgh University, Cameron Toll and the Royal Infirmary. If this route comes to pass it will double the capacity Edinburgh Trams operate at.\nI am absolutely passionate about public transport, and I am always proud of how both Lothian Trams and Lothian Buses define our city. Edinburgh Trams is exceeding all expectations, with the staff delivering a service which carried over 1 million passengers in August 2023. This complements the 2 million or so passengers carried by Lothian Buses every week. We can be proud of all that the staff in these companies do. The need to ensure the continued growth of public transport in Edinburgh, however, means that these companies must integrate their services more. That’s why in 2024 I hope we will see these companies merge… perhaps into an entity formally known as Lothian Regional Transport! Does that sound familiar?\nThis year, on June 1st, we will also see enforcement of Edinburgh’s city centre Low Emission Zone begin. Essentially, reducing the most polluting vehicles from the city will benefit everyone. Air pollution harms both our physical and mental health, so the LEZ we will help create a healthier place for everyone, reducing inequalities and making the city centre a more welcoming place. I have been speaking to NHS Lothian about the benefits it will bring, particularly to the youngest and oldest in Edinburgh. Dona Milne, director of Public Health, NHS Lothian, said: “Reducing air pollution has clear long and short-term health benefits for everyone. Our hope is that improved air quality will also encourage people to take advantage of more sustainable and active ways of travel, such as walking, cycling and public transport, which is beneficial for individuals and communities alike.”\nIn terms of active travel projects, spring should also see the completion of the City Centre West to East Link, and the Roseburn to Union Canal scheme taking shape. This year we will also see progress on the Western Villages project on Granton Waterfront, and the West Edinburgh Link will get underway. We will start the statutory consultation on Meadows to George Street, and the Lothian Road public and business engagement exercise will report. All of these schemes will improve walking, wheeling and cycling for everyone, whilst also providing good connections to our excellent public transport network.\nAlthough this pace of change is incredible and is stretching the available staff and budget resources, there will always be those that urge us to go further and faster given the climate emergency and Edinburgh’s congestion problem. I will try not to disappoint them!",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_04_21_edinburghs-100-seat-buses-are-falling-short/content_618.html": "Last November I had an article in the Evening News about the accessibility of Edinburgh’s new 100 seat buses. The key issue I raised was that, unlike much of Lothian Buses’ fleet, it was reported that these buses could not accommodate a buggy and wheelchair at the same time.\nFollowing this, I met with Richard Hall (Lothian Buses MD) in December at the formal launch of these buses. We discussed the many benefits of them, and I was assured that both a buggy and wheelchair could fit in the bus within a “shared space”, but mum/dad would have to sit across the aisle – not ideal, but a reasonable compromise.\nSince the buses became operational, however, I have been made aware of three key accessibility issues:\n- A buggy and wheelchair cannot fit in the shared space together (there is even a petition on this).\n- The luggage area is small, and many folded bugged don’t fit there.\n- The middle exit door does not lower to the same extent as the front doors on other buses.\nOn Thursday, I went over these points in a constructive discussion with Lothian Buses. I also discussed their use of second hand buses from London as these also can’t accommodate a buggy and wheelchair together. During the discussion we agreed on a great deal – particularly environmental credentials of these buses and the excellent service Lothian Buses provides. However, they were unwilling to give any ground on the accessibility of these buses. They still say that the 100 seat buses can take a buggy and wheelchair, but now qualify that to say not every buggy will fit.\nI made the point that the fundamental problem here is that Lothian Buses did not consult users as part of the design process for these buses. Although they don’t have to consult anyone, I think involving customers in the design of a service can only be a good thing. The Council actually has an “Active Travel Forum” which could have provided feedback. As good as these buses are, I think they could be better.\nSince 2016 the city has been planning for an additional 47,000 people by 2024, and an additional 102,000 by 2039, taking the total population from 492,610 to 594,712 over the 25-year period from 2014 to 2039. The question is how we accommodate this growth, and it can’t be done by expecting everyone to drive around our capital – public transport has to be attractive and accessible. We have one of the UK’s best bus services, but it needs to improve. It needs to be world class, but these buses don’t quite meet that standard.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_02_16_edinburghs-labour-councillors-tried-their-best-to-protect-services-in-the-face-of-brutal-snpgreen-cuts/content_482.html": "Edinburgh’s communities have never faced as many challenges as they do today. Child poverty is rising. Our social care system is failing. Our schools are crumbling. Our roads, footpaths and cycle-paths are a mess.\nOf course, the setting of our Capital’s budget is a chance to solve these problems and take advantage of new opportunities. Budgets are not just a collection of numbers, but an expression of our values and aspirations as a City.\nThe problem we face, of course, is that values and aspirations alone won’t solve the problems we face.\nAfter a decade of cuts, our Capital has been handed a 3.6% real terms cut by the SNP and Greens. The SNP Group Leader is happy to call this “positive” and the Greens say they are “delighted”, but it is clear that Edinburgh’s citizens will literally pay the price for this cut.\nYes, we rightly found extra funding for homelessness and social care but that has been done by cutting other services. Indeed, there has been progress in many areas but too often there has simply not been enough money to complete the job.\nFor example, Labour fought hard to protect library opening hours, but could not stop a cut to the book budget. With the SNP and Greens forcing cuts like this on Edinburgh, it is little wonder Scotland is falling behind in international education league tables.\nLikewise, we argued that the poorest households should be given the resources they need to equip their children for school. Instead of offering the £129.50 the Child Poverty Action Group, Poverty Truth Commission and One Parent Family Scotland all recommend, the School Clothing Grant in Edinburgh will be limited to just £72. This should shame us all, but the SNP and Greens in particular.\nThanks to the arguments I and others have made, low income families in Edinburgh will be exempt from paying £25 for garden waste collection and Tiphereth will continue to deliver the service in Colinton. Nonetheless, serious concerns remain about how this service will operate and take-up is uncertain.\nAlthough some money has been found to improve cycle-paths, footpaths and roads, not a penny could be spared to implement the outcome of the gritting review. Keep in mind that the review was triggered after 500 people were admitted to A&E in December alone after slipping on icy footpaths.\nAs a Labour Councillor, I am proud of how my group has won argument after argument in the budget negotiations, but the black hole resulting from the SNP / Greens cut has simply been too difficult to bridge in many cases. Indeed, it has been tough in these negotiations deciding which bridges to build and which to burn.\nIf the Scottish Government had adopted Labour’s budget proposals the story would be different. We would have protected local government funding, reformed Council Tax and given Edinburgh the power to introduce a “tourist tax” of 1% on hotel stays. These measures would have provided the resources needed to better ensure our Capital and everyone in it can succeed.",

I can now confirm that next Thursday in Full Council the Council Leader will propose we confer the Freedom of the City of Edinburgh on Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in recognition of their Leadership and heroism.\nThroughout the crisis I have recognised the value of symbolic demonstrations of solidarity, but I have also been urging that the Council takes real action to support Ukraine. On Thursday my group will table a motion condemning the horrific and illegal attacks on the independence of Ukraine and its people. We will also commend the Ukrainian people for their “heroic defence of their land in fighting the illegal invasion”, and we will also ask that the Council agrees:\n- to withdraw all support and cooperation and will withdraw and decline any future invitations to and from the Russian Consulate in Edinburgh with immediate effect.\n- to write to the Russian Ambassador, advising that the Russian Consul is no longer welcome in our Capital and write to the UK Foreign Office to request the expulsion of Russian diplomatic staff from the City of Edinburgh until Russian troops vacate Ukraine.\n- to ban all Russian Government-supported arts and cultural events and performances in Edinburgh Council-owned venues and encourage other venues in the City to do the same.\n- write to the UK Home Office encouraging unrestricted refugee visas and agrees to work locally to source host families to house refugees, with a focus on those with cultural and language understanding to best support unaccompanied children, families and individuals. Following emails to me from a Buckstone resident, will be proposed that this should utilise Positive Action on Housing’s “room for refugees” programme and other organisations.\n- to publicise the DEC appeal through Council communication channels and encourage financial donations as the best way the people of Edinburgh can help.\n- to allocate up to £100,000 to help coordinate local efforts of humanitarian aid with the Edinburgh Partnership to maximise supplies to Ukraine and support local infrastructure within Edinburgh to facilitate donations and transport supplies to distribution centres in Poland and other locations.\n- to write to the MOD to request access to any unused temporary accommodation for those travelling to Edinburgh from Kyiv and wider Ukraine in the knowledge that those people will overwhelmingly want to return to their Country when the war is over.\n- to make preparations to ensure that schools are prepared to continue Ukrainian children’s education who are coming to Edinburgh and work to prepare other support services to support those fleeing the conflict.\nFollowing a conversation I had with a Russian mother in Edinburgh this week, we will also ask that the Council acknowledges the protests in Russia of brave citizens opposing this war and those Russians within Edinburgh who have stood with Ukraine in making clear this is not in their name.\nThese proposals will be debated by Edinburgh’s 62 Councillors on Thursday – all will have a chance to speak and amend them. As part of the debate I hope to pay tribute to the work Ukraine’s neighbours have done to deal with Europe’s largest refugee crisis since World War II – particularly Poland, Hungary, Moldova, Romania and Slovakia.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2025_02_13_scotland-needs-to-catch-up-on-hiv-testing/content_11.html": "In October 2024, I visited Waverley Care’s headquarters in Firrhill, Edinburgh South West, and was deeply impressed by their work. Established in the 1980s, Waverley Care bravely opened the UK’s first purpose-built AIDS hospice, Milestone House, responding to the then-emerging HIV/AIDS epidemic in Edinburgh.\nMilestone House faced initial opposition, reflecting the fear and stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS at the time. I heard first hand accounts of this, including from a former Firhill High pupil who recalled school visits and the subsequent backlash against the hospice. Even a brief work experience opportunity was cut short due to sensationalized and inaccurate reporting.\nWe must acknowledge the courage of individuals like former Councillor John Allan, who welcomed the hospice to the Oxgangs Ward despite the resistance.\nThe turning point came with Princess Diana’s visit. Her simple act of sharing tea with a visibly ill young woman sent a clear signal – the patients faced death, but they were still people worthy of our respect.\nSince then remarkable medical advances have transformed HIV/AIDS from a death sentence to a manageable condition. As one former Waverley Care fundraising head told me, the introduction of new treatments dramatically reduced mortality rates. As treatments became available, he said:\n“The effect was pretty immediate. We went from having 2-4 deaths a month to one every three or four months in the space of a year. Then down to effectively none. The psychological impact on people was huge. It’s also down to early detection. Get tested and get on treatment.”\nHowever, the fight is far from over. Shamefully, HIV testing in Scotland has decreased by 19% since 2019, while new diagnoses are on the rise. Scotland lags behind England, lacking a dedicated HIV Testing Week and opt-out testing in high-risk urban centres.\nWaverley Care rightly highlights that while the LGBT community has strong awareness, heterosexual transmission is now the most common route, often due to lower testing rates. This is why a dedicated HIV Testing Week and opt-out testing are so important.\nWaverley Care, in partnership with THT, is leading the charge for opt-out testing and a National HIV Testing Week in Scotland. These measures have proven effective in England and Wales, increasing accessibility and reducing stigma. Furthermore, ensuring access to PrEP is crucial, particularly for marginalized people like the trans community, who may face additional barriers to care.\nWaverley Care’s work is essential to achieving Scotland’s goal of ending HIV transmission by 2030. I urge the Scottish government to heed their call for a National HIV Testing Week and implement opt-out testing.\nWe must act now to build on the progress made and ensure that everyone has access to the testing, treatment, and support they need.\nHaving read the statement from Waverly Care and THT, I cannot see how Scotland can meet its target to end HIV transmission by 2030, and that will only make the job of the UK Government harder.",

If the decline we have witnessed nationally is to be reversed, we must all take seriously our responsibility to ensure all children can reach their full potential.\nWithin that context, we must remember that the best schools are partnerships between inspirational teachers, motivated children, engaged parents and a supportive community. The building simply facilitates learning, it is the other elements that make it happen.\nThis is why the crisis facing Currie Community High School is so concerning. This school is one of the best in our Capital because of its place at the heart of the community it serves. People are right to be concerned about moving the school and dividing the community.\nWe must take the news that the school building has structural problems seriously, but we must also be careful that they are addressed without harming the life chances of current and future pupils. Personally, I remain to be convinced that the entire building needs to be demolished and replaced elsewhere.\nI also share the concerns of my constituents about the unexpected nature and complexity of the proposals launched by the Council’s Education department. As a local Councillor, I was only told about the consultation after the school’s Parent Council.\nI’m also concerned that no educational impact study has yet been undertaken (this will happen if the proposals reach the next stage) and that my constituents without children at the school were not directly notified. Indeed, I have constituents living next to one of the potential sites who found out about the proposals via the Evening News.\nDespite these problems, the current consultation is really just the first step in the process and I have been assured no decisions have been made yet. I would strongly urge all interested residents to take time to read the proposals and submit their comments before the 9th of February: www.edinburgh.gov.uk/schoolsreview\nAddendum: the consultation has been extended up to the 29th of March.",

On top of that he’s now being asked to pay £25 to have the clippings collected.\nTo help mitigate these SNP cuts, the nationalist Councillors in Edinburgh have backed Labour’s call to give our capital the right to set a modest tourist tax on hotel stays.\nAfter going cap in hand to his party’s elite, Edinburgh’s SNP Council Leader Adam McVey announced boldly on Twitter that “In the next 12 months our plans for a tourist tax will be ready for implementation”.\nHowever, a mere 32 minutes later Fiona Hyslop MSP (Cabinet Secretary for Tourism) slapped him down saying: “So let’s be clear – you have no shared plans, no tourist business consultation and no agreement with the Scottish Gov.”.\nIt appears Edinburgh and Councillor McVey need to know their place!\nI was left wondering if Councillor McVey should follow Councillor Graczyk and leave his party in order to stand up for the people of Edinburgh?",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2023_08_11_snp-green-scot-gov-council-tax-changes-the-impact-on-edinburgh-residents/content_25.html": "Below is an update from Council Officers on the impact of the SNP/Green Gov’s ill-thought Council Tax proposals on Edinburgh residents. The dithering SNP Government just needs to deliver its commitment to scrap the Council Tax. The current SNP/Green proposal to increase bills by 0-22.5% will not change the fact that it is a fundamentally unfair tax, or reduce the costs faced by the poorest Scots. On top of that, the SNP/Green Gov will claw back a big chunk of the cash raised.\nBriefing\nThe Scottish Government and COSLA have launched a consultation on the Council Tax system. The consultation was published on 12 July 2023 and focuses on potential increased Council Tax charges for properties in valuation Bands E to H.\nThe consultation runs until 20 September 2023 and seeks views on:\n- Increasing Council Tax for properties in valuation Bands E to H\n- The phasing of any increases\n- The potential to expand Council Tax reduction.\n- Impact of the proposed changes.\nThe Scottish Government oversees a Joint Working Group on Sources of Local Government Finance. This is essentially a political forum with Local Government represented by the COSLA presidential team and two officers drawn from the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation and COSLA Directors of Finance. The Joint Working Group has been exploring proposals for meaningful Council Tax changes\nScottish Government advises proposals contained within the current Council Tax consultation is just one aspect of a broader range of potential measures that are under consideration. The current consultation asks for views about the relationship between the property valuation band and the Council tax rate set.\nTo assist political groups develop their own consultation submissions the following information has been compiled.\n- Occupiers of domestic properties pay Council Tax, with the amount due to be paid depending on the valuation band of the property.\n- Council Tax is often described as a regressive tax. This is because when the average Council Tax liability is expressed as a percentage of the estimated property value, the effective tax rate is higher for lower value properties and lower for the higher value properties.\n- The Scottish Government increased the Council Tax Band E to H multipliers in 2017, with a percentage change of 7.5% for Band E, 12.5% for Band F, 17.5% for Band G and 22.5% for Band H.\n- The Council Tax Reduction scheme protects the most financially vulnerable. Entitlement and the amount awarded is based on the characteristics, capital, needs and income of the household.\n- The proposed changes in the current consultation are identical to those in 2017, with a percentage change of 7.5% for Band E, 12.5% for Band F, 17.5% for Band G and 22.5% for Band H.\n- Approximately 38% of Edinburgh households would be impacted by the proposal.\n- The consultation seeks views on whether the changes could be introduced on a phased basis from 2024-25 onwards, with a percentage year-on-year increase over several financial years. This can be delivered from an operational perspective but there are likely to be resource, system and scheduling considerations.\n- The consultation also requests views on the impact of the proposed changes. The proposal has the potential to have a range of impacts and it is anticipated that Scottish Government would complete a full impact assessment before implementing any change. The proposal has the potential to raise funds that could tackle hardship and inequality. The financial impact on protected characteristic groups will also need to be considered, including those that live in higher value properties but have more limited financial means.\n- The consultation proposals do not impact on the Council’s ability to set the Council Tax rate for Edinburgh. The Council would determine this, with any updated multipliers being applied in the normal way as part of the overall process.\n- The impact of the proposal is detailed in the following table, with figures based on the 2023/24 charge. This is for illustrative purposes only.\nIt is anticipated that a similar arrangement to reflect any agreed revisions to Council Tax multipliers will be adopted within the Local Government Finance Settlement, as was the case for the previous related changes in 2017.\nIn line with the underlying principles of Council Tax, any additional income raised from revising the multipliers would be retained by the council concerned. However, in accordance with the needs basis approach underpinning the Local Government Finance Settlement, an individual council’s funding from Scottish Government will be adjusted to ensure that their overall percentage share of grant funding and Council Tax remains unchanged. This ensures that authorities with fewer higher-banded properties (and thus raising proportionately less income from the changes) are not disadvantaged.\nBased on the £176m of additional income anticipated to be generated across Scotland, the net increase in resources available to any given council would be aligned to its share of the Scotland-wide needs assessment. For Edinburgh this would equate to £14.1m (i.e. £176m * 8%).\nOverall anticipated position for Edinburgh\n- Estimated additional Council Tax collected and retained locally = £25.5m\n- Less reduction in Scottish Government funding = £11.4m (which will be distributed to councils with a lower number of band E – H properties to ensure adherence to overall funding being based on a needs-based approach).\n- Net increase in total funding = £14.1m\nCOSLA has produced a separate briefing note and this can be accessed here.\nOfficers will update Committee on the outcome of the consultation. At this time there is no definitive timeline as to when the consultation outcomes will be published.\nThe consultation notes that changing the Council Tax multipliers requires regulations to be agreed in the Scottish Parliament, as well as changes to local authority billing and administration systems. These could be delivered in time for changes to take effect from the start of the 2024-25 Council Tax year.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_12_27_volunteering-in-edinburgh-should-not-have-a-dark-underbelly/content_290.html": "I’m absolutely delighted that Unite and Underbelly were able to broker a deal which means our Capital’s Hogmanay celebrations can go ahead without anyone being accused of exploiting workers (report, 27/12/17).\nI think we’ve all been in a position where we move into a new home and have a particular dislike for the décor. Being a new Councillor is like that. There are lots of decisions that have been made in the past, which either have not stood the test of time or perhaps were never a good idea. Indeed, the tram debacle has taught all Councillors the value of doing their homework and asking Officers difficult questions.\nInterestingly, the two decisions from the previous administration which have been of concern to me in recent weeks both originate from the now defunct “Culture and Sport Committee”. This SNP convened committee left both a threat to our libraries and the controversy surrounding the use of volunteers at Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Celebration.\nAs we all know, Edinburgh is a fantastic city. I take huge pride in welcoming friends, family and academic partners to it. Its natural setting, architecture, history, culture and citizens are what draw people here. The Council has a duty, however, to ensure those that do visit are safe, respectful and want to come back. That’s why our city needs its civic festive celebrations to be professionally organised.\nIndeed, the success of these events in recent years are why we had to take the controversy surrounding the use of “volunteers” at this year’s celebration seriously. As a Labour Councillor and trade unionist, I don’t want to see any worker exploited. I don’t want to see people being duped in to being “volunteers” when in fact they are basically unpaid workers.\nThat’s why I agree with Cllr Donald Wilson, Labour’s Culture Tsar, when he says that where volunteering is used legitimately it can be hugely positive. Like him, I want it to be used to help people get back into work, engender a sense of community and help build self-esteem. That’s why we all have to support his efforts to review how the Council and its contractors use volunteers.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2024_02_14_a-short-note-on-road-and-footpath-maintenance-budget-2024-45-for-city-of-edinburgh-council/content_229.html": "In February 2023 City of Edinburgh Council set it’s budget for the coming year, and that included a one-time £11 million surge in funding for road and footpath maintenance. This reflected the state of the roads and footpaths Councillors inherited after the 2022 election. Indeed, when I became Convener I inherited a situation whereby road and foot path maintenance was underfunded by £8 million per year (I question the roads engineer here).\nThis funding meant that 420,000m² of road and 170,000m² of pavement improvements will be carried out in 2023/24, compared to pre-Covid yearly averages of 225,000m² for roads and 30,000m² for pavements. The work original programme is detailed here.\nNow, one year later the budget is being set again. If Councillors do nothing on road and footpath maintenance funding, it will revert to the February 2022 level (i.e. £11 million less than Feb 2023).\nThis means that when Councillors talk about “extra” funding for road and footpath maintenance anything less than £11 million is actually a cut!\nSo what are the parties offering? As far as I can make out (I am awaiting confirmation), the offers are:\n- Conservative – £12 million “extra”.\n- Greens – Nil, but £450k is allocated to dropped kerbs (i.e. £10.55 million less than last year).\n- Independent – Nil (i.e. £11 million less than last year).\n- Labour – £12.5 million “extra” each year for 3 years.\n- Liberal Democrats – £12.5 million “extra”.\n- SNP – £1.2 million cut (i.e. £12.2 million less than last year).\nIt is important to note that Council Officers were clear about the minimum level of investment needed in 2024 onwards: “To maintain a steady state in condition and continue to apply the guidance, it is estimated that an additional £8m-£10m will be required in each financial year.”\nGiven the state of our roads and footpaths, these SNP/Green cuts look like an act of vandalism. They would basically half the roads and footpath budget and set us back years.\nThis is because good quality Pavements, Streetscapes, Lighting and Roads infrastructure benefit all our citizens and visitors whenever they walk, wheel, cycle or use public transport. Investment in our infrastructure improves safety and enhances the appearance of our city. It’s essential that we continue investment in both basic infrastructure and active travel.\nLabour’s proposal will mean of these funds will include investment in road safety and community-lead projects and in improving areas identified as feeling unsafe in the Women’s Safety survey.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_12_18_2019-20-budget-briefing-city-of-edinburgh-council/content_616.html": "Below briefing from Council Officers on the 2019/20 Council Budget – It has been confirmed that the SNP Government intend to cut Edinburgh’s core funding by 2.4%. This is 5 times the expected level – meaning that Edinburgh is being cut by £8.9m more than predicted. On top of this £1.8m is needed for an unfunded pay rise. The total savings target for this year is now £38m.\nBackground\nThe Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Economy and Fair Work presented a one-year Draft Scottish Budget for 2019/20 to the Scottish Parliament on 12 December. In contrast to recent years, the announcement included only headline detail of the Local Government Finance Settlement, with provisional authority-specific figures then provided on 18 December. The draft Settlement will now be subject to five weeks’ consultation, with comments invited on the accuracy of the calculations underpinning the accompanying Finance Circular and, as such, all allocations remain provisional at this stage. In addition, the quantum of funding provided to local government may change as part of the Draft Bill’s Parliamentary consideration, given the likelihood of needing to secure the support of at least one other political party represented within the Scottish Parliament to be passed.\n1.2 Receipt of each council’s full funding allocation is dependent upon increasing Council Tax levels by no more than 3% in 2019/20 and continuing adherence to national commitments around maintaining current pupil:teacher ratios and guaranteeing a place for every probationary teacher who requires one under the Teacher Induction Scheme.\n1.3 The Settlement reflects baselining of the £170m of additional revenue resources initially provided on a one-off basis as part of the revised Local Government Finance Settlement in February 2018. In addition, it includes:\n(i) total additional revenue (£210m) and capital (£25m) investment to support further expansion of early learning and childcare provision;\n(ii) combined additional revenue funding of £160m to facilitate expansion of Free Personal and Nursing Care for under 65s, continuing implementation of the Carers’ Act and increased investment in health and social care integration, allowing on-going payment of the Living Wage by all adult care providers. A further £12m has also been provided for expanded school counselling services. Local authorities are required to pass on to Integration Joint Boards and/or relevant services a net increase at least equal to their share of this total of £160m of additional funding;\n(iii) an indicative £3.3m of additional revenue resources for valuation authorities to support implementation of the recommendations of the Barclay Review of Non- Domestic Rates; and\n(iv) a new £50m Town Centre capital fund to enable local authorities to stimulate and support place-based economic improvements and inclusive growth.\n1.4 As newly-introduced funding streams, a number of the above sums remain to be distributed amongst Scotland’s thirty-two authorities. Allocation decisions will be taken forward by the joint Scottish Government/COSLA Settlement and Distribution Group (SDG) and presented to COSLA Leaders for approval in accordance with established practice.\nScotland-wide and Edinburgh-specific Settlement, 2019/20\n1.5 The headline provisional Local Government Finance Settlement reflects a year-on-year increase of £173m (1.7%) in revenue and £208m (23.7%) in capital funding. These sums, however, reflect both funding for a number of new or expanded commitments (with corresponding expenditure obligations) and other presentational changes, the net effect of which requires to be taken into account in discerning the underlying impact on the Council’s budget framework. The capital allocation additionally reflects £150m of realigned funding, having previously been subtracted from the 2016/17 Settlement in view of wider Scottish Government priorities at that time.\n1.6 Receipt of supporting information to the Settlement is on-going but, on the basis of details received to date, it is estimated that, once account is taken of the factors noted above, underlying Scotland-wide revenue funding has decreased by about £230m (2.3%). The specific impact on individual authorities’ financial planning will however depend, in particular, upon the level of funding already assumed to be provided to integration authorities. Edinburgh’s level of grant funding reduction, at 2.4%, is slightly higher than this average, reflecting the net effect of:\n(i) an increase of about £2.8m in its share of the needs-based distribution formulae, primarily those calculated with reference to overall population numbers;\n(ii) receipt of a £1.7m contribution under the policy whereby no authority receives less than 85% of the average Scotland-wide per capita level of revenue funding;\n(iii) offset by a £5.3m reduced contribution from the stability funding floor. Due to a significant reduction in support for historic borrowing costs in recent years, however, the Council will still receive £13.3m through this source in 2019/20.\nImplications of provisional 2019/20 Settlement for Council’s budget framework\n1.7 At this stage, it is estimated that the provisional settlement as set out above will result in an increase of £8.9m in the Council’s incremental savings requirement for 2019/20. This represents the net effect of a £17.9m like-for-like reduction in grant, less (i) the framework’s pre-existing assumption of the provision of £6.0m of additional demographic-related investment for health and social care services and (ii) the further current assumption of a 0.4% (£3.0m) reduction in revenue grant.\n1.8 As noted above, the draft Budget Bill now enters a process of further Parliamentary consideration. This consideration has, in the last two years, resulted in the provision of significant additional resources for Local Government, with £12.4m of further funding provided to the Council in 2018/19. While, due to the tightness of the wider Scottish Government budgetary position, there is no similar guarantee for 2019/20, there is nonetheless the potential for the level of funding to change and members will be kept apprised of any updates as the Bill progresses.\nPay award, 2018/19\n1.9 Members may be aware of the decision reached at a Special COSLA Leaders’ Meeting on Friday 14 December to increase by a further 0.5% (to 3.5%) the employer’s pay award for most non-teaching staff for 2018/19. At this stage, in the absence of any indication of corresponding external funding, it is proposed that a provision of £1.8m be incorporated within the framework in respect of this additional liability. Assuming settlement at this level, this will also hasten a similar additional liability in the current year, re-emphasising the need for urgent corrective action, such that a balanced overall position can be achieved by the year-end.\nDemographic provision\n1.10 As indicated in the budget framework update report considered by the Finance and Resources Committee on 27 September 2018, the level of incremental demographic provision in respect of rising pupil numbers has been reviewed following the publication of updated pupil roll projections in December 2018. Based on these updated projections and in accordance with the established practice of funding at 70% of unit costs to reflect the marginal costs of delivery and incentivise innovative ways of addressing increased demand, a further £0.3m has been included in the framework for 2019/20. No changes to existing levels of provision are proposed for future years at this time.\nUpdated revenue position, 2019/20\n1.11 Taking into account the above changes, the revised savings requirement for 2019/20 has increased by £11m as shown below:\n| £m | |\n| Incremental savings requirement per report to Finance and Resources Committee on 27 September 2018 | 27.8 |\n| Provisional impact of Scottish Government Draft Budget, based on underlying change in funding once account taken of (i) monies provided in respect of new or expanded commitments and (ii) existing H&SC demographic provision | 8.9 |\n| Potential recurring implications of improved 3.5% pay offer for non-teaching staff in 2018/19 | 1.8 |\n| Additional demographic provision – Communities and Families (based on updated pupil projections) | 0.3 |\n| Revised savings requirement | 38.8 |\nFurther risks\nTeachers’ pensions\n1.12 Following a review of discount rate assumptions by the UK Treasury earlier in the year, a 5.2% increase in the employer’s superannuation contribution rate will be introduced with effect from April 2019. While the UK Government has confirmed that an element (estimated at around a third) of the additional costs will result in Barnett Consequentials for the devolved Administrations, the Scottish Government is not bound to allocate these sums in accordance with the changes that triggered them. On that basis, and acknowledging the UK Treasury’s earlier indication that the remaining costs would fall to be met by the devolved Administrations, there is potential exposure in 2019/20 and future years to an unfunded liability of up to £7.2m. The Head of Finance will continue to monitor the situation and, working with COSLA colleagues, impress upon the Scottish and UK Governments the importance of fully funding these increases.\nService pressures\n1.13 Executive Directors and the Chief Officer of the Edinburgh Health and Social Care Partnership have identified a number of recurring pressures as part of both the current year’s revenue monitoring and future service planning. At this stage, it is expected that all such pressures will be contained within the services affected but there is a risk that these measures will not fully mitigate the sums concerned, adding further to the incremental savings requirement in 2019/20. Updates will be provided to members as the budget process progresses.\nCapital funding settlement\n1.14 As noted above, the headline level of capital grant funding across Scotland has increased by £208m over the amount received in 2018/19. This increase includes, however, ringfenced sums of £25m to support further expansion of early learning and childcare provision and £50m for the creation of a Town Centre Fund. In addition, the 2019/20 Settlement reflects, as expected, the £150m of General Capital Grant (GCG) previously reprofiled from 2016/17. As with the revenue settlement, the underlying position is therefore one of a slight reduction in core grant funding.\n1.15 Transfer of Management Development Funding (TMDF) of £33.877m to support the provision of additional affordable housing accounts for the majority of distributed ringfenced grant. Edinburgh’s 2019/20 allocation of £14.5m for early learning and childcare expansion had previously been confirmed in May 2018. Distribution of the Town Centre Fund capital monies amongst authorities will be determined by the SDG.\n1.16 Once account is taken of the core level of grant funding and Edinburgh’s share of the re-profiled monies, the provisional Settlement for 2019/20 includes around £10.4m of additional General Capital Grant funding that will be available for allocation through the budget development process.\nNext steps\n1.17 Updates concerning the impact of the provisional Local Government Finance Settlement and other pertinent changes on both the revenue and capital budget frameworks will be considered by the Finance and Resources Committee on 1 February and referred to Council as part of the budget-setting process. In the interim, further updates will be provided to members as the budget process progresses.",

Even those who stood under the SNP banner last year are not happy. Indeed, he ignores the fact that three councillors have left the SNP since last May – two of them due to key decisions the group made. Furthermore, discipline is such that the group has just enrolled its third Whip. He deliberately ignores the fact the SNP Scottish Government have given a bigger cut to Councils (7.1%) than the Scottish Government have received from Westminster (1.3%).\nOnce again he ignores the fact that the coalition agreement states “ The partnership will campaign against austerity in all its forms and will lobby both the Westminster and the Scottish Government to ensure that local services are adequately funded.”\nAs Labour Councillors, we are working end austerity and call on others to do the same.\nHowever, there are those in the Council who are content to remain silent in the face of the funding crisis which is set to have a significant impact of our schools. Indeed, as your columnist makes clear, there are even those that view opposing cuts to education in our capital as “openly attacking the Scottish Government”.\nIn 2015 when the nationalists were led by former Councillor Sandy Howat the group put city before party. In response to the budget cut that year in a press release he told the SNP Government that the “harsh reality is that this will translate to real job cuts that hit real families, in real communities throughout our capital city. Everyone will be hurt by this”.\nThis is the message we are sending to the SNP Government again in order to oppose “austerity in all its forms”.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_12_19_parking-around-pentland-primary-school-a-note-from-parents/content_447.html": "Below is a briefing from Pentland Primary School Parent Council (PPC) about parking around the school.\nWe want ALL our children to be safe going to school.\nIt has been brought to the attention of the school and PPC that people (Both Parents/Carers and residents) are parking in an unsafe and inconsiderate manner at drop off and pick up times of the school day. This has been happening at all sides of the school and the school is taking phones calls from residents of the area as well as other parents also complaining to the ‘PPC’ and ‘The City of Edinburgh Council’.\nWhile it is understood that some families need to bring the cars to school for onward journeys after dropping off or for the distance they have to travel within the catchment area, we (as parents) need to take responsibility for keeping all the children safe at such a busy time of the day.\nThe following covers each side of the school individually. Complaints have been made from various sources at all sides of the school area.\nIt should be noted that the school cannot take responsibility for this situation as it is not on the premises (apart from those who use the car park) and as such anything that follows on is in the hands of the City of Edinburgh Council and the police/traffic warden. Please avoid contacting the school office if you have any issues on this subject as they do not have the time to field phone calls on this.\n- · Don’t park on Single or Double yellow lines\n- · Don’t park on pavements\n- · Don’t park over driveways\n- · Don’t speed\nOxgangs Bank\nRecently, the parking warden attended the Broadway shops side of the school and ticketed 3 vehicles in the morning and 1 in the afternoon. There is signage along the short stretch beside the grass that indicates there is no stopping at certain times of the day.\nThere has also been reports of vehicles parking on the grass on the opposite side of the corner under the tree. This is NOT a parking area; the residents have complained directly to the school regarding this.\nThere has been a report made to the PPC of a parent in a heated discussion with a resident on Oxgangs bank going up the hill for parking over the driveway. Can people please be aware that it is illegal to park a vehicle over a dropped kerb driveway. The resident can complain to the police and it does carry a fine. Please park considerately if you do park on this stretch of road.\nThere has also been a complaint made to the school for people parking in the care home/private resident’s car parking spaces. These are private spaces not to be used by parents. It’s the same for the ‘Stevenson Reeves’ building, these are private property for the business.\nCan everyone please be considerate when parking in the area. We can park in the spaces beside the Broadway shops, behind the Broadway shops and in the ALDI car park. If you are parking close to the school, please do so safely and do not block footpaths or driveways. Parents have been saying that they feel unsafe at time when walking the children to school as they cannot see cars moving around and they are having to cross the road through tight gaps between the parked cars. Oxgangs view now has double yellow lines on one side, please do not park on these.\nIt has also been spotted that certain vehicles are speeding on this stretch of road with no regard appearing to be made to the children or the speed bumps. Can we please watch our speed in the area for the safety of the children who have to cross the road.\nIn the image below (Broadway side), the highlighted areas show where we should and should not be parking. The Yellow boxes are to highlight areas where there are restrictions but do have safe areas to park.\nNursery Side\nThe image below shows area where it safe to park, as long as it is carried out in a considerate way to the residents and other parents.\nSadly, there has been a report of someone parking here and having their car scraped by another who left the area without passing on insurance details.\nPlease, again, be considerate of everyone else.\nOxgangs Green\nOn this side of the school, the residents of the area have been complaining about vehicles being parked up on the pavements narrowing the road into the school car park and making it dangerous for pedestrians, blocking driveways (which, as mentioned before is illegal) and coming into the school car park itself to drop children off.\nThis is an access road into the school that is required by staff to enter the premises, and also if the emergency services required to attend at that side of the school. This area should NOT be blocked or used by parents for parking at any time due to those reasons. It is wholly inconsiderate to everyone to do so in the areas in the red boxes in the image below.\nIn the green area, please park considerately for the neighbours and safely for the children.\nIf you have any further issue with this subject could you please contact the PPC at the email address ppcchair1@gmail.com or our Edinburgh Council representative Councillor Scott Arthur at Scott.Arthur@edinburgh.gov.uk and if you wish to further discuss in the long term then please come along to the next PPC meeting and solutions and the way forward can be set out.",

As the Leith Walk section opens up, however, issues and concerns are arising around the operation non-tram element which were agreed by the last Council administration. Below are two press statements which I issued today in relation to this.\nBanned Left Turn on to London Road\nThe changes to the road layout at the London Road junction are designed to improve public transport efficiency, and protect pedestrians. These improvements are clearly signed, with seven signs in place on approach. Anyone contravening the rules is breaking the law, as well as endangering the safety of themselves and other road users. Ignoring the ban on left hand turns is extremely selfish, and I would urge drivers to take heed of the changes and follow alternative routes.\nI visited the junction on Sunday to observe driver behaviour, and yesterday the Police, Council and the Trams to Newhaven team considered the issue. They continue to monitor the situation on an ongoing basis and are in the process of installing changes to the junction to make breaking the ban harder. They will also optimise the operation of the traffic lights at Picardy Place so that the time to get around the junction and turn right into London Road is as efficient as possible. We will continue dialogue with Police Scotland and continue to monitor the junction.\nAccessibility of Leith Walk\nThe safety and comfort of all road users, in particular vulnerable groups, was at the forefront of Trams to Newhaven’s development by the last administration. Ultimately, in addition to the new tram line, this scheme aims to deliver a more welcoming environment for everyone travelling by foot, wheel or bike.\nThe Council’s project team has worked hard to engage closely with the public from the project’s inception, and the design for Leith Walk was developed in close consultation with the community and stakeholders during 2018 to allow residents, businesses, pedestrians and cyclist to co-exist with buses and trams.\nThe current layout complies with the Edinburgh Street Design Guidance (ESDG), which recognises that flexibility is required to accommodate a variety of modes in the design of existing streets. The lip between the footway and the cycleway is there to provide clear segregation for visually impaired pedestrians.\nI acknowledge, however, that there are genuine concerns regarding this scheme and I will ensure it is closely monitored once it is fully open to the public. Additionally, I have given careful consideration to what lessons can be learnt from what we see unfolding on Leith Walk. Early in 2023 I hope to start the work of collaborating with disability groups to establish an Access Charter against which all transport projects will be assessed. As well as focusing on physical and sensory disabilities, this approach will consider the needs an rights of residents with learning disabilities, neurodiversity and brain injuries.",

I have ensured that community interests are well represented at the event – we should see everyone from Community Councils to Parent Councils & GPs there!\nThe Ministry of Defence (MOD) has stated that Redford Barracks is to close by 2022 as part of a wider rationalisation of the MOD estate. The nearby Dreghorn Barracks will remain open, with some of the functions from Redford Barracks being relocated there. Council officers have been engaging with the MOD to support the development of a masterplan that could transform the Redford Barracks site into a successful, sustainable residential-led community.\nThis placemaking workshop will focus on the surrounding communities of Redford, Colinton and Oxgangs, and look at opportunities which may arise from the redevelopment of Redford Barracks, seeking to agree a view on how this area could be different. The workshop outcomes will inform future investment planning in the local area, including both the brief for the Redford Barracks site masterplan and the Council’s City Plan 2030.\nThe first part of the workshop will explore the key issues and priorities in the wider Redford, Colinton and Oxgangs area, both from a Council service provision and community stakeholder perspective. This will include considering how people currently view the area, and what would make the area better.\nThe second part of the workshop will focus on placemaking scenarios and consider opportunities that the redevelopment of the barracks will offer around a number of different themes e.g. housing, transport, amenities, services, environment. This will identify opportunities for shared investment and community-led aspirations for the site which will inform future plans for the area, including the redevelopment of the Redford Barracks site.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_07_02_speaking-out-against-rising-child-poverty-in-scotlands-capital-city/content_477.html": "Well done to Councillor Cammy Day (Opinion, 02/07/18) for speaking out against rising child poverty in our capital. I grew up in a workless single parent council house in Fife during the miners’ strike, so I know first-hand about the impact poverty can have.\nMy route out of that was to work hard at school and go on to complete a degree and eventually a PhD. It breaks my heart, therefore, that children are still facing the same challenges I did 40 years ago but the escape route via education I found is simply not there for so many youngsters.\nAlmost one in four (230,000) of Scotland’s children are officially recognised as living in poverty – this is higher than in many other European countries. The SNP blame Tory Government for this, and the Tories blame the SNP Government. The truth is that both are to blame.\nThe Tory assault on the welfare system has contributed to the number of UK children living in poverty rising by 200,000 in 2016 alone. The Tories have also cut Scotland’s budget by 1.8% since 2013/14, but the SNP Government amplified this austerity by cutting Council funding by 7.1% – the equivalent in Edinburgh of £226 per person.\nWhilst the SNP and Tories in Edinburgh remain silent on these cuts, our education and social care services are being starved of the cash they need to help the very poorest households.\nEdinburgh needs all its Councillors to stop defending their party’s governing elite and start working to ensure the UK and Scottish Governments deliver secure employment, adequate social security benefits, affordable housing, affordable childcare and fair access to education.\nMore than 96% of the richest Scottish school leavers go on to a so called “positive destination”, the figure is just 85% for the poorest. Closing that gap by raising the attainment of the poorest is the only way to tackle poverty, but our capital can only do it if it has the funding it needs.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_05_22_braid-road-the-quiet-route-another-update-more-cars-less-bikes/content_396.html": "Below is the latest update on Braid Road and the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Routs from the Spaces for People team. The main conclusion appears to be that traffic moving through the area is more settled. The number of cyclists continues to fall, but numbers on a nearby road (Whitehouse Loan) are rising. Pedestrian numbers on Braid Road are noted as being “high”, but these are also falling. The data files are at the foot of this blog.\nPedestrian traffic on Braid Road appears to have dropped by 21%.\nThe data suggests that the total number of vehicles passing through Greenbank junction has increased by 9% whilst the number of bikes has dropped by 27%. The data also suggests that the total number of bikes passing through the junction on Braid Road (where the roundabout was) has increased by 12% whilst the number of bikes has dropped by 27%.\nIn response to the briefing, I have posed the following questions to the SfP team:\n- It would be useful if you could add to this an objective analysis of the delays on Comiston Road.\n- Your data suggests that the total number of vehicles passing through Greenbank junction has increased by 9% but the number of bikes has dropped by 27%. Is that correct?\n- Pedestrian traffic on Braid Road appears to have dropped by 21%. You describe the numbers as “high”. I assume this is just a personal judgment rather than an objective analysis? I live in Buckstone and many streets here are far busier – esp Buckstone Road and Crescent.\n- Your data suggests that the total number of bikes passing through the junction on Braid Road (where the roundabout was) has increased by 12% whilst the number of bikes has dropped by 27%. Is that correct?\n- On Braid Road, it was originally closed as it was argued that the numbers of pedestrians accessing the Hermitage meant extra space was needed. The current configuration has removed this extra space as the carriageway at the hermitage entrance is now wholly consumed by space for bikes and cars. Given that SfP argued that the Braid Road closure is separate from the Quiet Route, what is the current “Covid” justification for Braid Road only being open southbound?\nSpaces for People Braid Road Update\nThe changes to Braid Road and the southern section of the Quiet Route have now been in place for several weeks and we have received updated count data. As such, I wanted to share an update on how the measures appear to be functioning.\nPlease find attached an updated summary document of the traffic counts, as well as pedestrian counts for both the April and May count periods.\nTraffic Movements\nIn terms of vehicle traffic movements through the Braid Estate, the Quiet Connection now appears to be functioning largely as planned, with a reduced number of vehicles accessing the Braid Estate overall, and most of the northbound traffic on Braid Road, continuing all the way to the junction of Cluny Gardens, rather than turning onto Braid Crescent and following the quiet route.\nThis is shown by the reduction in the number of vehicles turning left onto Braid Road from Braidburn Terrace from 1,083 vpd in the April counts, to 895 in the May counts, as well as the significant increase in the number of vehicles turning right from Braid Road onto Cluny Gardens from 491 vpd in the April counts to 776 in the May counts. Suggesting a reduction in the amount of through traffic traveling along Braidburn Crescent, Hermitage Gardens and Corrennie Drive compared to immediately after the changes. This is supported by officer’s on site observations, as well as more recent feedback from members of the public.\nLevels of traffic accessing Braid Road southbound have increased from 961 in April to 1,414 in May, which should help to reduce pressure on the A702 southbound.\nWe are aware of concerns from residents on some streets in the area (notably Midmar Gardens and the southern end of Hermitage Gardens) of increased traffic. It is likely that, though traffic on these streets may have increased compared to when Braid Road was closed, it is still very low. We will continue to assess and review nonetheless.\nIt is worth noting that the level of traffic in the area is dramatically reduced compared to pre-covid baseline. Almost all through traffic in the Braids Estate must travel through the Braid Road / Braidburn Terrace junction. In 2018 levels of traffic at this junction exceeded 9,000 vpd. In the latest counts this figure was 2,308 vpd.\nLevels of Cycling\nInterestingly levels of cycling at all points were lower in May than in April. However I have reviewed our counter data for the nearby counter on Whitehouse Loan which suggests that: the count period in April was during a particularly high week for cycling, and; over the longer term the current levels of cycling in the area are notably higher than levels during Spring in previous years. This is shown in the below charts.\nThe first chart shows the weekly summary of average daily cycle traffic on Whitehouse Loan during each week since the start of 2021. The April counts took place during the week shown in blue, the May counts took place during the week shown in red.\nThe second chart shows the monthly summary of daily average cycle traffic at the same location since the start of 2018. Figures for March, April and May during each year are highlighted. The average daily cycle use at this location in March, April and May, is the highest on record for each of those months, and among the highest for any month (I am not sure why the figure is so high for Autumn 2019, this is spike is present in several of our counters).\nPedestrian Use of Braid Road\nLevels of pedestrian use remain high on Braid Road, though figures in May were below those in April. The footway on the South-East side of the junction of Braid Road and Hermitage Drive is consistently the busiest at this junction, highlighting the importance of the footway widening at this point.\nI hope that the above and attached data is of interest. I am sharing due to the high level of interest in the scheme, especially during the weeks shortly after implementation when problematic traffic movements were causing issues in certain residential streets in the Braid Estate. The data suggests that these issues have reduced, and that the scheme is now functioning largely as planned.\nThis data will form part of the project review for this project, which will be carried out by officers in the coming weeks.",

It comprises a range of practical and radical policies which are focussed on the problems our city and its residents are facing. With these policies enacted we will be in a good place to tackle the cost of living crises, rebuild the economy after the pandemic and respond to the Climate Emergency.\nOur key priorities are:\n- Investing in our services and in our communities.\n- Getting basic services back on track – everything from filling potholes to getting litter bins emptied.\n- Campaigning for Fair Funding for Edinburgh and fighting cuts in services.\n- Working to eradicate child poverty by 2030.\n- Tackling the Climate Emergency to reach the target of net zero emissions by 2030.\nThe manifesto is packed full of policies and ideas, but the key ones for me are:\n- Putting additional resources into increasing the frequency of street bin emptying and street cleaning services.\n- Stopping charging for bulk uplifts, and enforcing the toughest penalties for fly tipping and dog fouling.\n- Making provision of safe travel home for staff a condition of licensing in the night time economy.\n- Prioritising women’s safety on public transport and in public spaces.\n- Retaining and improving our network of public libraries and community centres.\n- Upgrading existing public toilets and increasing the number across the city, including in parks, all to meet accessible and changing room standards.\n- Delivering a programme to upgrade public parks and play facilities.\n- Providing additional funding for home adaptations in council homes, and lobbying the Scottish Government to provide more grants for private renters and home owners.\n- Increasing the number of qualified pupil support assistants to guarantee support for all nursery, primary and first and second year high school classes, and improve their pay and terms and conditions.\n- Working with the voluntary sector to ensure availability of good quality informal youth work provision that meets the needs and aspirations young people in their communities.\n- Establishing a new tourism body for the city that includes local community representatives as well as the tourist industry and councillors.\n- Introducing a presumption against using public spaces and parks for commercial purposes where there is not clear community support.\n- Making payment of the Real Living Wage a condition of any council contracts.\n- Starting a programme to build at least 25,000 council owned homes within 10 years, including enough accessible and larger family homes to meet need. We call on the Scottish Government to match fund the investment coming from tenants’ rents.\n- Requiring 35% of housing on development sites to be for council or housing association homes, with a target of 70% of these being for social rent.\n- Upgrade council homes to keep them warm and help reduce fuel bills, using organisations like the Edinburgh Solar Co-op and supply from renewable sources where possible. We will press the Scottish Government to match fund the investment being put in from rents.\n- Committing to making no more green belt land being allocated to development.\n- Press the Scottish Parliament to reform the planning system to give communities rights of appeal.\n- Increasing the pavement maintenance budget by 20%, increasing the active transport budget to 15% of the total transport budget.\n- Establishing a fast track repair service for dangerous pot holes.\n- Increasing the pedestrian crossing budget by 20%, and review timings to cut waiting time and ensure the less mobile have time to cross.\n- Reviewing winter gritting plans to ensure key walking routes to bus stops, schools, GP surgeries etc are prioritised.\n- Protecting and improving Edinburgh’s bus network. We will review all routes, oppose plans to remove bus stops and will invest in bus shelters. We will also ensure that all new buses provide space for both wheelchairs and buggies.\n- Committing to work in partnership with business and our neighbouring local authorities to find a solution to commuter parking, including improved public transport, park and ride schemes, restrictions on commuter street parking in residential areas, restricting parking spaces in new office developments and other measures to help meet our net zero carbon target.\n- Monitoring the introduction of low emission zones to ensure neighbouring areas are not affected by increased traffic and pollution.\nI hope that these commitments, and the others in the manifesto, will be at the heart of everything the city does over the next five years.",

This pride often switches to shame, however, when I see they are confronted with grubby streets, overflowing bins and potholed pavements.\nThere can be little doubt that Edinburgh is struggling to cope with its own popularity and, if we are not careful, what tourists come to see is at risk of being destroyed. No one was surprised when in July CNN Travel declared Edinburgh one of the world’s worst hotspots for “overtourism”.\nIndeed, in the city there has been growing concern about the privatisation of public space for private gain, with even the A-Board ban being lifted to allow festival advertising to be placed on jam-packed footpaths.\nIn my article last month, I raised concerns about how the Council was managing the growth in tourism. Since then, an opportunity has arisen within the Scottish Government’s Programme for Government. I was delighted to see that the Scottish Government has at last listened to the public and will at least now consult on giving Edinburgh the power to set a tourist tax. As ever, however, there was a catch. The Scottish Government say: “receipts will be to fund local authority expenditure on tourism.”\nI feel that denying Edinburgh the right to decide how the money is spent is insulting to local democracy. As a democrat, I want Edinburgh to have full control of its tourist tax revenue. If it is all to be spent on tourism, that should be Edinburgh’s decision and no one else’s.\nAt the very least, I feel the revenue should be invested in areas that benefit residents and visitors alike. If the tourist economy is to grow, it must grow geographically. Community projects like Colinton Tunnel Project (please visit the mural if you have not already done so), should be supported and promoted as ways of drawing tourists away from central Edinburgh to enjoy the better parts of our city(!). The extra money spent in these areas is far more likely to benefit Edinburgh residents than money spend elsewhere.",

One reported cut which has particular resonance in my ward is a proposal to close almost all of Edinburgh’s Public Toilets, including those in Colinton.\nThe Council Leader (Cllr Adam McVey, Leith Ward) claims that public toilets are generally in need of substantial investment and are the focus of crime.\nHe has clearly never had to “spend a penny” in Colinton. The village enjoys a relatively new building which is fully accessible and well used (not least by bus drivers). Council Officers have confirmed to me that there are no problems with them, and the Police have told me they can find no record of crime or anti-social behaviour linked to them.\nIt is an accepted fact that older people, people with disabilities, people with carers, women and children all have their lives limited by the current lack of public toilets in Edinburgh. Given that there is no shortage of these groups in Colinton, it is hard to understand the basis of the closure.\nRather than closing public toilets, we should be improving them across the city. I’d much rather Edinburgh was a place that was known for having clean and fully accessible public toilets where natures needs can be met and babies can be changed, rather than a place where men (mostly) were too often seen urinating in public.\nThese cuts are driven by political decisions made by the Scottish Government. They have chosen to disproportionately target local government, and ensure Edinburgh has Scotland’s lowest per capita funding settlement. That is their prerogative, but when the point is reached where the most vulnerable in society fall victim to their cuts it is surely time for a rethink.\nThat’s why I am delighted that Colinton Community Council has decided to run a campaign to save the village’s public toilets and I look forward to giving it my full support.",

The indyref2 threat has been hidden away and what’s left in its place is an intellectually incoherent set of policies cobbled together on the hoof.\nOn education, we have policies lifted from the Tories. Magically, by simply adding a saltire the Nationalists make the unacceptable acceptable.\nLikewise, Labour policies the SNP opposed just a few months ago are now in their Programme for Government. This includes Labour’s progressive policies on ending the pay cap, bringing ScotRail into public ownership and organ donation.\nOn one hand we are promised an SNP delivered end to the internal combustion engine, and on the other tax cuts will be awarded to airlines. This environmental incoherence is what happens when a government is driven only by a desire to grab headlines.\nLike a magpie, the Nationalists appear to have worked their way through Labour’s policy platform and taken all the shiny bits as their own. Free access to sanitary products, an end to rough sleeping, bus regulation, a Scottish Investment Bank, support for Frank’s Law and exploring how the basic income could work have all now been “adopted” by the SNP.\nImitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but this is beyond a joke. It’s what happens when a political elite is driven only by a hollow constitutional goal and not an underlying ideology.\nAlthough I welcome the SNP’s belated support for Labour policies, I do wonder about their ability to meaningfully implement them. One only has to look at the guddle they made of the baby box. In Finland the policy involved providing parents with lots of useful items in order to encourage them to engage fully with the healthcare system. The SNP went big on the giveaway element, but experts have questioned the lack of follow up support.\nI fear this is how their Programme for Government will progress – long on spin and gimmicks, but short on substance.",

Following this there has been a serious accident on the road at the junction with Redford Drive.\nMy survey of residents living along the route found that:\n- 88% said they were concerned about speeding on the road (see attached).\n- 5% said no safety improvements were needed.\n- 47% said they wanted better speed enforcement.\n- 61% wanted an improved pedestrian environment\n- 28% wanted a safer environment for cyclists.\nI have to stress that only 66 people took part in the survey, so actual local opinions may be stronger or weaker than these statistics suggest. Nonetheless, I think this quote from a local mum sums up what some people feel:\nVehicles speed up and down this road daily. It’s so concerning to me as I have a young family. We live [locally] and cars come off the Redford road and speed along daily, even at school drop off times when they are dropping their own kids at school.

Please note that the collision retrieval undertaken and any data provided is accurate as of 15 November 2021. The current collision history does not support the introduction of physical traffic calming measures at this location.\nOn the speed of vehicles, they say Redford Road will be included in a planned review:\n…we are undertaking a review of streets that have a 30mph speed limit and Redford Road will be considered as part of this process. Following the review, it is planned to carry out a public consultation on the proposals next year. The consultation will be promoted widely in the Press, on the Council website and on social media to raise awareness and encourage people to take part.\nI will ensure local people are kept involved with this process, and I will request that the promised review will consider the wider issues along the route.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_10_06_city-of-edinburgh-council-airbnb-briefing/content_156.html": "I have used Airbnb a few times. I do, however, recognise that in some contexts Airbnb (and similar) lets can cause problems for communities. This breifing outlines City of Edinburgh Council’s position.\nBackground\n- The Council is receiving increasing numbers of queries about the operation of domestic properties as short term lets, booked through the ‘Airbnb’ website. This briefing note is designed to cover the most frequently asked questions about ‘Airbnb’.\n- ‘Airbnb’ was founded in 2008 and its operations now cover many cities across the world including Edinburgh and London.\n- People seeking accommodation are able to use the website to book stays in residential properties as an alternative to a hotel or bed and breakfast.\nAre Airbnb regulated or licensed by the Council?\n- Airbnb and the home owners who take bookings via the website do not require permission from the Council to operate in this way. The Council licences ‘Houses in Multiple Occupation’, but short term lets are exempt as the property being let is not the main residence of the person making the booking.\nDoes the Council have any plans to introduce a licensing system for Airbnb?\n- The Council would be unable to introduce a licensing system for Airbnb under current legislation. The Scottish Parliament would need to introduce new legislation giving local authorities additional powers to license this activity.\nDoes the Council keep a register of homes which are let on the Airbnb website?\n- The owners do not require permission of the Council and therefore the Council would have no way of knowing which homes were being used in this way.\nWhat about responsibility for common repairs?\n- Any issue of common repairs remains the responsibility of the homeowner, irrespective of whether the property is let out via the website.\nDo let properties require Planning Permission?\n- Short Term Commercial Visitor Accommodation\nThe change of use from a residential property to short term commercial visitor accommodation may require planning permission. In deciding whether this is the case, regard will be had to:\n- The character of the new use and of the wider area\n- The size of the property\n- The pattern of activity associated with the use, including numbers of occupants, the period of use, issues of noise, disturbance and parking demand, and\n- The nature and character of any services provided.\nFor example, a flat rented out for one week with perhaps one bedroom may be viewed as ‘residential’, whereas a three bedroomed flat allowing short stays of two or three nights has the potential to cause more of an impact on local amenity, and so might be seen as ‘short stay commercial’. Each has to be decided on a case by case basis as to whether it requires planning permission\nIs there any regulation of Airbnb by the Council?\n- Trading Standards may have a role under The Consumer Rights Act 2015 if the property is being rented from someone shown to be carrying on a business. If the property is being rented from a private individual then the Act may not apply. Each case would need considered on the facts of the case.\nWhat should I do if I am disturbed by antisocial behaviour or noise from guests within a property let out via the Airbnb website?\n- Residents suffering any antisocial behaviour should report this to the Council on 0131 200 2000 or Police Scotland on 101. The Antisocial Behaviour Scotland Act 2004 includes powers to deal with problems from short term lets.\nDo let properties have to pay business rates or Council tax?\n- If the property is the sole or main residence the occupier can let it out to up to six people and the entry would remain on Council Tax as a domestic entry. If the property is not the sole or main residence, or is let out to more than six people, the entry would be valued as a commercial property. Each case is considered on its merits, and if necessary information passed to the Valuation Board.\nWhat action has the Council taken on these concerns?\n- In March 2017 the Corporate Policy and Strategy Committee considered a report on Short Term Lets in the City. The Committee agreed to call on the Scottish Government to increase the powers available to local authorities to manage these, by introducing a licensing system or strengthening planning restrictions. This report includes the data currently available to the Council.\nThe Minister for Local Government and Housing has responded to the council’s request by noting that the Expert Working Group on the Collaborative Economy, set up by the Scottish Government, is considering short term lets as part of its remit. That group is due to make recommendations to Scottish Ministers by the end of 2017. The minister expects the report to include recommendations on ‘how Scotland can take advantage of the opportunities of the collaborative economy and overcome any regulatory, economic and social challenges’.\nThe Council’s Regulatory Services Manager provided the Expert Working Group with a detailed submission in June 2017 at an evidence session on Short Term Lets. Details of this session can be found in the blog below.\nhttps://blogs.gov.scot/scotlands-economy/2017/07/07/collaborate-celebrate-scotland-offer/\nAn update report to the Corporate Policy and Strategy Committee will be submitted later this year.",

This follows claims that SNP ministers dismissed council workers as ‘not on par‘ with health workers in pay talks. Indeed, SNP Councillors across Scotland are great at paying lip service to the work Council staff have undertaken throughout the pandemic, but when push came to shove at COSLA in May they voted AGAINST a fair pay rise for staff – they put party loyalty before teachers and other Council staff.\nThe SNP/Green Government need to engage with trade unions in good faith and negotiate a fair pay deal.\nIntroduction\nThe purpose of this briefing is to update members on the current status of national pay negotiations for local government employees and the possibility of industrial action arising from this.\nBackground\nThe joint trade unions for local government employees (UNISON, GMB and Unite the Union) recently voted to reject the revised national pay offer presented by CoSLA on behalf of Local Authorities.\nWhilst negotiations are continuing, Unite the Union and the GMB are currently undertaking consultative ballots with their members and, as of 23 August 2021, we have received formal notification from UNISON that they are intending to issue voting papers to their members on\n1 September 2021 to ballot them on whether or not they are prepared to take part in strike action.\nMain Points\n- The joint trade unions for local government employees (UNISON, GMB and Unite the Union) recently voted to reject the revised national pay offer presented by CoSLA. Whilst negotiations are continuing, in the absence of an agreement the joint unions are undertaking ballots with their members.\n- UNISON will be issuing a ballot to their members on 1 September 2021 balloting members on whether they are prepared to take part in strike action (yes/no answer). This ballot will close on 22 September 2021. The period during which any strike action can take place covers from 6 October 2021 to 21 March 2022. The UNISON ballot for strike action also specifies that the members they are specifically seeking to involve in the proposed action would cover employees working in school cleaning, school catering and waste and cleansing services.\n- Both Unite the Union and the GMB are currently undertaking a consultative ballot with their members as to whether or not the pay offer should be accepted. The result of this will determine their next steps and whether they too issue a ballot for strike action.\n- Before any industrial action can be taken, certain ballot thresholds need to be met to comply with employment law provisions:\n1. At least 50% of members covered by the ballot need to vote;\n2. A simple majority of those who voted must be in favour of industrial action; and,\n3. In certain important public services, the level of support required must be at least 40% of total members entitled to vote.\n- If certain Council employees were to strike this could seriously and adversely affect vulnerable children and adults, or anyone receiving certain key public services. Trade unions are required to provide lists of categories of employees whom they reasonably believe will be asked to take part in any proposed industrial action.\n- As an employer, we are collating a list of roles we believe should be exempted from participating in industrial action and if agreed, the unions can grant ‘life and limb’ exemptions from strike action. Simple ‘inconvenience’ is not an acceptable reason for requesting exemptions, but rather where there is genuine concern surrounding risk to vulnerable service users or critical public services. “Life and limb” cover would typically include areas such as residential homes for children and the elderly, emergency duty social work, etc.\n- A cross organisational working group of officers led by the Service Director: Human Resources has been established to ensure we have resilience and communication plans in place to respond accordingly.\n- Discussions with the City of Edinburgh Council Trade Unions Branches and relevant Regional Officials locally will be continuing. However, member attention is drawn to the fact that, as a result of the current national position, the City of Edinburgh Council UNISON Branch has withdrawn from local discussions which were underway to explore opportunities for reform and change in respect of pay and terms and conditions of service, following the successful consolidation of Scottish Local Government Living Wage earlier this year.\n- CoSLA Leaders will meet next on 27 August where the position on the national pay negotiations will be discussed further.\n- Further briefing notes will be provided to elected members to update on this situation as it develops.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_06_20_south-west-schools-whats-next/content_654.html": "The news that the proposed merger of Currie Community High School and Wester Hailes Education Centre has been binned is fantastic. This decision only impacts on a tiny part of my Ward, but it is hugely important for the children that live there (now and in the future).\nAbandoning the ill-considered merger and investing in the schools at their current sites is right because it means everything that is special about them can be protected, but we can invest in making them even better.\nThe focus now must, however, be on reimagining WHEC to ensure every child in its catchment can reach their full potential. Rebuilding WHEC alone won’t do that, we have to invest in nursery and primary education feeder routes, and establish links with the college and university on its doorstep.\nThis partnership is important as the attainment gap can’t be solved in high school alone – that was the folly at the heart of the argument for the doomed merger. Early years and primary education is where the real work needs to be done. We should be using high school to amplify those gains, and I feel working with local colleges and universities is key to that. Indeed, I’ve already had informal chats with an Edinburgh university about how they can work with WHEC.\nAlthough protecting CCHS and WHEC was always the right decision, reaching that point has taken longer than needed and caused more upset than necessary. The hard part, however, is finding the money to regenerate these schools and others in Edinburgh like Liberton High. The Scottish Government have delayed releasing funds again and again – the latest is that an “announcement” may be made at the end of the year, but there is still no guarantee of funding.\nI have therefore written to every Councillor in Edinburgh asking them to have their party’s MSPs stand up for Edinburgh and make the case for investing in our schools – not least Gordon MacDonald MSP who represents the Currie / Wester Hailes area. I have also asked that all the Edinburgh Council Group leaders write as one to John Swinney demanding that funding be made available.",

A fifth option has also been introduced – “Bi-directional cycle lanes (north side) & road remains open. Similar layout to Option 1 with core section operating as bi-directional route”. Although the scheme is being proposed in an effort to “help pedestrians and cyclists travel and exercise safely while meeting physical distancing requirements“, the precise issue it is trying to address is not clear. Full details and plans below.\nExisting Layout\nBraid Hills Drive in the South of the city is a two-way single carriageway country road connecting Liberton Brae in the East and Comiston Road in the west. It is 3.3km long and the vast majority of it is fronted by the open grassy slopes of Braid Hills. At either end there are short stretches of residential streets. On the north side, overlooking the city is a 3.2m wide footway. On the south side there is no footway. The carriageway is severely cambered making the first 1.0 to 1.5m of either edge inappropriate for cycling.\nThere are no existing dedicated cycleways on Braid Hills Drive. No public buses use Braid Hills Drive.\nSummary of Proposal\nThis scheme is part of overall emergency measures in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, that re-designates key parts of the road network to help pedestrians and cyclists travel and exercise safely while meeting physical distancing requirements. It is proposed to improve the environment for cyclists in what is, at present, a car dominated layout. Carriageway space will potentially be reduced wherever possible and segregated cycle ways implemented with options to close sections of Braid Hills Drive / Road. The intended outcome of this is to provide safer spaces for local communities to exercise whilst social distancing as well as providing cycling connections to key local destinations.\nFive design options are now suggested:\n- Braid Hills Road / Drive remain open to vehicular traffic and segregated, unidirectional cycle lanes are provided. The segregated cycle lanes would be provided from the junction of Braid Road / Braid Hills Road to the junction of Liberton Road / Liberton Brae.\n- Provision of segregated, uni-directional cycle lanes from the junction of Braid Road / Braid Hills Road to a closure point just east of the junction with Braid Hills Avenue. A closure point will also exist at the junction of Braid Farm Road and Braid Hills Road. From here Braid Hills Road / Drive would remain closed until the junction with Liberton Tower Lane. East of this closure point a segregated, bi-directional cycle lane will be provided on the southern edge of the carriageway until the junction with Alwickhill Road and east of this, segregated, uni-directional cycle lanes will be provided until the junction with Liberton Brae.\n- A closure point will be situated on Braid Hills Road just east of the junction with Braid Hills Avenue. A closure point will also exist at the junction of Braid Farm Road and Braid Hills Road. From here Braid Hills Road / Drive will remain closed until the junction with Liberton Tower Lane. East of this closure point a segregated, bi-directional cycle lane will be provided on the southern edge of the carriageway until the junction with Alwickhill Road where the scheme will terminate.\n- As above closure points will be created at Braid Hills Road east of the junction with Braid Hills Avenue. A closure point will also exist at the junction of Braid Farm Road and Braid Hills Road. From here Braid Hills Road / Drive will remain closed until the junction with Liberton Tower Lane.\n- The fifth option is to introduce a bi-directional segregated cyclelane adjacent to the north kerbline over the majority of the route. In this option no road closure is necessary, however, entry and exit arrangements at each end are still to be determined.\nSubject to approval the detailed design would be considered at the Design Review Group, subject to Stakeholder Notification.\nPlans",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_03_02_shooting-for-the-moon-thoughts-on-taking-the-trams-to-newhaven-in-a-binary-political-world_comment-page-1/content_705.html": "Below are my current views, thoughts and concerns on the plan to complete the tramline to Newhaven – the “Newhaven Proposal”. I am not expecting everyone to agree with me, but I hope people will respect the fact that I have thought about it before reaching a view.\nWe apparently live in a binary world. People are Yes or No. They are Leave or Remain. In Edinburgh, they are either for or against completing the tramline to Newhaven.\nThe reality is different, however. Just like on many other binary arguments, most people are stuck in the middle between hardcore “extremists” on the tram debate. On one side we have people that want to extend the line at any cost, and on the other we have those that oppose it ideologically no matter what the benefits. For those groups, it’s an easy decision and those that oppose them just don’t get it. I actually envy their certainty.\nThat’s why it’s worth looking at the Final Business Case (FBC) prepared by the Council on extending the tram. It makes the case for the project, but it does so in a way that acknowledges the uncertainties and risks. It makes clear that what is needed is a considered judgment, not a knee-jerk decision.\nThe headline cost is £207.3m – this includes the Capital costs to completion (£156.7m), Support for business (£1.9m), Development costs (£5.5m), Risk (£31.9m) and Optimism Bias (£11.9m). It is acknowledged, however, that there is a 20% chance that the project costs will exceed £207.3m. Indeed, a more conservative approach to assessing the potential for the project to go over budget suggests there is 20% chance of the project costs exceeding £257.3m(!), and a 5% chance of it exceeding £334.8m(!!).\nThe Council Officers should be congratulated for presenting the costs in this way. They have chosen not to simply put a price ticket on it, but instead have sought to communicate the uncertainty in a responsible manner. The clear aim is to deliver the project for £207.3m, but their approach is clear that there is a 1 in 5 chance of a cost overrun.\nNonetheless, even if the project does hit £257.3m it is still estimated to deliver £1.25 of benefit for every £1 spent – i.e. a Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) of 1.25 . If the final cost is £207.3m, the BCR is 1.4. Whilst this is positive, a BCR of 1.25-1.4 is technically “low value for money“.\nAlthough it is hard to compare the proposal with other projects as a lot of work had already been undertaken on the extension route (2007-14), it is in line with other light rail/tram projects such as Nottingham Express Transit Extension (BCR = 2), Leeds Supertram (BCR = 2.0), Sydney Light Rail (BCR = 0.8), Newcastle (Australia, BCR = 0.5), Forrestfield Airport Link (BCR = 1.4 ) and ACT Capital Metro (BCR = 0.5).\nWith all the focus on costs, it is important to remember that this project will deliver significant benefits. Leith is one of the most densely populated and deprived areas in Scotland and it is already congested. Making it easier to move people around is key to developing brownfield sites in northern Edinburgh. The tram will link these key development sites with key employment areas (City Centre, Edinburgh Park and the Airport). Let me be clear, developing these brownfield sites in north Edinburgh will take pressure off the greenbelt in my Ward (Colinton-Oxgangs-Fairmilehead).\nSince 2016 the city has been planning for an additional 47,000 people by 2024, and an additional 102,000 by 2039, taking the total population from 492,610 to 594,712 over the 25-year period from 2014 to 2039.\nThis is a breath-taking pace, and such a pace cannot help but create new ills as it dispels old, new ignorance, new problems and new dangers. So it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest, to wait. But our city was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them.\nThe question is how we accommodate this growth, and it can’t be done by expecting everyone to drive around our capital. We have one of the UK’s best bus services, but is needs to improve. In parallel, we need to improve safety for those that are able to travel by foot and bike – particularly for children going to school. We can and must do all these things, but the FBC makes the case for the tram being the best way to add capacity for the congested route to Newhaven. Without it, the FBC is clear that congestion and pollution will constrain economic development.\nWhilst these arguments hold water, the Edinburgh Tram has a troubled history. We once had an excellent network (many buses cover the same routes today), but the most recent incarnation has been a national embarrassment. A mixture of schoolboy errors and poor governance structures led to Edinburgh getting a fraction of the expected line at a much higher cost (from £375 million to the final £776m) than was ever feared. As a result, in 2014 the SNP Government set up the Hardie Inquiry in to the shambles, with Alex Salmond claiming with his customary bravado it would be “swift and thorough” and would cost an estimated £1m. Almost 5 years later it has still to report, and the costs look likely to exceed the £10.2m the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq War cost. All this may well be legitimate, but it feels like insult is being added to injury.\nThe monumental disaster we witnessed on our streets between July 2007 and May 2014 has three direct impacts on the proposal to complete the line to Newhaven:\n- The public lost trust in the Council. This means that the Newhaven Proposal has come under significant scrutiny by a sceptical public and a new intake of Councillors. Whilst the Tram Team has welcomed the feedback, it is notable that other larger items of expenditure are subject to a far lower level of scrutiny (e.g. I have seen no questions about the £874.112m planned spend on Council Housing in Edinburgh over the next 5 years, or the £200m the Council plans to invest in schools).\n- Lesson were learned by the Council. Unlike the 2007 project, the Newhaven Proposal will use standard contracts, the project team will have light rail experience, roads will only be closed once, robust quantitative risk analysis has been undertaken and there has been significant community engagement. It is important to note that Turner & Townsend was appointed by Edinburgh City Council to manage the project after Transport Initiatives Edinburgh was disbanded in August 2011, and after the 2012 Council elections a Labour led Council replaced the SNP/LibDem Coalition – this meant political control of the project fell to Councillor Lesley Hinds (not a passive character). Not only did she demand that the Scottish Government allow concessionary tram travel for Edinburgh’s older citizens, she had oversight of the project whilst it continued mostly on schedule and budget. Although Lesley Hinds has retired, the core Tram Team she worked with 2012-14 is behind the Newhaven Proposal and the FBC.\n- Safety issues for pedestrians and cyclists are now better understood. There has been a great deal of focus on improving safety along the existing line, and those lessons have been reflected in the Newhaven Proposal. It is notable that there has been significant constructive engagement with Community Councils, Ward Councillors, Living Streets Edinburgh and SPOKES about the detailed design of the public areas around the route. Whilst I don’t expect any of these groups are absolutely happy, I think all will agree there have been significant improvements over the original proposals (I was clear that I could not support these).\nAlthough the case for backing the Newhaven Proposal does, on balance, have some merit I do still have concerns, and these are detailed below.\n- Optimism Bias – Although the people behind big projects are highly rational and logical, it is recognised that the human brain is sometimes too optimistic for its own good – something we all suffer from at times! To counter this, a 6% “Optimism Bias” has been added to the project. Although this equates to £11.9m, it is at the very bottom of the 6%-66% range recommended for “Non-standard Civil Engineering” projects. It is argued that this is because the project is at an advanced stage and many lessons have been learned from the 2007-14 debacle. However, there are two significant unknowns that could have real impact on the project: the “swift and thorough” Hardie Inquiry recommendations; and, the ongoing Brexit shambles.\nAlthough the Hardie Inquiry are recommendations considered in the FBC as an unknown cost, there is no mention of Brexit. An earlier version of the FBC (AKA the Outline Business Case) made this comment: “…there is a risk that uncontrollable economic and market factors adversely affect the type, structure and overall cost of borrowing the Council is able to gain access to. Two significant events that are likely to be a factor in this are the impact of Brexit and the announcement and timing of any potential second Scottish Independence Referendum.” In a review of the FBC for the Council, Scott-Moncreiff say the Tram Team “has excluded uncertainty surrounding Brexit from its Quantitative Risk Analysis over the construction costs and the potential impact of Brexit has not specifically been referred to within the FBC or financial model.”. - Sensitivity Analysis – The FBC considers the “sensitivity” of the project finances, by varying key parameters (such as travel time and economic development) and assessing the impact on the BCR. The analysis, as presented, only varies these parameters one at a time in simple “what if” scenarios and does not consider outcomes where two or more parameters vary. Scott-Moncreiff made this comment: “We note that the FBC analyses the sensitivity of each of these components individually, and does not consider the cumulative impact of more than one of these components.”\n- Environmental Impact Statement – This apparently has not been updated since 2003 and the FBC makes the point that earlier work “implicitly suggests” that there were no “unacceptable” environmental impacts. This is hardly reassuring.\n- Strategic Support – The project is of strategic importance to Scotland’s capital and the wider region, yet the Council is expected to fund it with no support from the Scottish Government. Additionally, Transport Scotland have made no comment on the FBC (nor has comment been sought). I find this highly questionable, particularly when this is seen within the context of the £125m the Scottish Government gave the Council (without it even asking) in the City Deal to upgrade Sheriffhall Roundabout.\n- Lothian Buses – The £207.3m for the project will be funded by ticket income from the new/existing line and a £20m (£2m per year for 10 years) exceptional dividend from Lothian Buses. There is concern that the impact of paying the exceptional dividend combined with losing passenger income along the Newhaven line will place undue pressure on Lothian Buses.\n- Alternative Projects – Although it should be noted that the Newhaven Proposal should put no demand on existing council budgets, it is true that the ticket income and exceptional dividend could be spent in other ways with the aim of delivering similar benefits, perhaps on a wider scale. The aim of this project appears to have been focused on extending the line, rather than delivering the benefits associated with it.\nConclusion\nIn summation, I hope I have shown the project does have significant benefits and a degree of uncertainty associated with it, but how those are balanced is tainted by the 2007-11 segment of the 2007-14 project. What is clear, however, is that there is a need to cut congestion and stimulate development in the north of Edinburgh, and right now completing the tramline to Newhaven appears to be the best way of doing that. I say that accepting that the £207.3m target price (BCR = 1.4) has a 1 in 5 chance of being exceeded, but in the knowledge that the Council has a £50m contingency in place if needed (BCR = 1.25).\nNote\nThe full set of CEC papers on the Newhaven Proposal are here.",

It will act as a gateway to Edinburgh’s World Heritage Site, and will also set the tone for the kind of city we want our Capital to be.\nEdinburgh is a growing city. By 2050 it will have grown by 25% and it is important that this growth is undertaken in a way that maintains, or ideally improves, the quality of life we currently enjoy. Indeed, Edinburgh must be a liveable city. That means governance, healthcare provision, culture, environment, education and infrastructure must all contribute to a good quality of life.\nPicardy Place is a key part of this. It can’t be designed purely to meet the needs of developers. That would be just as silly as designing it just to meet the needs of motorists. It must be designed for people – jobs, walking, cycling, driving, public transport, culture and wellbeing.\nOn reading Tory Councillor John McLellan’s views on Picardy Place I can only assume that the rumours are correct about him visiting the St James Quarter developer just before Christmas. He focuses on their view, and seeks to represent the problem as being a battle between unnamed “investors” and the City of Edinburgh Council (Opinion, 28/12/17). Incredibly, he’s critical of Councillors like myself and Karen Doran who dare to listen to the views of residents to ensure Picardy Place meets their needs and aspirations. Unbelievable.\nI’d advise Cllr McLellan to spend less time hobnobbing with developers and more time listening to the people that elected him and his chums to the City Chambers. A more balanced view, would actually help inform the debate and ensure we get this key decision right.\nMy feeling is that we should do all we can to engage everyone in a positive conversation about what’s possible. One that seeks to integrate Picardy Place and the St James Quarter into the wider discussion about ensuring Edinburgh remains one of Europe’s greatest capitals. The discussion needs to focus on more than the movement of cars and the needs of developers. We need to think about place making, wellbeing and the economy. We need to think holistically about ensuring Edinburgh is a liveable city.",

Special uplifts will also resume.\nIntroduction\nWe’re reopening all our recycling centres from Monday 1 June on an appointment only basis and restarting the special uplift service.\nThese services were suspended in March due to staff shortages and physical distancing requirements but with enough crew members now available and physical distancing arrangements in place, recycling centres can reopen and special uplift collections can resume safely. However, note that there will be changes to the way in which they are managed.\nRecycling centres\nRecycling centres will reopen on an appointment only basis on Monday 1 June. Residents will need to book a time slot using a new online booking system on our website, which will be available from the afternoon of Thursday 28 May. Our contact centre staff are continuing to focus on emergency calls so it won’t be possible to book an appointment over the phone.\nWe’re expecting our sites to be busy and the booking system will help to minimise crowding and help staff and customers to maintain physical distancing.\nTraffic management systems will be put in place at each location to help manage queues. This includes reverting to the old entrance at our Seafield recycling centre on Fillyside Road for the first three weeks. We’re writing to local residents who may be affected to advise them of this and the temporary local diversions and road closures which will be in place.\nTraffic management signage will also be in place in streets around all sites as well as signs to ensure residents are aware that they must book an appointment to use a recycling centre.\nFurther guidance:\n- Only residents of Edinburgh can book an appointment. When doing so, they should consider:\n- if their visit is necessary\n- if they can store their waste safely at home.\n- They should be prepared to queue before entering the site.\n- Only cars are permitted – no vans or trailers.\n- Our staff won’t be able to help unload cars at the site, so people should plan to only bring what they can carry.\n- We may need to close our sites at short notice.\n- Anyone who turns up without a booking will be turned away.\nTime slots are available on a first come, first served basis and anyone who turns up without a booking will be turned away.\nAppointments are limited to one per household for the first two weeks of re-opening.\nSpecial uplifts\nWe’re restarting our special uplift service on 1 June and will be accepting online bookings for the collection of bulky items from Thursday 28 May with a maximum of five items per household.\nTo ensure the safety of our crews and the public, we won’t be able to collect any items from inside homes.\nThe special uplift service is expected to be busy during the first few weeks, so there may be a wait for collections – please check the council website for updates.\nResidents can book an uplift on our website though not currently over the phone – allowing our contact centre staff to deal with emergency calls.

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_09_05_briefing-planned-temporary-closure-of-bridge-road-colinton/content_463.html": "Below is a briefings from SGN on the planned temporary closure of Bridge Road in Colinton. This issue will be discussed at the September Colinton Community Council meeting (7:30pm on the 10th of Sept in Colinton Bowling Club).\nAnswers to five questions I posed to the Council:\n1. What will the impact on traffic be?\nHas this been quantified? There is likely to be increased traffic flow on the diversion route, particularly at Craiglockhart Avenue, but unfortunately there is no alternative diversion route available. The closure is a necessity due to the location of their main and to allow a safe working zone. Closing the road will also allow them to get through this section quicker, and they have agreed to work 7am to 7pm 7 days a week.\n2. What will the likely extra journey times for buses will be?\nI’ll contact Lothian buses for this info and get back to you.\n3. Will cyclists and pedestrians still be able to pass through the area?\nCyclists will likely be required to safely dismount. Pedestrians will have access at all times.\n4. Will arrangements for deliveries and support for businesses be put in place?\nYes, these will be discussed when SGN visit the local businesses prior to commencement. They are hoping to speak to businesses before the Community Council meeting next Tuesday.\n5. Will the parking restrictions also apply to “blue badge” holders\nYes.\nFrom Caroline Lawrie, SGN Stakeholder and Community Manager:\nAs you are aware, SGN manages the network that distributes natural and green gas to 5.9 million homes and businesses across Scotland and the south of England. We also provide the gas emergency service in these areas.\nWe’re investing £438,000 to upgrade our gas network in the Bridge Road area of Colinton in Edinburgh.\nThis essential project involves replacing our old gas mains with new plastic pipe to ensure a continued safe and reliable gas supply for the local area for many years to come.\nWe’ve worked closely with the local authorities in planning our project. Our work will start on Saturday 12 October and will finish in early Spring 2020.\nDuring this project it will be necessary to close the following streets to ensure everyone’s safety:\n- Bridge Road, Edinburgh 12 October 2019 for approximately 4 weeks\n- Westgarth Avenue, Edinburgh 28 October 2019 for approximately 6 weeks\n- Redford Road, Edinburgh 07 January 2020 for approximately 10 weeks\nSigned local diversion routes will be in place for motorists during the road closures, and local access will be maintained for residents. Where possible, the phases of this project have been planned to coincide with school holidays, and when traffic is likely to be quieter, ensuring disruption is kept to a minimum.\nWe’ll also need to use temporary traffic lights during various stages of the project. These will be manually controlled during peak times to minimise disruption as much as possible.\nSome parking suspensions will also be in place, although access to driveways will always be maintained where possible.\nWe’ll be working Monday to Friday between 8am – 4pm, and at weekends where required. We know that this is a busy area and wish to assure you that work will progress as quickly as possible and we’ll be doing everything we can to limit delays and disruption.\nWe will post regular updates on our website and using social media and traffic bulletins to keep everyone informed.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_10_15_assisted-uplift-service-under-review-in-edinburgh/content_98.html": "Below are details of the Council’s plans to review the assisted uplift service in Edinburgh. They plan to write to some of the most vulnerable people in Edinburgh to ask if they still need the service. I am really concerned about this, and have asked if the process has been approved by the Transport & Environment Committee.\nThis does not feel like the best time to be worrying some of Edinburgh’s most vulnerable people about potentially removing this valuable service. Indeed, I hope equal effort is invested in raising awareness of the service so more people can make use of it.\nBriefing\nI am contacting you to inform you that the Waste and Cleansing Service is undertaking a review of our residents who are registered as having an assisted collection.\nAs you may be aware the service is designed to help where members of a household are physically unable to move wheeled bins or boxes to the kerbside for us to collect. Our crews collect, empty and return a residents bin(s) to a storage position at an agreed location within the boundaries of their property. We can arrange for an assisted collection on a temporary basis (6 months), or on a long-term basis depending on their specific circumstances.\nThere are currently around 7500 existing assisted collections and there has not been a review of these for a number of years. We believe there may some which are no longer required but we have not been informed of the change. Therefore we are checking whether resident still requires the service and gathering information which help us contact them in the future. A DPIA has been completed and all personal information gathered in this exercise will be handled carefully and in accordance with the relevant legislation.\nA letter will be sent out to each address that currently receives an assisted collection this week, a copy of the letter is attached. The letter asks if the assisted collection is still required and requests that the resident (or resident’s carer) fills in the form and returns it to us in a prepaid envelope.\nWe allow 15 working days for a response, for those who do not respond we will send out a reminder letter in November. If we have had no response we will assume they no longer the service and they will be removed but this will not be done until after the New Year.\nIf you require any further information please let me know.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_01_25_an-immortal-memory-why-burns-values-should-shape-scotland/content_102.html": "I have to concede that I don’t know a great deal about Burns. I know he was born in 1759 in Alloway and died just 37 years later in Dumfries. I know he wrote poems and songs, but that’s about it. So in drafting this blog I wanted to learn more about the man and how he has influenced modern Scotland. To do this we have to look at when Burns lived and his values.\nJust 50 or so years before his birth, the Act of Union had taken place. Scotland had joined with England. England had 5 times the population and 36 times the wealth. Scotland did not have equal riches, but Scots became equal partners. Amongst the benefits Scotland brought to the table was education. As well as a literate general population, we had a highly developed university system – five universities, to England’s two.\nBy the time Burns was born, Scotland was successfully combining its educated population with English gold to create the Scottish Enlightenment. Indeed, he was to be a key part of this intellectual movement. This movement, combined with our protestant work ethic, enabled Scotland to punch above its weight and become more affluent. However, much of the “punching” took place in the Empire, and focused on tobacco and slavery.\nWe should not pretend that by the time of Burns’ birth everyone was happy with the union in Scotland. After all, the 1715 Jacobite rebellion would have been within living memory and his parents would have lived through the 1745 rebellion. Indeed, his grandfather is likely to have lived through both uprisings.\nGiven that Burns’ family no doubt discussed these events, it is tempting to wonder what he made of Scotland’s constitutional position. It is notable, however, that in over 600 works published by Burns there is hardly a mention of the Jacobite rebellion. His attachment to the Jacobite cause was purely sentimental, and he had no desire to see the restoration of the Stuart monarchy. Furthermore, as Alex Salmond once said, “No-one should ever try to pigeon-hole Burns into party politics because he was far too big for that”. Nonetheless, Mr Salmond did go on to suggest that Burns would have voted Yes in the referendum because “From tip to toe, Robert Burns was a 100% Scottish patriot” – as if one can’t be a patriotic Scot and oppose the will of Alex Salmond.\nThe problem Mr Salmond faced was that although he could extend the referendum franchise to 16 and 17 year olds, allowing the dead of the 18th century to vote was beyond even his abilities! Furthermore, we can’t imagine what Burns would make of Scotland today and our ruling class in Holyrood. More interesting than how Burns would have voted in the referendum is how he influenced politics today.\nSo what were Burns’ values? For the Burns family the 1745 rebellion coincided with his grandfather taking on the lease of a farm. When the farm encountered financial problems just two years later, Burns’ father moved to Edinburgh where he worked for two years landscaping gardens in the area now known as “The Meadows”. In 1750 he moved to Ayrshire and worked as a gardener until 1786. He then became a head gardener and leased seven acres of land at Alloway where he built the cottage which was later the birthplace of Burns.\nSo Burns would have grown up in a household which knew what hard work was, but he would also have been familiar with the wealth of the laird. At the same time the world was also changing more in the second half of the 18th century than Scotland had in the first:\n- Britain became the dominant power on earth.\n- The slave trade began to crumble (Burns was almost part of it)\n- America fought an 8 year war of independence (messy, but perhaps quicker than a “once in a lifetime” referendum).\n- Australia was discovered (or perhaps rediscovered).\n- The French revolution took place.\nJust as the world was changing, so was Scotland:\n- Wearing tartan and the kilt was again legal.\n- The Forth-Clyde Canal was opened.\n- Scotland’s first proper lighthouse was built.\nIn the 18th century the opening of the Forth-Clyde Canal and the construction of lighthouse at Kinnaird Head would have been massive engineering endeavours. Thanks to good maintenance, we still benefit from them today.\nLike many other Scots, Burns worked hard and sought a better life for himself. He moved from farmer to mill worker to white collar tax collector. This experience, and that of growing up on a farm, would have shaped him more than anything, and this is reflected in his works. Burns reports and reflects on the lives of ordinary Scots, and freely insults and attacks the privileged in society – the clergy, the wealthy and government employees like himself. On politicians he said, “all would rule, but none obey”.\nIndeed his sympathies for Wallace, Bruce and the French Revolution were all rooted in his opposition to tyranny and the subjugation of the poor.\nEven if we look at a Burns poem which we all learn at school, To a Mouse, we find that it offers more than meets the eye. On the surface it tells the story of a mouse whose home has been destroyed by a ploughman. However, is also a depiction of how the ordinary man is equally vulnerable to external forces. As a tenant farmer, Burns was particularly aware that the best laid plans of mice and men may often go wrong. However, man suffers even more through worry than the mouse which apparently only lives in the moment.\nIt is this perspective that led to UNESCO declaring Burns the world’s first ‘people’s poet’ because he began the practice of writing poetry, prose and songs about the commonplace experiences of the poor.\nPeople as diverse as Bob Dylan and Colin Fox, the SSP leader, claim Burns inspired them. I disagree with Fox on many issues, but I don’t doubt his commitment to fairness and equality. But when we look at impact of Burns on society, towering above both Fox and Dylan is Keir Hardie – the man who started the democratic revolution that delivered the NHS and the welfare state. Hardie said that he owed more to Burns “than any man alive or dead”. Indeed, Hardie rejected Marxism in favour of a humane and popular approach to politics that came out of his Christianity and the works of Burns. Referring to the ideas of humanity and equality found in the works of Burns, Hardie told a friend that “Burns point of view” was superior to a socialism of “German formulas” (Marx).\nSo in conclusion, we in Scotland should be proud of the way Burns has influenced political thinking and his role in inspiring the likes of Hardie. However, I would say that we should perhaps concern ourselves less about what Burns would have thought about Scottish independence and more about his values and how they can continue to shape Scotland to meet the needs of ordinary Scots. The problem we face is that Scotland’s ruling political elite, and I include all the media in that, find the constitutional politics more interesting than the job of making Scotland a fairer and more equal society.\nTherefore, in toasting the immortal memory of Rabbie Burns next week we should pay tribute not only to the passion and power of his work, but we must acknowledge that as Scots we owe him a debt of gratitude for impact he has had, and continues to have, on our great country.",

During my election campaign I raised concerns about how it was being implemented and as I was not quite “on message” copies of my leaflet were reproduced in the Evening News (something I was not absolutely unhappy about!).\nNow that the scheme is almost a year old, however, the Council is reviewing it with the aim of producing a report in the summer. I was concerned about the public response to the review (now closed), so I set up my own survey to collect Ward 8 opinion. It is not representative, but some of the questions raised are interesting.\nIn total a little under 200 people took part – 59% were female. In total a whopping 54% of those that took part said they were opposed to the scheme from day one (30% were supportive and 16% were unsure). Furthermore, now that it is implemented, opposition is still sitting at 54% but the number of people who are supportive is now 40%.\nThis result, however, hides one factor – women were slightly less likely to oppose the scheme – only 49% did so (46% were supportive).\nIt is important not to stereotype those who are against the scheme as somehow being against road safety in general. Some said they wanted safer streets around schools and more said they wanted key 40 mph roads reduced to 30 mph (Lanark Road, Comiston Road/Buckstone Terrance/A702 were mentioned repeatedly). Despite being against the 20 mph scheme, several respondents also noted that Oxgangs Avenue should be reduced to 20 mph. Like the A702 and Lanark Road, Oxgangs Avenue is a road which physically divides a community, and makes it harder for young children to walk safely to school and/or local parks.\nIn summary, whilst the 20 mph scheme may remain unpopular, in many households support is growing. Furthermore, even those that still have concerns feel there is more to be done to make our capital’s streets safer.",

The local walking campaign, Living Streets Edinburgh Group [1], has discovered through a Freedom of Information request by one of its members [2] that the Council plans to introduce 1,206 more parking spaces on city centre streets. The campaigners say that this will undermine confidence in the ability to deliver a safer, cleaner city, its Convenor, Don McKee, commenting:\n‘We’ve been strongly supportive of the Council’s visionary plans for a more walking-friendly city centre. But this revelation – adding the equivalent of 5.5 kilometres of car parking space on our streets – is either breathtakingly hypocritical or it suggests that the Council’s left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is trying to do.’\n‘Extra parking takes valuable public space away from walking, cycling and buses – and it means more traffic on the roads, directly conflicting with the Council’s stated vision. Yet walking is designated as the top priority in the Scottish Government’s planning policies [3]. It’s time for the Council to properly recognise this in its programmes and projects for the city. ‘Business as usual’ – with the car as king – is simply not an option when we’re trying to tackle the climate emergency.’\nAnalysis of the FoI reply indicates that parking spaces in some streets will be boosted far beyond the 12% average – examples being Grove Street (30%), Mayfield Terrace (34%) and Blenheim Place (38%). Full street-by-street details can be found here: http://bit.ly/3bm3yq3\nNOTES FOR EDITORS:\n[1] Living Streets Edinburgh Group is the local volunteer arm of Living Streets, the national charity for ‘everyday walking’, see: http://www.livingstreetsedinburgh.org.uk\n[2] The Freedom of Information request asked, in relation to Traffic Regulation Order TRO19/29 for detail of (i) number of parking spaces added and removed per street, and (ii) distance in meters of parking space added and removed per street. See: https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/traffic_regulation_order_tro1929?nocache=incoming-1511839#incoming-1511839\n[3] Paragraph 273 of ‘Scottish Planning Policy’ states that: ‘Plans should identify active travel networks and promote opportunities for travel by more sustainable\nmodes in the following order of priority: walking, cycling, public transport, cars. The aim is to promote development which maximises the extent to which its travel demands are met first\nthrough walking, then cycling, then public transport and finally through use of private cars.’ See: https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-planning-policy/",

The whole thing took over five hours, and in many ways it was a lost opportunity. It was undertaken in a manner which suggested the whole Capital was watching, when in fact anyone who watched the whole thing on the Council’s rather grainy webcast probably deserves a medal.\nThroughout the marathon session, I felt that as a Labour Councillor I was stuck in the middle. This started with the representations from Edinburgh’s trade unions. Labour engaged them in a discussion about the impact of SNP\\Tory cuts, whilst other parties largely either looked on with indifference or sought to pick a fight with them.\nThen came the blame game. The Tories blamed the SNP and Greens for cutting Edinburgh’s budget, whilst the SNP blamed the Tories. The truth is, of course, that both are to blame. The UK Government has been squeezing public spending, but the SNP have been squeezing Councils hard er. On top of the 3.4% real terms cut this year, between 2013 and 2018 Council funding fell by 6.9%, whereas the Scottish Government Budget fell by only 1.6%. On top of this, Tory Welfare reform places huge demand on Council services. We need to change both governments.\nThe opposition parties, of course, realised that Labour’s priorities were tackling homelessness, protecting libraries, investing in social care and increasing the School Clothing Grant. Knowing this, they sought to drive a wedge between us and the rest of the administration by putting forward alternative budgets with extra funding in these “moral” areas. The problem was that this was largely grandstanding and the alternative budgets proposed simply did not hold water. Quite frankly, they’d have been alarmed if their budgets had been passed. This is why the whole “debate” was a lost opportunity.\nThe opposition parties hold the majority of votes in Edinburgh – 33 out of 63. If they had worked together, the Tories, Greens and Lib-Dems could have engaged Labour in a positive and constructive discussion on key issues. Perhaps they could have forced us to scrap the plan to charge for garden waste collection (I have real concerns about this), fund the School Clothing Grant better or increase funding for road repairs. Instead, all I saw was grandstanding and political tribalism from the cheap seats.\nA good opposition is indispensable at all levels of government. A city administration should learn more from its opposition than from its enthusiastic supporters. Edinburgh’s problem is that it needs an opposition that goes beyond tribalism and grandstanding.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_01_03_edinburgh-council-briefing-on-residential-field-trips/content_134.html": "Below is a briefing from City of Edinburgh Council on its residential education plans in the coming year.\nResidential Visits\nResidential visits are progressing; the Council is taking a proactive, incremental and proportionate approach aligned with its priorities of protecting Council staff, vulnerable individuals and essential services, including keeping schools open.\nStep 1: camping expeditions promptly reintroduced in June. Offsite camping, including the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award expeditions, were permitted by Scottish Government in May and approved by CEC from June onwards. Permission was sought via the Council’s Service Resumption Group (SRG) process and a template risk assessment produced to minimise transmission risks. Health Protection Lothian was consulted regarding risk assessment, transport and general guidance. The financial risk was assessed to be minimal (low cost often self-led or delivered inhouse by the Sport and Outdoor Learning Team) and transmission risks could be managed initially through single occupancy of tents (in-line with Scottish Government policy). Several groups have restarted resulting in many Secondary pupils undertaking overnight camping excursions.\nStep 2: reopening of Benmore and Lagganlia during the Autumn Term. I am sure you will be pleased to know that this has been very successful with over 1000 young people from Edinburgh undertaking an overnight visit. This has required an immense amount of planning. Decisions were made in May 2021 for the Autumn; we did not know what the Autumn SG advice would be nor the transmission rates. Budgets were updated, staff training undertaken and SRG approval gained in the Summer Term (all within a few days of SG approving residential visits).\nSteps 1 and 2 are being used to understand the pandemic within a school residential context; developing resources through learning and partnership work with Health Protection Lothian. The Council has an enviable range of tools designed to assist schools (more info below).\nRegarding Step 3, senior Council leaders will shortly be presented with a further SRG request linked to reopening specific UK visits to non-Council providers. This is a more complex step that has required the involvement and approval of colleagues from Insurance, Procurement, Legal and Finance.\nI wish to take this opportunity to thank Lorna French, David Bruce and Lynn Paterson for their leadership and support. We are very fortunate to have leaders who listen to staff and commit to an approach. Their proactive attitude means we have been able to progress with residential visits.\nThis proportionate approach is making sure we have the capacity to learn, manage outbreaks and develop/trial resources so the next step (Step 3), which will involve a significant increase in visits, will be achieved safely and staff/families feel reassured that the Council and providers are fulfilling their responsibilities. This in turn will maximise attendance. If this is not undertaken robustly, there is a substantial risk that we experience several outbreaks, resulting in the temporary pause of all residentials so that appropriate mitigations are put in place to minimise risks. The Sport and Outdoor Learning Unit has been in contact with several providers to request their latest information and to offer an update meeting. A number have not yet replied.\nThe primary reasons for this stepped approach are twofold:\n- Minimising transmission risks and managing outbreaks, and ensuring schools remain open to educate pupils. Residential visits are a higher pandemic educational activity risk due to the overnight component (national household guidance applies to higher risk contacts including dormitories). The Council has used the first two steps detailed above to liaise with Health Protection Lothian (HPL) to produce essential and rigorous tools to (a) minimise transmission risks and (b) to manage symptomatic persons whilst on the visit. This has included a checklist, template risk assessments (overnight and transport), process for monitoring Covid contexts before, during and after the visits and scenarios with appropriate actions. School residential visits within a pandemic context is relatively new and HPL value our work with them so they can develop their advice to us and other neighbouring local authorities (one of which is yet to restart residential visits). This has been essential work and we have seen at first hand when these resources have safeguarded people’s wellbeing. You will be reassured to know the Council has formed an enviable relationship with HPL, including weekly meetings dedicated to residential visits. As you know, we rely on the significant enthusiasm and agreement of staff to plan and attend residential visits. It is important that we put in place appropriate safeguards, so they feel reassured and are safe. Staff feedback regarding our resources and support has been extremely positive. Likewise, we also receive questions from families wanting reassurance about pandemic safety and arrangements e.g. repatriation. Our robust scenario planning and information sessions have been very well received and reassuring for families. This has all been created through a proportionate restart that has allowed us to learn and develop resources to deliver safe residential visits. We have had ‘Covid instances’ at the centres and these have been managed very well, ‘lessons learnt’ used to improve guidance/resources and the impact on school operations generally kept to a minimum.\n- Minimising financial risks / protecting monies. From October 2020, the Council like other local authorities no longer has pandemic cancellation insurance that caters for school residentials (prior to travel). This significant national barrier was highlighted early to Scottish Government. External providers have developed a range of ‘Covid guarantees’ in a variety of formats e.g. verbal assurances, email ‘pledges’ through to some modification and presentation of terms and conditions. These vary significantly in quality and detail, for example, some only seem to provide cover for the scenario of ‘Scottish Government not permitting school residentials’. In reality, there are a range of Covid scenarios that need consideration, examples include but not limited to postponement/cancellation/significant alteration due to (i) local outbreak management (local outbreak requires a single residential to be cancelled based on advice from HPL/Council); (ii) insufficient staff due to isolation, illness or redeployment elsewhere in the school to keep it open; and (iii) individuals identified as close contacts. Visits to Benmore and Lagganlia include comprehensive pandemic cancellation guarantees based on our learning from the pandemic in a residential context. Schools have received questions from parents/carers about how their contributions are protected and so our significant work in this area dating back to May 2021 is providing excellent standards of reassurance for our parents.\nThe forthcoming Step 3 SRG request includes a recommendation to create a central checking process managed by Council officers who have the capacity and expertise to scrutinise external providers’ terms and conditions, and pandemic arrangements. This allows School staff to focus on teaching and learning, and pupils’ wellbeing. I am sure Councillors, school staff and families welcome this approach. The proposed aim is to create a central approved list that schools can choose from. This would deliver consistency and capacity across the Council.\nExternal providers are highly valued and form part of delivering sufficient capacity to support school residentials, particularly in the Secondary phase. Subject to clearance via the SRG process, we expect this process of approval to start in January 2022 with some trials before this. It is acknowledged there is always a lag between booking and delivery due to the planning required. Any future visits are always subject to the latest guidance, a risk assessment of transmission rates and local pandemic contexts.\nYou will be pleased and reassured to know that Council Officers have been invited to co-lead national working groups to look at national solutions and develop resources for use across Scotland; based on a number of those created by our Council. These resources should be ready for Step 3.\nRegarding other local authorities, the picture varies across Scotland. Some local authorities have decided not to permit any school residential visits whilst they devise and implement processes (mainly due to pandemic transmission and financial concerns). Other local authorities are permitting residential visits, often with specific conditions and requiring the Head Teacher to check and evaluate provider terms and conditions and infection control measures. Several schools are reluctant therefore to procced due to concerns about financial risks and how to deal with outbreaks. This information comes to us via our membership of SAPOE (Scottish Advisory Panel for Outdoor Education) and is reliant on LAs submitting data returns. Regarding private schools, some have decided not to run residential visits to centres this academic year but reintroduce them in 2022/23. Conversely, others have decided to proceed.\nBonaly Scout Centre\nWe are currently developing an offer for schools delivered by the Sport and Outdoor Learning Unit at Bonaly. Bonaly no longer has its own instructors. This includes a pilot ‘targeted transition day’ programme; shorter residentials for younger children; potentially some secondary school days and meeting any urgent needs to ensure all P7s are offered a residential experience this year (small number of schools).\nAs you know, schools and wider Council services are working hard to deliver outcomes in different ways throughout this pandemic and more recently via an increasing transmission rate. This includes day visits to achieve specific outcomes. Schools are being kept up to date via the Council’s Coronavirus Excursions Toolbox which allows us to interpret national general schools and specific offsite visits guidance into ‘local’ advice and practice.\nI hope you consider this to be a useful and full explanation and can see how tirelessly and proactively schools and the Sport and Outdoor Learning staff are working within a very dynamic context to support all pupils. Our stepped approach means we are developing nationally recognised resources to support safe visits and the ability to check providers to ensure they have suitable and sufficient measures in place. This means that Edinburgh schools can focus on day to day operations, rather than be worried about checking terms and conditions etc.\nWe share the disappointment of any pupil missing a residential visit and thank school staff in trying to present flexible solutions within this ever-changing context. The work continues.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_06_12_briefing-plans-to-reopen-edinburghs-schools-in-august/content_343.html": "Below is a briefing from the City of Edinburgh Council’s “Executive Director for Communities and Families” on his plans to reopen our capital’s schools in August. Firstly you will see that there is still a great deal uncertainty where how much time kids will spend in class is concerned – we only know they will have “full days” and that “33% of a school’s roll will be engaged in in-school learning”.\nWith the Council facing a huge black hole in funding (largely due to Covid-19), the briefing also touches on financial pressures. As I said at a meeting of Bonaly Primary School Parent Council yesterday evening, as we come out of the crisis the Council and Scottish Government must find a way of protecting education if we are do avoid lasting damage to a whole generation’s life chances. The same point is made by Jack McConnell here.\nBriefing\nThe following briefing provides the latest position on our plans to reopen schools in August. I will be writing to all parents today on the same basis.\nFirst of all, I want to assure you that all arrangements being put in place are designed to ensure the safest return to schools for our pupils and staff.\nFollowing the Scottish Government’s announcement that schools should open a week earlier next term, we’ve made some minor adjustments to our session dates for 2020/2021. As such, our schools will reopen to pupils from Wednesday 12 August. (The two preceding days will be used as in-service days for staff.)\nAs schools will start the session one week earlier than originally published, the summer holidays in 2021 will consequently begin one week earlier, with the session finishing on Friday 25 June 2021.\nThe Scottish Government has advised that this month should be used as preparation for reopening schools in August and part of this will involve some children being invited into school for special transition experiences. Those children who require this support will be contacted by their school and appointments will be made with families to attend during June.\nIn accordance with Scottish Government and Health Protection Scotland guidance, social distancing, hygiene regimes and risk assessments will be essential to keep our children and staff safe. This means that not all children will be able to return to school at the same time.\nAll arrangements must take account of social distancing, staff availability and circulation routes as well as hygiene and infection control arrangements. Rotas will be arranged to ensure that all children and young people receive a blended model of in-home and in-school learning. Headteachers will be in contact parents/ carers prior to 24 June to inform them which days their child will be in school.\nTeaching will take place through Mondays to Thursdays with all children attending for whole days and Fridays used by staff to support home learning. Limited key worker childcare support will continue throughout the week, including Fridays during normal school hours. All children will attend for whole days.\nTo enable social distancing, from the start of the session it is anticipated that 33% of a school’s roll will be engaged in in-school learning and when and, where conditions allow, arrangements will be made to maximise the proportion of in-school learning.\nIn Early Learning (Nursery) and Primary Schools, children will be grouped together to enable family members to attend school on the same full day. In Secondary Schools, pupils will be grouped together either by year group or family group depending on the individual arrangements made by each secondary school and each child in the rota will attend for a full day.\nPupils at special schools will be in for 50% of the week with the majority offering two full days in school and the rest as home learning.\nThere will be a city-wide approach to catering and building opening, with the details of the arrangements at each school reflecting local circumstances and Headteachers will be in contact with parents with details before the end of the session.\nThese new arrangements will result in budget pressures and consideration is being given as to how these can be offset. This will be covered formally at Committee on 26 June.\nI’d like to end by reassuring you that every effort is being made to minimise the disruption to our pupils’ learning. I believe the new blended model of learning represents an improvement on the current home learning arrangements and, though far from ideal, we will review, refine and improve the arrangements as conditions allow.\nExecutive Director for Communities and Families",

What caught my eye is the description of Lothian Buses:\nEdinburgh has a cheap (about a buck-fifty a ride in town) and efficient bus system with frequent service to everywhere a visitor might want to visit. The drivers and fellow passengers alike are extremely friendly and more than willing to explain the system and point you to the correct stop, as well as discuss their recent doctor’s appointments, the town council’s foolishness and, of course, the weather.\nWe should never forget that Edinburgh has one of the UK’s best bus services. What makes it so special is that it is owned by the Council and operates to benefit Edinburgh, not maximise profits.\nThose that doubt the benefits of Lothian Buses only have to look west to see how lucky we are. In Glasgow there is no municipal bus company, services are operated by First Bus and Stagecoach. Whereas in Edinburgh we can travel the length of our Capital for £1.60, a relatively short journey in central Glasgow can cost £2 even when the tickets are bought in advance. Making matters worse for Glaswegians, this week it was announced that fares will increase by 15% for adults and an eyewatering 40% for children. What’s more, unaccompanied children will have to pay the adult fare. Adding insult to injury, the view out of the window is nowhere near as good as we get in Edinburgh.\nGlasgow City Council is powerless to intervene as for 11 years the SNP have refused to regulate bus companies or give other Councils the power to establish the equivalent of Lothian Buses. They have let private bus companies run riot.\nThat has now changed. At last, after pressure from Labour and Unite, the SNP have said they “aim” to bring forward legislation in the coming years. Don’t hold your breath though, similar commitments were made in the past.\nOf course cynics will say the SNP have not acted to date because the party has received millions from Sir Brian Souter. As well as been known for spending a million pounds opposing gender equality legislation in Scotland and being caught in a £11m tax avoidance dodge, this super rich SNP backer is Chairman of the Stagecoach Group. Anyone who doubts the influence Souter has over the SNP should ask why they had him knighted and why Nicola Sturgeon refused to ask to that reward be removed when he was caught avoiding paying tax.\nSo let’s be grateful for Lothian Buses, but not expect anything similar to be started up elsewhere in Scotland anytime soon.",

Indeed, the situation in Edinburgh is worse than elsewhere. Our Capital now has the most poorly-funded budget, £1443 per person, 25% less than other Scottish cities. It represents a cut double that of the Scottish average since 2013.\nIn the build up to the SNP Government’s budget, the Council had been briefed to expect a cut of £30m and planned on that basis. Reducing library hours was discussed alongside plans ranging from charging for garden waste collection to cuttting home to school transport.\nWhen Derek McKay’s budget was published, however, the cut was less than expected – £12.2m. He did, however maintain the trend of cutting Edinburgh more than the national average – 10% more to be precise.\nI am, of course, grateful that the cut was less than feared.\nIn addition, however, the budget came with a big catch – unfunded pay rises (£2.2m). In addition to this, we have to set aside money to start dealing with the huge building maintenance backlog (£9m), inflationary pressures on rent (£1m) and changes to social care (£2m). This means that even with reluctantly increasing Council Tax by 3% and without accounting for rising demand in services, we are looking at a black hole of £26.4m.\nOf course, this is just a draft budget and the SNP is a minority government. The days of the SNP doing deals with the Tories have passed, so we can now expect the nationalists to seek support from the Lib-Dems or the Greens if they are to set a budget.\nTribalism in the SNP ranks means that they are unlikely to do a deal with Labour. In any event, Richard Leonard is unlikely to accept SNP tax policy without significant change.\nThe Greens and Lib-Dems, however, may be willing to tinker and seek more funding to help protect local services. This won’t deliver the real change for the many that we need, but it may be enough to the reduce the impact of the SNP’s attack on our Capital.",

In order to manage the area safely, the traffic control measures through this one access point needed to be deconflicted with military users of the estate and members of the public accessing the area under the Scottish Outdoor Access Code (SOAC). Therefore, for primarily safety reasons and duty of care I stopped public vehicle access under the barrier to the training area access road by lowering the barrier to 1m, keeping it to site traffic only. It has not affected pedestrian passage for those wishing to access the Pentland Hills.\nAt one stage all three projects were going to happen concurrently. However Scottish Water deferred their start date until after the Dreghorn Barracks build and Scottish Power delayed until the start of this year. Scottish Water have finished their main project on MOD land but they still have some residual works involving tree felling and planting. I am hopeful this will be concluded soon but it will lead straight in to the Scottish Power project which will start shortly and is planned to go on until Aug/Sep 20. They too require access via the barrier, working on the pylon towers and positioning equipment near the entrance. We have just started the liaison and planning process this month and will know more once a programme of works is issued.\nIt is unfortunate that both Scottish Water/Power projects were delayed and ran on consecutively, stretching out the time and disruption to all concerned. Despite this, I am convinced the decision to restrict public vehicle access was correct as it was in the interests of public safety. As ever I will continue to consult with all stakeholders, namely the Forestry and Natural Heritage Service and Friends of the Pentlands, keeping them informed at all stages.",

This makes parts of our capital fairly unpleasant, and the resultant air quality problems are a particular risk to children and those with health problems.\nThe first proposals for WPL were actually made by Harold Macmillan’s Tory Government in 1962-4. These proposals, however, noted that WPL can force parking elsewhere, does not reflect journey length, does not target peak traffic and once the charge is paid it does not influence the number of journeys.\nHarold Wilson’s 1964 Government did not take these proposals forward. In 2000, however, legislation did enable English councils to enact WPL and 12 years later Nottingham introduced the first (and only) UK scheme.\nNottingham introduced the charge not to raise income, but to solve the same congestion problem Edinburgh faces. Unlike Edinburgh (so far), however, Nottingham worked with neighbouring authorities to ensure the charge did not cause problems at the city boundary. The charge started deliberately low, then slowly increased over time – this gave employers (and employees) time to adapt. Exemptions for small businesses mean that only 40% of employers pay the charge. The income was used to fund transformative improvements to public transport.\nNottingham’s experience has been positive, so it is right that we undertake a dialogue with the public to see if it would work in Edinburgh. Any income should not be used to backfill cuts, but must be used to transform active and public transport. Lastly, if introduced in Edinburgh I will argue that Edinburgh’s Councillors and Holyrood’s MSPs are first in line to pay the charge.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_02_05_the-greens-failed-their-own-test-when-they-cut-edinburghs-budget/content_488.html": "It is hard not to like Edinburgh’s Green Councillors. But whilst they are a great asset to the city, they do come with two drawbacks.\nThe first, of course, is their inability to really stand up to the SNP and the second is how numbers often appear to confuse them. Councillor Gavin Corbett’s opinion article on how “Edinburgh is £27m better off thanks to [the] Greens” is a great example of both.\nOf course, it is an open secret that for the 2017/18 budget the Greens thought they’d protected local government spending. The problem was, however, that they did not quite understand the difference between revenue and capital spending – they’d been duped by their Nationalist masters!\nThis year numbers appear to be getting the better of them again. The “£27m better off thanks to [the] Greens” line is based on quite pessimistic briefings from the SNP Government designed to make Edinburgh grateful for the cuts handed to Scotland’s Capital by the Nationalists.\nIn fact the Greens managed to lessen the cut destined for Edinburgh by £12.4m. This is a very welcome improvement, but it does not live up to the Green pledge to only support a deal that delivered “no cuts to council budgets” and provides a “fair public sector pay rise”. Council Officers have confirmed that the likely pay rise is not fully funded and that Edinburgh’s budget has been cut by the Greens. They sold out Edinburgh to keep the SNP’s elite happy.\nAs if that is not enough, Councillor Corbett wants to make matters worse with a plan to plant 6,000 street trees in our city. I’ve been working hard with residents in my Ward to have dead street trees replaced with ones which attract pollinators, so I know they are not cheap. The trees must be placed in special planters to stop the roots damaging pavements and the footpath must be made good. The cost of this is up to £1,000 per tree, so 6,000 would cost £6m. If this really is a Green budget priority, they need to be clear about what else they’d cut to fund it.\nThe Greens have sold Edinburgh short and an unfunded plan to plant 6,000 trees won’t hide that.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_03_07_edinburghs-housing-crisis-why-affordable-housing-wont-solve-the-bb-problem/content_547.html": "Councillor Susan Rae and the Evening News should be congratulated for raising the plight of homeless people who have been placed in Bed and Breakfast accommodation by the City of Edinburgh Council (report, 06/03/18). The report was concerning given that in February it was reported to Full Council that 1,609 households were in temporary accommodation and that 605 of these were using B&Bs.\nThe report makes clear that the quality of this accommodation too often is not good enough. The Council, however, needs to go beyond simply getting families out of B&Bs. Firstly, if we are paying £5.7m per year for temporary accommodation, we need to make sure it is fit for human habitation. In the longer term, we need to aspire to end the use of B&B accommodation completely rather than just lift families out of them. Indeed, the number of families in B&Bs is so small that it’s not even the tip of the iceberg. It’s the snow on the tip of the iceberg!\nThere will be those that argue that the solution to the problem is the Council’s plan to build 20,000 affordable houses over 10 years. We need to be honest about this, however, as only around a quarter of the “affordable” housing built last year in Edinburgh was for social rent. With over 20,000 people on the council house waiting list in Edinburgh, we know that social housing is what’s needed. Indeed, over five thousand people recently applied for just 32 council houses built as part of the Leith Fort development.\nThe other types of “affordable” housing are simply not affordable to many people living in Edinburgh – it’s time we were honest about that. Building more social housing costs money, however, and the SNP Government is cutting Edinburgh’s budget. Indeed, the recent “City Deal” came with not one penny for social housing. That’s why we need to use the £2m allocated in Edinburgh’s budget for homelessness wisely.\nTo start to tackle the housing crisis we need to act fast, but building homes takes time. That’s why we need to stop paying private landlords to offer temporary accommodation. Instead, we need to “borrow to buy-back”. We should use the £2m to borrow around £16m to pump-prime the systematic buy-back of the council houses Margaret Thatcher sold. We can use the money that would have went to private landlords to pay back this loan.\nThis proposal may look radical, but a timid approach won’t solve Edinburgh’s housing crisis.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_05_01_briefing-waste-and-cleansing-service-recovery-plan-in-edinburgh_comment-page-1/content_555.html": "Below is an update from the Council on the status of the waste collection system in Edinburgh. The key points are:\n- Recycling centres remain closed due to Government restrictions, but a plan is ready for their safe operation once they can reopen.\n- The special uplift service should return in the near future.\n- There are no plans to reopen public toilets as yet.\nBriefing\nThis briefing outlines the steps we’re taking to review and reinstate Waste and Cleansing Services during the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic. It also highlights some of the assumptions being made in the reinstatement of services, particularly any relaxation of current Government guidelines.\nA number of services were suspended during the outbreak both as a result of reductions in available staff, and the requirement to ensure physical distancing to reduce risks to collection staff. This reduced the numbers of staff who can occupy a vehicle cab. As a result, the service had to adapt and change the way in which collections were carried out.\nIt is particularly important to note that the current intention is to maintain physical distancing controls for crews until such time as we are comfortable that normal crew arrangements can be reinstated.\nIn Edinburgh, our focus was on maintaining the most critical services which were required to maintain public health, including general household waste, food collections, mixed recycling and all communal bin services.\nAbsence levels due to Coronavirus currently appear to have reached a plateau within waste collection. Staffing availability will continue to be tracked daily and forecast for the weeks ahead.\nThe following outlines the current position with regards to each of our collection services.\nKerbside and communal services\nWith the exception of blue box and garden waste collections all the remaining kerbside and communal services have been fully maintained. In some cases, across communal collections, the collection frequency has been enhanced to reflect people staying at home and generating more waste than they might normally.\nThere has been some media coverage suggesting an increase in rat/vermin sightings and reports.\nThe number of rat complaints received between 13 March 2020 and the 24 April 2020 was 27. For the same period in 2019 there were 81 requests for service.\nBlue box collections\nBlue box collections of glass were the first to be suspended. As staff numbers have stabilised over the last two weeks this service was reinstated with effect from 28 April.\nCommunications messaging has focused on residents assisting collection crews by not presenting excess glass waste outside of their boxes and instead asking residents to filter additional glass over the course of their next few collections.\nEarly indications are that we are collecting double the glass tonnage each day than would be collected under normal circumstances.\nGarden waste collection\nThose garden staff who remain at work have been used to support the core functions of collecting residual waste, mixed recycling, food and communal bins alongside allowing the service to provide additional collections to high rise properties to prevent increased fire risk.\nGarden waste collections will be reinstated in the week commencing 11 May. Relevant communications to the public have commenced. Customers are being emailed or written to in order to confirm reinstatement.\nIt is currently proposed to extend a customer’s permit to cover the number of missed collections resulting from the suspension.\nHousehold Waste Recycling Centres\nAll three household waste recycling centres (HWRCs) in Edinburgh remain closed and all HWRCs in Scotland are currently closed. This is in line with Government guidance that people should only leave their homes for defined essential activities and the provision of HWRCs is not considered by the Government to be essential at this time.\nThere has been discussion around a co-ordinated reopening of HWRCs in Scotland when the appropriate time comes to avoid any mass surge in visits to any particular Council sites should they be the first to re-open. This approach has not yet been confirmed on a national basis, although as a minimum Edinburgh are actively holding discussions with neighbouring Councils to establish their intentions.\nThe service is currently working to an assumption that the HWRCs will re-open following a relaxation of the current Government guidelines, however are awaiting further guidance.\nAt this stage we are assuming that when the sites re-open there will be a requirement for some form of social distancing to protect both customers and staff. Current proposals being considered are:\n- initially opening two of the three sites which may be defined by staff availability\n- restricting the range of materials accepted to core garden, black bag, bulky and possibly cardboard\n- restricting staff assistance to customers (to move materials to skips)\n- requiring physical distancing measures to be followed at all times and therefore restrictions on the number of customers on the site at any one time and following a one in, one out policy.\nCommunications messaging will need to focus on increased wait times and new site working arrangements to avoid additional frustration for customers. It is important to note that the way in which HWRCs operate, and the way in which customers use them, is likely to change significantly.\nWhen a reopening date is confirmed a further briefing will be provided to Elected Members and will focus on the arrangements that will be in place to protect staff and customers.\nSpecial uplifts of bulky waste\nAt the current time we are working towards a reinstatement date in the near future, although the precise date is yet to be confirmed. There is an element of direct support required from colleagues in Customer and their current working arrangements are being considered.\nOnline booking forms would likely go live one week ahead of the first job being carried out. It is highly likely we would be unable to provide assisted special uplifts (where operatives enter a person’s house to uplift) due to the obvious risks. We may also need to restrict the number of items that can be booked on one job to five rather than ten. The average number of items uplifted per job is two.\nWe normally provide ninety slots per day but can increase this if demand is excessive.\nWhilst Special Uplifts have been suspended, the staff have been providing support to Cleansing colleagues on the uplift of dumping and fly tipping. As the table overleaf shows the number of dumping/fly tipping requests/complaints has reduced when measured against the same period in 2019.\nCleansing\nCleansing functions remain reduced but have been bolstered by staff from other areas. This service continues to operate albeit in a reduced state, with a focus on emptying litter bins and removing fly-tipping. Increased focus on mechanical cleansing will require to take place once restrictions are lifted.\nPublic conveniences\nPublic conveniences remain closed. There are currently no plans to reopen these although as with all services our aim would be to do so when we are satisfied that we can provide a reliable and safe service.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2016_12_31_the-baby-box-an-expensive-unhelpful-stunt_comment-page-1/content_309.html": "In the Scotsman today Jane Bradley quite convincingly questions whether the money used by the SNP Government to fund its “Baby Box” scheme could not be better used to target support at those parents who need it most.\nOf course, the debate surrounding universalism versus targeted benefits is age old and extends far beyond Scotland. There are overwhelming arguments for the universal delivery of benefits such as health and education, but it’s important that some others are evaluated to ensure they offer a net benefit to society.\nThe SNP’s “Poverty Tsar” Naomi Eisenstadt CB considered universalism in her report for the Scottish Government. She concluded that universalism can “mean spreading a limited budget too thinly” and that “money should be spent on trying to level the playing field, not, as is sometimes the case, reinforcing ongoing disadvantage”. With the subtlety of a brick, she said “it would be very useful to have a clear and shared understanding of what a progressive universal system would look like”. She went on to say that the SNP could learn a lot from how Labour had delivered Sure Start by targeting it at disadvantaged families.\nOf course, what Eisenstadt is getting at is the chaotic delivery of universal benefits in Scotland. University education is not means tested, but this is funded by means testing and cutting the student grant for the poorest students. We have families using foodbanks, but the SNP extended Labour’s targeted free school meals policy to include the very wealthiest families.\nIt took Nicola Sturgeon almost 4 months to respond to Eisenstadt’s report, and on the same day she promised the Baby Box as a universal benefit. Labour has already noted it contains no support for those needing help with breast feeding, an unacceptable oversight when we know breastfeeding uptake is lower in more deprived areas.\nPerhaps Professor Graham Watt, an expert in community healthcare and deprivation at Glasgow University, was right when he said it was “an expensive, unhelpful stunt”? I guess we may find out if the SNP actually say how this fits into the “progressive universal system” strategy Eisenstadt asked for.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_05_04_spaces-for-people-urgent-review-of-the-greenbank-to-meadows-quiet-route_comment-page-1/content_603.html": "Overview\nBelow is an update from the Spaces for People team on an “Urgent Review” of the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route I knew nothing about. Plans above, and the original PDF version is below.\nBased on the briefing below I put three points to the SfP team:\nPoint 1\nCllr Arthur – What actual data was this decision based on?\nSfP – This proposal was based on officer observations and feedback from local residents and councillors. Counts have been conducted (Tue 20th and Wed 21st) and reviewed, and follow on counts are scheduled for next week. Count summary attached (this level of data presentation has taken a considerable amount of time and may not generally be available across other projects). [note the data is linked at the foot of this blog – it is for 7am to 7pm] The change is a very minor modification following an instruction from the Transport and Environment Committee on 22 April to conduct an urgent review due to unintended consequences with the layout at that time. Should problems persist more significant modifications can be considered.\nCllr Arthur – This data suggests (graphic below) that an average of 12,603 vehicles (inc buses) and 250 bikes pass through Greenbank junction from the north or south each day. For Braid Road the daily numbers are 911 vehicles from Hermitage Drive and 336 bikes passing the Hermitage entrance. Note – In May 2020 there were 600 trips daily on Braid Road alone.\nPoint 2\nCllr Arthur – Did the observation today that traffic was falling take into account that many schools were closed for in-service training? Can the data relating to traffic levels be shared?\nSfP – Today’s observations did not specifically consider the impact of school operations, however on previous days the majority of the traffic heading northbound on Braid Road was observed to turn right onto Braid Crescent – following the Quiet Connection. Today the majority of traffic heading northbound on Braid Road at this location was observed to continue along Braid Road.\nPoint 3\nCllr Arthur – What discussions have taken please in relation to the peak-time delays to public transport on Comiston Road? Was this considered today? I raised this with the SfP team last week.\nSfP – Lothian buses have been part of discussions and while there have been some delays recently on the A702 there has been no clear pattern. LB have not raised any concerns with our proposals and we will continue to discuss any issues with LB if and when they emerge.\nBraid Road Urgent Review – Outcome\nAs you are aware Braid Road re-opened to Southbound traffic alongside the introduction of several measures meant to support the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Connection on Monday 19th April.\nAs you are also aware, the layout as installed resulted in some unintended consequences with significant numbers of vehicles travelling north/east from Braidburn Terrace towards Cluny Gardens along the route of the quiet connection until the junction of Cluny Drive and Braid Avenue where traffic is forced to turn left. This resulted in larger levels of traffic in certain streets on the quiet connection (such as Corrennie Drive) than would normally be seen.\nThis traffic quickly reduced over the ensuing week as motorists became aware of the closures, however towards the end of last week it was observed to still be higher than had been hoped. It was also noted that numerous concerns had been raised about motorists finding the layout confusing. Following this input, and in line with instruction from Committee, a review was carried out.\nFollowing this review we have actioned several minor changes to tweak the layout to encourage better driver behaviours in the area, and discourage through traffic from using the streets on the Quiet Connection. These changes are summarised in the attached document.\nMost of these changes have been carried out, and we hope that all changes will have been made within the next week or so. We will continue to monitor the operation of the Quiet Connection through officer observation, consideration of public and elected member feedback and traffic counts at various sites.\nFrom observations on site today it would appear that traffic levels on the Quiet Connection are continuing to fall compared to immediately after the introduction of the scheme, and we will continue to monitor this closely and consider any further changes that may be required.\nWe have received a large amount of correspondence from the public regarding this scheme and will shortly begin responding to all of these now that we have a more established way forward.\nWe will also be making the following changes following specific feedback:\n- Widening the northbound cyclelane on Braid Road immediately north of the hotel\n- Revising the layout of Braid Road between the junction with Hermitage Drive and the Hermitage of Braid path to allow northbound egress from the Hermitage of Braid for forestry maintenance vehicles\n- Adjusting the Rosehill Cycle Lane Defenders at the junction of Braid Road and Hermitage Drive to improve pedestrian desire lines\nPlease let me know if you have any comments or questions on the above and attached.",

It’s not uncommon in my Ward, however, to see a gully choked to the gunnels with weeds growing out of it.\nIt is worth also considering, however, what’s blocking the gullies. The Council’s own data makes clear that there has been a marked drop in street cleanliness in Edinburgh, and that it is not meeting its own targets. It’s this material that’s blocking the gullies.\nIt’s not just these basic services where problems exist. Fly-tipping incidents have increased by 91% since 2017. Weeds are now so big in parts of my Ward they are trip hazards. Our capital looks unloved, and Council staff are exhausted playing catch-up.\nI’m a huge fan of some of the strategies the Council has produced over the last few years – it has plans to tackle everything from poverty to climate change. I support and welcome this, but I think all of Edinburgh’s 63 Councillors could do more to ensure the Council is getting the basics right too. That’s about asking questions to find out what the issues are, but it is also about standing up for Edinburgh and ensuring it has the funding it needs. Above all else, we need to be honest about the challenges we face.\n(You can report blocked gullies here)",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_02_22_the-future-of-spaces-for-people-in-edinburgh_comment-page-1/content_593.html": "The online engagement exercise looking at the future of Spaces for People schemes was launched today at 2pm and will close at midnight on the 21 March 2021 (now extended to the 5th of April). The council say this consultation “will help inform any proposals to keep changes in place more permanently”.\n“In line with our wider ambitions to create a green, healthy and well-connected future for the Capital, we want to make it as easy as possible for people to get from A to B using sustainable, active modes of transport. With these ambitions in mind, we’re asking residents if they’d like to see some of the schemes introduced as part of the Spaces for People programme, or elements of them, retained or removed.”\nCity of Edinburgh Council\nThere are three stands of engagement, each with a separate questionnaire:\n• Stakeholders\n• Businesses\n• General Public\nThe public questionnaire will be accessible through the Council’s consultation hub, as will the questionnaire for businesses. All three questionnaires will be available on request in regular print, large print, braille and translated into other languages.\nConcurrently, there will be a piece of market research undertaken in the city on the same topic, conducted by an independent market research company (I have asked about the cost).\nThe Council will be holding briefings and engaging with various stakeholders directly, including:\n• Representatives from the access panel and equalities groups;\n• Business community;\n• Emergency services;\n• Community Councils;\n• Transport Organisations;\n• Heritage Groups; and,\n• Transport Advocacy Groups.\nThe Council has provided the perspectives below from residents. These views are all valid, but I don’t feel there fully reflect the range of views in Edinburgh on the Spaces for People projects.\nTeresa Holligan said: “I understand the anxiety around an apparent lack of consultation over the Braid Road closure, but given the urgency required during the pandemic I was pleased to see swift action and I am delighted with the closure. I have lived at the ‘top’ end of the Buckstone estate for 32 years and make regular journeys to Morningside and my allotment at Midmar. At the start of the pandemic I stopped using buses and relied on my car, but with the new cycle lanes and the closure of a section of Braid Road I now feel able, for the first time ever, to make these almost daily journeys safely by bike, and am doing so. This is obviously healthier for me, the people around me and our environment. I hope that the Council will find a way to make safe cycling routes from Fairmilehead and Buckstone into the city a permanent feature of our transport network.”\nDave McCraw said: “As a family with young children attending the Lanark Road nursery who also commute on the A70 we seem to be forever on this stretch of road. As it exists today it is extremely hazardous to cross on foot, such that we do not use the bus or at any time allow grandparents to handle the nursery run (unless they were driving door to door). Under the proposed scheme, we would happily allow grandparents to take our children to nursery by bus. We often cycle, especially in the summer months when it is dry. Unfortunately the lack of safe street lighting on the Water of Leith path combined with the horrific mud finds us doing a two mile drive to nursery more often than we’d like. We have considered taking our children to a different nursery because the A70 both makes it extremely difficult to access nursery except by car and detracts from the setting of the nursery in general. With the benefit of a 30mph two lane road with excellent active travel provision, the nursery will find itself in even greater demand. All of this is to say: the changes proposed to the Lanark Road will allow us to keep cycling through the winter instead of driving.”\nColin Fischbacher said: “I usually cycle both for travel and work and I know from speaking to colleagues that the main reason people with bikes are reluctant to cycle more in Edinburgh is concern about the safety of cycling in traffic. That’s particularly true on a road like Lanark Road where as you cycle, cars may be passing close to you at 40mph. I think that better provision of cycle lanes is a vital measure to encourage more cycling. A painted line is nice, but a physical barrier is even better.”\nMike Livesley said: “The recently installed cycle lane and segregation on Duddingston Road has vastly improved the quality of life for my family travelling to and from school before the recent lockdown, and will continue to do so once the restrictions are lifted. We are a family with no car and currently travel from Rosefield Place in Portobello to Duddingston Primary where my eldest son (6 years old, p2) is a student. As we have to travel quite far, cycling has always been a popular option as I can also take my youngest son (2) on the back of my bicycle, however until the installation of the cycle lane, Duddingston Road was always far too dangerous to entertain cycling with my son and was scary enough at the best of times on my own, with always a block of parked cars on both sides of the road by St John’s School and Nursery, with opening car doors an additional hazard. However this was transformed with the new cycle lane and has allowed my son and I to cycle together and to greatly improve his confidence and ability to cycle safely on the roads.”\nBarbara Kerr said: “I live just off the Links and regularly cycle in the area. Before Links Gardens was closed to provide Spaces for People I avoided it a lot. It was really busy with cars, and drivers tended to ignore me at the narrow bits as I was on a bike and they thought they could squeeze through even though I had right of way. Now it is a joy to cycle along that way. It is such a short section, but provides a really important link to the shared use paths on the Links and towards the Water of Leith Cycle way. Before I would be on the road trying to keep up with traffic on East Hermitage place and Duke street, now I use Links Gardens and the shared use path instead.”\nColin McLean, Head Teacher at James Gillespie’s Primary School, said: “The Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route allows students and staff to cycle, walk and wheel more safely to James Gillespie’s Primary School and Nursery. Our school community has worked hard over a number of years to encourage cycling, walking and wheeling which are known to improve life-long health and wellbeing and improve air pollution in our neighbourhood. Whilst we have one of the highest number of students travelling in this way, we know that many families still consider the road network too dangerous for young children to cycle. The new road safety measures are a game changer to reassure families that it is safe. The Quiet Route will allow us to run our bike- and walking-buses in greater safety and will reduce the risk of accidents involving children and vehicles. We hope that these can now run daily rather than weekly or monthly. We hope that the Quiet Route approach can be expanded into a Low Traffic Neighbourhood approach over time and this will allow students and staff from all parts of the city to reach our school safely and using active travel.”\nYou can submit your views here.\nThe Council press release:",

In addition to this I have been saying the Council needs to listen to the needs of residents more when promoting these schemes.\nThere are clear benefits to even the most controversial schemes such as the closure of Braid Road. They also, however, come with consequences for local residents and businesses. In my view, the Council has a duty to engage with the public and present evidence-based arguments which show the benefits outweigh the consequences. This is the only way to meet Edinburgh’s longer-term goal of increasing walking, cycling and public transport use. Community engagement, not just consultation, is key as it leads to better outcomes on infrastructure projects. It increases acceptance of decisions by the public, and provides a community commitment to outcomes. The Council’s failure to engage with residents and businesses is why 92% of 300+ people who responded to the Council’s “consultation” on the Lanark Road Spaces for People scheme oppose it.\nWithin this context, the Labour Group agreed the following reasonable requests for the Transport Committee tomorrow:\n- the proposed ETRO in East Craigs be halted and the Council works with residents on a TRO;\n- that all new Spaces for People schemes be “paused and an evidence-based report is produced which demonstrates that the proposed use of Covid TTRO powers is proportionate”; and,\n- Braid Road should be the subject of a “specific proportionality study” which includes “monitoring pedestrian and cycle use of Braid Road for a period whilst simultaneously monitoring traffic, public transport delays and air pollution on the A702 corridor”. This should be followed by a temporary re-opening of Braid Road, during which time the same data continues to be monitored for both Braid Road and the A702 corridor.\nI understand that these requests were blocked by the SNP Group in the Council. I have therefore decided not to put myself in a position of being asked to vote for something which I genuinely feel may leave the Council open to legal challenge, and shall be asking to be removed from the Transport and Environment Committee.",

I have ask Council Officers about this as Lothian Road is used by a number of bus services serving my Ward, some of which are already being delayed by the Braid/Comiston Road Spaces for People scheme (this is under review, but I spotted no problems today). The response from Officers on the resurfacing plans is below.\nLothian Road Resurfacing Works\nFirstly I can confirm that we are well aware of the issues at George IV Bridge and have been working with the Network Management team to determine a way forward.\nIt’s not simply a question of postponing the works. As the work is being undertaken by a third-party contractor there would be a cost involved in rescheduling the works, possibly requiring us to go back out to tender and delaying the work by several weeks.\nI am pleased to report, however, that we have been in discussion with the contractor over the last couple of days and have determined a way to reconfigure the work to enable us to delay the introduction of the proposed temporary traffic lights at the Fountainbridge/East Fountainbridge junction which were planned to be in place from Monday 6 September. This will mitigate the impact of the work in the short term.\nWe are now looking at implementing them at some stage week commencing 13 September instead, when the situation at George IV Bridge will hopefully be clearer.\nThe work at Lothian Road next week will concentrate on the removal of the existing Spaces for People measures on Earl Grey Street along with gully replacement works which will require only a single lane closure. Lothian Buses have been involved in these discussions and are supportive of the revised proposals.\nWe will continue to monitor the situation over the forthcoming days and weeks.",

The biggest and most intractable casework issue is housing – evidenced by almost 800 people applying for a single council house in my Ward recently.\nWhilst I have a constant stream of housing casework, other issues can be more seasonal. Without a doubt this time of year is when complaints about road and footpath condition peak. This year we went into winter with many roads and footpaths in a bad state, and the cold and wet weather results in further decline. Road and footpath condition is an issue which the council must, and is, taking seriously.\nHaving inherited a situation where road and footpath maintenance was underfunded in Edinburgh, the current Labour Council Administration allocated £11M of additional funding to the issue despite our capital being Scotland’s worst funded local authority. We are listening to the public, and will resurface whole streets rather than take a piecemeal approach. This means that 420,000m² of road and 170,000m² of pavement improvements will be carried out in 2023/24, compared to pre-Covid yearly averages of 225,000m² for roads and 30,000m² for pavements.\nIn addition to this, we are trialling a state-of-the-art “Pothole Killer” machine which helps automate repairs – so far, it has filled around 8,000m² of potholes.\nWe won’t get footpaths and roads back to where we want them to be in one year, but this investment will help halt the decline.\nIndeed, as part of the 2024/25 budget process I am working hard to get additional funding for roads and footpaths – Despite Edinburgh being Scotland’s worst funded local authority. We will invest wisely and prudently to improve the network. In January we agreed the city’s latest Transport Asset Management Programme which commits to prioritising projects to make the most efficient use of the funding available, as well as exploring new methods and treatments to maximise funds.\nIf you want to know more on this, you can listen to me here talking on Radio Scotland about the issue.\nOur offer for the 2024/24 budget:",

The meeting was chaired by the Transport Convener, but disappointingly the updated plans and consultation responses were not shared. Nor were we told how many people had responded to the consultation, but it was reported that the majority did object. It was also noted that a local petition which had raised concerns about the scheme had attracted “around 1000” signatures (1,344 actually).\nIt was explained that the aim of the scheme was to reduce congestion on the Canal Towpath and the Water of Leith Walkway. This appears to be based on anecdotes about usage in April, and an assertion that cycle traffic is still higher than normal. “Key Pinch Points” were noted as being Slateford Aqueduct and Harrision Park (no Water of Leith locations were mentioned). I asked if the plans were proportionate, and if the risks justified the use of Covid Powers. Although no evidence was tabled, it was argued that because the towpath was already busy pre-Covid then the plans are justified. Although I accept the towpath is/was busy (I broke my arm in a low-speed collision last year), I think a stronger argument needs to be made to justify the use of Covid Powers. Lessons have to be learned from the East Craigs debacle.\nKey points.\n1. The revised plans will be published along with the consultation responses before the mid-November Transport Committee. Transport Convener said she would not permit any further consultation on the plans.\n2. The floating bus stops will not be part of the “Phase 1” installation. As I reported on my Facebook page, the Council are working with Sustrans on developing a new “factsheet” on these, and as part of this they will carry out a workshop with relevant affected groups who have raised concerns. Once this is complete they will review Lanark Road and consider the installation of floating bus stops along the corridor. If this does take place it will be subject to a Road Safety Audit before installation. To be honest, I doubt a “new factsheet” will change my mind or that of anyone else.\n3. The Transport Convener expressed disappointment that the wider Spaces for People initiative has not been allowed to “flourish” due to public concerns being raised and regretted that the Lanark Road scheme (along with others) had become a “flashpoint”.\n4. Changes to the plans have been made to accommodate Cranley Nursery, Lanark Road Nursery and Dovecot Park. Although I requested these changes (along with many residents), it appears the Council has yet to contact Cranley Nursery and several other businesses along the route. The Golf Club has also not been contacted.\n5. The Council accept they have not given a great deal of consideration to the nurseries, but they hope that the scheme will encourage people to cycle to both Cranley Nursery and Lanark Road Nursery.\n6. A temporary pedestrian crossing at Dovecot Park is not possible.\n7. It was reported that the proposed Lanark Road / Ingles Green Scheme was a “top priority” within the wider Spaces for People initiative. Nonetheless, if work gets underway as planned in mid January 2021 it will go live more than 10 months after lockdown started.\nPresent at the meeting\nCllr Lesley Macinnes (Transport Convener)\nCouncil staff (x3)\nCllr Scott Arthur\nCllr Ricky Henderson\nCllr Gavin Corbett\nCllr Neil Gardiner\nCllr Andrew Johnston\nCllr David Key\nCllr Jason Rust\nPresent but did not speak\nCllr Karen Doran\nCllr Sue Webber\nDid not / Could not attend\nCllr Ashley Graczyk\nCllr Cathy Fullerton\nCllr Denis Dixon\nCllr Donald Willson\nCllr Graeme Bruce\nCllr Phil Doggart",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_08_15_wearing-a-cycle-helmet-it-makes-sense/content_399.html": "I cycled a lot as a child after learning to ride on a friend’s Raleigh Chopper. This was mainly with a second hand bike an auntie obtained from her neighbour, but then a Raleigh Grifter (my brother’s) and a Halford’s Vitesse road bike. By the time I left Kirkcaldy for university in Dundee in 1987, however, these bikes were past their best and replacements were unaffordable.\nOnce I started my PhD in 1992, I bought a bike – a Diamondback Curaca. What had changed in the intervening 5 years was that cycle helmets had become more common. I bought one with my new bike as it made sense, but found it was not unusual to be pointed at by pedestrians in Dundee where I lived. We moved to Edinburgh in 1996 and I found that cycle helmets were more common (and the drivers were less aggressive).\nI have cycled a lot since then – mostly commuting, but I have toured Scotland (inc the Outer Hebrides), England, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. The vast majority of the time (99.9%) I wore a helmet because it still made sense to me, and when my kids came along they wore them too.\nSince 1992 I think I’ve had 6 proper accidents on my bike: two due to ice, one in my drive, two with cars (their fault, one driver was charged) and one on the canal towpath in Edinburgh. I don’t think my helmet was damaged in any of these, but there was one broken arm and a few scraped knees. Nonetheless I was glad I was wearing it.\nOn the 10th of August 2021 I spotted this tweet:\nI saw this and thought of a recent incident in my Ward where a SUV driver had pulled out in front of cyclist using a Spaces for People lane (the junction has now been made safer). The cyclist’s bike was destroyed but a trip to A&E showed that he had been relatively lucky in terms of physical injuries. Like Storm Huntly above, he was clear that he thought his helmet had saved him – an uncontroversial observation which I accepted. In responses to Storm Huntly’s tweet, I retold his story on Twitter and encouraged people to wear a helmet – “Wear a helmet!” I said.\nI did not get quite the response I expected. Three replies stand out:\n- “As there are, overall, many more pedestrian, car driver and bath/shower user injuries do you recommend helmet wearing for them too Scott?” – Cllr David Key\n- “I’m in the business of selling helmets and I don’t recommend wearing a helmet. It’s a personal choice. I doubt this ‘saved Storm’s life’. Probably saved a bump or an abrasion, though.” – Hart’s Cyclery\n- “There is no evidence that cycle hats reduce either mortality or morbidity for transport cyclists. This is due to risk compensation by riders, increased aggression from motorists and a few cases where a cycle hat causes injury in a fall. Hats are not the answer – segregation is.” – Overlander\nNow, it is important to note that none of these people are saying that people should not wear helmets. They are however trying to say that the risk of an accident while cycling is low compared to other everyday activities, and that investing in cycle lanes is the best way to reduce the risks associated with cycling. Nonetheless, I found the scepticism about the benefits of wearing a helmet interesting.\nOf course, it is possible to argue for changes to road network which reduce the likelihood of incidents whilst also making the case for measures which reduce their consequences. Indeed, this is entirely sensible as we know that around 16% of fatal / serious cyclist incidents reported to the police do not involve a collision with another\nvehicle, but are caused by the rider losing control of their bicycle. Furthermore, peer reviewed research has concluded that helmet wearing is beneficial “especially in situations with an increased risk of single bicycle crashes, such as on slippery or icy roads”.\nIndeed, in many places in the UK we are a million years away from having safe cycling networks to get us from A to B. Even where they so exist they tend to make the safest section safer, but offer little support at junctions (see Lanark Road).\nI think RoSPA sums up my feelings pretty well:\nIn 2018, 99 cyclists were killed, 4,106 were seriously injured and 13,345* were slightly injured on Great Britain’s roads. Although cyclists suffer a number of different types of injury during accidents, head injury has been identified as an important cause of death and serious injury in cycling collisions. One way in which cyclists can prevent or reduce the extent of a head injury in a cycle accident is to wear a cycle helmet… …we strongly recommend that cyclists wear a cycle helmet. However, it is important to remember that cycle helmets do not prevent crashes from happening. It is therefore vital that through infrastructure improvements, supported by education and training that we reduce the primary risk factors.\nThe Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents\nOf course, we live in an era where we have instant access to information and misinformation. If you don’t believe the earth is spherical, the Covid-19 vaccines are safe or the the Climate Emergency is real there are websites which will cater for your views. The debate about cycling helmets is no different, but is based on the perceived uncertainty regarding the benefits of wearing a helmet rather than conspiracy theories.\nA quick look at Google Scholar suggests that there is a fair bit of work being undertaken in this area. I searched for “cycle helmet” from 2000 – 2021 and ranked the return by relevance, and these were the top 20 results:\n- Non‐legislative interventions for the promotion of cycle helmet wearing by children – This observed that “helmets reduce bicycle‐related head injuries, particularly in single vehicle crashes and those where the head strikes the ground”, and that “non‐legislative interventions appear to be effective in increasing observed helmet use, particularly community‐based interventions and those providing free helmets”.\n- The impact of compulsory cycle helmet legislation on cyclist head injuries in New South Wales, Australia – This concluded “we have identified evidence of a positive effect of compulsory cycle helmet legislation on cyclist head injuries at a population level such that repealing the law cannot be justified”.\n- Emotional reactions to cycle helmet use – This found that “cycling with a helmet did not lead to increased speed, or to changes in emotional reactions as would have been expected from a risk compensation perspective”, but did note “those who use helmets often cycle more slowly when not wearing a helmet“.\n- Performance analysis of motor cycle helmet under static and dynamic loading – Not relevant.\n- The impact of compulsory cycle helmet legislation on cyclist head injuries in New South Wales, Australia: A rejoinder – This paper challenges the conclusion of Paper 2 above and suggests the helmets “protect at best 10%-15% of cycling related head injuries”, and concludes “Bicycle helmets may provide a small benefit for some types of low speed crashes, but the conclusion that there needs to be mandatory helmet legislation for all adults and children is not justified”.\n- Cycle helmet ownership and use; a cluster randomised controlled trial in primary school children in deprived areas – This observes that “bicycle helmets afford protection against head and brain injuries to wearers of all ages involved in all types of crash, whether or not another vehicle is involved. Although childhood cycle injuries appear to be reducing in incidence, there were still more than 7500 children under 16 admitted to NHS hospitals between 1991 and 1995 with bicycle related head injuries… There is a steep social class gradient in mortality from pedal cycle injury, with children from social class V having a mortality rate four times higher than children from social class I.”. This paper concludes that “an educational pack plus a form to order a free cycle helmet is an effective way of increasing bicycle helmet ownership and use and reduces inequalities in helmet ownership among children in deprived areas”.\n- Demographic, socioeconomic, and attitudinal associations with children’s cycle-helmet use in the absence of legislation – Behind paywall.\n- Inequalities in cycle helmet use: cross sectional survey in schools in deprived areas of Nottingham – This concludes that “programmes aimed at preventing head injury among child cyclists will need to address the inequality in helmet ownership that exists between children residing in deprived and non-deprived areas”.\n- Cycle helmet wearing in 2002 – See Paper 10.\n- Cycle helmet wearing in 2004 – This is a regular report which has been published since 1994. It shows that cycling helmet usage has been increasing amongst adults, but less so with children.\n- Increasing cycle helmet use in school-age cyclists: an intervention based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour – This observed that “helmets reduced the risk of head and brain injury by 63%-88%” and studied measure to increase the numbers of children wearing helmets.\n- Systematic reviews of bicycle helmet research – This article concluded that “there is good evidence that bicycle helmets are effective in reducing head and facial injury in the event of a crash, and that helmet legislation is also likely to be effective at a population level, although high quality controlled research must continue. We know that non-legislative interventions are effective in increasing helmet wearing rates in children, particularly community-based programs that provide free helmets.”\n- Changes in head injury with the New Zealand bicycle helmet law – This questions the efficacy of making helmets compulsory at a time when the number of people wearing helmets is increasing. It concludes that “the large increases in wearing with helmet laws have not resulted in any obvious change over and above existing trends, helmet laws and major helmet promotion campaigns are likely to prove less beneficial and less cost effective than proven road-safety measures, such as enforcement of speed limits and drink-driving laws, education of motorists and cyclists and treatment of accident black spots and known hazards for cyclists.”\n- Cycle Helmet Performance in the Real World – Not peer reviewed(?) and contains no references. It concludes that the “clearest outcome of promoting helmet use has been to increase the public’s perception of cycling as a dangerous activity, leading many people to forego the overall health benefits they might otherwise enjoy. Research has shown that helmet promotion campaigns are linked strongly to a decrease in the number of people cycling”.\n- Head injuries to bicyclists and the New Zealand bicycle helmet law – This paper concludes that “the helmet law has been an effective road safety intervention that has lead to a 19% reduction in head injury to cyclists over its first 3 years.”\n- The impact of mandatory helmet-use legislation on the frequency of cycling to school and helmet use among adolescents – This concludes that “the implementation of the helmet-use law did not have a negative impact on the frequency of cycling to school.”\n- A computational simulation study of the influence of helmet wearing on head injury risk in adult cyclists – This paper concludes that “bicycle helmets are effective in reducing the severity of head injuries sustained in common accidents.” and that helmets were effective over the entire range of cycle speeds studies, up to and including 14 m/s (31.2 mph)”.\n- The impact of mandatory helmet law on the outcome of maxillo facial trauma: a comparative study in Kerala – Not relevant.\n- Application of Reverse Engineering and Impact Analysis of Motor Cycle Helmet – Not relevant.\n- MADYMO simulation of children in cycle accidents: A novel approach in risk assessment – This paper concluded that “wearing a cycle helmet was found to reduce the probability of head injuries, reducing the average probability of fatality over the scenarios studied from 40% to 0.3%.”\nI then searched for “bicycle helmet” from 2000 – 2021 and ranked the return by relevance, and these were the top 20 results:\n- The risk compensation theory and bicycle helmets – This paper suggest that when wearing a helmet cyclists may take more risk. The paper explains why this may be the case, but offers no empirical evidence. The authors note “The empirical difficulty with establishing the relevance of risk compensation to cycle helmets is that, compared with other activities such as motoring, there is a shortage of reliable data.”\n- Effect of legislation on the use of bicycle helmets – This paper documents how in Canada the “rate of helmet use rose dramatically after legislation was enacted” in 1997 and that the “proportion of injured cyclists with head injuries in 1998/99 was half that in 1995/96”\n- Risk compensation and bicycle helmets – These researchers observed 35 volunteers cycling down a short hill with and without helmets. They found that “routine helmet users reported higher experienced risk and cycled slower when they did not wear their helmet“. However, for “cyclists not accustomed to helmets, there were no changes in speed, perceived risk, or any other measures when cycling with versus without a helmet“. The paper concludes that the “findings are consistent with the notion that those who use helmets routinely perceive reduced risk when wearing a helmet, and compensate by cycling faster”.\n- Oblique impact testing of bicycle helmets – This paper concluded that the “current helmet designs provide adequate protection for typical oblique impacts onto a road surface, in terms of the peak linear and rotational head accelerations“.\n- Bicycle helmets–A case of risk compensation? – This paper is from the same authors as Paper 3 in the first list and Paper 3 in this list. The researchers conclude: “The results give less support to a risk-compensation explanation, in particular because the speeding behaviour of the speed-happy group is more connected to other types of equipment than to bicycle helmets. The helmet is more or less just one element in the total equipment package. So it is not because of the helmet that these cyclists ride fast; they use all the equipment (including helmets) because they want to ride fast.”\n- Bicycle helmets–To wear or not to wear? A meta-analyses of the effects of bicycle helmets on injuries – There are three key conclusions here – (1) Bicycle helmets reduce head injury by 48% and serious head injury by 60%; (2) Bicycle helmets reduce face injury by 23% and do not increase cervical spine injury; and, (3) Bicycle helmet effects are larger in single bicycle crashes than in collisions. The final sentence in the paper – “Thus, for an individual cyclist, the results suggest that wearing a helmet can be recommended, especially in situations with an increased risk of single bicycle crashes, such as on slippery or icy roads.”\n- Bicycle helmets – Behind a paywall, but the abstract notes “the bicycle helmet is a very effective device that can prevent the occurrence of up to 88% of serious brain injuries.”\n- Bicycle helmets work when it matters the most – This paper concludes that “injury prevention programs should advocate the use of helmets in bicycle riders especially in the teenage group where least compliance with bicycle helmet use was observed.”\n- Protective effect of different types of bicycle helmets – This is behind a paywall but recommends the use of hard shell helmets over foam ones.\n- The efficacy of bicycle helmets against brain injury – this paper re-analysed data from 1987–1998 which was used by a separate study to conclude that cycle helmets prevent serious injury to the brain. This paper concluded that the “analysis does not provide scientific evidence that bicycle helmets, not being tested for capacity to mitigate the main factors that cause serious injury to the brain, do reduce it” and that “the Australian policy of compulsory wearing of helmets lacks a basis of verified efficacy against brain injury”.\n- Bicycle helmets and risky behaviour: A systematic review – this paper built on the the work of Paper 3 and 5 in this first list, and Paper 3 the first list. The researchers conclude: “review found little to no support for the hypothesis bicycle helmet use is associated with engaging in risky behaviour”.\n- The Cochrane Collaboration and bicycle helmets – This is from the same researcher as Paper 10 and again critiques the work of others. This time it is noted that the Cochrane review Helmets for preventing head and facial injuries in bicyclists took no account of the “scientific knowledge of types and mechanisms of brain injury”.\n- Differences in impact performance of bicycle helmets during oblique impacts – This research evaluated 10 helmet designs and noted significant variations in performance.\n- Heat transfer variations of bicycle helmets – Not relevant.\n- Increasing the use of bicycle helmets: lessons from behavioral science – This paper focused on measurers to encourage younger people to wear cycle helmets.\n- Protection performance of bicycle helmets – This study presents a helmet test method that considers oblique impact in addition to drop tests, as well as brain tolerance limits based on recent biomechanical research.\n- Bicycle helmets: a review of their effectiveness: a critical review of the literature – This is a DoT report which considered the case for making cycle helmets mandatory. It made this observation – “There is now a considerable amount of scientific evidence that bicycle helmets have been found to be effective at reducing head, brain and upper facial injury in bicyclists. Such health gains are apparent for all ages, though particularly for child populations.”\n- Bicycle helmets and the law – Behind a paywall.\n- Testing of bicycle helmets for preadolescents – This is not peer reviewed(?). This study aims to provide guidelines for a helmet testing procedure especially designed for preadolescents.\n- Nonuse of bicycle helmets and risk of fatal head injury: a proportional mortality, case–control study – This study concludes that “not wearing a helmet while cycling is associated with an increased risk of sustaining a fatal head injury. Policy changes and educational programs that increase the use of helmets while cycling may prevent deaths.”\nSo what do these 40 papers tell us? Firstly, it is broadly accepted cycle helmets are effective at reducing the likelihood of death or head, brain and upper facial injury – this makes sense. This finding fuelled studies considering how to increase the the number of children using helmets, particularly from more deprived areas. It also appears that the cyclists wearing helmets tend not to take more risks – i.e. there is scepticism about the “risk compensation”.\nThe main controversary in the field appears to be whether not making helmets mandatory is justified. This issue is that it makes it is just another barrier to people starting to cycle (some studies contradict this). This is understandable as most novice cyclists will buy a cheap bike, and then are stung for the extras – lights, lock & helmet. At a minimum, this will come in at £50, but could easily be double that.\nI guess the other question is how dangerous is cycling really? Is cycling really safer than driving as some suggest? In 2019 alone, 100 pedal cyclists were killed, 4,333 seriously injured and 12,451 slightly injured in the UK (2020 was far higher). However, based on time spent travelling a cyclist is 500% more likely to have a fatal accident than a car driver – they are vulnerable road users. However, that’s still only one fatality every 9,000,000 bike rides and let’s not forget that for individuals shifting from cars to bicycles the estimated beneficial effects of increased physical activity are “substantially larger than potential mortality due to increased air pollution exposure and traffic accidents“.\nIs cycling more dangerous that walking? This is an odd question as pedestrian already have the segregated lanes cyclists want (i.e footpaths!). FullFact looked at this, and concluded: “The overall and KSI casualty rate per billion kilometres travelled is greater for cycling than walking, suggesting that the former is more dangerous on this measure”.\nCycling being more dangerous than walking and driving is why we need to invest in well designed and maintained cycling infrastructure in the UK and elsewhere. We have seen progress on this in recent years in Edinburgh, but the flawed approach since Covid-19 has polarised the debate here.\nThere is a also a growing case for for 20mph schemes in the UK. The European Transport Safety Council notes – “At speeds of below 30 km/h, cyclists can mix with motor vehicles in relative safety.” and that “Traffic calming measures in 30 km/h zones are essential to discourage drivers from exceeding the speed limit.”\nWe also should not pretend that investing in cycling infrastructure can lead to a situation where we have no incidents . In the Netherland where levels of cycling are far higher than the UK and the infrastructure is far better, the number of cyclists being killed there is very similar to here despite that country only having about a third of the population. The story is worse for for Denmark. Indeed, in the Netherlands and Denmark 5-6 people per million each year when cycling (in the UK it is 1.6 people per million), and most of these deaths are due to collisions with vehicles (see the chart at the bottom of this page). The higher number of deaths is explained by the fact that people cycle far more in these countries – the death rate per kilometre cycled is 50% higher in the UK.\nNonetheless, the Dutch Road Safety Research Foundation (in a report commissioned by the Dutch Transport Ministry) predicts that if cyclists in the Netherlands always wore a helmet, there would be 85 fewer road deaths a year.\nThis means that whilst improving the safety for cyclists in the UK is essential, even when we achieve the level of the Netherlands and Denmark incidents will still occur. It is therefore important that we think about how we reduce the impact of the incidents that will continue to occur with or without a step change in the provision of high quality cycling infrastructure in the UK. This is why it makes sense to wear a helmet.",

Currently 23% of children in Edinburgh live in poverty, and a decade of constitutional bickering in Holyrood and Westminster means that their plight is side-lined too often. We cannot afford to repeat this mistake in the coming decade.\nThis will mean that our response to these challenges must focus on people and communities. Small businesses in Edinburgh are the powerhouse of our jobs economy, but adaption will be difficult for some. That’s why the Scottish Government need to fund the Council to better support small and medium sized businesses in the transition to more sustainable practices.\nWe need to move the climate change debate on from changing one car fuel to another, and think about real change at a city scale. We need to think about how we improve the thermal efficiency of our homes. We also need public sector bodies to work together at a city scale to reduce their carbon footprint.\nIf we are to tackle poverty whilst doing this, we need to adopt community wealth building (aka “The Preston Model“) as our approach – this is about creating a resilient and inclusive economy for the benefit of all in the local area. This means that we have to look at the “social value” of every contract – with benefits for the local people such as employment, skills, real living wage, environmental impact, and greater wellbeing.\nWe should not need a Climate Emergency and a Global Pandemic to make us realise that Edinburgh needs to be a fairer, happier and healthier place to live, but it feels like now is the time to act.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_01_11_update-on-colinton-dells-closed-bridges_comment-page-1/content_566.html": "January 2022\nColinton Dell Bridges Update – Due to “staff shortages” in the Bridges and Structures team, the Council have been unable to provide the necessary professional expertise to develop designs and contract specifications for the closed bridges in Colinton Dell. They have, however, recently secured the use of their engineering framework consultant (Mott Macdonald) and (after a site meeting in November) received confirmation they will be able to produce designs by February 2022. After the designs are assessed by the Council’s engineers and an Agreement in Principle (AIP) given, the bridges will be procured in April/May with the intention of delivery by October 2022.\nColinton Dell Landslip Update – The Council’s geotechnical consultant has completed all the necessary surveys and have put forward a design for the remedial work which will be required before the path can be reopened safely. The Council are now working on formalising an agreement with a local landowner as an aspect of the design requires for pins to be driven in the bed rock located behind their property boundary. The Council’s consultant is also preparing a bill of quantity for the work to go to tender. The Council will get a better idea of the timescale for the work to be undertaken once a successful contractor has been appointed.\nJanuary 2021\nBelow is a briefing from the Council on the closed bridges in Colinton Dell. The history and wildlife in Colinton Dell make it my favourite part of the Water of Leith Walkway. Generations of local people have used Colinton Dell to restore their wellbeing, but lockdown and the fantastic Colinton Tunnel Mural means that it is now more popular than ever. Whilst the costs of repairing the bridges and dealing with the landslip is not trivial, the Council really does have a responsibility to restore easy access to the area. I know Council officers are frustrated by the situation, but I feel ashamed telling residents that cuts mean the Council can’t do better. Indeed, I was bitterly disappointed that Sustrans blocked the use of Spaces for People funding as I feel this could be a “Spaces for Exercise” project which would be widely welcomed and come with no disruption.\nBriefing\nWith regard to the Pipeline bridge, colleagues in Structures are looking at this with a view to advise on potential options including, the possibility of building the path up and installing a shorter span bridge or a style over the pipe. We are also working with the Water of Leith Conservation Trust to investigate options for volunteer involvement which, if possible, may help to keep the costs down. However, the estimates I have been given suggest the cost is still going to be in region of £20,000. The Water of Leith Conservation Trust have also approached Scottish Water, who are undertaking work in the area, to ask if they would provide any funding to this community project. [Scott Arthur – I asked Scottish Water about this and they declined].\nWith regard to the wooden bridge over the river at Redhall Weir we are continuing to seek funding for this. Again, colleagues in Structures are investigating material options for this bridge however, my understanding is that we are still looking at a cost of over £40,000 and therefore considerable funding will be required.\nWe have investigated the possibility of obtaining funding through the Spaces for People (SfP) project for one or both of these bridges, unfortunately SfP funding is not available for this – Sustrans gave us the steer some time ago that these projects would not be eligible for this funding as they were neither temporary or immediate in nature. A more recent response from SfP when asked if there was ‘any merit in exploring whether we can access some of the SfP money currently being used to develop cycle provision on Lanark Road?’ stated:\n“I am afraid that, as this funding is part of the Spaces for People grant fund we are receiving from Sustrans, and advice they have previously given would still apply here. The current allocation we have against the Lanark Road scheme is fully committed to delivering the changes to Lanark Road and would not be able to cover any additions of this nature, especially at the amounts you have provided. An additional £60k would be approximately a 40% increase in the value of the Lanark Road scheme. While I can see that the Lanark Road Scheme, and these bridge repairs/replacements share some of the same rationale, and can certainly see the value in repairing the bridges in the context of Covid-19, I don’t think that the SfP budget would be able to support this. The only way this could change would be if Sustrans decided that these bridge improvements were eligible – however the SfP team would then need to consider whether they represented the best use of the council’s limited allocation of funds which is already fully accounted for, meaning that any use of SfP budget towards these bridges would likely require the removal of other schemes from the programme.”\nWith regard to the bridge closures in the Dells, we understand the importance of these routes to the local community however, we will not be able to progress works to re-open these bridges until we have secured the appropriate funding.\nThe steps to/from Dell Road are closed due to a landslip. We have appointed a geotechnical expert consultant to undertake a condition survey and report which will include options for proposed remedial works, including associated costs. This is the first step in understanding what will be required to stabilise the slope and reopen the path. We met with the Consultants, following their initial survey work, on 22nd October, we are now waiting on clarification regarding a few points and costed options for remedial works. We had hoped faster progress would have been made however, this has been hindered due to staff resources and sickness. We can only apologise for the delay and will get back to you with a fuller response in due course.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_07_24_cuts-to-home-to-school-travel-for-children-with-additional-support-needs/content_615.html": "Data produced in 2017 shows that the City of Edinburgh Council spends just under £6.5m per year on home-to-school transport. This is a substantial sum of money, so does come under some scrutiny withing the context of the cuts the Scottish Government is forcing on our capital.\nUnder the Education Act, free home-to-school transport must be provided for children of school age: under 8 living 2 or more miles away; and, children aged 8 and over living 3 or more miles away, from their catchment school. The Council implements this as:\n- 2 miles or over for primary aged children (some of these kids will be over 8)\n- 3 miles or over for secondary aged children.\n- Where there is no safe walking route.\nThese rules, particularly at primary level, mean most children are not eligible for free home-to-school transport. The main schools where children are eligible are Roman Catholic Schools; those in the more rural parts of the city (largely west Edinburgh); and, and schools with very large catchments due to their specialist nature: Edinburgh Music School and Bun-sgoil Taobh na Pàirce (Gaelic Medium Education). The Scottish Government prevents Edinburgh from means-testing free home-to-school transport.\nIn addition to this, the Council has Special Schools where the education is specially suited to the additional support needs of children. Indeed, a quick glance at the “top 20” most expensive home-to-school transport schools shows that those for children with additional support needs dominate – they take up over two-thirds of the £6.5m budget.\nWithin this context, in May this year Councillors from all parties on the “Education, Children and Families Committee” unanimously backed a report entitled “Assisted Travel Policy and Guidelines – Home to School“. This report noted the Council “has a duty to implement Best Value for assisted home to school travel” and took the allocation of home-to-school transport out of the hands of headteachers in Special Schools, and gave it to a group entitled the “Travel Allocation Panel”. This approach does have the benefit of providing more consistency across the city, but it does also place more pressure on parents.\nIn the past few days I have been contacted by a number of parents with children at Braidburn School in my Ward who have had their home-to-school transport support removed or fear it will be. Yesterday I supported one parent’s appeal in the strongest possible terms after home-to-school transport for her son was removed, despite his very significant support needs, just a few weeks before term starts. She does not drive and her son has a developmental age of under 3. She told me she wants him to become more independent, but “he will refuse to walk or expect to be carried and I physically cannot lift him for that length of time.” and “I was offered £4 a day to get the normal bus which is as much of a walk to the school and completely pointless. Apparently this is a life lesson for our children as they grow that transport is not reality.” Braidburn School is 450m from the nearest bus stop.\nI have spoken at length with the home-to-school transport team about this and they understand the pressure families are under. They are looking at other ways to cut costs such as bringing services back in-house (already proven cheaper) and reducing the need to hire coaches/taxis by asking Lothian Buses to adjust their routes. In West Edinburgh the safety of walking/cycling routes will be improved to reduce the need to issue bus passes or hire coaches/taxis.\nThe problem the Council faces, however, is that it has very little discretion over who has access to home-to-school transport, but there is flexibility where Special School are concerned. However, I think most people in Edinburgh feel that services for children with additional support needs should be the very last things that are cut. If we can’t stop Scottish Government cuts, we should be shaving every spare penny off other schools’ home-to-school transport budgets before we force mums to carry their children to school.",

Yes, it was maybe a mistake to let a fast food company sponsor the bikes but apart from that I think most people see it as a wholly positive step. Indeed, it must be good as most of Edinburgh’s political parties appear keen to take credit for it from Labour’s Lesley Hinds.\nHowever, the aim must be bigger than having a bike hire scheme for the sake of it, or to compare ourselves with other cities. We have to think about how the scheme can be used to do much more than get us from A to B. I’d suggest four key aims should drive the future of the scheme.\nInclusion – We have to use the scheme to encourage people from deprived areas to live healthier and happier lives. Right now, not one single docking station is in a deprived area. Bizarrely, the station at the City Chambers is the one in the lowest area of deprivation.\nEconomy –We must use the bikes to drive our economy by using them to get tourist out the city centre and to places like Colinton and Cramond.\nActive Transport – We must use the scheme to encourage people out of their cars. They should be a stepping stone to full bike ownership. In a city like Edinburgh, why can’t my son use his bus pass to hire the bike? Why are none of the stations west of Stockbridge or south of Edinburgh University?\nBetter Infrastructure – Parts of Edinburgh have some fantastic cycle lanes. With more people cycling, I hope they will demand fantastic cycle lanes right across this city.\nThat’s my strategy, but the question is what are Just Eat Cycles basing their plans on? I asked them, and they said “as we are in the early days of the scheme, we will be expanding where we can”.\nI fear some joined up thinking is needed.",

Whilst many in Scotland’s nationalist movement clearly have nothing in common with the likes of Trump and Farage, the SNP’s elite does. Like all nationalists the SNP seek to blame others for the problems we face. Trump blames Mexicans, Farage blames the EU and the SNP blames England. This is escapism.\nThis week, the SNP took their homage to Trump one step further when they apparently used a Party Political Broadcast to attack a journalist who dared to ask questions (report, 20/01/18). At that very moment, Scotland became a place where the Government parodied its critics on national TV. They out Trumped Trump.\nJust like Trump, they used Fake Facts and ridicule to attack those who dared to question them. Specifically, they took credit for free university tuition and free personal care for the elderly when it was Labour that introduced these. That’s right, the policies that they listed as their greatest achievements in Government were actually delivered by Labour!\nNonetheless, this Party Political Broadcast will be remembered for how it attacked the media. This is part of the SNP elite’s long-term agenda of moving Scots away from trusted news sources and in to the arms of uncontrolled online content providers.\nIndeed, many hardcore nationalist are happy to admit to completely ignoring the “main stream media” and instead using RT (the propaganda arm of the Russian state), Facebook (an echo chamber) online bloggers (trolls who attack people using the worst kind of language). Even my MSP, the SNP’s Gordon MacDonald, recently labelled the BBC as a “Fake News” outlet and suggested the channel should carry a warning making this clear (report 07/12/17). This slip was rightly branded as ‘irresponsible’.\nIt’s time for the moderates in the SNP’s grassroots to start bringing their party’s establishment back in line. They need to behave less like Trump, and more like an actual Government.",

Tragedy has arguably been averted due to the diligence of Council Officers.\nThe problems with the Council properties are, however, the tip of the iceberg. Alongside that, we have a crumbling road network and widespread housing maintenance problems. Edinburgh is a city to be truly proud of, but it is being held back every day by political decisions made by the SNP Government.\nI therefore welcome the fact that the SNP Council Leader will be asking the Nationalist Government for more capital funding to address the crisis Edinburgh is facing. However, this must be done in an open and transparent way.\nIt is worth noting that if the SNP Government simply pass on the Tory budget proportionately to Edinburgh we’ll land an extra £5m in capital spending and a marginal decline in revenue funding. I hope Councillor McVey is asking for more than that, and I hope he’ll publish his request.\nIf the SNP again decide to disproportionately cut Edinburgh’s budget to protect the wealthiest, then people should be left in no doubt that this is again a political decision to pass austerity on to our schools, community centres and libraries.\nIt’s now time for the SNP to convert some of their Westminster anti-austerity rhetoric in to action in Holyrood. It is time for real change. It is time to set a budget for the many, not the few.",

In addition to this I have been saying the Council needs to listen to the needs of residents more when promoting these schemes.\nThere are clear benefits to even the most controversial schemes such as the closure of Braid Road. They also, however, come with consequences for local residents and businesses. In my view, the Council has a duty to engage with the public and present evidence-based arguments which show the benefits outweigh the consequences. This is the only way to meet Edinburgh’s longer-term goal of increasing walking, cycling and public transport use. Community engagement, not just consultation, is key as it leads to better outcomes on infrastructure projects. It increases acceptance of decisions by the public, and provides a community commitment to outcomes. The Council’s failure to engage with residents and businesses is why 92% of 300+ people who responded to the Council’s “consultation” on the Lanark Road Spaces for People scheme oppose it.\nWithin this context, the Labour Group agreed the following reasonable requests for the Transport Committee tomorrow:\n- the proposed ETRO in East Craigs be halted and the Council works with residents on a TRO;\n- that all new Spaces for People schemes be “paused and an evidence-based report is produced which demonstrates that the proposed use of Covid TTRO powers is proportionate”; and,\n- Braid Road should be the subject of a “specific proportionality study” which includes “monitoring pedestrian and cycle use of Braid Road for a period whilst simultaneously monitoring traffic, public transport delays and air pollution on the A702 corridor”. This should be followed by a temporary re-opening of Braid Road, during which time the same data continues to be monitored for both Braid Road and the A702 corridor.\nI understand that these requests were blocked by the SNP Group in the Council. I have therefore decided not to put myself in a position of being asked to vote for something which I genuinely feel may leave the Council open to legal challenge, and shall be asking to be removed from the Transport and Environment Committee.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_04_18_introduce-a-congestion-charge-in-edinburgh-whilst-raising-rail-prices-is-bonkers_comment-page-1/content_65.html": "On Saturday The Herald reported that the SNP plan to introduce a Congestion Charge in Edinburgh, similar to the one in London where drivers pay £15 to enter the cordon at peak time. Formally announcing this on Saturday means it comes a day after tens of thousands of people in Edinburgh started voting by post.\nThere can be no doubt that we have to work to reduce congestion and cut climate emissions in Edinburgh, particularly where people are commuting into our Capital from surrounding Local Authorities. This can only really be done by improving public transport and cutting the number of cars entering the city. Extra parking, or improved traffic light sequencing are not the answer.\nI’ve said that Edinburgh needs to work with surrounding Local Authorities to improve public transport links, and also invest in Park & Ride schemes. That will need collaborative working, and a regional strategy – I’m not convinced that the SNP plan to unilaterally introduce a Work Place Parking Levy and a Congestion Charge is the answer. Indeed, even they appear to be endorsing the view that it is simply part of a “War on Motorists” – unhelpful rhetoric given the challenges we face.\nKeep in mind that the SNP plan to introduce a Work Place Parking Levy and a Congestion Charge at the same time as increasing rail fares. This is incoherent at best, and certainly not joined up policy making.\nThis is how the SNP describe their policy: “We will introduce a commuter charging zone at the city boundary to discourage those living outwith the city from driving in, encouraging them to switch to bus, tram, train, foot or cycle. No Edinburgh resident – including those living in South Queensferry and the western villages – will ever have to pay the charge.”\nLeave aside the notion of people commuting by “foot” from Livingston, let’s have a think about what that could mean:\n- No charge for driving a SUV from South Queensferry into central Edinburgh, but somebody driving from Loanhead to visit a loved one at Marie Curie Hospice in my Ward would have to pay.\n- Drivers taking a break on long trips to the north or south at the cafes just off the bypass in my Ward would have to pay.\n- People enjoying Hillend Ski Slope would have to pay to access Craigdon Mountain Sports in my Ward.\n- Frontline NHS staff starting early and finishing late would be exempt from the Workplace Parking Levy, but would have to pay the Congestion Charge if travelling from outside Edinburgh.\n- Keyworkers with unsociable working hours would have to pay, despite often not having access to public transport.\n- Tradesmen coming into Edinburgh would have to pay, and the charge would be transferred to customers.\n- It would also essentially mean the reintroduction of a toll for driving from Fife to Edinburgh… from the party that removed it!\n- Most important of all, my family in Fife would be charged for visiting me!\nNo doubt some of these issues could be resolved, and I would also expect exemptions for Blue Badge holders. Like the Workplace Parking Levy, however, there is a risk that a Congestion Charge would simply gentrify driving. Indeed, if a Congestion Charge is introduced alongside increased public transport costs the consequences could be worse than that.\nSo what is the solution to Edinburgh’s congestion problem? Firstly, I think a Congestion Charge could work, but only as part of a region wide transport strategy focussed on public transport improvements. This would mean working collaboratively with surrounding Local Authorities to make public transport a cheaper and more efficient alternative to driving. The current SNP “plan” to introduce a Congestion Charge whilst raising rail prices is bonkers!\nBack in 2005 I was one of the 25.6% of Edinburgh residents that voted for a Congestion Charge. It was a bit of a muddle, but I thought it could be made to work. Almost 20 years later, things have changed. Congestion has got worse, the Climate Emergency is now a reality and Fuel Duty is on the way out.\nThe last point is important, around half of what is paid for petrol and diesel goes straight to the Government via Fuel Duty and VAT. Fuel Duty income in 2021/22 is estimated to be £26B – around £950 per household. The switch to electric vehicles, however, means this income will dwindle. Of course it is possible that a way could be devised to tax electric vehicle charging, but it is more likely that we will switch to “Road Pricing”. Road Pricing is similar to Fuel Duty in that if you drive more you will pay more, but it also offers other opportunities. It could mean people pay more to drive in congested areas/times and Blue Badge Holders could be exempt. People taking journeys served by public transport could even be targeted. The possibilities are endless, and it enjoys modest levels of public support.\nThe House of Commons Transport Committee has published a paper on the subject, and the Scottish Government are also looking at it. Of course the Congestion Charge is a form of Road Pricing, but it is clumsy and indiscriminate.\nI feel that the UK and Scottish Government should be working together on national Road Pricing now so that we can move away from Fuel Duty smoothly. They could make it cost neutral, but I think it could be used to manage congestion and pollution across the UK. If that happens in Edinburgh, the Council working with surrounding Local Authorities will still be key.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_01_07_briefing-rollout-of-free-bus-travel-for-5-21-year-olds-resident-in-scotland/content_141.html": "Bellow is a briefing from the Local Government Improvement Service in the rollout of “free” bus travel for 5-21 year olds resident in Scotland\nIntroduction\nI am writing to update you on developments with the Scotland-wide Young Persons’ Free Bus Travel Scheme for under 22s.\nAs you may know, from 31 January 2022 residents of Scotland aged 5-21 will be able to access free travel on bus services across Scotland with a new or replacement National Entitlement Card (NEC) or Young Scot NEC.\nTransport Scotland, with the support of the IS and other delivery partners, had planned to launch a national marketing campaign on 5 January 2022 to encourage applications. However, due to the rising cases of COVID-19, and current messaging which encourages people to stay at home as much as possible, the decision has been taken to pause the launch of the marketing campaign until the situation improves.\nHowever, there are many essential reasons why children and young people might need to travel by bus and all delivery partners were keen to ensure that they could start benefitting from free bus travel at the earliest opportunity. Therefore, young people and children aged 5-21 years old will still be able to apply for their new or replacement NEC or Young Scot NEC from 10 January as planned, to access the scheme from 31 January onwards, but only those for whom bus travel is considered essential are being asked to submit their applications at this time. This will also help to minimise pressure on local councils, also impacted by the current situation with the pandemic, who will be responsible for processing applications and responding to enquiries.\nInformation about the scheme and how to apply is now available on the Transport Scotland website ahead of applications officially opening on 10 January. Messages will be shared through a network of delivery partners and stakeholders, and I hope you too will help get the message across using your channels. An information pack on the scheme is included with this letter.\nIf you have any questions about the scheme, please contact Transport Scotland at: concessionarytravel@transport.gov.scot\nSarah Gadsden, Chief Executive, Improvement Service\nYoung Persons’ Free Bus Travel Scheme – information pack for elected members\nOverview\nFree bus travel for 5-21 year olds resident in Scotland will be available from 31 January for those with a valid National Entitlement Card (NEC) or Young Scot NEC. Children under the age of 5 already travel for free on commercial bus services and don’t need a card.\nA national marketing campaign was due to launch from 5 January to encourage applications, giving full details on how and when to apply. However, given the current situation with the pandemic, it has been decided to pause the launch of the national marketing campaign – which proactively encourages bus travel – until the current COVID-19 situation improves.\nAll young people and children aged 5-21 years can still apply for their new or replacement NEC or Young Scot NEC from 10 January to access the scheme from 31 January. However, we are asking that only those for whom bus travel is essential apply at this time, because of work, education, health or care reasons, for example. Information about the scheme and how to apply is now available on the Transport Scotland website ahead of local authority delivery partners opening applications on 10 January.\nThis approach will also help minimise pressure on local councils who will be processing applications and responding to queries, ensuring young people and children under 22 for whom bus travel is essential are able to access the scheme from 31 January. Everyone under the age of 22 and living in Scotland will be proactively encouraged to apply to access the scheme by the extensive marketing campaign which will now be launched nationally at a later date.\nWhy the scheme is so important\nAt the same time, the introduction of free bus travel for under 22s will also reduce inequalities and advance equality of opportunity and outcome for young people and families as well as having the potential to help address child poverty by reducing household outgoings. Free bus travel supports the delivery of a Just Transition and removes financial barriers, giving young people more and better choices in work, education, health and social activities.\nResearch commissioned in October 2021 revealed nationwide support for the roll out of free bus travel amongst young people – with almost two-thirds (61%) agreeing that access to public transport will play a central role in the fight against climate change. One full double decker bus equates to removing 75 single occupancy cars from Scotland’s roads.\nAll delivery partners are committed to delivering the scheme in a way that is safe for children and young people and instils confidence in their parents and guardians. That is why parents or guardians will be required to apply on behalf of children under the age of 16 to ensure they can exercise their responsibility for their children’s safety.\nTransport Scotland has also worked with Barnardo’s Scotland to make available additional training for bus drivers on child safeguarding in advance of the scheme’s launch.\nApplication process\n5-21 year olds living in Scotland will need a valid National Entitlement Card (NEC) or Young Scot NEC to access free bus from 31 January.\n- Many young people will already have a NEC or Young Scot NEC but this will not allow them to access free bus travel. Everyone who is eligible will have to apply for a new or replacement card if they wish to use the scheme.\n- The Improvement Service and National Entitlement Card Programme Office (NECPO), together with local authorities, are responsible for handling applications and issuing National Entitlement Cards (NEC and Young Scot NEC) which are used to access the Young Persons’ Free Bus Travel Scheme.\n- The scheme will use the existing application processes and will enable young people or their parents/guardians to apply either online or in person at council offices.\n- Applications open on 10 January. All eligible children and young people can apply but we are working through our network of delivery partners and stakeholders to get messaging out, encouraging children and young people to apply at this time if they need to make essential journeys by bus.\n- A number of different methods will be available for 5–21 year olds to get their card to access free bus travel: online at GETYOURNEC.SCOT or through parentsportal.scot if it is used by the child’s school; via a local council where it is not possible to apply online; and, in some local council areas, schools are coordinating applications on behalf of their pupils.\n- Young people aged 16-21 should apply themselves.\n- Parents or guardians will be required to apply on behalf of 5-15 year olds.\n- Children under the age of 5 do not need to apply as they already travel for free on commercial bus services without a card.\nHow you can support the launch:\n- Use your social media platform to confirm that the scheme will go ahead and that everyone who wants to use it will need to apply for a card but encourage only those with essential travel requirements to apply while public health restrictions are in place.\n- Respond to enquiries from the public, directing them to the Transport Scotland website which gives them information on the scheme and guidance on travel restrictions.\n- Let people know that the scheme supports the adoption of sustainable travel behaviours early in life, and will also improve access to education, leisure, work and other opportunities as soon as we come out of restrictions.",

As part of that process, I’d make it clear to the SNP that Scotland absolutely relies on £15 Billion of funding from the rest of the UK (£2500 per person per year), and ask that the SNP Government draws up a parallel budget to show how it would deal with losing that money.\nOf course, independent countries can borrow money to feed their deficit. I’d ask the Scottish Government to speak to the international money markets in advance of any second referendum to see what terms they’d get. Given that Scotland has the biggest deficit in the EU, I would not expect particularly good news.\nHaving allowed the SNP to establish the extent of Scotland’s borrowing needs, I would then encourage them to conduct negotiations with the EU on our terms or re-joining. Even optimists predict that we’d be out of the EU & UK until 2023, but there is uncertainty about whether or not we’d have to accept the Euro and Schengen, or what level of payment we’d have to make to the EU.\nAll this would mean Scotland would be going to the ballot with its eyes wide open this time. How could the SNP oppose that? Oh, wait…",

I don’t claim my survey is “scientific” or conclusive, but it does show that locally there is a desire for safer roads.\nFor Change\n- I don’t see the need for 40mph speed limit within residential areas. Would love the limit to be reduced on biggar road so I can more easily take the bus to school (Pentland) with my children.\n- Cars come off the bypass and still go to fast down this road especially with all the new housing 30 would be plenty please also included the slow down sign and also the cost of policing (speed checks) on a regular bases without this people will remain going to fast\n- This is essential!\n- Volume of traffic, day car parking, extra houses and junctions and shops, mean this road is becoming more and more dangerous. A 30 limit would help take some of the heat out the traffic\n- The road is too fast. It’s in a fairly built-up area with lots of parked cars. There’s no need for it to be so fast there -30mph would be more appropriate. I’m really worried about my son and his friends crossing the road when they start at Boroughmuir next year.\n- The area around the shops at Buckstone is particularly dangerous as the bend in the road means that people do not have good sight lines when crossing, particularly outside the shops where people double park.\n- There is no need to travel above 30mph in Edinburgh\n- There have been two fatalities near our house within the last 5 years and many near misses that we have seen, it is against the spirit of road safety to drop the limit to 20 on tiny streets with no traffic and leave thousands of people to cross 40mph roads with loads of traffic, whilst going about their daily business to catch buses etc.\n- We live on Pentland View, and regularly struggle to pull out of our road safely given the speed of oncoming traffic and difficulty seeing past parked cars outside the Buckstone shops. I also feel vulnerable (especially with my two young children) crossing the main road here due to the speed of the traffic.\n- The section of road from Fairmilehead to the top of braidburn is residential and as traffic volume has risen so have the incidents of careless driving putting both residents and motorist in greatear danger there is no need for a residential street to be 40 mph\n- Extremely dangerous roads – especially the charwood grill junction.\n- As a resident of Winton who has to cross Biggar Road on a daily basis with my children to get the bus, I believe reducing the speed on that road is absolutely necessary to make the passage safer\n- I fully agree. These roads pass through residential areas, and it would be much safer for everyone if the speed limit was reduced.\n- I’m a car driver, but I also regularly cycle on the 702 to Fairmilehead, as do many others. It’s a busy bus route, and many school kids getting off the buses and crossing, and a lot of older folks living in the area. 40mph limit here is not appropriate, and it’s common to see cars travelling a lot faster than 40mph.\n- Recent accidents demonstrate the need to bring the limit down on these roads. It’s also a great opportunity to put some meaningful provision for cyclists.\n- These Highly residential areas should limited to 30mph\n- These are far to fast for residential areas of Edinburgh with very close proximity to local schools. All of these roads are used daily by children and families to get to school, 40mph is unsafe and leaves me very nervous to cross . I have lived in the area for under 5 years and in that time I have been aware of at least 5 quite serious road traffic incidents on Buckstone Road alone, most including pedestrians. This urgently requires review.\n- Yes please. As a cyclist And bus user/walker who lives just off this road we need this badly for safety. Crossings are too infrequent for bus users carrying shopping etc and hard as a cyclist to safely navigate pinch points ( islands) and exit right over 3 lanes of traffic.\n- I lived on Biggar Road for 21 years, witnessing the speed of cars, still driven at bypass levels or drivers heading south from crossroads accelerating with the down hill & 2 lanes. It is a lethal & frightening road to cross, pedestrians avoid the area, local people use their cars to move around, especially when transporting their children. Reducing speeds would reduce car use, road safety, traffic density & improve local residents quality of life, health & air quality.\n- Should have been 30 limit years ago (F’head lights to Braid H Hotel). Especially at B’stone shops.\n- I cycle past the Buckstone shops almost daily and it’s an accident waiting to happen. Vehicles are double parked outside the shops making it even more unsafe for cyclists and other roads users not to mention all the school kids crossing to wait for buses into town. And the cycle lane is a joke, avoid at all costs unless you wanted floored by a opening car door.\n- I assume the City of Edinburgh accepts that we have a climate emergency? It really is time that pedestrians, cyclists and local bus services are given priority over motorists. The pedestrian crossing helps but as a cyclist you take your life in your hands trying to turn right out of the waterboard estate. Although the speed limit is 40mph many cars/vans/lorries are travelling faster. Please, in the interests of safety, reduce the speed limit to 30mph.\n- The road from Greenbank to the bypass has no business being 40mph. On-street parking is already a problem and is a significant hazard to cyclists. Parking should be forbidden from Riselaw Place southwards as far as the bypass. Or, create a bus lane. Speed reduction is needed in tandem with removal of hazards.\n- Please also consider safe pedestrian crossings near Craigdon Mountain Sports, ie of the Biggar Road and of the of the bypass slip roads. There’s a great walking path eastwards from Swanson village and onto the Mortonhall estate but it involves risking life and limb crossing the slip roads and then the A702.\n- Please – put the safety of vulnerable road users first. Thank you\n- Traffic volumes and on-street parking (with respect to the the A70) are probably the most significant, but sure: whatever it takes to start a process of making these roads safer.\n- Crossing this road is a danger cars do not just do 40mph they drive 45mph. There are houses on both sides of the roads and in such a residential area I have no idea why the speed limit is 40.\n- I would also like to see some traffic calming in Swanston Avenue as it is commonly used as a rat run when traffic builds up around the fairmilehead crossroads – driver speed to make up for their perceived lost time ?\n- Streets need to made safer for residents.\n- My main concern is Biggar Road as cars speed up this road after exiting the City Bypass. It’s almost impossible to get out of Swanston Avenue safely! But all the roads mentioned above require the speed to be reduced to 30 mph.\n- I still think there is a requirement for a Park and Ride at Lothianburn as the volume of traffic is increasing. You just need to look at the volume of cars parked on Comiston Road and side streets to confirm people are driving into that area then taking the bus into town.\n- This reduction in speed should have been implemented YEARS ago. All secondary school children living in Buckstone have had to cross that road to get to the bus stops, putting their lives in danger every day. Since our boys were at high school when we worried every day for their safety, the situation has been improved somewhat by the introduction of two crossing points but we all know that if a bus is coming the children will run. As long as the limit is forty many drivers feel safe to drive at fifty. I used to walk from my house to work at South Morningside primary and I found that quite a number of drivers actually didn’t always notice the crossings anyway! There is also a problem with the twenty mph on Braid Road,where almost no drivers actually stick to the limit. There is a big 20 written on the road but JUST as they come off Comiston Road but it is a very sharp turn and drivers are too busy at that exact point to notice the 20. I think it might help a lot if we could have another big 20 painted on the road maybe twenty metres down Braid Road once drivers have negociated the corner.\n- Thank you – we so need speed to reduce as volume and speed of cars is increasing. As residents of Pentland view we need a reduced limit all way to green bank to prevent cars from accelerating away from the shops going downhill to green bank. Coming out of PV already is unsafe when driving due to obscured view of traffic from double parked cars, commercial bins etc. Reducing speed would allow my daughter to safely cross the road from taking bus from town without taking her life in her hands. Parking also needs to be enforced in the area and near bus stops so that pedestrians can see when getting off bus and to allow safe crossings of road. I feel particularly for young and old people with current speed limits ( and our area has a very high proportion of families and elderly people).\n- The Buckstone shops area is an accident waiting to happen and someones child is going to be killed. It is the junction to Pentland primary, a busy nursery at Cranley, playgroup and after school club at St Fillan’s and access across the road for both commuters and high school kids. It needs to be considered urgently for reduction in speed\n- The current speed limit of 40mph is dangerously high given the numbers of pedestrians crossing, vehicles changing lanes or turning into and out of side roads, and bikes using the road. It gives the wrong signals to cars joining the road from the bypass, that they are still on a ‘fast road’ and that they should drive accordingly and expect others to do so; in practice this means less patience, tolerance and accommodation of other vehicles making manoeuvres, and greater danger for all road users.\n- A 30mph limit would be more appropriate to the usage of the road, more consistent with the surrounding 20mph roads, and would significantly reduce the risk of accidents.\n- There is no NEED for a 40 mph limit as at present. It doesn’t serve any purpose and drivers need to be calmed down immediately they come off or cross the by-pass and be aware they are in a residential area and in the City of Edinburgh. I’ve driven for over 40 years and the Fairmilehead cross roads and approaches make me very nervous as everyone seems intent on doing 50mph ‘attitudinally’. Hell for leather is the phrase that comes to mind. If the limit was reduced it would be well served by the illuminated signs that record speed and state the need to slow down to 30.\n- Every high school aged child in the Buckstone and new Waterfield estate on the previous waterboard ground have to cross the road on Buckstone Terrace on their journey to Boroughmuir or other schools. It is insane given the number of RTA’s in the past that this road remains a 40 (meaning many do above this). The addition of the crossing may have helped a bit but in my opinion should have been lights for the junction rather than just a crossing and would have positioned the crossing point nearer to where Waterfield kids cross. Many kids continue to cross at the islands. The crossroads at Fairmilehead should also be reviewed. Turning right from Buckstone Terrace to Hunters Tryst which is a near blind junction, especially if cars queuing to turn right from the bypass, and is the only approach without a dedicated filter. Lane marking should also be reviewed to make left lane turn left and straight on, and right hand lane turn right only. Same coming from the bypass – 3 lanes should be left only, straight ahead and right only.\n- commuting by bike on this stretch would be a lot nicer\n- Parking outside shops at Buckstone Terrace, sometimes vehicles double parked, make it hard to see on-coming traffic travelling south when turning right from Pentland View. Parking restrictions on junction both in Buckstone terrace and Pentland View aren’t enforced. Have lived in Pentland View for 13 years and have never seen parking attendants here.\n- These are busy cyclist commuter routes with a dangerous pinch points at Buckstone shops.\n- The safety of vulnerable road users is more important than someone getting to the back of the next traffic queue a minute quicker than they otherwise would.\n- And A702 Biggar Road (Damhead to City Bypass)\n- I believe that the Council can not justify a 40mph limit in any residential area where housing is directly on to the road.\n- As a resident of Lanark Rd the speed of the traffic continues to increase as drivers are freed from the restrictions on the surrounding roads. This can only be addressed by reducing the speed on Lanark Road itself. It is a residential street with family homes on both sides and in my time here I have witnessed accidents involving people (thankfully no serious injuries) and many animal fatalities. The bottleneck on Lanark Road heading into town is created by increased housing in Currie and Balerno and reducing the speed after Gillespie crossroads towards Kingknowe to 30 would have little or no effect on journey time and make a significant difference to the safety of Lanark Road.\n- Speed limits change from 20mph to 40mph at Buckstone shops.\n- Large numbers of children need to cross this road to get to school. I’m sure you’re aware of the chances of survival if struck by a car at 40mph, compared to 30 or 20. People driving through see the 40 limit so don’t realise it’s a highly built up area, so very often treat the road as a continuation of the bypass and go even faster. I think it’s unprecedented in the city for a 40mph road to traverse such a densley populated area.\n- Regular speeding on Buckstone Terrace. 30mph would make a big difference when reversing out into traffic with small children in car.\n- We have had our vehicles hit twice in the past year, I feel reducing the speed limit to 30moh would make our road much safer for pedestrians and cyclists.\n- The current speed limits are excessively abused and need to be reduced for safety reasons.\n- cars travel too fast on this section\n- Lanark Road traffic has become much faster recently and unless you use it , you are probably not aware of the danger , particularly to children and the elderly.\n- Essential with so bent youngsters and a nursery in the vicinity\n- These areas are all very residential and i use Lanark Road in particular for nursery pick up. Drivers go way to fast and am always concerned for the little ones coming out onto such a busy road,40 speed limit is too fast for such a built up area.",

It confirms that it has not been given the funds to meet the 3.3% pay rise pledge made by the Scottish Government – proof that headlines are cheap.\nThe Evening News deserves great credit for the work it has done in recent years to raise awareness of the social care crisis our capital has been facing. The pandemic has further highlighted, however, just how important social care workers are. Frankly, I think that it is incredible that it took a pandemic for the Scottish Government to offer care workers the living wage – it is the absolute minimum they deserve. The revelation that the service is so underfunded in Scotland’s capital that care workers won’t get the living wage like their counterparts elsewhere is an insult to care staff which should shame us all.\nUpdate (7pm on 14th May 2020) – The Evening News has now spoken to the Scot Gov and Edinburgh Health and Social Care Partnership, and they have said:\n“The Scottish Government has agreed to fund the additional costs required to meet this commitment. We are working closely with Edinburgh Health and Social Care Partnership on delivering the payments and have every expectation that these hard working social care staff will be paid at least the new Real Living Wage of £9.30 backdated to 1 April.”\nThe Scottish Government\n“We recognise the importance of compensating health and social care workers suitably for the key roles they undertake. Planning is well underway to implement the 3.3% salary uplift outlined by the Scottish Government in April and we have been working closely with them to finalise the funding arrangements which underpin this commitment.”\nEdinburgh Health and Social Care Partnership\nI am hopeful that as well as funding the pay rise, the Scottish Government will now fully fund social care provision in Edinburgh.\nBriefing\nMany of our providers have been in touch asking what our plans are for implementing the Cabinet Secretary’s commitment to fair work and the living wage in adult social care by agreeing a national contractual uplift of 3.3%. As soon as the announcement was made, my team contacted the Scottish Government and we have been working closely with them to finalise the funding arrangements which underpin this commitment.\nHere, in Edinburgh, we are extremely conscious of the contribution all heath and social care staff make towards keeping vulnerable people in our city safe and this is more true now than ever. Every day my team and I hear heart-warming examples of the extra mile colleagues in this extended workforce are going to to support people in the most testing circumstances. We therefore recognise the importance of enabling providers to maintain a fair working regime to suitably recompense workers for the key roles they are undertaking.\nThis desire, however, needs to be set against the financial challenges facing the public sector in Scotland and the rising costs of all services which regularly outstrip the income we receive. For 20/21 we are facing an opening budgetary gap of c£24m and, as yet, have not fully identified how we will meet this. As such, it would be extremely difficult for us to increase this funding gap, which is why agreeing funding with the Scottish Government is so crucial for us. Our calculations show that we would need around a further £5m to fund an across the board increase of 3.3% on all our contracts so I’m sure you will understand our need for assurance.\nAs soon as we get confirmation from colleagues in the Government we will move quickly to implement.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2016_12_27_how-the-snp-made-the-poorest-students-poorer/content_135.html": "Rising student debt (Scotsman 26/012/16) will come as no surprise to anyone who works in a Scottish university. The SNP were elected in 2007 on a pledge to wipe student debt, but instead they have piled it on the poorest Scots.\nWhen elected, they abolished the “graduate endowment”, a £2,000 fee paid by students after graduation, and Alex Salmond quickly claimed “The rocks will melt with the sun before I allow tuition fees to be imposed on Scottish students”. In a typically modest move, he even had his words carved in stone and unveiled them in the grounds of one of Scotland’s best universities.\nThe problem is that fees are only part of the cost of attending university, the second part of the equation is living costs. If you come from a wealthy family, there’s a good chance that the “bank of mum and dad” will help with living costs. Poorer students, however, must rely on a bursary from the Scottish Government.\nCurrently the SNP offers the very poorest students a bursary of just £1875 per year. In comparison, ten years ago Labour offered the poorest students a bursary of £2,455 (~£3,000 today).\nThis means that whilst all students benefit from abolition of the £2,000 graduate endowment, the books have been balanced by cutting £4,500 from the bursary awarded to the poorest students on a typical 4 year degree programme. Poor students must fund their studies via debt and/or work.\nThis movement of money from the poorest to the richest at a time of “austerity” is the action of a government that says its number one priority is cutting the attainment gap.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_08_08_seeing-red-spaces-for-people-internal-audit/content_155.html": "The Council’s Internal Auditors had given the Spaces for People Programme in Edinburgh a RED rating. This means “Significant Improvement Required” (See Appendix 13 of this report) . This is the second worst rating it can give.\nSpecifically, they conclude “Significant and / or numerous control weaknesses were identified, in the design and / or effectiveness of the control environment and / or governance and risk management frameworks. Consequently, only limited assurance can be provided that risks are being managed and that the Council’s objectives should be achieved.”\nThe auditors noted the context of the Covid-19 crisis but conclude that “proposals are not appropriately prioritised for approval, and the rationale supporting decisions is not recorded” and that these schemes “were largely based on professional judgement with limited justification available to support prioritisation outcomes…”\nThey also stated there was a “public perception that feedback provided through the Commonplace survey was not considered in relation to ongoing schemes.”\nThese conclusions are not a surprise, as I know many residents raised these concerns with myself, and the Transport Convener often justified the approach taken when questioned.\nBased on work they did in October 2020, the Auditor recommended the Council should:\n- ensure that prioritisation outcomes and supporting rationale are clearly documented.\n- publish the outcomes of a retrospective prioritisation process.\n- consider whether any changes to either completed or initiatives in progress are required based on public feedback.\nThe Auditors said that where possible there was a “need to align proposals with public feedback and opinion” but found that “where public feedback was incorporated into projects, no audit trail was available to confirm that this was completed”. Again, myself and local residents have been calling for greater public engagement since summer 2020!\nIn terms of project delivery, the Auditors said “no risk management process was implemented to support identification, assessment, and management of programme delivery risks.”, and that “no assessment has been performed to confirm that expected benefits have been realised”.\nIn terms of the Commonplace survey used to collect feedback early in the SfP Programme, the Auditors say “data controller responsibilities have not been clarified between the Council and the application provider”.\nOn removing or retaining the scheme the Auditors say “there is currently no clear strategy for determining the potential exit costs associated with reversing individual projects, or transitioning them into permanent solutions, and it is currently unclear how any significant exit costs will be funded”. They say £175,000 has been retained to complete a review of programme benefits by an external consultant, but no “supporting rationale for this retention value” and that “Management has advised that this budget allocation was defined following detailed engagement with Sustrans, however no evidence has been provided to support this”.\nConclusion\nAlthough it is a little dated now, this is a damning report. It does, however, explain why the Spaces for People Programme has been so controversial in Edinburgh. Many of the points identified by the Auditor have been raised by the public many times. Whether people love Spaces for People or hate it, there can be no doubt that this damning Internal Audit judgment could have been avoided if residents were listened to. No only were the expectations of people in Edinburgh not met, the Council did not even comply with the community engagement guidance set by Sustrans.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_09_20_scotlands-capital-should-not-have-to-cannibalise-services-to-pay-its-workers/content_528.html": "We know that in the 5 years since 2013-14 funding for day-to-day council spending from the SNP Government has decreased by 7.1% but the UK Government only cut the Scottish Government’s revenue budget by 1.8%.\nOn average across Scotland, the SNP have cut Council spending by £148 per person but in Edinburgh the cut has been even bigger – £226 per person.\nAs Ian Swanson’s interview with the SNP’s Councillor Alistair Rankin makes clear (report, 20/09/18), Edinburgh is now facing yet another round of unprecedented cuts – £28m in total this year. Over one half of this is due to a long overdue pay rise for Council staff which the Scottish Government refuse to fund, but will take credit for. The Council will have to axe jobs to fund a pay rise for those that remain.\nI am reminded of Ouroboros – a serpent from ancient Egyptian mythology which consumed its own tail. However, Scotland’s capital should not have to cannibalise services to pay its workers.\nTo fill the £28m budget black hole, “savings” will be needed and charges will rise. The dozen or so discussed in the Evening News by Swanson & Rankin are the tip of the iceberg. In recent weeks proposals for the best part of 100 charges and cuts have been circulated in the City Chambers on what has euphemistically been called a “change deck”.\nIt is tempting to question which of these cuts will happen and what charges will increase or be introduced. The real question, however, is what are the SNP in Edinburgh doing to stop them?\nAfter all, what is the point of Edinburgh having a SNP led Council if they are unable (or perhaps unwilling) to demand Edinburgh gets a fair deal from their masters in Holyrood?",

This reflects positively on the impact of Council policy and the efforts of staff across our Capital in the face of cuts imposed in Holyrood by the SNP and Greens.\nSpecifically, I think there is a clear link between the fall in complaints relating to fly-tipping and the bulky waste item uplift service improvements introduced by Labour’s Lesley Hinds (remember her?).\nAs important as complaints are, however, I emphasised in the Transport & Environment Committee last week that we should consider them alongside more objective measures of good service delivery.\nIn my own Ward many people put their waste and recycling out on “bin day” hoping, rather than expecting, it to be collected. Whilst the Council is striving to improve this situation, many of my constituents now quietly accept it rather than complain. Those who do complain often find the procedure difficult to navigate and give up. I fear that this situation may be contributing to the decline in the level of service complaints the Council received over the past year.\nFurthermore, we know that middle-class people are far more likely to complain than others in society. So if City of Edinburgh Council were to wholly rely on complaints to drive service improvements there is a risk that some areas would not get the attention they deserve.\nThe good news is that the Council is committed to using its own data, alongside improving the complaints process, to drive service improvements. By the end of the year, our waste/recycling vehicles will be fitted with a system that automatically reports where collections have been missed. This means data will be available almost live to drive and prioritize service improvements.\nBoth now and in the future, however, complaints will remain a key consideration when driving service improvements. So please let the Council know if there is anything it can do better.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_10_06_city-of-edinburgh-council-airbnb-briefing_comment-page-1/content_305.html": "I have used Airbnb a few times. I do, however, recognise that in some contexts Airbnb (and similar) lets can cause problems for communities. This breifing outlines City of Edinburgh Council’s position.\nBackground\n- The Council is receiving increasing numbers of queries about the operation of domestic properties as short term lets, booked through the ‘Airbnb’ website. This briefing note is designed to cover the most frequently asked questions about ‘Airbnb’.\n- ‘Airbnb’ was founded in 2008 and its operations now cover many cities across the world including Edinburgh and London.\n- People seeking accommodation are able to use the website to book stays in residential properties as an alternative to a hotel or bed and breakfast.\nAre Airbnb regulated or licensed by the Council?\n- Airbnb and the home owners who take bookings via the website do not require permission from the Council to operate in this way. The Council licences ‘Houses in Multiple Occupation’, but short term lets are exempt as the property being let is not the main residence of the person making the booking.\nDoes the Council have any plans to introduce a licensing system for Airbnb?\n- The Council would be unable to introduce a licensing system for Airbnb under current legislation. The Scottish Parliament would need to introduce new legislation giving local authorities additional powers to license this activity.\nDoes the Council keep a register of homes which are let on the Airbnb website?\n- The owners do not require permission of the Council and therefore the Council would have no way of knowing which homes were being used in this way.\nWhat about responsibility for common repairs?\n- Any issue of common repairs remains the responsibility of the homeowner, irrespective of whether the property is let out via the website.\nDo let properties require Planning Permission?\n- Short Term Commercial Visitor Accommodation\nThe change of use from a residential property to short term commercial visitor accommodation may require planning permission. In deciding whether this is the case, regard will be had to:\n- The character of the new use and of the wider area\n- The size of the property\n- The pattern of activity associated with the use, including numbers of occupants, the period of use, issues of noise, disturbance and parking demand, and\n- The nature and character of any services provided.\nFor example, a flat rented out for one week with perhaps one bedroom may be viewed as ‘residential’, whereas a three bedroomed flat allowing short stays of two or three nights has the potential to cause more of an impact on local amenity, and so might be seen as ‘short stay commercial’. Each has to be decided on a case by case basis as to whether it requires planning permission\nIs there any regulation of Airbnb by the Council?\n- Trading Standards may have a role under The Consumer Rights Act 2015 if the property is being rented from someone shown to be carrying on a business. If the property is being rented from a private individual then the Act may not apply. Each case would need considered on the facts of the case.\nWhat should I do if I am disturbed by antisocial behaviour or noise from guests within a property let out via the Airbnb website?\n- Residents suffering any antisocial behaviour should report this to the Council on 0131 200 2000 or Police Scotland on 101. The Antisocial Behaviour Scotland Act 2004 includes powers to deal with problems from short term lets.\nDo let properties have to pay business rates or Council tax?\n- If the property is the sole or main residence the occupier can let it out to up to six people and the entry would remain on Council Tax as a domestic entry. If the property is not the sole or main residence, or is let out to more than six people, the entry would be valued as a commercial property. Each case is considered on its merits, and if necessary information passed to the Valuation Board.\nWhat action has the Council taken on these concerns?\n- In March 2017 the Corporate Policy and Strategy Committee considered a report on Short Term Lets in the City. The Committee agreed to call on the Scottish Government to increase the powers available to local authorities to manage these, by introducing a licensing system or strengthening planning restrictions. This report includes the data currently available to the Council.\nThe Minister for Local Government and Housing has responded to the council’s request by noting that the Expert Working Group on the Collaborative Economy, set up by the Scottish Government, is considering short term lets as part of its remit. That group is due to make recommendations to Scottish Ministers by the end of 2017. The minister expects the report to include recommendations on ‘how Scotland can take advantage of the opportunities of the collaborative economy and overcome any regulatory, economic and social challenges’.\nThe Council’s Regulatory Services Manager provided the Expert Working Group with a detailed submission in June 2017 at an evidence session on Short Term Lets. Details of this session can be found in the blog below.\nhttps://blogs.gov.scot/scotlands-economy/2017/07/07/collaborate-celebrate-scotland-offer/\nAn update report to the Corporate Policy and Strategy Committee will be submitted later this year.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_10_07_briefing-traffic-figures-for-comiston-road-following-the-braid-road-closure/content_451.html": "Below is a briefing on traffic volumes on Comiston Road before and after the Braid Road closure. It was drafted by the Council in late September, but not shared with me(!). I only found out about it when a local resident raised some questions about the content!\nTraffic Figures for Comiston Road\nIt is noted that traffic levels at Morningside Station are at, near or marginally above the levels seen pre-Covid. This is shown in the traffic levels dashboard collected weekly, the most recent available data is below.\nThis is supported by recent counts of the junction compared with counts carried out in 2018 which produce the following comparison showing that although levels of traffic at this location are currently above 2019 levels, they are below levels seen in January 2018 by around 5%.\n| Morningside Station | |\n| Jan 2018 Avg Weekday Traffic | 16854 |\n| Sep 2020 Avg Weekday Traffic | 16067 |\n| Change | -787 |\n| Change % | -5% |\nIt is likely that part of the reason Morningside Station has seen traffic return to roughly normal, while some other streets continue to see reduced levels of traffic, is due to the closure of Braid Road, diverting some traffic onto the A702.\nCounts at Greenbank Crossroads suggest that the A702 corridor is seeing a slight increase in vehicle numbers. However, this increase is far smaller than the number of vehicles that have been removed from Braid Road, so overall levels of traffic in the vicinity are still notably less than they were pre-Covid.\n| Comiston Road | Braid Road | Overall | |\n| Jan 2018 Avg Weekday Traffic | 15447.5 | 9485.5 | 24933 |\n| Sep 2020 Avg Weekday Traffic | 17063 | 0 | 17063 |\n| Change | 1615.5 | -9485.5 | -7870 |\n| Change % | 10% | -100% | -32% |\nWhile traffic on Comiston Road is 10% higher than the pre-Covid baseline, 17,063 vehicles per day, compared with 15,448 vehicles per day, the increase on the A702 corridor is far smaller than the amount of traffic previously recorded using Braid Road; 9,486 vehicles per day.\nThe overall level of traffic on these two corridors is 32% less than pre-Covid levels. This means that the general level of traffic which has returned to these corridors (68% of pre-Covid) is less than the level across the city (80-90%), suggesting that the closure has achieved a level of traffic reduction/ evaporation.\nIt is considered to be a significant risk that re-opening Braid Road at this stage would induce additional journeys by car, thus adding to the overall level of traffic in the area.\nHowever, there is also a risk that if traffic across the city returns to normal levels then traffic on Comiston Road may continue to grow, possibly increasing public transport journey times and reducing air quality. Therefore, traffic levels will continue to be monitored at Morningside Station and Greenbank Junction and will inform decisions relating to existing and proposed interventions. We will also continue to liaise closely with Lothian Buses on a regular basis regarding the impact of the Braid Road closure on bus routes on the A702 corridor.\nThe completion of roadworks on the A701 has reduced the impact of diverted traffic and modifications to the traffic lights at the junctions of Greenbank Crescent and Greenbank Drive should improve the junction efficiency, mitigating the impact on bus journey times and reducing queueing times for all vehicles.\nThe road closure at Braid Road and introduction of a one-way street (except cyclists) on Braidburn Terrace has significantly reduced through traffic in the Hermitage Drive/ Braid Avenue/Midmar Drive area.\nThe development of the proposed Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Connection will consider feedback from local residents and Elected Members. Ongoing reviews of the current Braid Road closure will also consider any negative impact on the Comiston Road corridor and local residential areas. The final decision for this proposed scheme will be considered in the round taking account of any impacts holistically.\nAt its southern end the Quiet Route will run along Hermitage Drive between Braid Road and Hermitage Gardens. With Braid Road closed this link is lightly trafficked, however, were Braid Road opened this might require further intervention to ensure it was safe.\nThe Quiet Connection has been designed to cut out ‘rat-running’ traffic from streets between Cluny Gardens and Comiston Road with strategic closures. This would include diagonal closures, continuing to allow access for local traffic and services, at the junctions of Braid Road and Braid Crescent, and the junction of Cluny Drive and Hermitage Gardens, as well as a modal filter on Braid Avenue. If Braid Road remains closed, these further closures would effectively eliminate through traffic cutting through residential streets between Cluny Gardens and Comiston Road, whilst allowing local access to both roads.\nIn addition, as part of the Braid Road, Road Safety Improvement Scheme, significant resurfacing from the Braid Hills Road junction to a point near Hermitage of Braid will now begin on 12 October for a period of three weeks and will, principally, take place within the existing road closure although restrictions about Braid Farm Road and Braid Hills Road will also be required. A further area of resurfacing at the junction of Braid Road and Cluny Gardens, being co-ordinated with SGN works, has also been rescheduled to begin on 21 September 2020 for a period of three weeks.\nAs previously stated, traffic levels will continue to be monitored to ensure that any potentially negative impacts of interventions can be considered and dealt with whilst also taking into account the benefits that the holistic approach to managing traffic in the area will realise.\nNext Steps\nThe review of the current closure on Braid Road is continuing and further traffic counts will take place to assess both the continuing traffic levels on Comiston Road, and the level of cycle and pedestrian use of Braid Road.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_12_01_briefing-brown-bin-tax-mid-year-registration-open/content_233.html": "Below is a briefing from Council Officers on the mid-year garden waste collection registration process.\n1. Introduction\n- The paid garden waste collection service is in its fourth year, with the mid-year registration window opening on 1 December 2021.\n- This briefing note provides background on the service, the registration window, in particular, the upcoming mid-year window, how we are communicating with customers and the key dates around this.\n2. Key Dates\n| Mid-year window opens | 1 December at 10am |\n| Service suspended | From 20 December until 16 January |\n| Mid-year registrations processed Month registered: December January February March April May | Monthly (see section 4 below for more details) Collections start from: 1 February 1 March 29 Mar 10 May 7 June 5 July |\n| Mid-year registration closes | At least 31 May 2022 (an extended timescale is being investigated, see section 4 below for more details) |\n3. The Service\n- Any residential household within Edinburgh can register for the garden waste service during the registration windows.\n- Customers who sign up receive a fortnightly collection. The service runs from 8 November 2021 until 6 November 2022, with no collections between 20 December and 16 January. The festive break in service allows us to divert resources to other recycling and waste streams during the busy festive period.\n- The cost of the service is £35 per bin. This is a price increase from the previous £25. This is the first price increase since the charge was introduced in 2018 and is required to ensure the Council can cover its costs for delivering this collection service. The price increase was approved at Council in February 2021.\n- A customer can sign up during the mid-year registration window however the cost will remain at £35 and the permit will run until the end of this service year, which is 6 November 2022. Exemptions\n- Exemptions from paying were established at the introduction of the charge and these continue. A customer can request an exemption if they receive Council Tax Reduction (formerly called Council Tax Benefit) or are classed, or live with someone who has been classed as, severely mentally impaired. Other council tax discounts, such as single occupancy or disabled person discount, don’t qualify for this reduction. Households that pay for garden aid are not exempt from paying for the service.\n- If a customer is eligible for an exemption, they must still register during the sign-up windows in order to receive the service. Exemption eligibility is checked before the subscription is progressed, if this check highlights that the customer doesn’t qualify the registration is cancelled and the customer is contacted advising them of this and how to pay if they still want to receive the service. The subscription will be processed alongside the other registrations of the month that payment is made.\n- Once the registration month ends, and the required eligibility and data quality checks are complete, the registrations are processed onto the waste collection systems and new routes are created.\n- During the week ahead of the service commencing the customer will receive a letter, with an attached permit sticker (and additional permit stickers if more than one bin has been registered for the property), and the collection calendar for the garden waste service address. The customer’s name will also be added to the letter where it is feasible to do so.\n- From this year, customers will now have the opportunity to select whether they want this letter to be sent to their home address or their garden waste service address if they are registering for a different property. This has been a highly requested option from customers, in particular those supporting individuals with care needs and landlords registering their properties.\n- Customers are advised that if they do not receive the permit by time collections start, they should report this as soon as possible, and no later than 28 days after this date. For those registering in the main window, this would be if it has not arrived by 3 November and should be reported no later than 3 December; and those registering in the mid-year window would align to the collection start date aligned to the month registered (e.g. for a customer who registered in December this would be during February).\n- Customers are advised to attach the permit to a clean and clear part of the bin below the handles; this allows the collection crews a quick way of confirming registered bins as the colour of the permit changes each year. If the bin does not have the permit attached, it will not be emptied.\n- The permit is a tamper-proof permit meaning that, if a permit was to be ripped off the bin, it would leave behind evidence the customer had paid for that year’s collections and the part taken off becomes void.\n- Tiphereth undertake garden waste collections in the Colinton area of Edinburgh through a long-running agreement. Customers on the streets serviced by Tiphereth would still register for the service via the Council however they would receive a weekly bag collection carried out by Tiphereth.\n- We don’t offer a commercial garden waste service however internal Council sites, and a limited number of other organisations (namely bowling clubs, lawn tennis courts, and croquet clubs), can register for the garden waste service.\n- The charge remains the same as residential customers, and the registration process and timescales also remain the same.\n- The key difference for these sites is that a Waste Transfer Note (WTN) covering the collection year must also be signed before the permit is sent out and the details of this are outlined at the point of registering. The WTN is a legal requirement to ensure the Council and the business is compliant with their duty of care. Where it has not been possible to get a signed WTN back within the deadline the subscription is cancelled and the business is refunded, it is possible for them to sign up again during the registration window.\n4. How to Register\n- The quickest and easiest way to register and pay is on our website at www.edinburgh.gov.uk/gardenwaste\n- Signing in to a MyGov account is now optional in order to make the process easier, however registering without signing in will mean the customer will not see the history of their garden waste subscription on their account.\n- Residents can ask a family member, friend or neighbour to register and pay on their behalf online if they’re unable to do it themselves.\n- Customers eligible for an exemption can register using the online form, or by using the phone number below if they don’t have access to the internet or someone who can register on their behalf.\n- Anyone without access to the internet can call us on 0131 357 2800. Phone lines are open Monday to Thursday between 10am – 4pm and Friday 10am – 3.40pm. • It’s not possible for a resident to register in person at one of our locality offices. They will need to register online or by telephone instead.\n- A one-off payment of £35 (per brown bin) will be taken by debit or credit card. There is no limit to how many garden waste bins a property can have but there will be a charge of £35 per bin.\n- Aligning to corporate policy, we don’t accept cheques or cash payments.\n- Residents can share a bin with their neighbours, but they’ll need to agree on one resident acting as the lead for booking and paying for the service against their property. If there are any service issues with the shared bin (e.g. a missed collection), then this must be reported against the property with the permit.\n- Residents are encouraged to sign up early once the registration window is opened. Registrations cannot be made outside of the sign-up windows. Main Registration Window\n- To receive the service for the full collection year, (and have a continuous service if they are already a customer) residents needed to register during the main registration window using the method outlined above. This window ran from 22 July until 1 September with the collections starting from 9 November. Mid-year Registration Window\n- If a customer moves into the area after the main window closes (or they changed their mind or missed the summer window), we operate a mid-year registration window. Previously this was two weeks held around January/February, however as of this year this window will be greatly expanded opening from 1 December 2021.\n- The approach to the mid-year window was approved at Transport and Environment Committee in June 2021, with an amendment to continue the mid-year window beyond 31 May 2022 (the originally proposed close date for the mid-year window) with details of this to be reported to Transport and Environment Committee in March 2022.\n- This upcoming mid-year window will open at 10am on 1 December and will remain open until the date to be agreed in the report above.\n- Registrations will be checked during the month of registration (range of checks in place including confirming residential status, or approved commercial site; data quality; and confirming eligibility on exemption registrations).\n- Registrations will then be batched at the end of each month to be added to the collection routes and for permit(s) and calendars to be sent out before the end of the next month. The service will commence around the first two weeks of the following month. The following table below outlines this. It is expected that sign up levels will be higher in the first half of the mid-year window than then second half. With this in mind, the service will be monitoring sign up levels and review the process and timescales as numbers reduce\n| Registered | Routing and mailing | Collections start |\n| December | January | 1 February |\n| January | February | 1 March |\n| February | March | 29 Mar |\n| March | April | 10 May |\n| April | May | 7 June |\n| May | June | 5 July |\n5. Summary of Key Points\n- The mid-year registration window opens at 10am on 1 December.\n- Subscriptions will be routed in monthly batches.\n- The rate remains at £35 per bin, and the service year ends 6 November 2022.\n- Residents are encouraged to register online (or have a family member, friend or neighbour register on their behalf). The other option to register is via phone.\n- Residents cannot register in person at one of our locality offices, and cheque/cash payment will not be accepted.\n- Details of the full terms and conditions can be found here: www.edinburgh.gov.uk/gardenwaste\n6.

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2024_07_20_my-maiden-speech-as-an-mp-a-tour-of-edinburgh-south-west/content_36.html": "Below is the text of my “Maiden Speech” (see it in Hansard). The tradition is that the speech should focus on two key elements – a tribute to my predecessor and praise of my constituency. It was part of the Kings Speech debate, so I also touched on that.\nI am obliged to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to make my maiden speech. I would like to start by thanking the hon. Member for Brigg and Immingham (Martin Vickers) for a fantastic speech, but I fear that he has made my job only a little more difficult. I have to say that it is a delight to give my maiden speech in a debate led by our fantastic Deputy Prime Minister.\nIt is an honour and a privilege to stand before this House as the representative for Edinburgh South West. I am deeply grateful to my constituents for placing their trust in me and also to my church for praying for me, although I know that they prayed more after I won the election than before it. I am committed to serving them all with dedication and integrity.\nBefore I address the subject matter of the King’s Speech, I would like to pay tribute to my immediate predecessor, Joanna Cherry KC, who represented the constituency for nine years. I had many dealings with her office in my role as a councillor, and I aways found her team to be utterly professional. I wish them all well. Joanna Cherry herself was a formidable parliamentarian. Members will recall that, during the Brexit crisis, she worked hard to ensure that Government decision making remained transparent and subject to parliamentary scrutiny. We all owe her a huge debt for that. I must also say that, although I disagree with her on many issues, I am happy to stand in complete solidarity with her in the face of the threats that she has faced. It pains me that, since coming here, so many others have spoken about threats and intimidation as well. This is an issue that we must take seriously. I must, however, tell the House that the campaign for Edinburgh South West between Joanna Cherry and myself was conducted entirely on the issues that matter to local people there, which is perhaps why I am so proud to be here to address the House today.\nI must also pay tribute to my predecessor’s predecessor. Alistair Darling was one of the greatest public servants of my lifetime. He sat here from 1987 to 2015. Like me, he was a councillor in Edinburgh, and convener of the city’s transport committee before he went on to serve as MP for Edinburgh South West. The similarities may end there. Indeed, we must all hope that I am never called on, as he was, to save the Bank of England. I know that Alistair is still much missed and I am proud to follow in his footsteps—indeed, without his help I doubt that I would have been elected as a councillor in 2017.\nBefore I address myself to the debate, I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to my constituency, its institutions and its people. At this point, Members may need a map. Edinburgh South West is the best part of the greatest city in the world. It stretches from the west end of Princes Street to the East Cairn hill, some 18 km to the south-west. Along its length, the constituency moves from dense urban communities—places such as Gorgie, the home of Hearts football club, Dalry, Parkhead, Wester Hailes, Sighthill and Oxgangs—to suburban settlements such as Colinton, Craiglockhart, Swanston and Baberton Mains, and to the semi-rural Water of Leith villages of Currie, Juniper Green and Balerno.\nOf all those, Oxgangs is perhaps the place I know and love most. Many people there struggle in temporary and overcrowded accommodation; that is why it has been so important today to hear about the Deputy Prime Minister’s ambition to build affordable homes. In Edinburgh, we have worked with the whole city and set aside land for 37,000 new homes. The land is there and the planning is there, but the barrier to building those new homes is the lack of funding from the Scottish Government. I hope that they can now follow what we are doing here, and show more ambition on affordable housing in Scotland.\nWhen it comes to natural beauty, the Pentland hills and the Water of Leith dominate my constituency, and the habitats along the Union canal should not be forgotten. But of course it is the people who make my constituency so special, such as those who volunteer at the Water of Leith Conservation Trust or who converted a disused railway tunnel into Scotland’s largest historical mural—the Colinton tunnel; please google it later. I must also mention Tiphereth, a unique charity that delivers residential and day services for people with learning difficulties. It really is unique.\nThe Edinburgh campus of Heriot-Watt University is perhaps the biggest employer in my constituency. It supported and developed me every day from when I started working there in 1996 until I was elected to this place. I shall miss my civil engineering colleagues and the many students it welcomes to Scotland from around the world. I hope to use some of my time here to support higher education, particularly the wellbeing of students. Mental health support in Scotland is failing its young people and acting as a barrier to many of them reaching their full potential. I will work with anyone and everyone to address that and the many other challenges facing students across the UK.\nOther large employers in my constituency include Lothian Buses, a bus company owned by the people of Edinburgh that defines the city just as much as the castle. I should stress that the castle is not in my constituency. If some Members question municipal ownership of public transport, or the importance of collaborative working between trade unions and management, they should speak to some of the 2 million passengers that Lothian Buses carries every week without any subsidy. Big businesses are also important in my constituency, but it is the small ones that define it. They are at the heart of many of the neighbourhoods. Many have high hopes that the UK and Scottish Governments will now work together to support them more.\nI am also proud to say that there are two infantry barracks in my constituency: Dreghorn and Redford. Both are valued by local residents as real assets, and they never caused me a problem as a councillor. The proposal in the King’s Speech for an armed forces commissioner will be supported by many in my constituency, particularly if it helps improve the living quarters for our service personnel and supports spouses at the point of relationship breakdown, particularly when domestic abuse has been an issue.\nElections are a reminder that we are all equal in this country, but it pained me that many constituents felt that they were less equal than others during the election campaign. That is why local groups in my constituency such as Soul Food Oxgangs, Best Bib n Tucker and Whale Arts must be mentioned in my speech, as they all work hard to ensure that people feel included and valued. That is our job too, of course—indeed, all of us here have a duty to keep on listening to voters now that the election is over. The first-past-the-post system means that I was elected on just 40.9% of the vote—I still cannot believe it, to be honest—and I know that some of those voters still want to be reassured that they did the right thing. I am here only because I promised to work with other parties where possible, and to listen to everybody in my constituency, no matter their sex, gender, background, faith, age or birthplace. I will keep listening to people, even if they voted for my opponents or did not vote at all.\nWe know, of course, that the people who need our help most did not vote for us. Among them are the 3,000 children in my constituency who are living in poverty. That number has grown across the whole UK since Labour last sat on the Government Benches, and that should shame us all. I know the costed measures in the King’s Speech are our best chance of changing those lives.\nMeasures such as GB Energy, building more homes, a new deal for working people and our plans for sustainable economic growth will not just get our country back on track and help us to meet our climate targets, but give parents hope again of a better future for their children. The child poverty taskforce is an opportunity to maximise the benefits of those policies by integrating their delivery. That is the change our country needs and voted for, and we must now work together across this Chamber to deliver it.",

It does note, however, that a “public petition with over 1,000 signatures opposing the proposals was submitted to Councillors on 12 October“.\nIt appears that many comments have been dismissed or dealt with superficially – this is particularly true of comments raised by Community Councils and disability groups.\nFor example, the Edinburgh Access Panel say: “Please ensure the provision of access and parking for blue badge holders in the roads affected by your proposals is at least equivalent to the current provision“.

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_12_23_give-edinburgh-some-independence-let-it-set-a-hotel-tax_comment-page-1/content_452.html": "By rejecting the call for Edinburgh to be given the power to set a hotel tax, Fiona Hyslop MSP is ignoring the wishes of Edinburgh’s citizens and siding with multi-national hotel chains (Report, 23/12/17). Outrageous!\nI have lived in Edinburgh since 1996 and it fills me with pride that it can attract people from around the world. Walking around our Capital’s streets, however, I also feel a little ashamed about what international visitors see. Our roads are potholed. Too often, our footpaths are grubby and the bins are overflowing.\nThis is not a criticism of the City of Edinburgh Council’s hardworking staff. Budgets have been cut year on year by the SNP Government.\nWorse than that, the SNP Government limits the ability of Edinburgh to raise revenues in the same way cities around the world are able to. Our SNP Government want independence, but give none to our Capital. Hypocrisy!\nLike Rome, New York, Vienna, Amsterdam and Paris, Edinburgh attracts tourist from around the world in droves. In 2014 3,795,000 tourists visited Edinburgh and stayed an average of 3.5 days – that’s 13 million overnight stays.\nUnlike Rome, New York, Vienna, Amsterdam and Paris, however, Edinburgh has no hotel tax. If you stay a night in a New York hotel, the city gains $15. Likewise, in Paris a night in its very best hotel sees that city gain a more modest €1.20.\nEdinburgh’s Labour Councillors are arguing for our Capital to be given the right to set a hotel tax and use the income to make the city a better place for tourists and residents alike.\nA night in an Edinburgh hotel costs from £10 to an eye-watering £1000, with most rooms falling within the £90 to £175 band. Taxing overnight stays in larger establishments at a modest 1% would not impact on the ability of Edinburgh to attract tourists, but would raise £10-20 million for the city.\nA modest tax on this industry would help reverse the cuts to services and help ensure Edinburgh continues to attract people from around the world to visit, study or work.",

Additionally, I have asked again if a copy of the Road Safety Audit be made available to Councillors.\n06.08.20 Update 1 – The Council have not yet provided the Road Safety Audit but they have forwarded the “Designers Risk Assessment for this project”. Please let me know if you want any risks added:\n06.08.20 Update 2 – The Council have agreed to my request that Community Councils attend the meeting, but have refused to let local residents contribute: “It was agreed at an early stage that the SfP programme would not be subject to the normal consultation processes and instead would focus on expedited engagement with Stakeholders – including ward Cllrs and other key groups such as Community Councils. Residents are not invited to attend the meeting.”\n06.08.20 Update 3 – The Council have confirmed there is little scope to change the plans: “…the intention of the meeting is to answer questions on the project. The project designs have been amended in several locations following the notifications process, mostly to increase the amount of available on street parking and also to reduce the speed limit from 40mph to 30mph.”\nBriefing\nPlease accept this invitation to a Microsoft Teams meeting to discuss the Comiston Road Spaces for People project.\nAs you are aware this project was approved by the Council’s CIMT for delivery on the 17th of July. Following approval for delivery we have been working on appointing a contractor for Phase 1 of this scheme which will involve lining and ‘Orange Cylinders’ in advance of full delivery later in Autumn.\nThis project is due to commence on site on Thursday 13 August and will be the second to be delivered from the ‘Travelling Safely’ section of Spaces for People, following Ferry Road which commenced on site on Monday 3August.\nWe are aware of various queries and concerns which have been raised by local councillors and residents regarding this project. The aim of this meeting will be to answer questions on the project proposals, and outline the anticipated project programme moving forward.\nFor ease I have attached the post CIMT Notification Letter for this project, which includes the approval form. You can also find the designs for Phase 1, and Phase 2 at the links below.\nWe hope that you are able to join us and that you find this meeting interesting and useful.\nPhase 1 – Commencing Thursday 13th Aug\nPhase 2 – Commencing later in Autumn\nThanks a lot, we look forward to speaking with you soon.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_03_02_shooting-for-the-moon-thoughts-on-taking-the-trams-to-newhaven-in-a-binary-political-world/content_508.html": "Below are my current views, thoughts and concerns on the plan to complete the tramline to Newhaven – the “Newhaven Proposal”. I am not expecting everyone to agree with me, but I hope people will respect the fact that I have thought about it before reaching a view.\nWe apparently live in a binary world. People are Yes or No. They are Leave or Remain. In Edinburgh, they are either for or against completing the tramline to Newhaven.\nThe reality is different, however. Just like on many other binary arguments, most people are stuck in the middle between hardcore “extremists” on the tram debate. On one side we have people that want to extend the line at any cost, and on the other we have those that oppose it ideologically no matter what the benefits. For those groups, it’s an easy decision and those that oppose them just don’t get it. I actually envy their certainty.\nThat’s why it’s worth looking at the Final Business Case (FBC) prepared by the Council on extending the tram. It makes the case for the project, but it does so in a way that acknowledges the uncertainties and risks. It makes clear that what is needed is a considered judgment, not a knee-jerk decision.\nThe headline cost is £207.3m – this includes the Capital costs to completion (£156.7m), Support for business (£1.9m), Development costs (£5.5m), Risk (£31.9m) and Optimism Bias (£11.9m). It is acknowledged, however, that there is a 20% chance that the project costs will exceed £207.3m. Indeed, a more conservative approach to assessing the potential for the project to go over budget suggests there is 20% chance of the project costs exceeding £257.3m(!), and a 5% chance of it exceeding £334.8m(!!).\nThe Council Officers should be congratulated for presenting the costs in this way. They have chosen not to simply put a price ticket on it, but instead have sought to communicate the uncertainty in a responsible manner. The clear aim is to deliver the project for £207.3m, but their approach is clear that there is a 1 in 5 chance of a cost overrun.\nNonetheless, even if the project does hit £257.3m it is still estimated to deliver £1.25 of benefit for every £1 spent – i.e. a Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) of 1.25 . If the final cost is £207.3m, the BCR is 1.4. Whilst this is positive, a BCR of 1.25-1.4 is technically “low value for money“.\nAlthough it is hard to compare the proposal with other projects as a lot of work had already been undertaken on the extension route (2007-14), it is in line with other light rail/tram projects such as Nottingham Express Transit Extension (BCR = 2), Leeds Supertram (BCR = 2.0), Sydney Light Rail (BCR = 0.8), Newcastle (Australia, BCR = 0.5), Forrestfield Airport Link (BCR = 1.4 ) and ACT Capital Metro (BCR = 0.5).\nWith all the focus on costs, it is important to remember that this project will deliver significant benefits. Leith is one of the most densely populated and deprived areas in Scotland and it is already congested. Making it easier to move people around is key to developing brownfield sites in northern Edinburgh. The tram will link these key development sites with key employment areas (City Centre, Edinburgh Park and the Airport). Let me be clear, developing these brownfield sites in north Edinburgh will take pressure off the greenbelt in my Ward (Colinton-Oxgangs-Fairmilehead).\nSince 2016 the city has been planning for an additional 47,000 people by 2024, and an additional 102,000 by 2039, taking the total population from 492,610 to 594,712 over the 25-year period from 2014 to 2039.\nThis is a breath-taking pace, and such a pace cannot help but create new ills as it dispels old, new ignorance, new problems and new dangers. So it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest, to wait. But our city was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them.\nThe question is how we accommodate this growth, and it can’t be done by expecting everyone to drive around our capital. We have one of the UK’s best bus services, but is needs to improve. In parallel, we need to improve safety for those that are able to travel by foot and bike – particularly for children going to school. We can and must do all these things, but the FBC makes the case for the tram being the best way to add capacity for the congested route to Newhaven. Without it, the FBC is clear that congestion and pollution will constrain economic development.\nWhilst these arguments hold water, the Edinburgh Tram has a troubled history. We once had an excellent network (many buses cover the same routes today), but the most recent incarnation has been a national embarrassment. A mixture of schoolboy errors and poor governance structures led to Edinburgh getting a fraction of the expected line at a much higher cost (from £375 million to the final £776m) than was ever feared. As a result, in 2014 the SNP Government set up the Hardie Inquiry in to the shambles, with Alex Salmond claiming with his customary bravado it would be “swift and thorough” and would cost an estimated £1m. Almost 5 years later it has still to report, and the costs look likely to exceed the £10.2m the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq War cost. All this may well be legitimate, but it feels like insult is being added to injury.\nThe monumental disaster we witnessed on our streets between July 2007 and May 2014 has three direct impacts on the proposal to complete the line to Newhaven:\n- The public lost trust in the Council. This means that the Newhaven Proposal has come under significant scrutiny by a sceptical public and a new intake of Councillors. Whilst the Tram Team has welcomed the feedback, it is notable that other larger items of expenditure are subject to a far lower level of scrutiny (e.g. I have seen no questions about the £874.112m planned spend on Council Housing in Edinburgh over the next 5 years, or the £200m the Council plans to invest in schools).\n- Lesson were learned by the Council. Unlike the 2007 project, the Newhaven Proposal will use standard contracts, the project team will have light rail experience, roads will only be closed once, robust quantitative risk analysis has been undertaken and there has been significant community engagement. It is important to note that Turner & Townsend was appointed by Edinburgh City Council to manage the project after Transport Initiatives Edinburgh was disbanded in August 2011, and after the 2012 Council elections a Labour led Council replaced the SNP/LibDem Coalition – this meant political control of the project fell to Councillor Lesley Hinds (not a passive character). Not only did she demand that the Scottish Government allow concessionary tram travel for Edinburgh’s older citizens, she had oversight of the project whilst it continued mostly on schedule and budget. Although Lesley Hinds has retired, the core Tram Team she worked with 2012-14 is behind the Newhaven Proposal and the FBC.\n- Safety issues for pedestrians and cyclists are now better understood. There has been a great deal of focus on improving safety along the existing line, and those lessons have been reflected in the Newhaven Proposal. It is notable that there has been significant constructive engagement with Community Councils, Ward Councillors, Living Streets Edinburgh and SPOKES about the detailed design of the public areas around the route. Whilst I don’t expect any of these groups are absolutely happy, I think all will agree there have been significant improvements over the original proposals (I was clear that I could not support these).\nAlthough the case for backing the Newhaven Proposal does, on balance, have some merit I do still have concerns, and these are detailed below.\n- Optimism Bias – Although the people behind big projects are highly rational and logical, it is recognised that the human brain is sometimes too optimistic for its own good – something we all suffer from at times! To counter this, a 6% “Optimism Bias” has been added to the project. Although this equates to £11.9m, it is at the very bottom of the 6%-66% range recommended for “Non-standard Civil Engineering” projects. It is argued that this is because the project is at an advanced stage and many lessons have been learned from the 2007-14 debacle. However, there are two significant unknowns that could have real impact on the project: the “swift and thorough” Hardie Inquiry recommendations; and, the ongoing Brexit shambles.\nAlthough the Hardie Inquiry are recommendations considered in the FBC as an unknown cost, there is no mention of Brexit. An earlier version of the FBC (AKA the Outline Business Case) made this comment: “…there is a risk that uncontrollable economic and market factors adversely affect the type, structure and overall cost of borrowing the Council is able to gain access to. Two significant events that are likely to be a factor in this are the impact of Brexit and the announcement and timing of any potential second Scottish Independence Referendum.” In a review of the FBC for the Council, Scott-Moncreiff say the Tram Team “has excluded uncertainty surrounding Brexit from its Quantitative Risk Analysis over the construction costs and the potential impact of Brexit has not specifically been referred to within the FBC or financial model.”. - Sensitivity Analysis – The FBC considers the “sensitivity” of the project finances, by varying key parameters (such as travel time and economic development) and assessing the impact on the BCR. The analysis, as presented, only varies these parameters one at a time in simple “what if” scenarios and does not consider outcomes where two or more parameters vary. Scott-Moncreiff made this comment: “We note that the FBC analyses the sensitivity of each of these components individually, and does not consider the cumulative impact of more than one of these components.”\n- Environmental Impact Statement – This apparently has not been updated since 2003 and the FBC makes the point that earlier work “implicitly suggests” that there were no “unacceptable” environmental impacts. This is hardly reassuring.\n- Strategic Support – The project is of strategic importance to Scotland’s capital and the wider region, yet the Council is expected to fund it with no support from the Scottish Government. Additionally, Transport Scotland have made no comment on the FBC (nor has comment been sought). I find this highly questionable, particularly when this is seen within the context of the £125m the Scottish Government gave the Council (without it even asking) in the City Deal to upgrade Sheriffhall Roundabout.\n- Lothian Buses – The £207.3m for the project will be funded by ticket income from the new/existing line and a £20m (£2m per year for 10 years) exceptional dividend from Lothian Buses. There is concern that the impact of paying the exceptional dividend combined with losing passenger income along the Newhaven line will place undue pressure on Lothian Buses.\n- Alternative Projects – Although it should be noted that the Newhaven Proposal should put no demand on existing council budgets, it is true that the ticket income and exceptional dividend could be spent in other ways with the aim of delivering similar benefits, perhaps on a wider scale. The aim of this project appears to have been focused on extending the line, rather than delivering the benefits associated with it.\nConclusion\nIn summation, I hope I have shown the project does have significant benefits and a degree of uncertainty associated with it, but how those are balanced is tainted by the 2007-11 segment of the 2007-14 project. What is clear, however, is that there is a need to cut congestion and stimulate development in the north of Edinburgh, and right now completing the tramline to Newhaven appears to be the best way of doing that. I say that accepting that the £207.3m target price (BCR = 1.4) has a 1 in 5 chance of being exceeded, but in the knowledge that the Council has a £50m contingency in place if needed (BCR = 1.25).\nNote\nThe full set of CEC papers on the Newhaven Proposal are here.",

I have ask Council Officers about this as Lothian Road is used by a number of bus services serving my Ward, some of which are already being delayed by the Braid/Comiston Road Spaces for People scheme (this is under review, but I spotted no problems today). The response from Officers on the resurfacing plans is below.\nLothian Road Resurfacing Works\nFirstly I can confirm that we are well aware of the issues at George IV Bridge and have been working with the Network Management team to determine a way forward.\nIt’s not simply a question of postponing the works. As the work is being undertaken by a third-party contractor there would be a cost involved in rescheduling the works, possibly requiring us to go back out to tender and delaying the work by several weeks.\nI am pleased to report, however, that we have been in discussion with the contractor over the last couple of days and have determined a way to reconfigure the work to enable us to delay the introduction of the proposed temporary traffic lights at the Fountainbridge/East Fountainbridge junction which were planned to be in place from Monday 6 September. This will mitigate the impact of the work in the short term.\nWe are now looking at implementing them at some stage week commencing 13 September instead, when the situation at George IV Bridge will hopefully be clearer.\nThe work at Lothian Road next week will concentrate on the removal of the existing Spaces for People measures on Earl Grey Street along with gully replacement works which will require only a single lane closure. Lothian Buses have been involved in these discussions and are supportive of the revised proposals.\nWe will continue to monitor the situation over the forthcoming days and weeks.",

Tory social security changes werefound to be a key cause.\nIts reports like that which forced Councillor Graczyk to speak out. They question is why are Ruth Davidson MSP and Councillor Whyte, who leads Edinburgh’s downsized group of Tory Councillors, being so quiet?\nIt is not just the Tories who should be explaining themselves. In the past year we’ve see how Council cuts imposed by the SNP on Edinburgh have been felt by many residents in our capital living with a disability.\nIndeed, I have a blind constituent who already must pay the Council to cut his grass. On top of that he’s now being asked to pay £25 to have the clippings collected.\nTo help mitigate these SNP cuts, the nationalist Councillors in Edinburgh have backed Labour’s call to give our capital the right to set a modest tourist tax on hotel stays.\nAfter going cap in hand to his party’s elite, Edinburgh’s SNP Council Leader Adam McVey announced boldly on Twitter that “In the next 12 months our plans for a tourist tax will be ready for implementation”.\nHowever, a mere 32 minutes later Fiona Hyslop MSP (Cabinet Secretary for Tourism) slapped him down saying: “So let’s be clear – you have no shared plans, no tourist business consultation and no agreement with the Scottish Gov.”.\nIt appears Edinburgh and Councillor McVey need to know their place!\nI was left wondering if Councillor McVey should follow Councillor Graczyk and leave his party in order to stand up for the people of Edinburgh?",

Council Officers report that there is a “huge backlog” – average turnaround time for a repair is 20 working days.\nIn 2018/19, 3,523 lights in Colinton/Fairmilehead will be replaced with “Energy Efficient Luminaire”. These should be more reliable and be cheaper to run – Win-Win!\nBelow is a briefing I received from Council Officers on the current problem:\nNote – Edinburgh has over 64,000 street lights.\nStreet Lighting Faults\nStreet lighting faults are currently prioritised into four categories:\n- Emergency Repairs made safe within 4 hours (i.e. life and limb situations)\n- Priority Repairs completed within 24 hours (6 or more consecutive dark lights)\n- Five-day Repairs (5 or less consecutive dark lights)\n- 28-day Repairs\nResources\nAll street lighting fault repairs are undertaken by Edinburgh Road Services (ERS), who deploy seven Approved Electricians and five Public Lighting Operatives across the city. ERS are currently carrying five vacancies for Approved Electricians and are experiencing difficulties in recruiting suitable staff.\nPerformance\nMost recent Figures (for September ’17) highlight the following performance:\n| Performance Indicator | Target | Performance |\n| % of Street Lighting Emergency Repairs made safe within 4 hours | 95% | 96.1% |\n| % of Street Lighting Priority Repairs completed within 24 hours | 75% | 74.1% |\n| % of Street Lighting 5-day Repairs completed in time | 70% | 55.9% |\n| % of Street Lighting 28-day Repairs completed in time | 95% | 97.8% |\nOwing to the low level of performance (especially in response to Street Lighting 5-day Repairs), the Edinburgh Road Services Manager has issued the following statement:\nDue to the volume of Street Lighting repairs, it is currently taking an average of 20 working days to attend Street Lighting reports.\nWe are improving this, but in the meantime apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.\nRecruitment\nExternal recruitment is being repeated, Employment Agencies have been engaged to source suitable staff, an existing Professional Services Framework is being used to source labour and the temporary contracting of a street lighting repair service is being explored.\nScottish Power Faults\nWith around 40% of the Council’s street lighting assets connected directly to a Scottish Power supply, power supply problems are outside the control of the Council.\nAs such, Scottish Power Networks’ target response times are:\n| Service | Performance Level |\n| Emergency Fault Repair Response | Attend site within 2 hours |\n| High Priority Fault Repair – Traffic Light Controlled | Within 2 calendar days |\n| High Priority Fault Repair – non-Traffic Light Controlled | Within 10 working days |\n| Multiple Unit Fault Repair | Within 20 working days |\n| Single Unit Fault Repairs | Within 25 working days |\nEnergy Efficient Street Lighting Programme\nThe Council is currently procuring a Contract for the conversion of its existing street lights to energy efficient lanterns. It is anticipated that the 35-month Contract will be awarded in January 2018, with the Contract being completed by 31 December 2020.\nThe Contract includes the introduction of a Central Management System, which will allow the street lights to be remotely monitored and improve responsiveness to lantern failures.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_07_20_lets-make-the-edinburgh-city-deal-for-the-many-not-the-few/content_139.html": "Winning the Edinburgh City Region Deal is a huge achievement. Great credit for this must go to Labour’s Andrew Burns for leading the bid and Edinburgh’s Chief Executive, Andrew Kerr, for his vision.\nIf truth be told, however, Edinburgh hoped for more. Edinburgh deserved more.\nIt was hoped that the City Region Deal would be worth over £1.5b, instead the SNP and Tory Governments each gave our Capital City £300m.\nWhilst £600m over 15 years is very welcome, it has to be placed within the context of the year-on-year cuts inflicted on Edinburgh and its people by the SNP and Tory Governments – this amounts to hundreds of millions. How many of the families falling into poverty due to those cuts will be seated alongside Nicola Sturgeon and Theresa May at the opening night of their new £20m Concert Hall in St Andrews Square?\nFurthermore, back in May we heard, without a whimper of opposition from Edinburgh SNP, that the Scottish Government had decided that the City Deal would not fund the tram extension. We now find, however, that it will fund a £120m upgrade of the City Bypass. This neither falls within the remit of the region’s councils nor, I understand, was it part of the City Region Deal bid. The SNP Government is arguably short-changing Edinburgh by making the already planned upgrade of Sheriffhall Interchange part of the deal simply to inflate its finances.\nNonetheless, the support for building more homes is very welcome indeed. I’ll be arguing that as many as possible of these homes are affordable – and I mean genuinely affordable. They must also be energy efficient, sustainable and set within developments which have consideration for active transport at the core of their design. Above all else, we must have adequate infrastructure to support them – schools, GPs, etc.\nLet’s make those homes the Edinburgh City Region Deal legacy, not the black tarmac of the upgraded bypass or the glittering chandelier of the Concert Hall. Let’s make it for the many, not the few.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_06_12_checking-the-small-print-on-scotlands-proposed-pavement-parking-ban/content_489.html": "I was delighted to read that the Scottish Government is at last considering giving Scotland’s councils the powers to deal with Pavement Parking and Double Parking (Report, 12/06/18).\nPavement Parking in particular is a real problem across our Capital. As well as causing problems to people with mobility issues and parents with buggies, it also causes significant damage to our footpaths. Based on the regular correspondence I receive from constituents on this issue, I expect the ban will be warmly welcomed by many in Edinburgh.\nIt is worth looking in more detail, however, at what is actually being proposed. Like any rule, there are exceptions. Unsurprisingly, the Police and other emergency services are exempt. It also appears that the Royal Mail, AA, RAC and bin lorries are also worthy of special consideration where there is no “reasonable” alternative.\nMost surprisingly, Subsection C of Clause 6 on Page 58 makes provision for exemption where vehicles are “parked for no longer than is necessary for the delivery, collection, loading or unloading and in any event for no more than a continuous period of 20 minutes.” This basically means that vehicles of unlimited size can continue to cause a hazard to pedestrians and damage to the pavement as long as goods or people are being loaded or unloaded.\nIt appears the only targets of this Bill are householders.\nOf course, the “reasonable” test is important. It is, however, rather subjective and has to be viewed within the context of a culture where everyone who currently parks on footpaths feels it is reasonable to do so – even where it is outside a primary school!\nAn issue secondary to these exemptions is the cost of enforcement and the associated public education campaign. Budget cuts mean the city is already struggling to enforce the current parking regime, so let’s hope these new powers come with the resources to enforce them.",

The reality is that Council Tax is going up and school budgets are going down due to Scottish Government cuts.\nThe Scottish Government has forced £590m of new commitments on to Councils, but have given them only £495m to undertake the work. Edinburgh has a £35m black hole to fill.\nIt is heart-breaking that the poorest people in Edinburgh will feel the impact of this most. The Oxgangs area of my Ward alone will see:\n- Over ninety-thousand pounds slashed from school budgets;\n- A threat to nursery teacher posts;\n- Community policing cut,\n- Local library opening hours cut; and,\n- The unfair Council Tax will rise by almost 5%.\nThe cuts in schools kids in my Ward attend are roughly as follows:\n- Bonaly Primary – £17,000\n- Buckstone Primary – £18,000\n- Colinton Primary – £7,000\n- Juniper Green Primary – £13,000\n- Oxgangs Primary – £10,000\n- Pentland Primary – £14,000\n- St Mark’s Primary – £4,000\n- St Peter’s Primary – £15,000\n- Boroughmuir High School – £75,000\n- Currie High School – £45,000\n- Balerno High School – £45,000\n- Firrhill High School – £70,000\n- St. Thomas of Aquin’s High School – £45,000\nA cut to libraries is a cut to education and well-being, and will only increase social isolation. When I was elected in 2017 I pledged to voters in my ward that I would protect library opening hours, and I don’t see that changing.\nHow can the head-teacher at Firrhill High School in my Ward raise attainment when Scottish Government cuts will mean his budget is cut by £70,000?\nThe SNP Government must think again. Please write to your MSP and ask him/her to block this budget. For people in my Ward, that’s Gordon MacDonald MSP and he plans to back the cuts.\nThe draft Council budget overview is here.",

The speed limit will be reduced to 30mph (Good news!).\nIf you look at the linked file a great many comments were made, but the response does not always contain the detail I had hoped for. I am also disappointed that the Council has refused to view this plan alongside the Braid Road closure and demonstrate some “joined up thinking” in doing so.\nMe: Will Braid Road remain closed? Has the interaction with Braid Road been fully considered?\nCouncil: Braid Road will be considered separately on its own merits.\nBriefing\nThank you for your comments regarding the proposed emergency road measures on Comiston Road. Comments have been reviewed and a summary of comments is included in the attached assessment feedback form to the Council Incident Management Team (CIMT). Following consideration by the CIMT on 17 July 2020 the proposals have been approved for implementation.\nOfficers will be monitoring all the temporary measures and will make adjustments as necessary to mitigate any impacts.\nInitially, these measures will be implemented using road markings and temporary traffic management materials (such as those used on Old Dalkeith Road, and Crewe Road South) only, in order to implement the changes as soon as possible. We are in the process of appointing contractors and expect this work to commence during early August – though timelines may be subject to change. At this time there will be no changes to bus stops and the layout on street may differ from the approved designs at some locations.\nThereafter the Council will deliver the changes outlined in the designs in full. This delay is due to the limited availability of some of the required materials, including the ‘Greenwich Wand Orcas’ which will separate cycles from traffic, and the materials which will be used for several of the Bus Stops. We expect that these more robust measures will be implemented during Autumn/ Winter, though this may also be subject to change.\nFurther information about how the Council is implementing temporary road measures to support safe walking, wheeling and cycling is available at www.edinburgh.gov.uk/spacesforpeople\nRegards\nSpaces for People Team\nFiles",

This simply is not credible.\nThe proposal takes no account of the concerns of residents living in communities adjacent to business areas such, as Edinburgh Park and Fairmilehead, where WPL may generate anti-social displacement parking. Why would staff pay £500 per year to park at the Scottish Water (say) site in Fairmilehead, when you can park in adjacent streets for free?\nThe SNP/Greens have also not addressed the concerns of Trade Unions regarding the impact that their indiscriminate WPL would have on low paid workers working anti-social hours with no access to public transport.\nNottingham introduced the UK’s only WPL in 2011, but traffic volume has grown faster (10%) there over the past decade or so since then than in Edinburgh (7%). It is clear that the WPL has generated cash in Nottingham, but it’s impact on congestion is less clear. Indeed, the focus of the proposal SNP/Green appears to be taxing (and thereby gentrifying) unwanted behaviours (rather than ending them) to help mitigate SNP/Green Government cuts – this is incompatible with Edinburgh’s commitment (and moral duty) to tackle the climate emergency.\nMaybe what was right for Nottingham in 2011, is not right for Edinburgh today. As Transport Convener I prefer to look to cities like Paris, where the politicians are working with residents to reduce traffic volume by investing in public and active transport. They don’t simply tax unwanted traffic, they provide a sustainable alternative – this plan will result in 70,000 parking spaces being unneeded. I offered the SNP/Greens Paris as a destination, but they chose Nottingham.\nI am a democrat, so I must respect the fact the the majority of Councillors backed the SNP/Green plan. Nonetheless, before the end of 2022 I hope to present Labour’s vision for the biggest expansion in public transport our capital has seen this century – inc tram, bus lanes and park & ride schemes. We will listen to residents on this issue, and work with them and surrounding local authorities to transform and decarbonise the transportation system in our capital. We will take Edinburgh forward.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_05_30_why-wont-the-snp-stand-up-for-edinburgh_comment-page-1/content_334.html": "Councillor McVey is the SNP Group Leader in City of Edinburgh Council and aspires to lead the council. In this role he would have a duty to put Edinburgh before Nicola Sturgeon.\nI’m therefore disappointed to see him buckle so readily when his party’s elite suggest they will remove funding from the City Region Deal for the £162 tram extension down Leith Walk and on to Newhaven (report, 30/05/17). Instead he argues that the project should be funded by city debt and potential fare increases. This flies in the face of the SNP manifesto commitment to ensure the extension is delivered “without placing undue pressure on the city’s finances”.\nWhilst the SNP’s claim to be “Stronger for Scotland” may now be rather questionable, Mr McVey is certainly not stronger for Edinburgh.\nLike many people, I had my doubts about the original tram project and want any bungling in the past exposed. However, I’m in no doubt that the tram extension will help boost some of Edinburgh’s most deprived areas and assist in the revitalisation of Leith Walk. It will also make large parts of northern Edinburgh more attractive to developers and, therefore, take some pressure off our green belt.\nTo make this reality, however, Councillor McVey needs to remember the commitment his party made to the City Region Deal in the past and stand up for Edinburgh!\nAbove all else, Edinburgh needs a leader that puts Edinburgh first. With the uncertainty that comes with Brexit and IndyRef2, the last thing our capital needs is a leader that’s in Nicola Sturgeon’s pocket.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_07_17_rent-pressure-zones-good-but-not-a-magic-bullet/content_74.html": "Ben Macpherson MSP appears to have a very short memory (Comment, 17/07/17). Yes, the SNP did legislate to allow the introduction of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) in Scotland. They did so, however, only after concerted lobbying from Shelter, Crisis, the Greens and Labour.\nIndeed, the initial plan proposed by the SNP Government meant that it could reject any application to create a RPZ without even having to give a reason for doing so – it took a Green amendment to stop that.\nFurthermore, it was not the SNP that championed the creation of RPZs in our Capital City. The motion was brought by Cllr Susan Rae (Greens) and was supported by the Labour Group.\nAlthough a RPZ will limit the activities of the worst landlords, it is important to note that it won’t stop the continuation of the 25% increase in rents we’ve seen over the past 6 years. This is because that rise is entirely due to new lets, and the RPZ legislation the SNP brought forward only applies to sitting tenants on the new “Private Residential Tenancy” agreements.\nFurthermore, the legislation limits rent increases to inflation plus 1% (unless otherwise specified higher). With inflation currently at 2.9%, that would mean new tenancies could increase by 25.8% over a six year period. There would be riots if mortgage payments rose at that rate – particularly when most people’s pay is not rising with inflation.\nSo whilst RPZs may be welcome, they are not a magic bullet. What’s really needed is more affordable housing – and I mean genuinely affordable. In particular, the supply of accommodation in the rented sector must be increased.\nThat’s why I won’t be letting the SNP Government water down its commitment to build 50,000 new affordable homes with “refurbishments” as they plan.\nI have also asked the City of Edinburgh Council if there’s a business case for buying back former council houses at the market rate as they come up for sale (thanks Sheila). I believe that this would both increase the availability of rented accommodation and cut the amount of Housing Benefit filling the pockets of private landlords.\nWe need a rented sector in Edinburgh that works for the many, not the few.",

I wrote it in response to yet another negative press article about our poll rating in Scotland.\nWithout a doubt these are tough times for Labour in the UK in general and in Scotland specifically. Nonetheless, I’m standing as a Labour candidate in May as ordinary Scots need Labour now more than ever.\nSince I joined Labour in October 2014 it has faced unprecedented electoral “challenges”. We’ve gained thousands of new members, but lost elections on an epic scale. The reasons for this are legion, but they can be traced back to long before the independence referendum. My own view is that the rot started when Tony Blair took us to war in Iraq – that is where we lost the trust of many voters.\nThat does not mean the Blair/Brown governments did not do great things. Doubling NHS spending and lifting 2 million people out of poverty are non-trivial achievements.\nAt the same time Scottish Labour reformed the NHS, rebuilt schools on an industrial scale and banned smoking in public places. What have the SNP and Tories done since then to match our transformative zeal? Divided Scotland and the UK respectively.\nIn 2016 the electorate listened to Labour’s message – Kezia Dugdale set the agenda with a cohesive narrative built around Labour values. The problem was it was overshadowed in the closing weeks of the campaign by the threat of a second independence referendum. The rest is history, a horrible history.\nSeven months after our defeat, the support we lost to the nationalists is beginning to wake up to the SNP’s indifference to social justice, but the constitutional arguments and a lack of trust in Labour remain barriers to them supporting us. There is no sign of the tide of popular support returning as quickly as it left us.\nNonetheless, we can’t afford to weaken further if everyone in Scotland is to have the chance to reach their full potential. We can’t let the challenges we face wear us down. We can’t abandon the people the Labour party was established to protect who are trapped right now between two forms of ugly nationalism.\nAlthough their politics are dissimilar, both the Tory Brexiteers and the SNP are using turbo-charged nationalist rhetoric to fight for different forms of independence. Like Trump, both are intent on blaming others for the problems we face. Both assume the moral high ground. Both will destroy public services and hold back a generation to reach their hollow ideological goal.\nAlthough the need for a Labour Government has never been greater, we can’t pretend we will be back in power in Scotland soon. There is no magic answer or silver bullet. Indeed, we need to stop thinking a change of leader is the answer – we’ve tried that too many times. It’s also clear to me that Labour’s recovery shouldn’t be about right versus left, or rich versus poor. It must be about convincing everyone that social justice is in their interest.\nWe also have to move beyond constitutional arguments by setting out our own position clearly. As a party, we can’t back independence due to the damage it would do to public services. It’s our job to set out the case for a form of devolution (including empowering councils) that works for Scotland. For me, the starting point for that debate is Kezia Dugdales’s speech on the need for a “New Act of Union” – a move towards federalism.\nAs a party we need to step back and think about how voters view us. We must be clear about what we stand for. At every labour meeting I have attended our common cause has been clear, however, too often we struggle to communicate this in a way that resonates. The 2016 manifesto was a huge step in the right direction which I hope we will build on.\nAbove all, however, we need to be bold and positive in everything we do. We must be proud about what we stand for as those values were forged in Scotland: by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone, so as to create for each of us the means to realise our true potential and for all of us a community in which power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many not the few.",

This means that there should be no impact on day-to-day services. There is an argument, however, that the ticket and dividend income could have been used in a better/other way.\n- The construction cost is £156.7m.\n- Taking into account a number of factors, it is estimated there is a 80% chance of delivering the project for £207.3m or less.\n- A second study showed that there is a only a 61% chance of delivering the project for £207.3m or less…. and there is a 80% chance of delivering the project for £257.3m or less. The Council is therefore proposing a contingency fund of £50m.\n- If the project were to cost £257.3m it is estimated that there will be £1.25 of benefit for every £1.00 spent.\n- There are three votes needed to approve the project: (1) Transport & Environment Committee, (2) Finance & Resources Committee & (3) Full Council.",

Key amongst the challenges is housing and transport – our city is already congested and polluted, and nobody wants to build more homes on our greenbelt.\nKey to solving this problem is making former industrial sites in the north of Edinburgh more attractive to developers by connecting them to employment opportunities in the City Centre, Edinburgh Park and the Airport. This is the aim at the heart of why Edinburgh’s Councillors recently agreed to use the profits from Edinburgh’s publicly owned tram and bus service to complete the tramline to Newhaven.\nWith an estimated cost of £207.3m, however, it was not easy for me to back the proposal despite the fact that £1.40 of benefits are expected for every £1 spent on the project. I was surrounded by people who either absolutely supported the project or absolutely opposed it, whilst I was somewhere in the middle. As with many things in life, many of those with the strongest views appeared to be the least well informed.\nAlthough I understood the benefits the project could deliver, my concerns were quite wide ranging: (1) The Tram Inquiry has not yet reported; (2) The Environmental Impact Assessment dates back to 2003; (3) The risks associated with Brexit and a second Independence Referendum have not been explicitly considered despite being noted as a concern in earlier reports; and, (4) The impact on Lothian Buses.\nAlthough I had these concerns, it was clear to me that there is a need to cut congestion and stimulate development in the north of Edinburgh, and right now completing the tramline to Newhaven appears to be the best way of doing that. I say that accepting that the £207.3m target price has a 1 in 5 chance of being exceeded, but in the knowledge that the Council has a £50m contingency in place if needed.\nMore of my thoughts on the tram project can be found here.",

As I stated at the workshop, it is not clear to me that the safest route for the “Quiet Route” has been selected. I also do not feel that I have seen sufficient data to understand why reopening Braid Road southbound was selected in preference to the viable alternatives. Lastly, I feel that there has not been sufficient engagement with local businesses and residents. Nonetheless, I am keen that we see some progress with Braid Road prior to schools returning after the Easter Break so I am happy for the southbound reopening to progress so that the impact on public transport may be tested.\nBriefing\nThanks a lot to those of you who submitted comments regarding the design proposals. These have resulted in further revisions to the designs, notably:\n- Retaining two way operation on Braid Road between Braid Hills Drive and the main entrance to the Braid Hills Hotel\n- Removing the northbound cycleway on Braid Road between Braid Hills Drive and the main entrance to the Braid Hills Hotel – thus retaining parking for residents on this stretch\n- Closing the southbound ‘slip road’ between Braid Road and Hermitage Drive to discourage southbound journeys from Morningside Clock utilising Braid Road\n- This will continue to be monitored following implementation and it is acknowledged that further measures may be required to discourage through traffic on Braid Road between Morningside Clock and Hermitage Drive\n- Including pavement widening at the southeast side of the junction of Braid Road and Hermitage Drive\nThe designs were approved, subject to relevant revisions including those outlined above, by CIMT yesterday. Revised designs and the AFF for this project are attached (designs may still be subject to minor revisions in advance of and during delivery).\nProject delivery is scheduled to commence next Thursday 8th April.

In short, cutting airport tax will increase inequality.\nFurthermore, the SNP Government’s own analysis shows its plan to cut airport tax by 50% could result in up to an extra 60,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases each year.\nIndeed, the SNP were sent packing in Holyrood when the only evidence they could dig up to back their argument was provided by the airline industry.\nBoth the Tories and the SNP claim that in the longer-term the move will boost the Scottish economy, but neither say how it will be funded in the short term. Will the £300m needed be taken from Education in a move that will further worsen inequality?\nPersonally, I have trouble understanding how cutting the cost of a holiday in Florida or Australia boosts the Scottish economy.\nWould a better way to boost tourism in Scotland not be to ensure councils have the money they need to maintain basic infrastructure. What must tourists think when they see the result of SNP cuts in our Capital City?

The stress of this is impacting on her mental health and her ability to hold on to her job and look after her child. Despite being classed as homeless, she can expect to wait two years for a home – hundreds of people are ahead of her on the waiting list.\nWhilst relationship breakdown accounts for 18% of homelessness in Scotland, Councillor Whyte is wrong to suggest welfare reforms implemented by his Tory chums in the UK Government are not also a driver. The acute shortage of affordable housing is being intensified by Tory welfare policy. As CRISIS puts it: “welfare reform has been making both private landlords and housing associations more risk averse with regard to letting to households in receipt of benefits.”\nIn Scotland, where recorded homelessness is far higher than in England, even if the SNP Government hits their targets and so manages to reverse the decline in new social housing they have presided over, CRISIS say that will only “slow-down” the rise in homelessness.\nThis context is why homelessness in Edinburgh is such a priority and triggered the Council setting up a cross-party “Task Force” (yes, I know) to deal with it. If Councillor Whyte is to serve on it alongside Cllr Cammy Day (Labour), Cllr Robert Aldridge (Lib Dem), Cllr Susan Rae (Green), and a SNP representative, however, he will first have to acknowledge his party’s contribution to the problem.\nPerhaps then he can undo another harmful Tory policy, and suggest we start buying back council housing as it comes on the market.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_09_13_why-edinburgh-must-control-edinburghs-tourist-tax-revenue/content_503.html": "Like most people in Edinburgh, I am proud that so many people from around the world want to visit our fantastic capital city to enjoy all it has to offer. This pride often switches to shame, however, when I see they are confronted with grubby streets, overflowing bins and potholed pavements.\nThere can be little doubt that Edinburgh is struggling to cope with its own popularity and, if we are not careful, what tourists come to see is at risk of being destroyed. No one was surprised when in July CNN Travel declared Edinburgh one of the world’s worst hotspots for “overtourism”.\nIndeed, in the city there has been growing concern about the privatisation of public space for private gain, with even the A-Board ban being lifted to allow festival advertising to be placed on jam-packed footpaths.\nIn my article last month, I raised concerns about how the Council was managing the growth in tourism. Since then, an opportunity has arisen within the Scottish Government’s Programme for Government. I was delighted to see that the Scottish Government has at last listened to the public and will at least now consult on giving Edinburgh the power to set a tourist tax. As ever, however, there was a catch. The Scottish Government say: “receipts will be to fund local authority expenditure on tourism.”\nI feel that denying Edinburgh the right to decide how the money is spent is insulting to local democracy. As a democrat, I want Edinburgh to have full control of its tourist tax revenue. If it is all to be spent on tourism, that should be Edinburgh’s decision and no one else’s.\nAt the very least, I feel the revenue should be invested in areas that benefit residents and visitors alike. If the tourist economy is to grow, it must grow geographically. Community projects like Colinton Tunnel Project (please visit the mural if you have not already done so), should be supported and promoted as ways of drawing tourists away from central Edinburgh to enjoy the better parts of our city(!). The extra money spent in these areas is far more likely to benefit Edinburgh residents than money spend elsewhere.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_04_10_the-helping-hand-of-inclusive-growth/content_433.html": "I welcome the news that the SNP’s Cllr Kate Campbell’s tenure as Edinburgh’s Housing and Economy chief will mark a move away from just talking about economic growth, to a narrative of making sure the benefit reaches into every neighbourhood. There will be some that see her comments as an implicit criticism of the previous SNP Councillors that held the role, not least Cllr Gavin Barrie and Cllr Frank Ross, but progressive minds in other parties will support a return to the kind of vision Labour’s Council Leaders had for our Capital.\nThis comment from Cllr Campbell did, however, leave me feeling bemused: “As the SNP we’ve got a lot of priorities like closing the attainment gap, promoting well-being – but for me the first barrier to those things is poverty.”\nWe know, of course, that the SNP are the cause of Scotland’s attainment gap crisis. Indeed, despite Scotland falling nine places in international educational league tables, just last month SNP Councillors voted with the Conservatives at COSLA to impose a real terms pay cut on our teachers. How can we tackle educational attainment if we don’t value teachers? We can’t.\nFurthermore, in recent weeks we’ve seen the SNP work with the Conservatives to prevent reform of the Council Tax and to delay the transfer of welfare powers to Scotland. Are these the actions of a party that’s concerned about fighting poverty? They’re not.\nIndeed, last week I cautiously welcomed a SNP proposal to give the very poorest households additional support to buy food, but I did wonder if a voucher for 16p per day more than the Tories provide is enough? It’s not.\nI’m proud that Scottish Labour believes that everyone should benefit from our prosperity. That’s why, against fierce SNP opposition, we support the Child Poverty Action Groups “Give Me Five” campaign which asks the Scottish Government to raise child benefit by just £5 a week, and so lift 30,000 children out of poverty.\nLet’s hope, therefore, that “inclusive growth” is more than a slogan and the philosophy spreads to all corners of our city, including Holyrood.",

Equally, I welcome the offer Keith Brown MSP, the SNP’s Economy Secretary, has made to the Capital to suggest improvements (report, 10/01/18).\nWhen considering this offer, it is important to think about what Edinburgh needs in terms of infrastructure. It needs housing and we need to support the wellbeing of all our Capital’s residents.\nIt was hoped that the City Region Deal would be focussed on housing and be worth over £1.5b (Glasgow got £1.13b), instead the SNP and Tory Governments each gave our Capital City £300m with the biggest single item being a £120m roundabout.\nWhilst £600m over 15 years is very welcome, it has to be placed within the context of the year-on-year cuts inflicted on Edinburgh and its people by the SNP and Tory Governments.\nFurthermore, back in May we heard, without a whimper of opposition from Edinburgh SNP, that the Scottish Government had decided that the City Deal would not fund the tram extension. It did, however, apparently find £120m to upgrade the Sheriffhall Roundabout on the City Bypass. This neither falls within the remit of the region’s councils nor, I understand, was it part of the City Region Deal bid. Indeed, the SNP Government is arguably short-changing Edinburgh by making the already planned upgrade of Sheriffhall Roundabout part of the deal simply to inflate its finances.\nThere is a conspiracy of silence about this outrage amongst Edinburgh’s Tories and Nationalists as both parties are architects of the deal. However, Keith Brown’s offer is a chance to correct this brazen attempt to short-change our Capital.\nWe should let Transport Scotland continue with its long established plan to upgrade Sheriffhall if it wishes, but we should end the illusion that this is part of the City Region Deal. Instead, we should seek funding to transform Edinburgh and the life chances of its residents.\nFirstly, this should be done by industrialising the construction of high quality, sustainable and truly affordable housing for rent in Edinburgh. What’s more, these homes should be built by apprentices trained in Edinburgh. Secondly, we need to provide a step change in support for active and public transport so people can lead more active lives and so, in the longer term, take some of the pressure of our NHS.\nSurely that would be a better legacy for this generation to leave the next than a £120m roundabout?",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_05_21_lothian-buses-meeting-notes-changes-to-10-and-16-services/content_158.html": "Below are notes from a meeting myself and David Houston (Colinton Community Council) held with Lothian Buses to discuss the planned changes to the 10 & 16 Services to Colinton. I am not happy with the outcome, but I now have a better idea of what is driving matters.\nCllr Scott Arthur and David Houston, Transport Convener, Colinton Community Council\nWe met with Lothian Buses (Gaynor Marshall, Communications Director and Board Member and Keith Finlay, Business Development Manager) to discuss major changes to the 10 and 16 services which many people in Colinton rely on. These changes are planned to take place from Sunday 5 June. Broadly, the No 10 route will become a Bonaly only service at a higher frequency of typically 4 per hour and the No 16 route will be extended to Torphin (like the N16) and provide a frequent service of about 5 per hour to Morningside but a longer journey to the City centre.\nWe started by outlining that many people in Colinton warmly welcomed aspects of the proposals, especially Bonaly passengers, but many residents living along the Woodhall Road/ Torphin Road area had concerns – particularly being deprived of a more direct service to town and regarding children travelling to school.\nWe expressed concern about the lack of local consultation with Colinton people by Lothian Buses over such a significant change but were told that, currently, they had insufficient resources to commit to consultation on all service changes across Edinburgh. In the absence of this, Cllr Arthur had conducted his own local survey which had quickly gathered over 350 responses, mostly concerned about the impact of the proposals on west Colinton.\nLothian Buses outlined how devastating the effect of the Covid Pandemic had been on their services and profitability, and expressed their concern that financial aid from the Scottish Government was about to end despite their services being months (or perhaps years) away from returning to normal. They noted that public transport recovery in terms of passenger numbers in Edinburgh had been slower than elsewhere, and that city redevelopment projects (e.g. tram works) were impacting on service reliability. It was also noted that Lothian Buses are not fully compensated by the Scottish Government for providing “free” travel for people under 22. This context is important for Lothian Buses as they wanted to communicate that they were not changing the timetable from a position of strength. In particular, to return to the frequency in 2019 when both Bonaly and Torphin had a 20min service was just not possible right now.\nThey acknowledged that there had been non-trivial reliability issues with the 10 service, but argued that this was partly due to the bifurcation of the No 10 bus route to Bonaly and Torphin (it makes it harder to turn around a delayed bus). It was explained that having a single terminus at the end of the 10 and 16 route would improve reliability.\nLothian Buses accepted that the 16 was a slightly slower route into the city, but argued that this was balanced by the fact that it was a more frequent service than the 10: 12min typically instead of 30min.\nWe explored introducing a peak time “Torphin 10”, or giving people free transfers from the 16 to the 10 at Rustic Cottages, but these were argued to be not commercially viable options. Nor were there any plans to introduce different ticketing, such as a 1 hour pass allowing use of multiple buses, but it was noted the Day Ticket remains an option and passengers under 22 and over 59 would have “free” travel anyway. They did say, however, that they will attempt to ensure the new timetable facilitates changes between the 10 and 16 in Colinton. We pointed out that if Rustic Cottages was to become a heavily used interchange point, the existing bus stop on the narrow pavement needed to be redesigned and expanded to minimise the risk of accidents, especially involving school children. This would actually be an Edinburgh Council responsibility through the Bus Stop Working Party.\nThey also undertook to provide a free service from the foot of Bonaly Rd to the Bonaly terminus for passengers wishing to access the new No 10 service directly from Woodhall Rd. In the outward direction, Woodhall Rd customers would still have the choice of taking the Bonaly 10 to Bonaly Rd or the Torphin 16.\nWe asked why the 16 had not been extended to Bonaly and the Torphin 10 retained and they indicated that was mainly down to the physical difficulty of the 100-seater 16 buses negotiating the narrow Bonaly roads.\nLothian Buses concluded that they intended to proceed as planned, but agreed to keep the situation under review. Any early difficulties will be addressed in the next scheduled timetable change in September but they believe that any major change like this should be given a reasonable opportunity to bed in.\nThis is not the outcome we hoped for, and it is particularly disappointing given the length of time it has taken to arrange the meeting. Whilst we still have significant concerns about the proposals, we can see that Lothian Buses are in a very difficult position.\nThe meeting ended with agreement that local residents should have more opportunity to input into any suggested service changes, and we discussed ways of doing this in the future.",

I want to assure both Helen Martin (Opinion, 15/12/17) and James Park (Letters, 16/12/17), however, that the “Open Library” trial is not a Trojan Horse which will enable a reduction in staffed library hours.\nEdinburgh’s Labour Councillors are absolutely clear that there’s no link between allowing the public to access unstaffed libraries outside the current opening hours and the funding made available to operate the current service.\nOf course, the Open Library proposal does come with some uncertainty, not least ensuring public safety and the security of valuable public assets. Indeed, UNISON has noted that in Peterborough “A decision was made to recruit four assistants to maintain a presence in four library sites where it was felt that extra safeguarding measures were needed during unstaffed hours”. These uncertainties are why we could only agree to a trial“.\nNonetheless, there will be those in our Capital that see libraries as easy fodder to fill the black hole left in the city finances by the SNP budget. The first step in repelling these attacks is to debunk the myth that libraries are simply rooms full of books for the public to borrow. They provide much more than that.\nThe two libraries in my Ward are cherished community assets. Oxgangs Library and Colinton Library offer the community a range of services ranging from Rent Advice Surgeries, to Computer Clubs and Surgeries held by a certain Labour Councillor(!). Anyone who thinks these are moribund spaces should come along to feel the energy in Colinton Library’s “Lego Club” or Oxgangs Library’s “Tiger Tales”. Absolutely none of this can be replicated using the Open Library model and anyone who dares to suggest otherwise is devaluing the hard work of our fantastic librarians.\nSo yes, let’s explore expanding the current library service using the Open Library model but please don’t let anyone suggest it can be a substitute for the real thing.\nFinances may be tight in Edinburgh, but cutting libraries during tough times is like cutting hospitals during a plague*.\n*Quote adapted from:",

This will include a centre in my Ward – either Oxgangs Library or Pentland Community Centre. I have also suggested that a church in Fairmilehead and/or Colintion as testing centres.\nIntroduction\nAt present, there are three Covid-19 testing centres in Council-owned buildings (Gate 55, Usher Hall and Leith Library). There is a licence agreement in place between the Council and the UK Government for each.\nWe have been approached by the Scottish Government on behalf of the UK Government to provide a further eight Local Testing Sites (LTS) in Edinburgh. The attached map shows both the existing centres and the locations where the new sites are required. This expansion aims to:\n- close the gap between the number of people being tested and the estimated number of daily new cases in the mid- to long-term;\n- focus on areas of higher deprivation and low car ownership to increase access to testing; and,\n- maximise the amount of people with symptoms who get tested, by making testing easy to access (and then support these individuals to self-isolate, contact trace their contacts, and break chains of transmission).\nThese centres are for testing people with symptoms of Covid-19 rather than for asymptomatic community testing, which will be covered separately.\nLTS can either be provided within existing buildings or as units on hardstanding areas on outdoor space. There are specific basic criteria for each option that proposed sites need to fulfil, e.g. disability access, separate access/egress etc\nProgress so far\nOfficers provided an initial list of potential options to the Scottish Government for consideration and the first three areas are in the process of being finalised. The options are:\n| Area | Options |\n| Granton | Outdoor LTS within the car park for Ainslie Park Leisure CentreSite at Waterfront Avenue |\n| Niddrie/Craigmillar | Outdoor LTS within the car park for Jack Kane Leisure Centre |\n| Restalrig | Piershill Library |\n| Moredun (TBC) | Moredun Library orGilmerton Community Centre |\n| Clermiston (TBC) | Drumbrae Hub orRannoch Community Centre |\n| Oxgangs (TBC) | Oxgangs Library or Pentland Community Centre |\n| Saughton (TBC) | Carrickvale Community Centre orLongstone Resource Centre |\n| Newington (TBC) | Newington Library orCameron House Community Centre |\nThe graphic above shows these locations on a map of Edinburgh.\nThe UK Government would like to have all eight centres operational by April. They have the capacity to mobilise three centres per week.\nOnce the preferred option for an area is identified, timescales are likely to move fast. A site visit to finalise the layout for the LTS will be followed quickly by a licence agreement and handover of the building.",

Instead of a government committed to ending austerity across the UK, we now have one that will end it only in Northern Ireland.\nThis absurd outcome is what happens when minority governments undertake grubby deals behind closed doors. We saw the same in Holyrood in 2007 (SNP/Tory), in Westminster in 2010 (Tory/Lib-Dem) and more recently in Scotland when the SNP needed Green support to cut local authority budgets.\nIn the City of Edinburgh Council the situation is little different. The SNP led minority administration will need support from the Tories, Lib-Dems or Greens in order to make the simplest of decisions.\nWhilst many will welcome such deals as a step towards consensus politics, they offer parties which have only limited support an opportunity to exert undue influence whilst simultaneously ensuring larger “losing” parties remain locked out of government.\nThe DUP won just 292,316 votes, but it now holds more power than Scottish Labour (717,007 votes) and the UK Labour Party (12,878,460 votes). Theresa May needs to explain why doing a deal to end austerity in Northern Ireland with a party that won 0.9% of the vote in the UK was just as easy as ignoring those millions of voters that backed Labour’s transformative vision.\nAfter all, we should be creating good quality jobs and building sustainable homes right across the UK, not just in Northern Ireland.",

This was kept from the public until the BBC reported it on Monday the 11th of May. I asked about the report on Tuesday and was told that the outbreak had been discussed in late February (this has now been retracted) and that Councillors on EIJB were told (they deny this). I was also led to understand the Council Leader was informed at the time, but it now transpires he was told “3 weeks after lockdown”.\nBriefing\nI agreed to provide the factual position with regard to the Reporting Scotland story regarding the Nike Conference last night from a City of Edinburgh Council perspective. In doing so I would flag that contact tracing of potential COVID-19 cases was conducted by the local Health Protection Team in NHS Lothian as per the existing process. Communication to Council Officers was via by the local Health Protection Team in NHS Lothian to our Environmental Health Service as per established infectious disease outbreak procedures. In terms of the facts:\n- The Nike Conference took place 26/27 Feb 2020.\n- Council EH teams were advised by local health protection team on 3 March that there was a ‘suspected case of COVID-19’ which was being investigated and that the Council would be updated when results were confirmed\n- There was then dialogue between the local Health Protection Team in NHS Lothian and our Environmental Health Service whilst results were awaited. On the 6 Mar 2020 the case was confirmed. At this stage the Exec Director and Chief Exec were advised\n- On 6 Mar Chief Exec spoke to NHS Lothian to seek reassurance that CEC will be kept fully informed of the development of cases\n- EH confirmed with HPT that no assistance was required with further contact tracing and given the time lapse and that there was no intervention needed at hotel (the virus is believed to exist in the environment for no more than 72 hours and therefore by the time CEC was first alerted this phase had passed)\n- NHS Lothian were following up with other Health Boards regarding the situation including further tracing if required. The NHS were managing this incident including what information could be shared.\nIt should be noted that the Council stood up the Council Incident Management Team on the 27th February to coordinate the Council’s response to the COIVD-19 crisis and I am confident that in this instance the Council responded in the appropriate manner.",

The key change is a 40% price hike, but the exemptions I argued for have been retained. There will also be more flexibility for some people on how registration works. Promoting the scheme as outlined in Section 5 will cost £70,000.\nEdinburgh Garden Waste Collection Briefing 2021/22\n1.0 Introduction\nThe paid garden waste collection service is approaching its fourth year, with the main registration window opening on 22 July. This briefing note provides background on the service, the registration window, how we are communicating with customers and the key dates around this.\n2.0 Key Dates\n| Date | Event |\n| 2021/22 Main registration opens | 22 July at 10am (runs for 6 weeks) |\n| 2021/22 Main registration closes | 1 September at 2pm |\n| Letter, with permit and calendar, land | Between 25 October and 3 November |\n| Current 2020/21 collection year ends | 7 November |\n| New 2021/22 collection year starts | 8 November |\n| Missing letters (permits) to be reported | As soon as possible after 3 November and before 3 December |\n| Mid-year window opens | 1 December at 10am |\n| Service suspended | From 20 December until 16 January |\n| Mid-year registrations processed | Monthly (see section 4 below for more details) |\n| Mid-year registration closes | At least 31 May 2022 (longer is being investigated, see section 4 below for more details) |\n| 2021/22 collection year ends | 6 November 2022 |\n3.0 The Service\nAny residential household within Edinburgh can register for the garden waste service during the registration windows.\nCustomers who sign up receive a fortnightly collection. The service runs from 8 November 2021 until 6 November 2022, with no collections between 20 December and 16 January. The festive break in service allows us to divert resources to other recycling and waste streams during the busy festive period.\nThe cost of the service is £35 per bin. This is a price increase from the previous £25. This is the first price increase since the charge was introduced in 2018 and is required to ensure the Council can cover its costs for delivering this collection service. The price increase was approved at Council in February 2021.\nA customer can sign up during the mid-year registration window however the cost will remain at £35 and the permit will run until the end of this service year, which is 6 November 2022.\n3.1 Exemptions\nExemptions from paying were established at the introduction of the charge and these continue. A customer can request an exemption if they receive Council Tax Reduction (formerly called Council Tax Benefit) or are classed, or live with someone who has been classed as, severely mentally impaired. Other council tax discounts, such as single occupancy or disabled person discount, don’t qualify for this reduction. Households that pay for garden aid are not exempt from paying for the service.\nIf a customer is eligible for an exemption they must still register during the sign up windows in order to receive the service. Exemption eligibility is checked before the subscription is progressed, if this check highlights that the customer doesn’t qualify the registration is cancelled and the customer is contacted advising them of this and how to pay if they still want to receive the service. Where this happens close to the registration closing, the customer is given a short extension to call and pay over the phone.\n3.2 Permits\nOnce the registration window closes, and the required eligibility and data quality checks are complete, the registrations are processed onto the waste collection systems and new routes are created.\nDuring the two weeks ahead of the service commencing the customer will receive a letter, with an attached permit sticker (and additional permit stickers if more than one bin has been registered for the property), and the collection calendar for the garden waste service address. The customer’s name will also be added to the letter where it is feasible to do so.\nFrom this year, customers will now have the opportunity to select whether they want this letter to be sent to their home address or their garden waste service address if they are registering for a different property. This has been a highly requested option from customers, in particular those supporting individuals with care needs and landlords registering their properties.\nCustomers are advised that if they do not receive the permit by a specific date, they should report this as soon as possible, and no later than 28 days after this date. For those registering in the main window, this would be if it has not arrived by 3 November and should be reported no later than 3 December.\nCustomers are advised to attach the permit to a clean and clear part of the bin below the handles; this allows the collection crews a quick way of confirming registered bins as the colour of the permit changes each year. If the bin does not have the permit attached it will not be emptied.\nThe permit is a tamper-proof permit meaning that, if a permit was to be ripped off the bin, it would leave behind evidence the customer had paid for that year’s collections and the part taken off becomes void.\n3.3 Tiphereth Customers\nTiphereth undertake garden waste collections in the Colinton area of Edinburgh through a long-running agreement. Customers on the streets serviced by Tiphereth would still register for the service via the Council however they would receive a weekly bag collection carried out by Tiphereth.\n3.4 Internal site and other organisations\nWe don’t offer a commercial garden waste service however internal Council sites, and a limited number of other organisations (namely bowling clubs, lawn tennis courts, and croquet clubs), can register for the garden waste service.\nThe charge remains the same as residential customers, and the registration process and timescales also remain the same.\nThe key difference for these sites is that a Waste Transfer Note (WTN) covering the collection year must also be signed before the permit is sent out and the details of this are outlined at the point of registering. The WTN is a legal requirement to ensure the Council and the business is compliant with their duty of care. Where it has not been possible to get a signed WTN back within the deadline the subscription is cancelled and the business is refunded, it is possible for them to sign up again in the next registration window.\n4.0 How to Register\nThe quickest and easiest way to register and pay is on our website at www.edinburgh.gov.uk/gardenwaste\nSigning in to a MyGov account is now optional in order to make the process easier, however registering without signing in will mean the customer will not see the history of their garden waste subscription on their account.\nResidents can ask a family member, friend or neighbour to register and pay on their behalf online if they’re unable to do it themselves.\nCustomers eligible for an exemption can register using the online form, or by using the phone number below if they don’t have access to the internet or someone who can register on their behalf.\nAnyone without access to the internet can call us on 0131 357 2800. Phone lines are open Monday to Thursday between 10am – 4pm and Friday 10am – 3.40pm.\nIt’s not possible for a resident to register in person at one of our locality offices. They will need to register online or by telephone instead.\nA one-off payment of £35 (per brown bin) will be taken by debit or credit card. There is no limit to how many garden waste bins a property can have but there will be a charge of £35 per bin.\nAligning to corporate policy, we don’t accept cheques or cash payments.\nResidents can share a bin with their neighbours, but they’ll need to agree on one resident acting as the lead for booking and paying for the service against their property. If there are any service issues with the shared bin (e.g. a missed collection), then this must be reported against the property with the permit.\nResidents are encouraged to sign up early once the registration window is opened.\nRegistrations cannot be made outside of the sign-up windows.\n4.1 Main Registration Window\nTo receive the service for the full collection year, (and have a continuous service if they are already a customer) residents must register during the main registration window using the method outlined above. This window runs from 10am on 22 July until 2pm on 1 September.\n4.2 Mid-Year Registration Window\nIf a customer moves into the area after the main windows closes (or they changed their mind or missed the summer window), we operate a mid-year registration window. Previously this was two weeks held around January/February, however as of this year this window will be greatly expanded opening from 1 December 2021.\nThe approach to the mid-year window was approved at Transport and Environment Committee in June 2021, with an amendment to continue the mid-year window beyond 31 May 2022 (the originally proposed close date for the mid-year window) with details of this to be reported to Transport and Environment Committee in March 2022.\nSimilar to previous years, a further Members Briefing will be circulated ahead of the mid-year window opening with specific details on this registration process.\n5.0 Communication\nA comprehensive communications campaign is being implemented to raise awareness of garden waste registration and to encourage sign up during the main registration window (between 22 July and 1 September).\nThe communications approach is using multiple channels to raise awareness to as many residents as possible and encourage sign up. The following communication channels are being used:\n- Lamppost wraps – targeted at areas people visit regularly such as supermarket\n- Radio/Spotify adverts o Social media posts (including sponsored adverts)\n- Press (press releases and reactive press statements as required)\n- Council website\n- Adverts in supermarkets\n- Billboards on key arterial routes\n- Mailing to existing customers and those that have registered an interest for this registration window, to advise of the registration window.\n- Customers who we have an email address for, will be sent emails from 22 July and those without email addresses will receive a letter. Both the email and letter will explain to customers what they need to do and about the rate change.\n6.0 Summary of Key Points\nThe main registration window opens at 10am on 22 July closing at 2pm on 1 September. Registrations after this time will not be processed.\nThe rate will now be £35 per bin, as approved by Council, to ensure full cost recovery of the collection and subscription management service.\nThe registration window will be supported by a multi-channel, comprehensive, communication campaign.\nResidents are encouraged to register online (or have a family member, friend or neighbour register on their behalf). The other option to register is via phone.\nResidents cannot register in person at one of our locality offices, and cheque/cash payment will not be accepted.\nThe mid-year registration will open from 1 December; however, the charge will remain at £35 and the service year ends 6 November 2022.\nDetails of the full terms and conditions can be found here: www.edinburgh.gov.uk/gardenwaste.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_local-issues/content_10.html": "Issue: Proposed Development on our Green Belt at Winton\nMiller Homes has once again brought forward proposals to build on the field at Winton. Miller Homes has banked this land and has consistently tried to get planning permission for residential development.\nLocal people have fought with Ian Murray MP against the development on this site for some time due to the impact it will have on the area and local road network.\nMy Position: In my view, the behaviour of Miller Homes has been unacceptable. If elected I will not sit on the fence. I will support local residents and work with Ian Murray MP to block this development.\nIssue: The Proposed Demolition of Comiston Farmhouse\nA developer is seeking to demolish Comisiton Farmhouse and fill the site with flats. This raises concerns about the loss of a local landmark, damage to local biodiversity and impacts on local roads.\nMy Position: If elected I will not sit on the fence. I’ll work with Ian Murray MP to block the demolition. I’m concerned about the loss of a historic landmark, the impact on already busy roads, protection of the trees and the visual impact of the proposed flats.\nIssue: The Future of Redford Barracks\nRedford Barracks are to close under the Government’s review of its defence estate. This site is huge and it’s future is uncertain.\nMy Position: If left unchecked, developers will fill this site with “luxury” homes and apartments whilst paying little attention to the needs of the local community. If I’m elected and the barracks doclose, I will make sure the community is at the heart of the decision making regarding the site. As well as making sure roads, our great schools and GPs are not overloaded, I will want to use the redevelopment as a chance to bring jobs and affordable homes (for purchase & rent) to the area. Above all else, we must ensure Colinton Village and Colinton Mains benefit from the redevelopment of the site.\nIssue: Capacity of Local Schools\nThe projected increase in pupil numbers over the next 10 years at many schools across Edinburgh – both primary and secondary – has become a major issue for Edinburgh. In total, secondary pupil numbers in the city are due to rise by 30% by 2026 and all but 5 of the city’s 23 secondary schools face capacity problems.\nMy Position: If elected, I will block new developments that lead to overcrowding in our Schools. I will ask the council to draw up a strategy for managing staff and class sizes in Colinton-Fairmilehead that does not involve changing school catchments. I will also protect denominational schools from closure.\nIssue: The Construction the Oxgangs Aldi Store\nWork is now underway at the Oxgangs Aldi store site. As a result of the development, the Oxgangs Library car park will be closed from the 20th of February until October when the store opens. This will be inconvenient, particularly for library users with mobility problems.\nMy Position: Let’s hope the store brings the promised jobs to the community and does not have a negative impact on local businesses. If elected, I will put pressure on the developer to get the Library car park open ASAP.",

A survey was also issued to CLPs, Trade Unions, affiliates and staff.\n- What went well (in order) – Locals activist support, optimism (manifesto), events, hustings, social media, fundraising, TU support & national organisation.\n- Problems (in order) – Voter targeting, lack of preparation nationally, infighting, unrealistic manifesto, poor manifesto communication (lacked clear message), Scottish narrative squeezed, poor internal communication & candidate selection.\n- Popular Themes (in order) – Austerity, WASPI, New Green Deal, nationalisation, local issues/candidate & NHS.\n- Problems in the doorstep (in order) – Jeremy Corbyn, Brexit, Independence (position not clear), manifesto (too many policies and now clear message) & broadband policy.\n- What needs to change (strategic) – We need a clear message, better research, better targeting and less infighting.\n- What needs to change (operational) – Better support for candidates, clearer strategy in Scotland, better training, select candidates earlier, organisers need better local knowledge (party needs to listen to local members more) and take clearer ownership of disciplinary issues in Scotland.\nIt was agreed that these finding should be considered alongside the Open Labour review which should be published next week. Jackie Bailey will discuss the review with the newly form election team and will report back to the SEC.\nAway day agenda item: Constitution\nThe focus of this was Richard Leonard’s paper on the constitution, and Ian Murray MPs suggested amendment. The key addition being:\n“Scottish Labour, does not support independence. We believe that the 2021 elections must be about electing a Government and a parliament that will dedicate its entire focus to rebuilding Scotland’s economy, public services and communities after the devastating impact of Covid-19. That work must be the focus of the next Scottish Government and so we will be going into that election in 2021 with a Scottish Labour party position that is not for a second referendum.”\nIan Murray MP\nRichard was clear that Labour’s position can’t be about defending the status quo, but must be about continuing democratic reform (devolution of power from Westminster & Holyrood to communities). The policy should be set by the party in Scotland. Richard made the point that the lasting impact Covid-19 will have on the economy (esp youth unemployment) and mental health in Scotland, will mean that the constitution must come second (at least) in Scotland’s political discourse. Labour must have a clear message on the constitution, but rebuilding lives and the economy in the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis must be paramount.\nThis was followed by a discussion about Richard’s paper, and Ian’s amendment (which Richard was happy to accept). There was a move to delay a decision, but the SEC agreed to back the paper with Ian Murray’s amendments.\nSelections – Scottish Parliament Constituency Selections\nIn total, 21 seats from the early selection tranche have candidates. The following are still outstanding:\n- On pause we have – Dundee City East; Eastwood (AWS); Glasgow Pollok (AWS); Kirkcaldy (AWS); Motherwell & Wishaw (AWS); Renfrewshire North & West (AWS); and, Uddingston & Bellshill.\n- Yet to begin – Almond Valley; Carrick, Cumnock & Doon Valley (AWS); Cowdenbeath; Dunfermline (AWS); Glasgow Anniesland (AWS) Glasgow Kelvin (AWS); and, Midlothian North & Musselburgh.\nWe also have 35 seats not in the early-selection tranche that need candidates: Aberdeen Donside; Aberdeen South & North Kincardine; Aberdeenshire East; Aberdeenshire West; Angus North & Mearns; Angus South; Argyll & Bute; Ayr; Banffshire & Buchan Coast; Caithness, Sutherland & Ross; Clackmannanshire & Dunblane; Falkirk West; Galloway & West Dumfries; Inverness & Nairn; Kilmarnock & Irvine Valley; Linlithgow\nMid Fife & Glenrothes; Midlothian South, Tweeddale & Lauderdale\nMoray; Na h-Eileanan an Iar; North East Fife; and, Orkney Islands. CLPs have yet to be consulted on AWS status of these seats.\nInability to hold face-to-face meetings is a real challenge to completing the selection process. The party is setting up software to run selections online. It was therefore recommended that Scottish parliamentary selections re-start from July 2020 starting with the paused first tranche seats.\nSelections – Holyrood Regional List Selections\nThese should get underway in August. Jackie Bailey will consider how BAME, LGBT+, disabled and female candidates can be better supported in the selection process. In the longer-term, it was agreed that The Gordon Aikman Leadership Programme (or similar) should be restarted to develop candidates from the widest possible diversity of backgrounds.\nSelections – By-election Selections\nA number of by-elections are in the pipeline:\n- Livingston South (West Lothian) – 1st Oct 2020\n- Ellon and District (Aberdeenshire) – 1st Oct 2020\n- Leaderdale and Melrose (Scottish Borders) – 29th Oct 2020\n- Kincorth/Nigg/Cove (Aberdeen City Council) – 5th Nov 2020\n- Aird and Loch Ness (Highland Council) – 5th Nov 2020\n- Craigentinny and Duddingston (Edinburgh City) – 12th Nov 2020\n- Thorniewood (North Lanarkshire) – 19th Nov 2020\n- Fortissat (North Lanarkshire) – 19th Nov 2020\n- Perth City North (Perth and Kinross) – 26th Nov 2020\n- Perth City South (Perth and Kinross) – 26th Nov 2020\n- Clackmannanshire East (Clackmannanshire) – TBC\n- North Isles (Orkney Islands) – TBC\nTo select candidates the party will use the same software platform that is being used for Holyrood Regional List Selections.\nSelections – SEC Elections\nDue to the Covid-19 crisis and the 2021 Holyrood election, it was agreed to defer elections to the Scottish Executive Committee for all sections until after the Scottish Parliament elections next year. This means the new SEC would be endorsed by Scottish Conference in Spring 2022 and a SEC Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, and Treasurer would be elected at its first meeting in May 2022.\nScottish Conference\nScottish Labour Conference was due to take place 23–25 October. As a result of the COVID-19 crisis a provisional hold had been extended on venue and accommodation without going to contract. Nonetheless, it was agreed to postpone the traditional “in person” meeting. The party will arrange an online alternative to provide a platform for members, affiliates and elected reps to engage with some of the policy and political discussions which conference provides.",

They said: “I think it’s awful… All the Russian propaganda TV channels are not working to provide information, but to provide hatred”.\nRather than echo these views and help a former First Minister of Scotland be less of a national embarrassment, Lesley Riddoch used her column in the Scotsman (13/08/18) to attack the BBC for apparently not reporting recent pro-independence marches.\nOf course, this is “Fake News” from Riddoch. A quick search finds the BBC did report these events with headlines like “Independence supporters stage Glasgow march” and “Thousands take part in Scottish independence march in Inverness”.\nBizarrely, Riddoch also spends a good deal of her article defending the pro-SNP Government blogger Stuart Campbell (he rund). This is a man who makes a lucrative income out of using the worst kind of language to attack those that dare to question the SNP. Of Ian Murray MP he once said: “I hope an aeroplane delivering dirty needles to an incinerator crashes onto Ian Murray tonight”.\nLesley Riddoch’s article shows us only one thing, hard-core nationalists in Scotland aim to move the public away from trusted news sources like the BBC and on to so called “alternative” media like Campbell and social media. In that domain, people like Vladimir Putin thrive as they can control content to deliver their agenda. The fact that Russia Today is now supplying “exclusive” material direct to Campbell is no coincidence.\nOf course, the BBC News is not perfect but when looked at as a whole it does a pretty good job. That simple fact is why hard-core Nationalists don’t like it. They’d rather Scotland was a place where the media only reports good news about the SNP Government. The problem is that this attitude results in the kind of news output people enjoy in Russia where, ironically, many turn to the BBC for their news.",

Both sites are in the heart of the city (Spittal Street and Leith Street) and sit alongside commercial premises and the tourist industry.\nThe services have been looking for suitable accommodation for over 3 years and are planning to move to Panmure St Ann’s, an accessible city centre location with a single point of access, where they will be co-located early 2020.\nThe inclusive homelessness service will support people who live on the streets, those who are in temporary accommodation or sofa-surfing centrally, therefore Panmure St Ann’s is a suitable location.\nThe Edinburgh Access Practice previously operated successfully for 12 years from a location a few hundred yards from Panmure St Ann’s (until 3 years ago).\nPanmure St Ann’s is owned by City of Edinburgh Council and will be leased to NHS Lothian. NHS Lothian has committed to investing 2.8 million pounds in refurbishing the building to ensure it is fit-for-purpose.\nThe inclusive homelessness service\nThe service will operate from 9-6pm Monday to Friday. It will not be open after 6pm or at weekends.\nA GP practice will be at the centre of the service which will also consist of housing officers, social workers, psychiatric nurses, practice nurses and administration staff. Our third sector partners (Cyrenians, Streetwork) and Edinburgh University students will also be based in and support the practice. University students will undertake research, support the service to implement and evidence best practice and work towards becoming a ‘Centre of Excellence’.\nThe service will be a one stop shop and will support people to:\n- Improve and manage their physical and mental health\n- Reduce harm caused by substance use\n- Access suitable accommodation\n- Maintain their accommodation\nAn appointment system will be in operation but occasionally the service will see people outwith these arrangements for a range of reasons.\nThe service will not operate a needle exchange.\nThe integrated service will focus on building effective relationships with people who struggle to engage, taking account of their past experiences in the way it operates, and supporting behavioural change.\nA core group of around 350 people with complex needs are currently accessing services provided by The Access Point and the Edinburgh Access Practice.\nUpdate on the planning process\nThis is at an early stage.\nAs this is not is not a major application, statutory consultation is not required. However, as good practice the Health and Social Care Partnership/NHS Lothian is committed to consulting with the local community, including stakeholders such as local businesses.\nThe building is listed, in a conservation area and a world heritage site. As well as a Planning Application, there will also be a Listed Building Consent application.\nFormal notification will be done by CEC Planning on receipt of the application. Neighbours and others have the right to object on legitimate ‘planning’ grounds.\nIn terms of indicative timescales, it is likely a planning application would be made late January 2019.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_03_21_edinburgh-tram-v-cycle-safety-on-leith-walk/content_552.html": "There is a tendency for all of as to define transport in a rather siloed way. We tend to talk about moving trains, cars buses, goods vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. I am convinced that it is this mentality that lies behind many of Edinburgh’s transport problems and our collective inability to discuss them properly.\nMy view is that we should simplify the argument by viewing transport in the city as a system which is focussed on moving goods and people efficiently. The difference is subtle, but important.\nLike many people in Edinburgh I own a car and bike, but I also love using Lothian Buses (I’m writing this from my favourite seat at the front of the top deck) and normally manage to wrack up at least 10,000 steps a day. Also like many people in Edinburgh, I actively swap between these modes of transport from day-to-day\nAs a city we know that if people make the positive choice to walk or cycle more often, that’s better for them and our Capital. The Council should be doing all it can to inform and support that decision making process.\nMaking the decision to start commuting to work by bike, however, can be incredibly difficult. As well as getting the right bike and clothing, a safe route has to be identified.\nAs somebody that lives in Buckstone, I really envy the ever improving cycling facilities on Leith Walk that help Leithers make that positive switch to a healthier and more sustainable alternative to the car. I had hoped these facilities would inspire similar investments in my Ward to make it safer for my constituents and their children to get to work or school by bike.\nInstead it appears that cycling safety measures may be removed from Leith Walk to make way for cars as part of the proposed completion of the tramline. Given the hundreds of accidents reported along the existing line and the ongoing plan to reduce the risks, who can argue with the demand that Sustrans has made that a full safety audit be undertaken on the proposed changes to Leith Walk? Indeed, there have also been reports that Leithers may have to walk up to 600m to cross the road safely!\nThe solution to this conflict is clear – we must listen to Sustrans and focus on people, not their mode of transport. Above all else, people should contribute to the consultation.",

I have been out campaigning every week since January, and we have spoken to thousands of voters. I have been doing this because I know taking Edinburgh South West from the out of touch SNP will make it easier to get the Tories out of Downing Street.\nSpeaking to so many local people means I know there is a real desire for change. We’re tired of the sleaze; We’re tired of the chaos and we’re tired of the failure to grow our economy and protect our public services. After years of Tory chaos and failure, and people feeling so let down by the SNP, this election is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss.\nThis election is a straight choice between a broken status quo with two bad governments, or change with Labour. A Labour government that will make work pay, bring down energy bills, create jobs and protect our public services.\nOther parties want to use this election to send a message. The SNP want to send a message to the Tories. The Tories want to send a message to the SNP. A vote for Labour isn’t a vote to send a message, it’s a vote to send a government to Westminster with Scottish Labour MPs at its heart, delivering the change Scotland needs. Labour is the only party trying to pull Scotland together not drive it apart and Labour is the only party with a positive vision for Scotland’s future.\nPolling consistently shows that Edinburgh South West is a fight between the SNP and Labour. Analysis published in May 2024 by the respected Electoral Calculus gives me and the SNP an equal chance of winning. Labour winning here is possible, but I need your vote to help make it happen. Every vote will count.\nIf I win this seat, we can help make a Labour Government possible and get our country back on track! If Labour is elected, we will demonstrate how much more we can do with government in both Westminster and the Scottish Parliament.\nThis isn’t about how people voted in the last election, or the one before that, or how they voted in the referendum. No matter how you voted in the past, if you agree that our country needs change, then Labour is ready to deliver it.\nWe stand at a key moment in our nation’s history. There is a choice ahead of us. More of the same under the SNP and the Tories. Or change with Scottish Labour. If you want change, you have to vote for it.\n(Promoted by Stephen Jenkinson on behalf of Scott Arthur both c/o 78 Buccleuch Street, Edinburgh, EH8 9NH.)",

If you want to get on my mailing list please complete this form.\nI have had a few requests today from residents asking if their street can be cleared of snow. I have passed all of these on to Council Officers via e-mail. So far the only response I have had arrived via social media: “Our gritters and ploughs are working as hard as they can and will not deviate from the original planned and approved routes”.\nFor the time being, I think we have to leave Council staff to get on with their job. Indeed, I had a walk from my house in Buckstone to the Colinton Mains Tesco first thing this morning (for soup ingredients!) and could see that Council staff had been working hard overnight on the footpaths and roads. However, with over 2,000 miles of roads and over 4,000 miles of footpaths in the city, there is still a lot of work left to do for only 22 gritters and 11 pavement tractors.

Some ideas:\n- If you are able, why not clear the public footpath outside your house or that of an elderly neighbour?\n- If you clear the snow from your driveway, please don’t dump it on the footpath!\n- Colinton Primary needs volunteers for a snow clearing party this Sunday – 12.30 till 2pm!! All welcome, bring your shovels\n- If your local grit bin is empty, you can request a refill.\n- If you feel you need an additional grit bin, you can request it here. Please let me know when you make this request as this system is a bit wonky!\n- If you own a car, please make sure that where you have parked it is not making it harder for the gritter driver to do his job.\n- We should never park on the pavement as it makes it difficult for people with prams and wheelchairs to pass, but doing so now will also hinder the pavement tractors.\nLastly, I just want to say that I was really moved to see Local residents clearing snow from Mounthooly Loan (almost 1km long) to help doctors living in the area get to work. They got a great deal done before the gritter eventually arrived Well done!",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2023_08_27_cutting-congestion-utility-companies-must-work-smarter-and-faster/content_96.html": "Each week a “road report” is issued to Councillors detailing all current and imminent road works and closures in our capital. This week’s report stretches to a modest 17 pages and documents almost 200 sets of works.\nThe good news is that a significant part of this is the Council delivering on Labour’s commitment to significantly increases funding for road and footpath maintenance following years of cuts. The bulk of the work, however, is being undertaken by utility contractors – SGN, Scottish Water, SPEN, Cityfibre, BT etc. The government gives the companies the “right” to install and maintain their infrastructure, and leaves the Council only very limited powers to co-ordinate the works. The result of this asymmetrical relationship is more congestion in an already congested city.\nRecent utility works at Fairmilehead Crossroads came with extensive delays to public transport, and traffic queuing all the way to the bypass. Whilst the works lasted for only two weeks, residents in my Ward were furious that most of the time no work was taking place. Despite the massive delays, there was no apparent sense of urgency from the utility company.\nDue to issues like this Edinburgh Councillor’s have now agreed, however, that we need the power to force utility companies to work smarter and faster.\nIn England, a lane rental scheme allows local authorities to charge utility companies for the time that roadworks occupy the road – £2500 per day. Edinburgh Councillor’s want the Scottish Government to give our capital the same power, and set a rate that forces utility companies to work faster.\nWill it happen? This was the answer Ralph Roberts, CEO of McGills Buses, gave to me: “It is unlikely unfortunately but I wish you luck. Bus companies will be right behind you. Utilities work the way they do to keep their costs low, but damage local economies as a result. Local economic impact should take precedence.“",

The issue, of course, is that by trying to please everyone nobody is happy. The same is certainly true of the Picardy Place “gyratory”.\nIt feels like the SNP is making the same mistake with their Workplace Parking Levy (WPL) proposals. Set aside for one moment the fact that Edinburgh does not have the Non-Statutory Guidance needed to implement a Workplace Parking Levy, and look at the content of the proposal and the comments of SNP Councillors in the media regarding their WPL proposals.\nThey plan on setting the minimum car park size at 50 for inclusion in the WPL – this would exclude a significant number of businesses from the plan, particularly in the city centre where air quality is an issue, and where congestion impacts significantly on the wellbeing of residents and public transport transit times.\nExisting Council modelling of WPL had focussed on a minimum car park size of 11 and suggested income would be £9m pa, but SNP Councillors suggest that excluding a significant number of spaces from WPL by raising the minimum size to 50 will generate £10m. This simply is not credible.\nThe proposal takes no account of the concerns of residents living in communities adjacent to business areas such, as the Gyle, where WPL may generate anti-social displacement parking. It is notable that in Nottingham 80% of employers pass the levy to staff (meaning VAT also applies) and that Trade Unions are concerned regarding the impact that an indiscriminate WPL would have on low paid workers working anti-social hours with no access to public transport.\nIndeed, the focus of the proposal appears to be taxing (and thereby gentrifying) unwanted behaviours (rather than ending them) – this is incompatible with Edinburgh’s commitment to tackle the climate emergency.\nInstead, Edinburgh’s new administration plans to follow Paris and end our capital’s addiction to parking income.\nBefore the end of 2022 we will present our vision for the biggest expansion in public transport our capital has seen this century – inc tram, bus lanes and park & ride schemes. We will listen to residents on this issue, and work with them and surrounding local authorities to transform and decarbonise the transportation system in our capital.\nThis will also be an opportunity to invest in active transport, so we will learn any lessons from the Trams to Newhaven active travel scheme which has been the subject of international media attention.\nThis investment in public transport is of national importance, so we hope to work in close partnership with the Scottish Government to both develop the full business case, and fund the project. In is not our intention to deliver this scheme via PFI (as has been suggested for the Glasgow Metro), but to respect Edinburgh’s culture of retaining public transport in public ownership.\nThe Scottish Government has made a clear “commitment” to reducing car-kilometres by 20% (compared to 2019 levels) by 2030 and we will contribute to this with a 30% target. Linked to this Edinburgh also has a clear commitment to significantly increase the number of people using public and active travel, both to and within Edinburgh.\nAs we work through this transition, Edinburgh’s parking needs will change significantly. Parking, of course, is a key part of any transport system, but poorly managing it leads to higher levels of trip generation and congestion.\nWe will comprehensively review the scale and distribution of on-street and off-street public and private parking in Edinburgh in the context of City Plan 2030, and model how parking demand will change if our capital is to meet its Net Zero and Modal Shift targets.\nWe will work with key stakeholders, just as Paris is, to develop a comprehensive plan to manage parking availability as public and active transport capacity expands. As commuters switch to public transport our focus will be providing the parking needed for residents and businesses, and people with disabilities.\nIn the coming years our focus will be on working with residents and businesses as we journey through this transition. This collaborative working will only improve our plans, but I am sure none of us would expect us to compromise on our shared determination to respond to the climate emergency.",

The point is that Scotland chooses not to, and the majority of Scots don’t want a second referendum on the issue.\nI’m quite proud to say that I was a key part of the grassroots campaign to keep Scotland in the UK. I spent some time looking at both sides of the argument before deciding that remaining in the UK was the best way of protecting jobs and services. I understood the many arguments made for and against Scotland leaving the UK, but the fact that there was no independent analysis that showed Scotland would be better off outside the UK spoke volumes to me. So much so that I campaigned right across Edinburgh to protect our hospitals, schools and universities.\nThis does not mean I don’t respect those who voted differently for their own reasons. I hope, however, that they also respect my position with equal measure.\nWell over seven years since the 2014 referendum, politics in Scotland has not moved on. The political debate is dominated by “unionists” and “nationalists”, and most ordinary Scots are stuck in the middle. The threat of a second independence referendum hangs over Scotland and, despite Brexit, the economic benefits of independence are still unclear to most Scots. Indeed, Brexit has shown how difficult it can be to leave an economic union.\nI now think it’s perhaps time to do what other countries do and focus our energy on fixing health and education. Indeed, Scotland already has the power to ensure we have the best education system in the world. Let’s focus on making that a reality, not reheating stale arguments from 2014.\nLet’s be defined as a country by our willingness to invest in our children’s future, not by a national obsession with constitutional arguments.\nIt’s time to move on.",

This will include a centre in my Ward – either Oxgangs Library or Pentland Community Centre. I have also suggested that a church in Fairmilehead and/or Colintion as testing centres.\nIntroduction\nAt present, there are three Covid-19 testing centres in Council-owned buildings (Gate 55, Usher Hall and Leith Library). There is a licence agreement in place between the Council and the UK Government for each.\nWe have been approached by the Scottish Government on behalf of the UK Government to provide a further eight Local Testing Sites (LTS) in Edinburgh. The attached map shows both the existing centres and the locations where the new sites are required. This expansion aims to:\n- close the gap between the number of people being tested and the estimated number of daily new cases in the mid- to long-term;\n- focus on areas of higher deprivation and low car ownership to increase access to testing; and,\n- maximise the amount of people with symptoms who get tested, by making testing easy to access (and then support these individuals to self-isolate, contact trace their contacts, and break chains of transmission).\nThese centres are for testing people with symptoms of Covid-19 rather than for asymptomatic community testing, which will be covered separately.\nLTS can either be provided within existing buildings or as units on hardstanding areas on outdoor space. There are specific basic criteria for each option that proposed sites need to fulfil, e.g. disability access, separate access/egress etc\nProgress so far\nOfficers provided an initial list of potential options to the Scottish Government for consideration and the first three areas are in the process of being finalised. The options are:\n| Area | Options |\n| Granton | Outdoor LTS within the car park for Ainslie Park Leisure CentreSite at Waterfront Avenue |\n| Niddrie/Craigmillar | Outdoor LTS within the car park for Jack Kane Leisure Centre |\n| Restalrig | Piershill Library |\n| Moredun (TBC) | Moredun Library orGilmerton Community Centre |\n| Clermiston (TBC) | Drumbrae Hub orRannoch Community Centre |\n| Oxgangs (TBC) | Oxgangs Library or Pentland Community Centre |\n| Saughton (TBC) | Carrickvale Community Centre orLongstone Resource Centre |\n| Newington (TBC) | Newington Library orCameron House Community Centre |\nThe graphic above shows these locations on a map of Edinburgh.\nThe UK Government would like to have all eight centres operational by April. They have the capacity to mobilise three centres per week.\nOnce the preferred option for an area is identified, timescales are likely to move fast. A site visit to finalise the layout for the LTS will be followed quickly by a licence agreement and handover of the building.",

However, it has now watered that down and is now saying refurbishments will count for a significant proportion of the total. Will Councillor Campbell stand up to her SNP masters and demand they honour their manifesto commitment? Probably not!\nCouncillor Kate Campbell is also correct to say that public services are suffering due to 7 years of “Tory Austerity”. What she does not mention is the SNP’s complete failure to use its revenue raising powers to help protect the most vulnerable in Scotland. Furthermore, the plight of many vulnerable people in Edinburgh is being exacerbated by the SNP’s failure to deliver their pledge of scrapping the “hated” Council Tax. Will Councillor Campbell stand up to her SNP masters and demand they do more? Probably not!\nCouncillor Kate Campbell is absolutely correct that the creation of Rent Pressure Zones will help many in Edinburgh. Shelter Scotland, Crisis, the Greens and Scottish Labour deserve great credit for lobbying the SNP to give Local Authorities this power. However, the SNP voted against a Labour amendment in Holyrood which sought to ensure rented properties are “warm, secure and safe”. Indeed, SNP MPs in Westminster abstained on a Labour amendment which sought to ensure rented accommodation is “fit for human habitation” – a decision which has come under increased scrutiny since the Grenfell Tower disaster. Will Kate Campbell stand up to her SNP masters and condemn these actions? Probably not!\nIn conclusion, if Edinburgh’s SNP led administration is serious about dealing with our Capital’s housing crisis it has a duty to ensure the Scottish Government uses all the substantial powers at its disposal to do so. Will Councillor Campbell put Edinburgh first and make that argument?\nFaithfully",

Local authorities are directed through Scottish Government guidance to ensure their schools and Early Learning Centre settings have access to CO2 monitoring, whether via mobile or fixed devices. This is in order to support the goal of all school buildings, including all learning and teaching spaces, being assessed regularly for ventilation issues with a view to remedial action being taken where required.\nThe City of Edinburgh Council are working to ensure that appropriate strategies for continuing effective CO2 monitoring are in place, with a particular focus on supporting schools to achieve good ventilation balanced with the requirement for user comfort and warmth.",

He should be demanding Edinburgh gets the power to set a Tourist Tax on top of a fair settlement, not instead of it!\nNonetheless, I hope the Greens in Holyrood have more luck than Council Leader Adam McVey in getting Edinburgh the tourist tax. So far McVey’s failure, and I recognise he has tried, to have any sort of influence over his own party in Holyrood has cost our Capital up to £40m.\nAs stark as the funding crisis is, we should not accept that the cuts are inevitable. For every minute we spend planning which services should be cut and wringing our hands about the over 600 net job losses expected, all of Edinburgh’s Councillors should be spending an hour opposing these cuts.\nNo group in Edinburgh has more influence over the SNP Government on this issue than that led by Cllr Adam McVey, but the silence from them is deafening. There has been complete silence about the impact of these cuts on education, transport, housing and social care from his SNP group members who are happy to accept “Special Responsibility Allowance” payments to be spokespeople on these briefs.\nNo doubt they will all have plenty to say at this weekend’s pro-independence march in Edinburgh.",

For many households, however, recent days would have been dominated by trying to find the time and money to equip Edinburgh’s future doctors, engineers and carers with a school uniform. The financial challenge this poses many in Edinburgh is a reminder of the inequality present in Scotland’s capital.\nI am hugely proud that my motion in Council this year resulted in Edinburgh’s school clothing grant no longer being one of the worst in Scotland. I am really disappointed, however, that despite a further top-up from the Scottish Government, Edinburgh still can’t offer the very poorest households the £129.50 charities say is needed. Indeed, the £100 Edinburgh offers does not compare well with the £135 available in neighbouring Labour run West Lothian.\nI know from my own upbringing in Kirkcaldy that the school holidays can be grim affairs for low income families as money must be found for school uniforms and to fill the space left in stomachs normally filled by free school meals.\nI had hoped that our Capital could emulate Labour run North Ayrshire and provide free school meals right through the summer. Unfortunately, my proposal to do this was not funded. Instead, a more targeted scheme branded “Discover!” was trialled in Oxgangs Primary School in my Ward and also elsewhere in the city. This targeted the most vulnerable households in a way that went well beyond just providing free food.\nAt city level, I know that this scheme supported families with a range of problems – from mothers who were victims of domestic abuse to armed forces families struggling to deal with post-traumatic stress disorder.\nAlthough I still hope that Edinburgh will next year follow in the footsteps of North Ayrshire, I hope “Discover!” is not lost as when I visited the Oxgangs Primary School I have never been so impressed by the commitment of Council staff, or so proud to say I am an Edinburgh Councillor.\nWhen I was there I saw parents sharing their experiences, lonely children building friendships and everyone coming together to share a filling plate of cheesy pasta (see image). I was proud that our capital is using what little money it has to help those in most need, but I can’t help wondering what more we can do if the Council was better funded.",

I contacted the Interim MD of Lothian Buses, Nigel Serafini, yesterday to get his perspective – his response is below.\nYou will see that he is clear that “delays to services of up to 60 minutes” have meant timetables have been “rendered redundant.” The cause is “significantly increased” traffic volumes, roadworks and “new road management measures”.\nAn efficient public transport system is key to getting our city out of the economic slump caused by Covid-19. These delays will only force people out of buses and into cars, a move that will only exacerbate the delays and damage Edinburgh’s tentative recovery. I have passed Nigel Serafini’s e-mail to the Spaces for People team so it can be considered as part of the review of the Braid Road closure.\nI am well aware of the stress these delays are causing people using the route – particularly S1 pupils are their parents. I have spent the last couple of mornings looking at traffic around Greenbank (see here & here), and on Monday (weather permitting) I hope to look at the evening rush hour as I understand that is when delays are worst.\nUpdate from CEC – “I have discussed this with colleagues in Lothian Buses who have advised that these delays are primarily due – as they see it – to the Temporary Traffic Lights at Kaimes Crossroads which started on Monday and finish today, pushing traffic from the A701 to the A702. As such we might reasonably expect the traffic situation to improve next week assuming the TTL operation at Kaimes is complete.“\nNigel Serafini:\nIn planning for the return of schools we increased service levels and provided additional journeys on corridors where we anticipated capacity issues. In addition to these measures we have provided for back-up vehicles and drivers to be deployed as and when we encounter unexpected customer uplifts. This has worked successfully throughout the many phases of lockdown and more recently as schools have re-opened fully. Unfortunately the effectiveness of these measures has been impaired by a number of external factors outwith our control.\nRoad traffic volumes have significantly increased this week coinciding with increased roadworks and new road management measures across the city. This has led to significant congestion and delays to services of up to 60 minutes, causing planned timetables to be rendered redundant. As traffic has slowed, loadings have become heavier and additional journeys have been unable to be in the right place and time to cater for school exit times. We are currently re-working timetables to try and mitigate some of these issues by introducing short workings on some timetables to allow a measure of flexibility.\nAs you will be aware, the compulsory wearing of face coverings on public transport is currently not enforceable by our staff and where family groups or those in ‘social bubbles’ are allowed to travel/sit together we cannot restrict numbers. We have never been asked by the local authority to provide dedicated school transport but we continue to monitor customer numbers and will adjust timetables/frequency’s over the coming days/weeks until hopefully traffic conditions begin to improve.",

Indeed, this battle is not without its skirmishes. On the table right now we also have the tram extension, the Picardy Place development, the George Street “Public Life Street Assessment”, the nebulous North Bridge public realm proposals and the much awaited “Central Edinburgh Transformation” plans.\nCynics would suggest that these projects are not sufficiently connected and promise a revolution at the planning stage but only, at best, deliver incremental change when it comes to implementation. I won’t test that argument or the one that says the best way to respect the World Heritage status we inherited from our ancestors is to empty litter bins and fill potholes. Nor will I question those that virtue signal about reducing car use whilst simultaneously cheerleading for the St James development and its corpulent car park (1000 extra spaces). I will, however, take issue with how the argument is framed.\nFirstly, this is not really about car users fighting pedestrians and cyclists. It’s about us Edinburgers and how we get around our city. It’s not just about copying what works in other cities. It’s about getting our city the way we want it.\nYes, that means fixing the roads and getting the clutter off our pavements. It also means, however, recognising that making it safer to cycle and walk around our city will make it a better place for everyone. Indeed, businesses know that somebody walking or cycling past their door is far more likely to stop and make a purchase than a motorist. The health and community benefits are also clear.\nSecondly, we have to remember taking cars off one road simply to overload another is not the answer. We also have to think about how those with mobility problems get around our city.\nLastly, we have to recognise that improving our city has to be about changing culture, not just publishing reports and erecting signs. This is a process that must start outside central Edinburgh. We need to make it easier for our children and grandchildren to walk and cycle safely to school and other community facilities.

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_07_23_buying-back-council-houses/content_219.html": "After reading this blog, I asked City of Edinburgh Council if it could relieve some of the demand for affordable rented accommodation by systematically buying back former “council houses” as they came on the market. The response I received is below – I am quite keen to seek an opportunity to develop a formal business case on this.\nThe Council’s acquisitions and disposals policy was developed to address the significant challenges of mixed tenure management and investment in improving homes where the Council is the minority owner. The project involves buying homes where the purchase results in the Council achieving full, or majority, ownership. These purchases are funded by the sale of homes in blocks where the Council is the minority owner and there is no long term benefit of investment in these homes.\nThe approach seeks to ensure that the Council achieves an overall balance in the acquisition and disposal of new homes, but there is also a connection to the potential to increase the overall supply.\nAssessing the financial value of the acquisitions approach is not straightforward, particularly given the buoyancy of Edinburgh’s housing market. The majority of homes purchased have been those previously sold to sitting tenants under former right to buy legislation. The cost of purchase can vary considerably, depending on the size, quality (i.e. how much investment the owner has put in to maintain their home) and location of the homes. The Council often has to invest significantly in the homes to bring them up to the required lettable standard for social rented homes. In some instances, the purchase and repairs cost have amounted to less than the average cost of a new-build, however this is not always the case.\nThe future demand and management implications of the purchase of homes also needs to be considered as part of the overall assessment, however, the primary aim is to facilitate our ability to carry out repair and maintenance works for years to come.",

As Black History Month draws to a close, the Group has launched a survey to allow people in Edinburgh to inform its work.\nWe have a duty to be open and honest about Edinburgh links with slavery and colonialism, and to understand what the perception is now and what could make it better. This need not be about destroying our heritage, but we have to reflect on how it is funded and ensure everyone feels valued, welcomed and safe in our city.\nBriefing\nCitizens are being encouraged to have their say on the Capital’s historical links to slavery and colonialism and how they should be remembered and addressed in today’s Edinburgh.\nIn 2020, the Black Lives Matter movement brought international attention to important issues relating to ongoing racism in society. As part of a wider response to the movement, the City of Edinburgh Council committed to ensuring that commemorations of Edinburgh’s history are appropriate for society today – and future generations. The Council therefore commissioned an independent review of the City’s historic links with Slavery and Colonialism in the public realm.\nAs part of its work, the Edinburgh Slavery and Colonialism Legacy Review Group is seeking the views of Edinburgh residents and stakeholders about a selection of prominent features which it considers representative of the many aspects of Edinburgh life and society shaped by this legacy. It wants to hear thoughts about the most constructive ways that the City could address this history for the benefit of all in the future.\nWhilst there are a significant number of monuments, buildings, street names and other features in the public spaces of the Capital today which could be considered, this consultation does not try to reference every one of these. Instead, it provides a representative selection of 41, separated into different themes or relating to a particular aspect of this history. For example, international trade and the profits from slavery and colonialism, the role of the military in sustaining slavery and colonialism and inspiring individual stories.\nThe Group hopes that this approach will help to illustrate the many different elements of Edinburgh life which have been touched by the legacy of slavery or colonialism.\nThe online consultation is hosted on the Council’s website here.

I’m sure I’m not alone in thinking that sounds remarkably similar to the empty rhetoric the SNP used in 2014. This isn’t a reboot, it’s Groundhog Day.\nI guess the question must be, however, why Ian Blackford is the best person to make this argument? What’s his record on inequality and fighting austerity?\nHe’s a man with 5 jobs outside parliament who accepted a substantial donation from a Tory hedge fund manager to bankroll his re-election. He also gave a relative a taxpayer funded job and quickly rewarded him with a promotion.

If they are serious about cutting inequality, maybe they should explain how the billions of pounds in cuts that will come with it would help fight inequality?\nMaybe they could explain how the damage they are doing to education will improve the life chances of the poorest Scots?\nMaybe they could get behind Labour’s plan to raise Child Benefit in order to cut child poverty?\nMaybe they could explain why they are talking about Indyref2 rather than getting on with their day job?

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_06_02_spaces-for-people-market-research-background_comment-page-1/content_276.html": "Running in parallel to the recent consultation on making at least some Space for People permanent, the Council conducted market research to understand what a cross-section of Edinburgh’s population feel. This is because consultations can often disproportionately attract responses from people with strong views.\nAs the survey will feature in the forthcoming SfP debate, I thought it was important to ask (1) which questions were asked and (2) how the people who responded were identified.\nWhich question were asked?\nIt appears the survey followed the same basic format of the of the online consultation, so that the responses could be compared. The Council say the survey “uses essentially identical questions as were on the Consultation Hub. The only appreciable difference between this survey and that on the Consultation Hub is that the Market Research asked questions about potential retention or removal of streets using a geographical split of the city. This was not done on the Consultation Hub for software reasons and to keep the survey as short as reasonably practical.”\nLinked below is the survey text.\nWho were asked to complete the survey?\nI asked how the people who completed the survey were identified, and if they matched the demographics of the city population as much as possible. Age, income, gender etc, and were spread across this city?\nI was given this reassurance – “In short, yes. We asked the MR company to look at the demographics of the sample against the most recent Edinburgh People’s survey to check that it was as representative as possible…. There were respondents from all parts of the city.” … “we asked the MR company to look at the demographics of the sample against the most recent Edinburgh People’s Survey. We also asked them to weight for sex/age if necessary to help achieve results that were as representative of the Edinburgh population as possible.” …\n“We did not collect information on income, so it was not possible to weight for that, We did ask a question on household car ownership in the questionnaire; as well as giving valuable insights in itself this tends to be a fairly good proxy for household income. We haven’t yet compared this information against latest info for Edinburgh, but I am pretty confident that it indicates somewhat higher household car ownership in the sample than in the Edinburgh population as a whole. We have not weighted for car ownership.“\nThe results have been weighted as below.\n| Age Group | Age distribution of sample (unweighted) | Edinburgh People’s Survey results – used for weighting |\n| 18-24 | 8% | 15% |\n| 25-44 | 37% | 40% |\n| 45- 64 | 38% | 28% |\n| 65+ | 17% | 17% |\n| Gender | Age distribution of sample (unweighted) | Edinburgh People’s Survey 2019 results – used for weighting |\n| Female | 51% | 52% |\n| Male | 49% | 48% |\nMore details of the methodology are in the file below.",

If the Council are serious about mitigating the impact of #climatechange, they have to manage their assets way better than this.\nSince reporting these again (1st of July), I received the response below from the Council on the 4th of July:\nI have now investigated the matter and have arranged for the gullies between Fairmilehead Crossroads and Colinton Mains Tesco to be prioritised for attendance. Some were attended last night with the remaining to be carried out shortly. Gullies not accessible due to parked cars will require a temporary parking restriction order to be promoted.\nI would reassure you that the reporting system is monitored and faults/defects/gullies will be attended to. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to address issues quickly due to resources but they will not be ignored. I would still encourage your constituents to continue reporting blocked gullies or any gully related issues via section of the Council’s web-site, at the following link.\nThere are over 55,000 gulleys adopted and maintained by the Council and there is a rolling programme of inspection and maintenance. We do prioritise sensitive locations that we become aware of, through inspections and reports from members of the public.",

We recently learned via the Evening News about the Council Leader’s wonky justification for closing public toilets and the impact that cut will have on families, those with a disability and people facing health problems. Now we read that Lothian Buses’ “jumbo bus” will not have the space for buggies and wheelchairs that far smaller vehicles have (report 13/11/18).\nIndeed, I know that many parents in my ward are concerned that too much of Lothian Buses’ fleet already does not have a space for both a wheelchair and a buggy. This is despite the fact that Lothian Buses boast on their website that “many of our newest buses have an additional space for a buggy as well as the wheelchair space”.\nI am therefore disappointed that although their newest bus is 50% bigger than normal, it will only offer a single space for a buggy or wheelchair.\nIt feels like the UK’s best bus operator has taken a giant step backwards with how this jumbo bus has been fitted out.\nWith 79% of drivers admitting that many of their journeys could be easily taken on foot, via bike or on public transport, as a city we should be making it easier for everyone to take the bus – particularity vulnerable groups.\nAs someone who is passionate about expanding public transport use, I would urge Lothian Buses to rethink this decision and provide more support to wheelchair users, parents and grandparents.\nI’d rather Edinburgh was known as a city that went the extra mile to support families and wheelchair users, than one that closed accessible toilets and made bus use more difficult.",

Indeed, in November 2021 Mr Holder wrote in the Evening news that “Edinburgh must expand”!\nAs if the implication of that is not clear, John McLellan ends his article with the line “There is nothing wrong with defending the greenbelt, but the council must be honest about the implications.”\nI am proud to have reached the end of my 5 year term as your Councillor without any greenbelt land in my Ward being lost to development. No “Polo Fields” have been lost on my watch.\nIt has taken a lot of arguing, but the Council now accepts that it can meet its housing supply targets without allocating any further greenbelt for development. This will be agreed by the incoming Councillors after the election. If re-elected I’ll ensure our greenbelt is protected.",

Cuts to education funding in Scotland have led to a national decline in standards in absolute and relative terms. Indeed, the SNP Government response to news that Scotland was falling down international educational league tables has been to pull out of them!\nThe reasons for this decline should be easy for a man of George Gordon’s intellect to see. Cuts implemented by his party have seen 4,000 teaching jobs lost. These cuts, a 24% real terms pay cut since 2008, and the bungled introduction of the Curriculum for Excellence in Scottish schools has led to unacceptable stress levels in the body of teachers that remain.\nIt’s no wonder that the EIS is balloting on strike action.\nOn top of all this, Edinburgh now faces a further £106m of cuts and reports suggest education is in the sights of the SNP led administration. Indeed, SNP Council Leader Adam McVey tweeted yesterday that Nicola Sturgeon was focusing on “partnership between national & local government”. For the SNP, this is a partnership where council budgets are slashed and those that oppose cuts to education are attacked in the Evening News by nationalist Councillors.\nCouncillor George Gordon could have stood in solidarity with teachers in his ward. He could have asked Adam McVey, the SNP Finance Convenor or the SNP Education Spokesperson to publicly oppose cuts to Edinburgh’s budget because of the impact they would have on a whole generation of Edinburgh school children. He chose loyalty to his party, not our city.\nInstead, he chose to wage a personal attack on me for opposing these cuts. Worse than that, he also tried to blame the cuts on Edinburgh’s Education Convenor simply because he’s a Labour councillor. It would be the easiest thing in the world for Councillor Ian Perry to walk away from the education brief and hand it to the SNP, but he knows he’s the last line of defence against the cuts Edinburgh faces.\nGeorge Gordon needs to quit defending the SNP Government, and start defending our schools.",

Additionally, I received no replies to my request to comment on the survey design. Nor was I allowed to see the area from which residents will be permitted to participate (it is shown on the above map which I received today after complaining).\nMy view is that the number of households being invited to respond from the Buckstone Terrace area is wholly inadequate, and does not compare well with the approach taken along the Lanark Road where a number of side streets were included.\nPeople living outside the survey area can’t take part, and when I asked about how this was monitored (for the Lanark Road survey) I received this response – “Participants of the survey are required to supply name, surname, postcode and email address. This will allow the us to determine if the participants are from the area or not. Regarding the integrity of the survey, we are managing the risk of this happening proportionately by introducing these required fields as it make it much more difficult for someone to fake a response at scale – to submit a hundred fake responses you would need a hundred valid postcodes, a hundred emails and a hundred names.”\nA copy of the survey and the letter to residents is below, but please don’t respond if you have not been invited to do so.

The dithering SNP Government just needs to deliver its commitment to scrap the Council Tax. The current SNP/Green proposal to increase bills by 0-22.5% will not change the fact that it is a fundamentally unfair tax, or reduce the costs faced by the poorest Scots. On top of that, the SNP/Green Gov will claw back a big chunk of the cash raised.\nBriefing\nThe Scottish Government and COSLA have launched a consultation on the Council Tax system. The consultation was published on 12 July 2023 and focuses on potential increased Council Tax charges for properties in valuation Bands E to H.\nThe consultation runs until 20 September 2023 and seeks views on:\n- Increasing Council Tax for properties in valuation Bands E to H\n- The phasing of any increases\n- The potential to expand Council Tax reduction.\n- Impact of the proposed changes.\nThe Scottish Government oversees a Joint Working Group on Sources of Local Government Finance. This is essentially a political forum with Local Government represented by the COSLA presidential team and two officers drawn from the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation and COSLA Directors of Finance. The Joint Working Group has been exploring proposals for meaningful Council Tax changes\nScottish Government advises proposals contained within the current Council Tax consultation is just one aspect of a broader range of potential measures that are under consideration. The current consultation asks for views about the relationship between the property valuation band and the Council tax rate set.\nTo assist political groups develop their own consultation submissions the following information has been compiled.\n- Occupiers of domestic properties pay Council Tax, with the amount due to be paid depending on the valuation band of the property.\n- Council Tax is often described as a regressive tax. This is because when the average Council Tax liability is expressed as a percentage of the estimated property value, the effective tax rate is higher for lower value properties and lower for the higher value properties.\n- The Scottish Government increased the Council Tax Band E to H multipliers in 2017, with a percentage change of 7.5% for Band E, 12.5% for Band F, 17.5% for Band G and 22.5% for Band H.\n- The Council Tax Reduction scheme protects the most financially vulnerable. Entitlement and the amount awarded is based on the characteristics, capital, needs and income of the household.\n- The proposed changes in the current consultation are identical to those in 2017, with a percentage change of 7.5% for Band E, 12.5% for Band F, 17.5% for Band G and 22.5% for Band H.\n- Approximately 38% of Edinburgh households would be impacted by the proposal.\n- The consultation seeks views on whether the changes could be introduced on a phased basis from 2024-25 onwards, with a percentage year-on-year increase over several financial years. This can be delivered from an operational perspective but there are likely to be resource, system and scheduling considerations.\n- The consultation also requests views on the impact of the proposed changes. The proposal has the potential to have a range of impacts and it is anticipated that Scottish Government would complete a full impact assessment before implementing any change. The proposal has the potential to raise funds that could tackle hardship and inequality. The financial impact on protected characteristic groups will also need to be considered, including those that live in higher value properties but have more limited financial means.\n- The consultation proposals do not impact on the Council’s ability to set the Council Tax rate for Edinburgh. The Council would determine this, with any updated multipliers being applied in the normal way as part of the overall process.\n- The impact of the proposal is detailed in the following table, with figures based on the 2023/24 charge. This is for illustrative purposes only.\nIt is anticipated that a similar arrangement to reflect any agreed revisions to Council Tax multipliers will be adopted within the Local Government Finance Settlement, as was the case for the previous related changes in 2017.\nIn line with the underlying principles of Council Tax, any additional income raised from revising the multipliers would be retained by the council concerned. However, in accordance with the needs basis approach underpinning the Local Government Finance Settlement, an individual council’s funding from Scottish Government will be adjusted to ensure that their overall percentage share of grant funding and Council Tax remains unchanged. This ensures that authorities with fewer higher-banded properties (and thus raising proportionately less income from the changes) are not disadvantaged.\nBased on the £176m of additional income anticipated to be generated across Scotland, the net increase in resources available to any given council would be aligned to its share of the Scotland-wide needs assessment. For Edinburgh this would equate to £14.1m (i.e. £176m * 8%).\nOverall anticipated position for Edinburgh\n- Estimated additional Council Tax collected and retained locally = £25.5m\n- Less reduction in Scottish Government funding = £11.4m (which will be distributed to councils with a lower number of band E – H properties to ensure adherence to overall funding being based on a needs-based approach).\n- Net increase in total funding = £14.1m\nCOSLA has produced a separate briefing note and this can be accessed here.\nOfficers will update Committee on the outcome of the consultation. At this time there is no definitive timeline as to when the consultation outcomes will be published.\nThe consultation notes that changing the Council Tax multipliers requires regulations to be agreed in the Scottish Parliament, as well as changes to local authority billing and administration systems. These could be delivered in time for changes to take effect from the start of the 2024-25 Council Tax year.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_01_29_edinburghs-budget-my-priorities/content_402.html": "On the 22nd of February, the City of Edinburgh Council will set its budget. Local Government budgets have always been an example of the “economic problem” – meeting infinite demand with limited resources. The problem we face now in Edinburgh is that demand is increasing due to an aging population and increasing poverty, but resources are falling due to the combined efforts of the UK and Scottish Governments. These are brutal times.\nWhen I was first elected I told a room full of people in the City Chambers that I would not support any cuts to the education budget. In response, a Council Officer laughed at my naivety. I now get the joke – the cuts we face are so significant that no Council service is spared.\nAmidst the discussions about what to cut, most Councillors like me have to think about what their priorities are. This is a game of poker between the parties – cards are not shown, but emotions can often betray what’s planned.\nRight from the start, I have been clear about what my priorities are. In what cynics might describe as a break from tradition, I have based my 4 key priorities on my election pledges, the needs of our Capital and feedback from my constituents.\nA key priority for me is tackling homelessness, but this has to be done sustainably. We need to get hundreds of people out of hostels and temporary accommodation, and in to good quality social housing. If that means buying back good quality former council housing, so be it.\nSecondly, we need to tackle the crisis we are facing in social care. We currently have 2,000 people waiting on a care package assessment, and 45 people are added to that queue every week. We need to clear that backlog.\nThirdly, if we are serious about fighting inequality and reversing the national decline in education, we must kick out the plan to cut library opening hours across the city. Cutting libraries during tough times is like cutting hospitals during a plague.\nLastly, it has been widely reported that the support available to families with children with complex additional support needs has been reduced. If Edinburgh is serious about everyone reaching their full potential, we must find extra funding to better support this service.\nThese are my priorities. The amazing thing is that they are not radical ideas, they are simply about maintaining these services at the minimum level we should really be able to take for granted. That should shame us all.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_12_05_why-charging-for-garden-waste-uplift-is-a-tax-on-the-poorest/content_259.html": "Steve Cardownie is correct when he notes how unpopular the proposal to charge for the collection of garden waste is amongst Edinburgh residents. However, whilst he and Cllr Cathy Fullerton may both feel “tough decisions will have to be made”, I do wonder if both nationalists feel the same should apply to their party’s actions in Holyrood? I assume that as members of the SNP, both back the cuts their party’s elite have been imposing on Scotland’s capital rather than make “tough decisions” like richest Scots tio pay a fair rate of tax?\nWhen it comes to charging for garden waste, I don’t know anyone that doubts that this will result in more fly-tipping, the return of garden bonfires and the misuse of the other waste streams. Before anyone shrugs their shoulders at this, I know from work I have undertaken in Belfast that fly-tipped garden waste makes a significant contribution to culvert blockages, and so increases flood risk.\nThere are many that argue, however, that charging for garden waste collection is “fair” as many people in Edinburgh don’t have gardens and so should not be subsidising those that do. That’s an argument that does not hold water. It takes us down the road where only those with children in school pay for education, or where only those who are ill pay for the NHS. No thanks!\nThe demographic nobody talks about in this debate, not least Steve Cardownie, are people on low incomes. The SNP Government are already forcing the City to raise the most regressive tax (Council Tax) because they won’t use the most progressive tax (income tax). On top of that, are we seriously suggesting that people who are struggling to feed and clothe their children should pay £25 to have their hedge clippings collected? Why should the poorest pay the same as the richest? Why should the many subsidise the few?\nThat’s why I think this proposal should be binned, but the alternative can’t be to cut something else instead. The alternative must be for the SNP Government to fairly fund Scotland’s capital. The alternative is real change.\nWhether you agree or disagree with me, please take part in the Budget Consultation.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_04_06_ward-8-spaces-for-people-update/content_69.html": "Introduction\nIt has been a wee while since I provided an update on the Spaces for People project – basically because the whole thing appears to have stalled. In this vacuum, a bit of misinformation has been circulating. Within that context it is important to note four things:\n- No party has ever asked for all Spaces for People schemes to be removed.\n- All parties have supported the installation of at least some schemes.\n- All parties have supported at least some schemes at least some of the time.\n- Covid-19 is no longer the justification for the schemes.\nThe November 2021 Transport & Environment Committee meeting set the direction of travel for the schemes impacting on my Ward – Lanark Road (the Oct 2021 decision was confirmed), Buckstone Terrace (A702), Braid Road (not actually in my Ward) and the two primary schools (Bonaly & Buckstone).\nLanark Road\nIt was agreed to progress this scheme to an ETRO. The process provides a statutory framework and public engagement process (not a homemade consultation) to consider any future changes to the scheme.\nComiston Road\nIt was agreed to also progress this scheme to an ETRO. It was agreed at the Transport Committee that changes to Braid Road and Comiston Road are impacting on delays to public transport on Comiston road (my video evidence here). The agreed solution to this was to remove a large section of the cycle lane and replace it with a bus lane.\nBraid Road\nThis will progress to an ETRO, and be reopened to two-way traffic. This will only happen, however, after a pedestrian crossing (agreed pre-covid) is installed at The Hermitage.\nSchools\nA School Travel Plan Review is underway for all schools. This piece of work will be carried out over the next 24 months. The aim of the review is to develop a 5 year action plan with parents, children and the schools to make the routes and streets surrounding the schools safer and to encourage more active travel. Schools with temporary Spaces for People measures are being prioritised and the survey for Buckstone and Bonaly has started. Residents will be involved once the initial plan is developed.\nProgress\nClearly, November 2021 was 5 months ago so it is only right that people should wonder what is happening. On the 3rd of February I was told that the ETRO consultations would start by the end of that month, and later I was told mid-March. To date, I have seen no visible progress.\nThe latest update I have for the schools was from mid-March, at that point I was told for Buckstone that “We are currently in dialogue with the school about the future of the Spaces for People measures at Buckstone as well as road safety issues on the wider routes to school”. I understand, however, that there has been no contact with the school since November. I expect the same applies to Bonaly.\nSo what’s causing the delay? Clearly, the Transport Committee should be doing more to scrutinise these projects. The underlying issue is, however, that the workload exceeds the staff resources available.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_12_23_edinburghs-circulation-plan-will-help-tackle-its-congestion-crisis/content_86.html": "Edinburgh’s Circulation Plan aims to “develop and deliver a strategic approach to allocating street space between modes of travel to define the degree of priority to be given to different modes on different streets”. This sounds a bit dull, but it is key to us transforming Edinburgh into a climate ready capital that sets economic development and resident wellbing as key priorities. The plan has already been before Councillors twice (October & December), and will (hopefully) go to consultation after the next iteration in January.\nIt’s becoming increasingly clear to me that the Circulation Plan is needed to both help protect key routes in the city, and also define which transport modes should be prioritised on these routes. The Leith Walk and Picardy Place designs show why this approach is so important. The last Council administration tried to please everyone by endlessly compromising, and ended up making nobody happy. Pedestrians, disabled people, cyclists, car owners, public transport providers and businesses have all raised concerns with me.\nAs we plan to move to a more sustainable transport system in Edinburgh over the next decade, it is important that we learn lessons from Leith Walk and show leadership in applying them in our other town centres to solve their problems. Right now places like Morningside Road are awful for pedestrians, and the congestion there delays thousands of people using buses every day.\nFor many routes in our city, we have to accept that there is only room to accommodate two transport modes to the highest standard. With the Circulation Plan consultation, we shall be asking residents and businesses about how this can be done and how ambitious we should be. In central Edinburgh and our town centres we shall need to ensure we have a world class pedestrian environment with first-class public transport connectivity and cycle access.\nDoing this will come at a cost. In recent days at the Leith Walk/London Road junction I have seen first-hand how a minority of people are willing to put personal convenience before the safety of others when changes agreed by the last administration were enacted. The fact that many people are not aware of what the changes at these junctions are trying to achieve tells me that we need to engage with residents better.\nWe shall have to work with residents and businesses in places like Brunstfield/Morningside, Corstorphine, Gorgie/Dalry, Leith/Leith Walk, Nicolson Street/Clerk Street, Portobello, Stockbridge and Tollcross to better manage parking and loading to cut congestion, and sustainable transport access for all. This will not be easy, but we will learn from similar cities which have made this transition. We’ll also learn from the Spaces for People scheme failures in areas like this, and make all of these places more welcoming in order to support local traders.\nI also recognise that for Edinburgh to thrive, goods and services must be able to freely move around our Capital – Labour in Edinburgh is not ashamed to say it supports economic prosperity and good employers. We will ensure key routes connecting to the city centre have the capacity to ensure Edinburgh goes from strength-to-strength, whilst also working with companies like Farr-Out-Deliveries on “last mile” logistics. At the same time we will see city centre parking reducing as public and active transport connectivity improves.\nI want to be clear that the Circulation Plan won’t just help us manage town centres and key routes, it will also help us deal with the “rat running” traffic which blights many communities. We will start by using the framework the Circulation Plan provides to protect zones around schools (“School Zones”) from the unwanted invasive traffic many communities struggle with.\nSo far I have been pleased with the response to the Circulation Plan from all political parties, businesses, residents and key stakeholders. Indeed, I feel there is enthusiasm for going further. With this in mind, the next iteration will be more ambitious and will start to show how the plan can be used to reduce congestion and cut traffic by 30%, and we will test the appetite for this via the consultation process.\nThere will be those who oppose Edinburgh moving towards a more sustainable transport system, but they often do this without proposing an alternative. Edinburgh is already a congested city and land has just been set aside to build 37,000 more homes by 2032. Inaction will not solve Edinburgh’s congestion crisis, but it will make it harder to tackle.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_11_07_update-lanark-road-braid-road-spaces-for-people-schemes-2/content_329.html": "The Evening News is today reporting that it has been briefed by the Council that the Transport Committee will next week “rubber stamp” the Lanark Road Spaces for People scheme and the continued closure of Braid Road. This is despite the final plans and the details of the recent consultation not yet having been made public.\nLanark Road\nOvernight the “Spaces for People Update – November 2020” report appeared on the Council’s website. For the Lanark Road scheme, the Council is now publicly stating what I reported on the 28th of October – the aim is “to provide a safe, protected cycling route as an alternative to the canal\ntowpath and Water of Leith shared use path...”.\nFinalised plans are not presented. Indeed, the scheme is described simply using 13 bullet points. It is claimed that the scheme will “form part of a longer route intended to provide an alternative to the Water of Leith and Union Canal towpath to enable physical distancing and reduce congestion and conflict on these busy routes…”, but no details of this are provided. The recent consultation gets no mention.\nBraid Report\nThe Braid Road closure also gets a mention in the Council’s report. This has been closed for some time due to the large numbers of people trying to access The Hermitage in early lockdown raising concerns about social distancing. Whilst difficulties maintaining social distancing at site are now much less of a concern, the Council has refused to back down and reopen the road even on a trial basis.\nThe Council is again saying the closure is needed to enable the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route. Although the Quiet Route plans now appear far less ambitious than I previously reported, the Council want to “maintain the existing Braid Road closure and introduce specific measures near the St Peter’s and James Gillespie’s schools to provide a coherent quiet connection from the Greenbank area through to the existing Meadows active travel network”.\n“At present the closure of Braid Road has effectively removed through traffic from the Cluny area. If Braid Road was re-opened in any direction this would re-introduce traffic to this area, primarily on Midmar Avenue and Hermitage Drive which would cause a conflict between general traffic, and users of the quiet route on Hermitage Drive. This could significantly undermine the attractiveness of the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Corridor.”\nCITY OF EDINBURGH COUNCIL\nThe report accepts that the Braid Road closure means traffic on Comiston Road is 11% higher than pre-Covid levels. Whilst this may mean less traffic is passing James Gillespie’s, far more is passing South Morningside Primary School – is more noise and pollution there acceptable? Additionally, added congestion on Comiston Road means buses are delayed and passengers are exposed to Covid transmission risks for longer.\nAgain, no finalised plans have been make public for the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route and there is now mention of the consultation responses.\n09-11-2020 Update – I now have a plan for this scheme – it is at the bottom of this post.\nLegal Advice\nThere are benefits to the Lanark Road scheme and the continued closure of Braid Road. Both, however, come with consequences for local residents and businesses. In my view, the Council has a duty to present evidence based arguments which show the benefits outweigh the consequences.\nIndeed the use of the Covid TTRO processes removes the rights local people and businesses have to be consulted on these changes. However, using the Covid TTRO process must be a proportionate response to the pandemic. The Council has already been rocked by claims that these powers are not being used properly.\nThe legal position is only mentioned once in the report, and this is only in relation to the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route – “All of the measures proposed have been considered in respect of the legal powers associated with TTRO powers. An assessment of the measures and the associated legislation has concluded that these proposals have been developed to provide access to appropriate areas which enables safe active travel for all ages during the transition through and beyond COVID-19.”\nThat’s it. The “assessment” is not shared and no argument is made to explain why the scheme is proportionate or how it warrants the use of TTRO powers specifically. There is no similar statement for the Lanark Road scheme.\nWe all want safer streets, less pollution and better support for walking and cycling, but this can only happen when the Council works with communities. Time and time again with Spaces for People in Edinburgh we have seen that even the best transport engineers will come unstuck if they don’t draw on local lived experience when drawing up their designs. If the Council wants to go beyond the Covid TTRO remit or can’t show that the benefits of these schemes outweigh the consequences, this is the approach it must adopt.",

When coupled with the news that Glasgow Airport has also witnessed significant growth, however, it must raise deep concerns about the SNP Government’s aviation strategy.\nWith business booming and tickets available for flights to many European capitals at prices comparable with the car parking charges at Edinburgh and Glasgow Airports, Nicola Sturgeon is intent on slashing air passenger duty (APD). This is a policy for the few, not the many.\nIndeed, analysis from the Office for National Statistics has suggested the SNP’s plan, which is supported by the Tories, to halve APD would save the top 20% of earners £73 per year whilst the poorest would save just £4 on average. In short, cutting APD will increase inequality.\nFurthermore, the SNP Government’s own analysis shows its plan to cut APD by 50% could result in up to an extra 60,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases reaching the atmosphere each year. Add to that real concerns about noise along the flight paths to understand the damage stimulating unconstrained growth in the aviation industry can do.\nThe SNP Government has set aside an estimated £189m to cut APD. Would that money not be better spent by investing it in more sustainable forms of transport?\nRather than making it cheaper for the richest Scots to jet off to New York and Florida, let’s use it to create a cleaner and greener transport system in Scotland. Let’s use it for the many and not the few.\nI would urge readers who are concerned about this to contribute to the Scottish Governments consultations on cutting APD and their Climate Change Bill – both can be found online and close in mid-September.\nThe SNP’s record on listening to consultations is not a good one, but it is important that progressive voices are heard.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2024_07_20_my-maiden-speech-as-an-mp-a-tour-of-edinburgh-south-west_comment-page-1/content_112.html": "Below is the text of my “Maiden Speech” (see it in Hansard). The tradition is that the speech should focus on two key elements – a tribute to my predecessor and praise of my constituency. It was part of the Kings Speech debate, so I also touched on that.\nI am obliged to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to make my maiden speech. I would like to start by thanking the hon. Member for Brigg and Immingham (Martin Vickers) for a fantastic speech, but I fear that he has made my job only a little more difficult. I have to say that it is a delight to give my maiden speech in a debate led by our fantastic Deputy Prime Minister.\nIt is an honour and a privilege to stand before this House as the representative for Edinburgh South West. I am deeply grateful to my constituents for placing their trust in me and also to my church for praying for me, although I know that they prayed more after I won the election than before it. I am committed to serving them all with dedication and integrity.\nBefore I address the subject matter of the King’s Speech, I would like to pay tribute to my immediate predecessor, Joanna Cherry KC, who represented the constituency for nine years. I had many dealings with her office in my role as a councillor, and I aways found her team to be utterly professional. I wish them all well. Joanna Cherry herself was a formidable parliamentarian. Members will recall that, during the Brexit crisis, she worked hard to ensure that Government decision making remained transparent and subject to parliamentary scrutiny. We all owe her a huge debt for that. I must also say that, although I disagree with her on many issues, I am happy to stand in complete solidarity with her in the face of the threats that she has faced. It pains me that, since coming here, so many others have spoken about threats and intimidation as well. This is an issue that we must take seriously. I must, however, tell the House that the campaign for Edinburgh South West between Joanna Cherry and myself was conducted entirely on the issues that matter to local people there, which is perhaps why I am so proud to be here to address the House today.\nI must also pay tribute to my predecessor’s predecessor. Alistair Darling was one of the greatest public servants of my lifetime. He sat here from 1987 to 2015. Like me, he was a councillor in Edinburgh, and convener of the city’s transport committee before he went on to serve as MP for Edinburgh South West. The similarities may end there. Indeed, we must all hope that I am never called on, as he was, to save the Bank of England. I know that Alistair is still much missed and I am proud to follow in his footsteps—indeed, without his help I doubt that I would have been elected as a councillor in 2017.\nBefore I address myself to the debate, I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to my constituency, its institutions and its people. At this point, Members may need a map. Edinburgh South West is the best part of the greatest city in the world. It stretches from the west end of Princes Street to the East Cairn hill, some 18 km to the south-west. Along its length, the constituency moves from dense urban communities—places such as Gorgie, the home of Hearts football club, Dalry, Parkhead, Wester Hailes, Sighthill and Oxgangs—to suburban settlements such as Colinton, Craiglockhart, Swanston and Baberton Mains, and to the semi-rural Water of Leith villages of Currie, Juniper Green and Balerno.\nOf all those, Oxgangs is perhaps the place I know and love most. Many people there struggle in temporary and overcrowded accommodation; that is why it has been so important today to hear about the Deputy Prime Minister’s ambition to build affordable homes. In Edinburgh, we have worked with the whole city and set aside land for 37,000 new homes. The land is there and the planning is there, but the barrier to building those new homes is the lack of funding from the Scottish Government. I hope that they can now follow what we are doing here, and show more ambition on affordable housing in Scotland.\nWhen it comes to natural beauty, the Pentland hills and the Water of Leith dominate my constituency, and the habitats along the Union canal should not be forgotten. But of course it is the people who make my constituency so special, such as those who volunteer at the Water of Leith Conservation Trust or who converted a disused railway tunnel into Scotland’s largest historical mural—the Colinton tunnel; please google it later. I must also mention Tiphereth, a unique charity that delivers residential and day services for people with learning difficulties. It really is unique.\nThe Edinburgh campus of Heriot-Watt University is perhaps the biggest employer in my constituency. It supported and developed me every day from when I started working there in 1996 until I was elected to this place. I shall miss my civil engineering colleagues and the many students it welcomes to Scotland from around the world. I hope to use some of my time here to support higher education, particularly the wellbeing of students. Mental health support in Scotland is failing its young people and acting as a barrier to many of them reaching their full potential. I will work with anyone and everyone to address that and the many other challenges facing students across the UK.\nOther large employers in my constituency include Lothian Buses, a bus company owned by the people of Edinburgh that defines the city just as much as the castle. I should stress that the castle is not in my constituency. If some Members question municipal ownership of public transport, or the importance of collaborative working between trade unions and management, they should speak to some of the 2 million passengers that Lothian Buses carries every week without any subsidy. Big businesses are also important in my constituency, but it is the small ones that define it. They are at the heart of many of the neighbourhoods. Many have high hopes that the UK and Scottish Governments will now work together to support them more.\nI am also proud to say that there are two infantry barracks in my constituency: Dreghorn and Redford. Both are valued by local residents as real assets, and they never caused me a problem as a councillor. The proposal in the King’s Speech for an armed forces commissioner will be supported by many in my constituency, particularly if it helps improve the living quarters for our service personnel and supports spouses at the point of relationship breakdown, particularly when domestic abuse has been an issue.\nElections are a reminder that we are all equal in this country, but it pained me that many constituents felt that they were less equal than others during the election campaign. That is why local groups in my constituency such as Soul Food Oxgangs, Best Bib n Tucker and Whale Arts must be mentioned in my speech, as they all work hard to ensure that people feel included and valued. That is our job too, of course—indeed, all of us here have a duty to keep on listening to voters now that the election is over. The first-past-the-post system means that I was elected on just 40.9% of the vote—I still cannot believe it, to be honest—and I know that some of those voters still want to be reassured that they did the right thing. I am here only because I promised to work with other parties where possible, and to listen to everybody in my constituency, no matter their sex, gender, background, faith, age or birthplace. I will keep listening to people, even if they voted for my opponents or did not vote at all.\nWe know, of course, that the people who need our help most did not vote for us. Among them are the 3,000 children in my constituency who are living in poverty. That number has grown across the whole UK since Labour last sat on the Government Benches, and that should shame us all. I know the costed measures in the King’s Speech are our best chance of changing those lives.\nMeasures such as GB Energy, building more homes, a new deal for working people and our plans for sustainable economic growth will not just get our country back on track and help us to meet our climate targets, but give parents hope again of a better future for their children. The child poverty taskforce is an opportunity to maximise the benefits of those policies by integrating their delivery. That is the change our country needs and voted for, and we must now work together across this Chamber to deliver it.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_01_16_a-briefing-on-active-transport-plans-for-the-upgraded-sheriffhall-roundabout/content_585.html": "Below is a briefing on how City of Edinburgh Council is working with Midlothian Council and Transport Scotland to ensure active transport is supported and promoted as part of the proposed upgrade of Sheriffhall Roundabout via the Edinburgh City Region Deal.\nThe consultants who are developing the design for the Sheriffhall junction upgrade on behalf of Transport Scotland have held a series of design workshops with representatives of both Edinburgh and Midlothian Councils. This process is ongoing and our Active Travel team is providing input on the proposed facilities for walking and cycling. Transport Scotland’s consultants tell us that their client intends that the new junction should be an exemplar active travel scheme.\nMuch of the A7 south of the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary (ERI) is within Midlothian, however the section north of ‘The Wisp’ is within this Council’s area.\nThis Council is supportive of the suggestion that the junction upgrade should include works to improve conditions for walking and particularly cycling on the entire road corridor from appropriate points in Midlothian south of the junction, north-westwards to the ERI.\nThe above was part of the verbal comments given to Transport Scotland’s consultants recently, at our last meeting. The essence of our response was that, whilst high quality segregated provision through the junction was essential, it would be most productive for the project to deliver a good standard of walking/cycling provision from origin to destination, rather than an excellent standard through the new junction coupled to no enhancement of the remainder of the route. The latter approach would leave a number of cycling-related issues on the route between Sheriffhall and the ERI, particularly for less confident cyclists – the key group when seeking to increase mode share for travel to work.\nThis Council is focussing its active travel investment in the locations where there is potential for the greatest impact. Its significant Active Travel budget is already essentially committed for several years to come and does not cover the work discussed above on the sections of route within Edinburgh (though the Council is participating in work considering an upgrade to cycling connections to the Bioquarter from the Cameron Toll/Kings Buildings areas). However, the Council would welcome any decision from Transport Scotland to include the links discussed above as part of the Sheriffhall junction upgrade scheme. As roads authority, the Council would be happy to collaborate with development, design and delivery work.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_03_22_oxgangs-house-investment/content_55.html": "It is long overdue, but the Council has now published plans to invest almost £4m in Oxgangs House. This will transfer the block into modern looking efficient Council homes. Privately owned homes will not have to take part in parts of the upgrade, but the owners will have to contribute to the costs of the improvements to the shared elements. Grants will be available to help owners with costs.\nA survey has confirmed that the building is structurally sound but requires significant planned investment of up to £3.5m with the cost of essential and medium-term repairs estimated at £1.6m. This estimated budget cost would be confirmed by tendering the proposed works.\nThe report recommends common works which include repairs to substructure walls, roofs structure and covering, render replacement to external walls, repairs to walkway ceilings, balustrades and handrails in common areas, external drainage, external window and doors and common area lighting. Additionally, the survey report recommends significant works to upgrade the mechanical and electrical installations within the properties.\nThe Council will be delivering a newsletter to all doors at Oxgangs House this week, and will follow up with the first direct letters to owners in the next two weeks.\nIf you live in Oxgangs House, please get in touch if you have any questions.",

I would strongly suggest Ward 8 residents who oppose this cut to take part in the consultation and write to Gordon MacDoland MSP asking him not to back cuts to Edinburgh’s budget.\nThe EIS has read with real concern the proposals around removing nursery teachers and headteachers from nursery classes. Whilst we appreciate the huge budgetary pressures Edinburgh Council is under due to the provisional Local Government Finance Settlement for 2019/20, we are strongly of the view that this is a short-sighted cut that is likely, over the long term, to actually cost the council more money. We refute the idea that having nursery teachers working in an individual class has no impact on the quality of the educational provision. Nursery teachers have expert level insight into the cognitive and pedagogical development of children, and how best to help children to become “school-ready”. This expertise is most effective when it can be linked to the specific needs of a child and the context in which the child is living (including developing relationships with, and knowledge of, the family/home circumstances). This is something that can only happen when a nursery teacher works closely with a class of children, and the associated early years practitioners, over extended periods of time. The idea that nursery teachers acting as “consultants” to a range of different classes in different settings would support children to anything like the same extent is clearly not credible. The result will be many children, especially the most vulnerable, being less ready and able to make the transition to school, and the long-terms financial and social costs of this are, I hope, obvious. It certainly undermines the drive to close the attainment gap, and to promote equity of educational outcomes.\nOver the next days and weeks, the EIS in Edinburgh will be gathering more evidence in support of our view that this proposal should be dropped from the Change Strategy, and we will be making our case to you, and to Edinburgh residents and parents. In the meantime, though, you may want to look at this document, which summaries some research into the impact qualified teachers have on early years education https://www.eis.org.uk/Policy-And-Publications/Sustain-The-Ambition",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_08_08_seeing-red-spaces-for-people-internal-audit_comment-page-1/content_365.html": "The Council’s Internal Auditors had given the Spaces for People Programme in Edinburgh a RED rating. This means “Significant Improvement Required” (See Appendix 13 of this report) . This is the second worst rating it can give.\nSpecifically, they conclude “Significant and / or numerous control weaknesses were identified, in the design and / or effectiveness of the control environment and / or governance and risk management frameworks. Consequently, only limited assurance can be provided that risks are being managed and that the Council’s objectives should be achieved.”\nThe auditors noted the context of the Covid-19 crisis but conclude that “proposals are not appropriately prioritised for approval, and the rationale supporting decisions is not recorded” and that these schemes “were largely based on professional judgement with limited justification available to support prioritisation outcomes…”\nThey also stated there was a “public perception that feedback provided through the Commonplace survey was not considered in relation to ongoing schemes.”\nThese conclusions are not a surprise, as I know many residents raised these concerns with myself, and the Transport Convener often justified the approach taken when questioned.\nBased on work they did in October 2020, the Auditor recommended the Council should:\n- ensure that prioritisation outcomes and supporting rationale are clearly documented.\n- publish the outcomes of a retrospective prioritisation process.\n- consider whether any changes to either completed or initiatives in progress are required based on public feedback.\nThe Auditors said that where possible there was a “need to align proposals with public feedback and opinion” but found that “where public feedback was incorporated into projects, no audit trail was available to confirm that this was completed”. Again, myself and local residents have been calling for greater public engagement since summer 2020!\nIn terms of project delivery, the Auditors said “no risk management process was implemented to support identification, assessment, and management of programme delivery risks.”, and that “no assessment has been performed to confirm that expected benefits have been realised”.\nIn terms of the Commonplace survey used to collect feedback early in the SfP Programme, the Auditors say “data controller responsibilities have not been clarified between the Council and the application provider”.\nOn removing or retaining the scheme the Auditors say “there is currently no clear strategy for determining the potential exit costs associated with reversing individual projects, or transitioning them into permanent solutions, and it is currently unclear how any significant exit costs will be funded”. They say £175,000 has been retained to complete a review of programme benefits by an external consultant, but no “supporting rationale for this retention value” and that “Management has advised that this budget allocation was defined following detailed engagement with Sustrans, however no evidence has been provided to support this”.\nConclusion\nAlthough it is a little dated now, this is a damning report. It does, however, explain why the Spaces for People Programme has been so controversial in Edinburgh. Many of the points identified by the Auditor have been raised by the public many times. Whether people love Spaces for People or hate it, there can be no doubt that this damning Internal Audit judgment could have been avoided if residents were listened to. No only were the expectations of people in Edinburgh not met, the Council did not even comply with the community engagement guidance set by Sustrans.",

Everything from Holyrood Park and West Princes Street Gardens to the many more humble public parks (like those in my Ward) are part of why Country Living recently awarded Edinburgh the status of the UK’s “Greenest City” .\nThat’s why I was so concerned to read that Glasgow’s DF Concerts thinks Princes Street Gardens could become “Scotland’s answer to the Hollywood Bowl” and urged Edinburgh to look at New York’s Central Park because it has “loads of events”, saying cities like Edinburgh need to “utilise their assets” better.\nThe basis of this approach appears to be that West Princes Street Gardens is a commodity which should again be encircled by barriers so it can be exploited. If this is the approach, it shows no awareness of the history of Edinburgh’s West Princes Street Gardens.\nIn the early 19th century West Princes Street Gardens was accessed by subscription only, and was only open to the general public for free two days per year. In 1876 the city took ownership of the gardens for the public to use free of charge.\nThese gardens and their position below Edinburgh Castle are part of what defines our capital. No other city would contemplate converting this to a “Hollywood Bowl”, so why should we? Would such a thing be contemplated on Washington’s National Mall or Paris’s Parc du Champ-de-Mars? Events have a place on these spaces, but first and foremost they are there for the public to enjoy.\nIndeed, comparing West Princes Street Gardens to the Hollywood Bowl and Central Park is misleading. Hollywood Bowl is actually in the hills outside Hollywood, and events take up a tiny part of Central Park’s 315 hectares (West Princes Street Gardens can fit in to it 26 times).\nI agree that cities like Edinburgh need to “utilise their assets” more, but I also feel that we have to value our public spaces more and not forget the rich inheritance our city ancestors gave us.",

The main focus is safety issues associated Bus Stop Boarders (I wrongly called these floating bus stops previously), the new Bus Lane, the Biggar Rd speed limit and an issue at the Fairmilehead crossroads.\nBus Stop Boarders\nMe: See attached (tweet in header image) from Living Streets on Bus Stop Boarders. Are these also off the table for the A702?\nCouncil: “Bus Stop Bypasses are still proposed on the A702. These will be part of Phase 2”\nMe: “Why are the bus stop boarders being removed from other schemes but not the A702?”\nCouncil: We have decided to omit Bus Stop Bypasses from some schemes, this is primarily to reduce costs associated with delivering these. Broadly, the criteria we have applied are as follows:\nIf a road is: 20mph AND local or secondary AND serves less than 10 buses per hour, we will not generally use Bus Stop Bypasses. On these roads it will be reasonably safe for someone cycling to overtake a stopped bus. You will note that each of these applies for Pennywell Road; Causewayside and Buccleuch Street.\nIf however a road is 30mph (or more), OR; Strategic, OR; serves more than 10 buses per hour, we generally will use Bus Stop Bypasses.\nThere are some exceptions to the above and there will always be consideration of the site conditions – especially gradient. For example, we are not proposing Bypasses at bus stops in lay-bys on a downhill grade where people cycling do not need to change direction in order to overtake a stopped bus.\nComiston Road is a busy strategic route, has a speed limit of 30mph and at times a steep grade. Expecting people cycling to move into traffic in order to pass a stopped bus on a road like this – especially when travelling uphill – will significantly increase the risk, and limit the attractiveness of using this route by bike, especially to less confident and beginner cyclists.\nThe detail of our Bus Stop Bypass design will make clear to people cycling that they should give way to pedestrians, and that they should reduce their speed on the approach to bus stops.\nYou may be interested in the attached research reports looking at the operation of the Bus Stop Bypasses that have already been installed on Leith Walk between Pilrig Street and Macdonald Road. This research has been circulated to Transport Spokespersons for each party as well as relevant stakeholders (SPOKES; Living Streets; Edinburgh Access Panel; Edinburgh Bus Users Group).\nThe first is a report produced by Edinburgh Napier University which considers specifically the nature of the interactions between Pedestrians and Cyclists at these Bus Stop Bypasses during November 2017.\nThe second is a report produced by AECOM Ltd which considers several elements of the Leith Programme, including the Bus Stop Bypasses, Albert Place cycle-priority crossing, and Middlefield continuous footway. This report considers these elements against various indicators to provide an overall picture, across three assessment periods: November 2017; May 2018, and November 2018.\nYou will note that this monitoring demonstrates several interesting findings:\n- The overall number of people walking and cycling increased over the study period\n- The proportion of cyclists entering the footway, and pedestrians entering the cycleway decreased over time\n- The frequency, of interactions between people walking and cycling at the Bus Stop bypasses was very low with the vast majority of users not being involved in any form of interaction,\n- The typical severity of the interactions that did occur between people walking and cycling at bus stops was also very low, with most conflicts which did take place being minor in nature\n- These outcomes are consistent with other studies within the UK\n- Those conflicts which did occur were most often when cyclists and pedestrians were facing the same way and a pedestrian stepped into the cycleway. It is anticipated that installing cycleways with a level difference will reduce this type of conflict, and others, to even lower levels\nI hope this is helpful, please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.\nMe: Can you confirm which of the studied stops use the same design as proposed on Comiston Road? If the answer is “none”, does CEC have any data which explains specifically the nature of the interactions between pedestrians and cyclists? When you say “we have decided to omit Bus Stop Bypasses from some schemes”, can you be clear about who “we” is? I understand there was a meeting with the Edinburgh Access Panel and Living Streets etc last week. Were their views on these stops discussed? Can the notes from the meeting be shared?\nCouncil: [awaiting reply]\nNew Bus Lane\nMe: I am getting lots of general e-mails from constituents about the A702, but the new bus lane at Fairmilehead crossroads is an issue that keeps coming up. I had a look at it yesterday, and I could see that southbound drivers were quick to merge (in the rush for the lights) alongside cyclists where the cycle lane ends. I feel the original proposed design was safer for cyclists, but making the bus lane 24/7 would be an improvement. Local residents are requesting off-peak parking in the bus lane. Can these three options be considered?\nCouncil: We will look into extending Bus Lane operation hours to 7am – 7pm on both bus lanes on the affected section of the A702 (northbound and southbound) to protect cyclists outside peak hours. We will not be introducing off-peak parking as this would be incompatible with the bus lanes being safe for use by cyclist\nTraffic Lanes on Biggar Road\nMe: Northbound traffic on the Biggar Rd still forms in two lanes (see header image). This leads to a sudden merger of traffic as it enters Buckstone Terrace. Making the left-hand lane for left turning traffic only would be safer. Can this be considered?\nCouncil: This is already part of the designs. I believe this will be don\nBiggar Rd Speed Limit\nMe: This must be the shortest section of 40mph road in Edinburgh and zero protection is offered to cyclists. Can we make it 30mph?\nCouncil: I will liaise with our Road Safety Team. If this section is already proposed to be reduced to 30mph then I will look into delivering this as part of SfP.\nMe: Yes, Biggar Rd was scheduled to be 30mph.",

My e-mail address is Scott.Arthur@Edinburgh.Gov.UK\nAs it stands, I plan on making the following points:\n- Specifically, what is the concern that triggered the use of Covid-19 guidance to propose these “Emergency Response Measures”.\n- Detailed drawings of individual Floating Bus Stop designs must be shared for comment.\n- A Road Safety Audit must be undertaken before work starts.\n- A meeting with local residents must be held to address residual concerns. before any work gets underway.\nThe full briefing is below – this includes the plans and details on how to respond to the consultation.\nCovid-19 Cycling and Walking Emergency Response Measures – Lanark and Longstone/Inglis Green Road\nPlease be advised that as part of overall emergency measures we are proposing to implement segregated cycleways on Lanark Road and Longstone/ Inglis Green Road to help pedestrians and cyclists travel safely while meeting physical distancing requirements.\nI have attached the proposed designs for the scheme. In summary it shows:\n- Introduction of uni-directional segregated cycleways along Lanark Road and Longstone Road\n- Improvements to junctions along the road to make them safer for cyclists\n- Introduction of waiting and loading restrictions along parts of Lanark and Longstone Road\n- Introduction of Floating Bus Stops along Lanark Road\n- Introduction of new sections of Bus Lane on the approach to key junctions\n- Removal of pedestrian guardrail\nAny comments relating to these proposals should be received by 1700 hrs on 9 October to spacesforpeople@edinburgh.gov.uk.\nAll feedback will be reviewed and where possible the scheme will be further refined. Feedback will be summarised in an assessment feedback form which will be presented to the Council Incident Management Team for approval.

Below is my reply.\nFirstly, the Community Council should be congratulated for standing up for Colinton residents on this important issue. This is exactly the kind of activity community councils should be leading on.\nMuch is said in Holyrood about the impact of UK Government “austerity” on the Scottish Government finances. The reality is, however, that the Scottish Government has chosen to specifically target these cuts on councils. In a report published just last month, COSLA revealed that “In the last 5 years, the Scottish budget has reduced in real terms by 0.4%. Local Government budgets have reduced 10 times that much by 4%”. Worse than that, Edinburgh has one of the worst funding settlements in Scotland. Indeed, the total budgeted funding (revenue & capital) for Edinburgh in 2011/12 was £872.5m, whereas in 2017/18 is was just £790.3m!\nDespite the severity of these cuts, Edinburgh is expecting to have to make £106m of “savings” (around 10% of its annual budget) over the next 5 years and we have a Council Leader who is simply unwilling to oppose them. Indeed, he welcomed the budget settlement last year despite the dark picture it painted for councils.\nhttps://twitter.com/Marion_Donals1/status/941369665443549185\nAlthough Edinburgh can’t avoid cuts imposed by MSPs, as a Councillor I feel that we all have a duty to ensure the most vulnerable people are protected from their impact. Over the past few months we have seen how the cuts driven changes to waste collection have brought significant distress to some of the most vulnerable people in Edinburgh – we have a duty to ensure that unintended consequence is not repeated in the 2019/20 budget.\nWithin that context, like you, I have concluded that closing public toilets across Edinburgh will be felt most by older people, young families, people with disabilities and those with certain health conditions. These are exactly the people we should be protecting from the Scottish/UK Government’s cuts.\nThe Council Leader recently claimed that public toilets are generally in need of substantial investment and are the focus of crime. He has clearly never had to “spend a penny” in Colinton. As you know, the village benefits from a relatively new purpose built facility which is fully accessible and well used (not least by bus drivers and tourists). Council Officers have confirmed to me that there are no problems with them, and the Police have also informed me they can find no record of crime or anti-social behaviour linked to them.\nThe reported proposal to close the majority of Edinburgh’s public toilets may only be equivalent to ~0.025% of the Council’s budget, but the true cost to our Capital will be huge.\nRather than slashing public toilet budgets, we should be improving these facilities across the city. I’d much rather Edinburgh was a place that was known for having clean and fully accessible public toilets where nature’s needs can be met and babies can be changed, rather than a place where men (mostly) were too often seen urinating in public.\nLast year I was able to work with others to have cuts which would have had a significant impact on my Ward removed from the budget (not least a significant reduction in Library opening hours) and have the impact of others lessened. I shall take the same approach to dealing with the threat to public toilets. Whilst I agree that a full consultation is needed before any cut is considered fully, I hope that this proposal is simply flushed away long before that.\nI am more than happy to work with Councillors from the four other political groups on this important issue as I recognise that normally 2-3 parties are needed to block/pass any motion.\nPlease let me know if you don’t receive a satisfactory response to the questions you have raised.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_03_07_edinburghs-housing-crisis-why-affordable-housing-wont-solve-the-bb-problem_comment-page-1/content_658.html": "Councillor Susan Rae and the Evening News should be congratulated for raising the plight of homeless people who have been placed in Bed and Breakfast accommodation by the City of Edinburgh Council (report, 06/03/18). The report was concerning given that in February it was reported to Full Council that 1,609 households were in temporary accommodation and that 605 of these were using B&Bs.\nThe report makes clear that the quality of this accommodation too often is not good enough. The Council, however, needs to go beyond simply getting families out of B&Bs. Firstly, if we are paying £5.7m per year for temporary accommodation, we need to make sure it is fit for human habitation. In the longer term, we need to aspire to end the use of B&B accommodation completely rather than just lift families out of them. Indeed, the number of families in B&Bs is so small that it’s not even the tip of the iceberg. It’s the snow on the tip of the iceberg!\nThere will be those that argue that the solution to the problem is the Council’s plan to build 20,000 affordable houses over 10 years. We need to be honest about this, however, as only around a quarter of the “affordable” housing built last year in Edinburgh was for social rent. With over 20,000 people on the council house waiting list in Edinburgh, we know that social housing is what’s needed. Indeed, over five thousand people recently applied for just 32 council houses built as part of the Leith Fort development.\nThe other types of “affordable” housing are simply not affordable to many people living in Edinburgh – it’s time we were honest about that. Building more social housing costs money, however, and the SNP Government is cutting Edinburgh’s budget. Indeed, the recent “City Deal” came with not one penny for social housing. That’s why we need to use the £2m allocated in Edinburgh’s budget for homelessness wisely.\nTo start to tackle the housing crisis we need to act fast, but building homes takes time. That’s why we need to stop paying private landlords to offer temporary accommodation. Instead, we need to “borrow to buy-back”. We should use the £2m to borrow around £16m to pump-prime the systematic buy-back of the council houses Margaret Thatcher sold. We can use the money that would have went to private landlords to pay back this loan.\nThis proposal may look radical, but a timid approach won’t solve Edinburgh’s housing crisis.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_01_23_spaces-for-people-proposal-to-close-braid-hills-drive/content_385.html": "Normally Councillors get (confidential) sight of Council reports a couple of weeks before they go in the public domain. This gives us a chance to seek clarification or perhaps even raise concerns.I received the (incomplete) 49 page Spaces for People report yesterday at 9:41am and it went in the public domain at 2:38pm.\nI knew it would possibly contain a plan for cycle lanes on Braid Hills Drive (not my Ward). Inspection of the report, however, reveals that the Council is considering closing the road. It was argued that it was an “important safe link to areas of exercise in the Hermitage of Braid and Braid Hill area“.\nFour options are presented:\nOption 1 – Braid Hills Road / Drive remain open to vehicular traffic and segregated cycle lanes are provided. The segregated cycle lanes would be provided from the junction of Braid Road / Braid Hills Road to the junction of Liberton Road / Liberton Brae.\nOption 2 (pictured above) – Provision of segregated cycle lanes from the junction of Braid Road / Braid Hills Road to a closure point just east of the junction with Braid Hills Avenue. A closure point will also exist at the junction of Braid Farm Road and Braid Hills Road. From here Braid Hills Road / Drive would remain closed until the junction with Liberton Tower Lane. East of this closure point a segregated cycle lane will be provided on the southern edge of the carriageway until the junction with Alnwickhill Road and east of this, segregated cycle lanes will be provided until the junction with Liberton Brae.\nOption 3 – A closure point will be situated on Braid Hills Road just east of the junction with Braid Hills Avenue. A closure point will also exist at the junction of Braid Farm Road and Braid Hills Road. From here Braid Hills Road / Drive will remain closed until the junction with Liberton Tower Lane. East of this closure point a segregated cycle lane will be provided on the southern edge of the carriageway until the junction with Alnwickhill Road where the scheme will terminate.\nOption 4 – As above closure points will be created at Braid Hills Road east of the junction with Braid Hills Avenue. A closure point will also exist at the junction of Braid Farm Road and Braid Hills Road. From here Braid Hills Road / Drive will remain closed until the junction with Liberton Tower Lane.\nPersonally, I feel Options 2-4 are so significant that they should be subject to meaningful consultation with the community around this road. Instead, the report simply says: “A decision needs to be taken internally on the preferred alignment / extent of the scheme”. Once this happens, only “key stakeholders” will be consulted.\nPersonally, I find it unlikely that the emergency services will agree to the closure of Braid Hills Drive.",

It was also agreed to increase how often the bin is emptied from once every three weeks to once every two weeks all year round and to change working patterns for waste crews to four days a week for the kerbside collection services.\nThe new garden waste service will start on 8 October. This will allow:\n- the service to align with the new four-day week working pattern\n- allow us to minimise the number of times we need to contact residents about changes to their services\n- provide sufficient time for\n- residents to register and pay for the service\n- new collection routes to be built and calendars created.\nResidents will be able to sign up for the new service from 18 June – 22 July. The registration period will be supported by an awareness campaign and we will be writing to residents to inform them of the changes and what they need to do as part of the campaign.\nResidents will continue to receive free collections throughout the summer until 5 October.\nThe service expects to meet the proposed budget saving.\nA further briefing will be issued next week and information for residents is available on our website.",

When compared to the last set of plans, there are quite a few changes – not least vehicle access for the Braid Hills Hotel.\nI am grateful for the time that has been invested in producing the latest set of plans. As I stated at the workshop, it is not clear to me that the safest route for the “Quiet Route” has been selected. I also do not feel that I have seen sufficient data to understand why reopening Braid Road southbound was selected in preference to the viable alternatives. Lastly, I feel that there has not been sufficient engagement with local businesses and residents. Nonetheless, I am keen that we see some progress with Braid Road prior to schools returning after the Easter Break so I am happy for the southbound reopening to progress so that the impact on public transport may be tested.\nBriefing\nThanks a lot to those of you who submitted comments regarding the design proposals. These have resulted in further revisions to the designs, notably:\n- Retaining two way operation on Braid Road between Braid Hills Drive and the main entrance to the Braid Hills Hotel\n- Removing the northbound cycleway on Braid Road between Braid Hills Drive and the main entrance to the Braid Hills Hotel – thus retaining parking for residents on this stretch\n- Closing the southbound ‘slip road’ between Braid Road and Hermitage Drive to discourage southbound journeys from Morningside Clock utilising Braid Road\n- This will continue to be monitored following implementation and it is acknowledged that further measures may be required to discourage through traffic on Braid Road between Morningside Clock and Hermitage Drive\n- Including pavement widening at the southeast side of the junction of Braid Road and Hermitage Drive\nThe designs were approved, subject to relevant revisions including those outlined above, by CIMT yesterday. Revised designs and the AFF for this project are attached (designs may still be subject to minor revisions in advance of and during delivery).\nProject delivery is scheduled to commence next Thursday 8th April. Braid Road is expected to open to Southbound traffic via Hermitage Drive the following Friday 16th April, in advance of Schools returning from the Easter Holidays.",

The council say this consultation “will help inform any proposals to keep changes in place more permanently”.\n“In line with our wider ambitions to create a green, healthy and well-connected future for the Capital, we want to make it as easy as possible for people to get from A to B using sustainable, active modes of transport. With these ambitions in mind, we’re asking residents if they’d like to see some of the schemes introduced as part of the Spaces for People programme, or elements of them, retained or removed.”\nCity of Edinburgh Council\nThere are three stands of engagement, each with a separate questionnaire:\n• Stakeholders\n• Businesses\n• General Public\nThe public questionnaire will be accessible through the Council’s consultation hub, as will the questionnaire for businesses. All three questionnaires will be available on request in regular print, large print, braille and translated into other languages.\nConcurrently, there will be a piece of market research undertaken in the city on the same topic, conducted by an independent market research company (I have asked about the cost).\nThe Council will be holding briefings and engaging with various stakeholders directly, including:\n• Representatives from the access panel and equalities groups;\n• Business community;\n• Emergency services;\n• Community Councils;\n• Transport Organisations;\n• Heritage Groups; and,\n• Transport Advocacy Groups.\nThe Council has provided the perspectives below from residents. These views are all valid, but I don’t feel there fully reflect the range of views in Edinburgh on the Spaces for People projects.\nTeresa Holligan said: “I understand the anxiety around an apparent lack of consultation over the Braid Road closure, but given the urgency required during the pandemic I was pleased to see swift action and I am delighted with the closure. I have lived at the ‘top’ end of the Buckstone estate for 32 years and make regular journeys to Morningside and my allotment at Midmar. At the start of the pandemic I stopped using buses and relied on my car, but with the new cycle lanes and the closure of a section of Braid Road I now feel able, for the first time ever, to make these almost daily journeys safely by bike, and am doing so. This is obviously healthier for me, the people around me and our environment. I hope that the Council will find a way to make safe cycling routes from Fairmilehead and Buckstone into the city a permanent feature of our transport network.”\nDave McCraw said: “As a family with young children attending the Lanark Road nursery who also commute on the A70 we seem to be forever on this stretch of road. As it exists today it is extremely hazardous to cross on foot, such that we do not use the bus or at any time allow grandparents to handle the nursery run (unless they were driving door to door). Under the proposed scheme, we would happily allow grandparents to take our children to nursery by bus. We often cycle, especially in the summer months when it is dry. Unfortunately the lack of safe street lighting on the Water of Leith path combined with the horrific mud finds us doing a two mile drive to nursery more often than we’d like. We have considered taking our children to a different nursery because the A70 both makes it extremely difficult to access nursery except by car and detracts from the setting of the nursery in general. With the benefit of a 30mph two lane road with excellent active travel provision, the nursery will find itself in even greater demand. All of this is to say: the changes proposed to the Lanark Road will allow us to keep cycling through the winter instead of driving.”\nColin Fischbacher said: “I usually cycle both for travel and work and I know from speaking to colleagues that the main reason people with bikes are reluctant to cycle more in Edinburgh is concern about the safety of cycling in traffic. That’s particularly true on a road like Lanark Road where as you cycle, cars may be passing close to you at 40mph. I think that better provision of cycle lanes is a vital measure to encourage more cycling. A painted line is nice, but a physical barrier is even better.”\nMike Livesley said: “The recently installed cycle lane and segregation on Duddingston Road has vastly improved the quality of life for my family travelling to and from school before the recent lockdown, and will continue to do so once the restrictions are lifted. We are a family with no car and currently travel from Rosefield Place in Portobello to Duddingston Primary where my eldest son (6 years old, p2) is a student. As we have to travel quite far, cycling has always been a popular option as I can also take my youngest son (2) on the back of my bicycle, however until the installation of the cycle lane, Duddingston Road was always far too dangerous to entertain cycling with my son and was scary enough at the best of times on my own, with always a block of parked cars on both sides of the road by St John’s School and Nursery, with opening car doors an additional hazard. However this was transformed with the new cycle lane and has allowed my son and I to cycle together and to greatly improve his confidence and ability to cycle safely on the roads.”\nBarbara Kerr said: “I live just off the Links and regularly cycle in the area. Before Links Gardens was closed to provide Spaces for People I avoided it a lot. It was really busy with cars, and drivers tended to ignore me at the narrow bits as I was on a bike and they thought they could squeeze through even though I had right of way. Now it is a joy to cycle along that way. It is such a short section, but provides a really important link to the shared use paths on the Links and towards the Water of Leith Cycle way. Before I would be on the road trying to keep up with traffic on East Hermitage place and Duke street, now I use Links Gardens and the shared use path instead.”\nColin McLean, Head Teacher at James Gillespie’s Primary School, said: “The Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route allows students and staff to cycle, walk and wheel more safely to James Gillespie’s Primary School and Nursery. Our school community has worked hard over a number of years to encourage cycling, walking and wheeling which are known to improve life-long health and wellbeing and improve air pollution in our neighbourhood. Whilst we have one of the highest number of students travelling in this way, we know that many families still consider the road network too dangerous for young children to cycle. The new road safety measures are a game changer to reassure families that it is safe. The Quiet Route will allow us to run our bike- and walking-buses in greater safety and will reduce the risk of accidents involving children and vehicles. We hope that these can now run daily rather than weekly or monthly. We hope that the Quiet Route approach can be expanded into a Low Traffic Neighbourhood approach over time and this will allow students and staff from all parts of the city to reach our school safely and using active travel.”\nYou can submit your views here.\nThe Council press release:",

Whilst he probably spent at least some of the Thatcher era in nappies there, I am a little older so I can remember what it was like. Redundancies. De-industrialisation. Mass unemployment. Hope lost.\nIn the space left behind by employment, deprivation and inequality grew. Places in Fife like Methil, Leven and Thornton still carry the scars. Labour Governments in Edinburgh and Westminster undid some of that damage, but that progress is now slowly being eroded.\nMany would argue northern Edinburgh shares the same experience. Where there were jobs we now have “brown field” sites ripe for development. Where there was once a proud workforce, we have pockets of deprivation which would bring shame on any civilised nation. This is part of Thatcher’s legacy.\nIt appears, however, that Councillor Cook wants to turn his back on that community in the same way that he walked away from his Liberton/Gilmerton Ward when he switched to Morningside in May.\nConversely, I want to bury the damage Thatcher did in northern Edinburgh under a tramline. It was the argument that extending the tram would bring economic growth to northern Edinburgh that led to me backing the proposals. As well as bringing investment locally, it will connect its people with our Capital’s key employment hubs: the City Centre, Edinburgh Park and the Airport.\nYes, there are still many unanswered questions and significant uncertainties. I am particularly concerned by the revelation that Transport Scotland are not responding to meeting requests from City Transport Chiefs – an issue I have taken up directly with Humza Yousaf, the SNP minister responsible.\nNonetheless, I am convinced that there is sufficient basis to justify taking the proposal to the next stage. Whilst we do this, the inquiry in to the fiasco surrounding the existing tramline’s construction should run its course so by late 2018 we will be in a position to reach a decision.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_12_16_braid-road-consultation-greenbank-to-meadows-quiet-route/content_204.html": "23-12-2020 Update – My consultation response.\nBelow is my response to the Quiet Route consultation.\nPoint 1\nI don’t know anyone who seriously opposes the quiet route concept. It is clear, however, that many people living along the route have concerns about the detail of the design. It’s disappointing that, in the eight months since lockdown began, more resources have not been made available to engage with residents living along the route. Indeed, there is no doubt that community engagement is important as it leads to improved outcomes on infrastructure projects. It increases acceptance of decisions as local knowledge from diverse groups shapes and creates inclusive, effective solutions.\nPoint 2\nGreater acceptance of the scheme may be possible if the evidence base for it is shared. It’s disappointing that in the eight months since lockdown began this has not happened.\nPoint 3\nThe Fairmilehead area interfaces with two Spaces for People schemes – those on Buckstone/Pentland Terrace and Braid Road. These schemes have struggled to gain widespread public support due to (1) the lack of community engagement, (2) failure to share the evidence base that justifies their existence and (3) the decision to view both of these as separate units. Pre-Covid, the need to better connect Morningside and Fairmilehead for those able to walk and cycle was clear. Rather than responding to the Covid crisis by working with the community to establish one good quality route we could all be proud of, the Council has stretched limited resources between two schemes and lost the trust of local residents. It is notable that many of those who signed the petition calling for the reopening of Braid Road actually live on or near it. Indeed, it is only now that data is being collected to understand how these schemes interoperate.\nWithin this context, I find the decision to view the (1) Quiet Route, (2) Braid Roads and (3) Buckstone/Pentland Terrace schemes separately as difficult to justify to residents in my Ward. If these schemes truly are to form a route for cyclists between Fairmilehead and the Meadows, there they should be viewed as one and residents should be consulted on the formation of a single coherent route which does not impact negatively on public transport or any local school.\nPoint 4\nIn terms of accessibility, many disabled people depend on cars (both to drive and as a passenger) and taxis. Road changes shouldn’t prevent disabled people from being able to stop near their destination. Changes to usual travel patterns can add to anxiety for all of us, but to some disabled people in particular. The scheme should therefore be seen in this context – continual changes should therefore be avoided where possible, and should be effectively communicated to the public (including disabled people).\nPoint 5\nSteps should be taken to remind residents along the route of the hazard parked cars and overgrown hedges (etc) pose to pedestrians and those with buggies/wheelchairs/guide dogs. This is particularly important on the streets surrounding the schools.\n20-12-2020 Update\nI have received a message from the Council saying that “For clarification, the Greenbank to Meadows measures do not include the closure of Braid Road, this is a separate scheme…”. This is despite the Braid Road closure being highlighted on the Quiet Route map (above) and the Council report on the Quiet Route saying:\nThe Spaces for People review of the measures on Braid Road recommends retaining its closure. This assessment has considered the scheme relationship with both Comiston Road and with the proposals for the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Connection… and later… The current recommendation is to continue with the closure of Braid Road and monitoring of traffic flows on Comiston Road (currently average +11%).\nSpaces for People Team, November 2020\nI asked if the Quiet Route could proceed without the closure of Braid Road and was told: “The opening of Braid Road would have significant issues but these could be addressed if required. So yes, the QR could proceed.”\nI asked why Braid Road was currently closed and was told:\n1. to improve distancing opportunities and road safety at popular exercise spots. to provide spacious alternatives\nSpaces for People Team on why Braid Road was closed.\n2. to paths and routes that are busy with pedestrians and cyclists to safely link together off-road walking and cycling routes\n3. to provide spaces for exercising that are safe from traffic.\n16-12-2020 Post\nLast week I reported that I had discovered that the Council had been running a consultation on the Braid Road closure but did not notify me or people in my Ward. This was because, technically, the closure is outside my Ward! Morningside Ward Councillors had been notified, and I only found out about it when one (Cllr Main) tweeted about it (see screenshot it the foot of this blog). The consultation closed last Tuesday, but I have asked for more time so people in my Ward can learn more about how the closure fits into the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route. The Council have agreed that the consultation will reopen for people in my Ward up until 1700hrs on Wednesday 23rd December 2020 via spacesforpeople@edinburgh.gov.uk. Feel free to copy me into your response, and I will draft a combined submission.\nThe consultation text is below, and a map of the scheme is above.\nPersonally, I don’t think the case for using Covid Powers to close Braid Road has been made and that the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route can succeed without it. Whilst James Gillespie’s Primary School will certainly benefit from the quiet route, closing Braid Road simply forces more traffic past South Morningside Primary School.\nProposed Temporary Cycle Segregation – Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route\nPlease be advised that as part of overall emergency measures we are proposing to implement improvements to help pedestrians and cyclists travel safely while meeting physical distancing requirements.\nThis scheme proposes to create a safe cycling route between the south of the city and the city centre, as well as providing a safe way to walk and cycle to school for several primary schools and one high school. It also improves options for safe cycling to Astley Ainslie Hospital. To achieve this, modal filters (where the street is closed to vehicular traffic) are proposed at the following locations:\n- Canaan Lane north of the Astley Ainslie hospital access;\n- Whitehouse Loan immediately south of the junction with Strathearn Road;\n- Whitehouse Loan immediately south of the junction with Bruntsfield Crescent; and\n- Whitehouse Loan immediately north of the junction with Warrender Park Road.\nAll feedback will be reviewed and where possible the scheme will be further refined. Feedback will be summarised in an assessment feedback form which will be presented to the Council Incident Management Team for approval. Please note that we will be unable to respond to individual emails.\nIf the proposal is approved for implementation, publicity will then be undertaken so that local people are aware of the changes. A dedicated inbox will help us to manage any feedback around proposals – spacesforpeople@edinburgh.gov.uk\nThe introduction of, or changes to, any restrictions will be implemented under emergency delegated decision-making powers using a Temporary Traffic Regulation Order.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_06_09_west-edinburgh-bus-priority-briefing/content_170.html": "Below is a briefing from Council Officers which sets out the rational for removing the temporary bus lane on the A8.\nIntroduction\nThis briefing note provides context and background information on the temporary westbound bus lane installed on the A8 as part of the interventions for recovery during the pandemic.\nThere are three key projects in West Edinburgh that are relevant to A8. These are;\n- West Edinburgh Transport Improvement Programme (WETIP); This is a £36m Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal (ESESCRD) project focused on the delivering an ambitious package of sustainable transport measures along the A8 corridor. These include active travel and public transport measures.\n- Bus Partnership Fund (BPF); This is an ESESCRD project to deliver an ambitious package of Bus Priority measures along key routes across the South-East Scotland region, including the A8. The BPF is split into the following two elements: 1) implementation of Quick Wins measures 2) Development of business cases for longer term Bus Priority interventions.\n- Bus Priority Rapid Deployment Fund (BPRDF); This is a Scottish Government fund in response to the pandemic, where local authorities were asked to identify areas where temporary bus priority measures could be implemented swiftly to improve bus journey times and make services more reliable to provide much needed support to operators during the pandemic.\nBackground\nThe Council with partners (including West Lothian Council & Transport Scotland), have been developing a series of bus priority improvements along the A8/A89 corridor since 2008, where several strategic transport studies have been undertaken, these include: WETA 2010, A8/A89 Public Transport Corridor Improvements Study and WETA Refresh in 2016 (which was developed in collaboration with the Airport and Transport Scotland).\nThe signing of the City Region Deal in 2018 was a major milestone and consequently provided £36m to the West Edinburgh Transport Improvement Programme – WETIP. This project focuses on the delivery of an ambitious package of sustainable transport measures (active travel and public transport) along the A8/A89 corridor between Maybury and Broxburn.\nWETIP is currently in the Outline Business Case Stage (OBC), with the aim to complete by Q1 of 2023. This will confirm the package of the permanent bus lanes along the A8 corridor.\nFollowing production of the WETIP OBC, the Final Business Case, Permissions & Consents and Procurement activities will be delivered, with construction starting Q1 2025. Post construction activities include: Commissioning, Monitoring, Evaluation and Benefits Realisation. Also being considered are opportunities to accelerate the delivery of certain measures (eg any BPF Quick Wins that can be delivered before 2025, such as the bus lane on the A89).\nThe WETIP project team have worked closely with neighbouring projects and plans, including: live planning applications, the Maybury junction improvement scheme, integration with the ongoing the West Edinburgh Masterplanning exercises and the development of the draft Edinburgh City Plan 2030; all this work has ensured that WETIP plays it part in enhancing connectivity, reducing severance and linking West Edinburgh into the fabric of the wider city.\nThrough the BPRDF, local authorities were asked to identify areas where temporary bus priority measures could be implemented to improve bus journey times and make services more reliable during various tiers of pandemic restriction.\nA key aim of the fund was to swiftly target parts of the road network and implement bus priority measures to provide much needed support to operators.\nThe Council, by drawing on previous transport studies and working collaboratively with stakeholders, including bus operators, identified several locations on key routes across the city, including the A8, where interventions would be appropriate and beneficial to bus operations.\nAs a result of these measures, bus operators have reported journey time savings. Passengers spend less time in the confined space onboard buses and, therefore, reduce their length of potential Covid-19 exposure with other passengers. The journey time and associated reliability improvements have also made public transport an attractive alternative to private car and aided patronage recovery.\nThe diagram below highlights the locations of bus lanes installed through the BPRDF.\nThe BPRDF has provided an opportunity to test bus priority measures, collect live data and deliver early benefits to bus operators (during the pandemic). This exercise also informed the successful bid into the Bus Partnership Fund, resulting in a further c£3m of funds being awarded to the City Region Deal.\nOf the £3m funding awarded from the BPF, £1.4m is currently being used to explore whether any of the BPRDF measures installed for pandemic purposes could be permanently retained; where they are appropriate and can continue to provide benefits to public transport in the evolving environment of permanent travel patterns and behaviour changes.\nThe figure above highlights that there are 12 locations where bus lanes have been implemented through the BPRDF. Of these, nine are being further evaluated through the BPF Quick Wins programme to explore their possible retention.\nThe three other locations that are not being taken forward for retention in their current form through the BPF and are instead being absorbed into more relevant programmes (eg the A8 westbound bus lane from Eastfield Road to Newbridge will be deliver through the larger WETIP which targets more ambitious benefits for Public Transport). Note; data collected from the BPRDF measures has helped advance thinking on WETIP and other programmes on how the permanent measures will operate.\nThe WETIP westbound bus priority proposals will be a much more significant construction project compared to the temporary bus lane implemented with BPRDF funding. It includes the delivery of a permanent bus lane, with potential to use carriageway verge if required by network considerations.\nAs highlighted in the figure, nine other BPRDF locations (which include; the eastbound, sections of bus lanes on the A89 approach to Newbridge & A8 Gogar Underpass) which continued to be monitored and are performing well and still benefit bus, are being further reviewed to explore their possible retention through the BPF.\nThe Council has been monitoring the performance of the BPRDF bus measures and impacts on the traffic network and has worked closely with key stakeholders, including the Airport, and will continue to do so.\nRecently we have witnessed a return to more traditional peak period commuting travel patterns. This has resulted in much increased congestion heading westbound along the A8, particularly during the evening peak travel period. The effect of this congestion creates wider spread network traffic issues and also hinders bus journeys along the A8, i.e. the queuing traffic prevents the bus from accessing the bus lane.\nWith the Royal Highland Show (RHS) approaching, traffic volumes on the A8 will continue to increase. Therefore, as predicted through the modelling work carried out by transport consultants, this bus lane has reached the point where it has become counter-productive.\nNow that traffic levels are increasingly returning to more traditional patterns, and in advance of the RHS, the process of organising the removal of the bus lane has commenced.\nAs it was always the intention to remove the bus lane, the signage to support the removal of the lane has already been manufactured.\nFor traffic management reasons the works are expected to be carried out this Sunday (12 June).\nNext Steps\n- Removal of the bus lane is planned for Sunday 12 June.\n- Continue to work with Bus Operators on the retention of measures where appropriate through the BPF.\n- In parallel, continue to work with all other key stakeholders, such as the airport, on the development of the WETIP measures, which will include the exploration of the accelerated delivery of bus priority interventions where possible.\n- Brief the relevant elected members of the project delivery plans for both WETIP and BPF and provide the latest progress updates.\n- Both WETIP and BPF projects will include the development of a full Communications Plan to ensure that all key stakeholders, businesses, and residents are kept informed. A draft of this will be presented to the relevant elected members.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_01_06_city-of-edinburgh-council-winter-weather-operations/content_377.html": "Below is a briefing from Council Officers on snow and ice removal in Edinburgh.\nOperational planning for adverse weather\nThe gritting of Edinburgh’s roads, footpaths and cycleways are undertaken on a priority basis – Priority 1 to 3.\nIn severe weather conditions, as we have recently experienced, our priority is to maintain the Priority 1 network to keep public transport, goods vehicles and emergency services moving. Thereafter Priority 2 and 3 routes are treated as resources and conditions allow. [Scott Arthur – The “priority” appears to be roads rather than footpaths or cyclepaths]\nCurrent Situation\nThe weather conditions during January have been very challenging, in particular with ice and freezing rain on top of snow conditions coming from the north-east. Freezing rain is a rare occurrence and is difficult to predict. It is very challenging to treat as the ice forms very quickly after the rain and the rain can also wash off the previous precautionary treatments.\nSince 1 January, the Roads Operation team, and colleagues from other services from Place Management, have worked relentlessly to keep on top of the Priority 1 network in the first instance.\nThey have put down around 1,250 tonnes of grit since then. By comparison in the full year of 2016/17, only 2,600 tonnes were required for the full six-month winter period. [Scott Arthur – Why just compare to 2016/17?]\nIt takes three to four hours for the team to cover the entire Priority 1 network following such weather. As soon as the Priority 1 network is clear and running, the teams moved on to both the Priority 2 and 3 networks as resources allow.\nTreatment of the Priority 3 network was hampered by a combination of ice on top of packed snow and lower levels of vehicle movements to work in the grit and activate the rock salt. Often residents have been concerned that their estate had not been gritted when in fact it had been treated multiple times, but the grit had taken time to work though the compact snow/ice.\nThrough January:\n- all Priority 2 road routes were treated on three out of the five days\n- on three of these days gritters were dispatched to many of the Priority 3 routes in the higher ground areas (predominantly in the south-west).\n- in several instances, gritters were deployed to locations more than once in the same day as the team worked against the freezing ice.\nFootpaths and cycleways\nFootpath and cycleway tractors have been out alongside the roads gritters round the clock. They have treated several areas twice for increased effectiveness. Footpath and cycle lanes are harder to treat in these conditions as the rock salt is not activated by vehicles in the same way as it is on roads. This is further exacerbated by the freezing ice on top of the snow. Many of the issues raised by councillors have reflected these kinds of circumstances.\nThe teams then moved to treating local footpath areas and respond to customer reports as best as resources allow. Unfortunately, it is simply impossible to treat all the network daily as there is insufficient resource to do so. This is not unique to Edinburgh and is all local authorities have a prioritisation of roads and footpaths.\nColleagues from Street Cleansing, and Parks and Greenspaces also worked on bank holiday Monday (4 January) to treat key shopfronts, care homes and as many parks areas as possible. Colleagues from these teams also continue to help in replenishing grit bins.\nSpaces for People segregated cycleways\nTreatment of the segregated cycleways for Spaces for People (SfP) has also been undertaken where possible after the Priority 1 network. We secured three additional tractors to help with this work (funded by the SfP external funding allocation). These routes were also affected by the harder to treat freezing ice. [Scott Arthur – In total Edinburgh has 16 pavement tractors. It had 21 in 2013.]\nImpact of lockdown and shielding requirements\nStaff shielding requirements as a result of recent changes in COVID guidance have resulted in additional pressure on resources. We will of course do everything we can to maintain the service. We have re-advertised for colleagues to sign up to the winter weather rota to mitigate any risk of a significant loss of workforce over the rest of the winter period.\nOvernight forecast 6-7 January\nThe risk of snow and ice forming is forecast again tonight by the MET Office and the gritting team is on standby throughout the night to react. However, we would advise everyone to take care moving around the city in the morning as there is a risk that surfaces of the Priority 1 network will be hazardous.\nThe teams will move on to the Priority 2 and 3 networks as required in the morning (7 January) as quickly as possible and as resources allow.\nGrit Bins\nThere are just under 3000 grit bins across Edinburgh and it takes considerable resource to replenish them following a sudden drop of snow or ice. Replenishment of the grit bins commenced over the weekend and is ongoing. We now have ten teams working on the replenishment of grit bins in priority order and they will continue to do so until they are all visited. This is in addition to those staff that are actively involved in undertaking gritting duties.\nWe have received several requests to site new grit bins from across the city. These will be reviewed and actioned, where appropriate, as quickly as we can. Officers need to review the suitability of locations and proximity to other grit bins and routes before decisions are made.\nYou can find information on the locations of existing grit bins as well as request a new bin on our website.\nOnline information and contact details\n- Report areas that require treatment following adverse weather, email Winterweather.enquiries@edinburgh.gov.uk (please note we do try our best to attend as many of these as we can).\n- Report a grit bin issue (including request a new one)\n- General gritting information\n- Gritting prioritisation information",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2024_05_19_7060_comment-page-1/content_76.html": "In 2023 Lothian Buses’ passenger numbers grew by 17%. This is incredible, and comes after a huge (and ongoing) effort to recruit more drivers. I’d love it if this continued, and we entered an era of exponential growth in public transport use in Edinburgh. It would certainly help us cut congestion, hit net zero, and accommodate the up to 37,000 homes that could be built in Edinburgh in the coming years.\nThe reality is, however, that the growth in bus use last year was mostly people returning to public transport after the pandemic. Weekends are busier than ever, but weekday bus travel is still being impacted by some people continuing to work from home.\nIndeed, we know that to grow bus patronage we need to make using services more attractive. This is not just about having a modern bus fleet, we need to have the right routes and ensure buses can move quickly through our city.\nThis is why I was disappointed that the Scottish Government “paused” funding bus priority schemes which would have allow buses to cut through congestion.\nRight now buses are too often held up in congestion, and those who are able to afford a car end up driving because it is faster. Of course, in a true Catch-22, those people end up making congestion worse. People living in every from Balerno to Fairmilehead will be familiar with this situation.\nThis situation is why the Council intends to trial “7-7-7 Bus Lanes” before the end of the year along the 44 route (between Balerno and Musselburgh). The aim being to improve bus journey times and reliability by moving the existing bus lanes to 7am to 7pm operation 7 days per week. This should benefit bus passengers along the route (inc those in my Ward).\nIf this works, it will be rolled out city-wide – and perhaps we really will enter an era of exponential growth in public transport use in Edinburgh.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_04_28_initial-poll-results-changes-to-10-19-bus-service/content_181.html": "Update (21-05-22) – Linked here are notes from a meeting myself and David Houston (Colinton Community Council) held with Lothian Buses. I am not happy with the outcome, but I now have a better idea if of what is driving matters.\nUpdate (18-05-22) – 366 people have now responded to my survey, with just 12.9% supporting the change, 20.7% requesting further consultation and 66.d% saying they prefer the status quo.\nUpdate (30-04-22) – 323 people have now responded, with just 12.7% supporting the change, 20.4% requesting further consultation and 66.9% saying they prefer the status quo.\nInterim Results\nLothian Buses have announced changes to the 10 & 16 bus services used by many in Colinton. The key changes with be that:\n- The 10 will serve Bonaly via Colinton; and,\n- The 16 will serve Torphin via Colinton.\nDetails are here.\nThe increased service to Bonaly is to be welcomed, but it appears that some in west Colinton will pay the price for this via:\n- A slightly slower service in to town.\n- More difficult journeys to Tesco & Allermuir Health Centre.\n- Losing the bus service to Firrhill High School, Meggetland, GWC, and Edinburgh Leisure’s Craiglockhart Leisure Centre & Tennis Centre.\nThe official response to these concerns I received from Lothian Buses on this was:\nThe network alteration is intended to improve the overall service provision for both Torphin and Bonaly. The current weekday daytime frequency is 2 buses each hour to Torphin and one bus per hour to Bonaly. From the change this will increase to 5 and 3 respectively. School children and elderly customers are entitled to free travel through the Scottish National Entitlement scheme and can change buses in Colinton at no additional cost. We appreciate that journey time is a factor in many peoples decision to use public transport, however service frequency is also a massive consideration and we believe that the significant increases in frequency will be a benefit to both areas.\nLothian Buses, 27-04-22\nI found these comments to be disappointing, “free” travel should not be second rate travel! I know there are a range of views locally, so I set up a poll to better understand local opinion on this issue.\nAfter just 24 hours, I have received 237 responses with just 12.2% supporting the change, 20.3% requesting further consultation and 67.5% saying they prefer the status quo.\nWhen I read the comments from residents (listed below), however, it is clear that opinion is less divided that these statistics suggest. I could see that the consensus is:\n- The bus service should be a viable alternative to using the car.\n- The current service, and the changes proposed by Lothian Buses, don’t meet the needs of the local community.\n- Residents would welcome an opportunity to provide feedback to Lothian Buses.\nSeparately, Colinton Community Council have contacted me raising concerns about what Lothian Buses are proposing. Based on this, emails I have received, and my poll results I have therefore taken the unusual step of contacting a member of Lothian Buses’ board to request that a representative attends the Colinton Community Council meeting scheduled for the 10th of May. A publicly owned bus service should be publicly accountable.\nIf you have not done so already, it is not too late to complete my poll.\nCllr Scott Arthur\nComments from those seeking consultation on the changes.\n- If the council want us to be more environmentally conscious when travelling in the city, they should invest more in public transport to benefit all residents, not just those who live near the tramlines.\n- The current route is better than the proposed route for reasons outlined in your post, but understandable that the bus company might need to make changes for economic reasons. A consultation would be a good middle ground to find out what the customers need. “\n- I think the 10 should cover both Torphin and Bonaly as one bus route and the 16 should remain as is.\n- Prior to lockdown I used the 10 Torphin daily to get into town or to Haymarket station via 10&4. But I also use the shops at Oxgangs Broadway & Morningside a lot so connect onto the 16. I now have to walk back most of the time from Westgarth on my return as the 10 timetable is reduced plus delayed by tram and road works so usually have to wait ages for a connection. So an alternating 10 and 16 with good frequency would be great. A major consideration I think is to ensure we keep a bus going up to Tipereth to allow service users access to independent travel and for the staff, many of whom I think are gap students on low income so not likely to have their own car. Also, don’t forget Braidburn pupils. In their senior years some undertake independent travel training so would rely on a 10 to get to or from school.\n- The reduction in frequency in the 10 since lockdown is an issue now that office working is back in place for many. Access to the local services is a must, and the ‘slightly longer’ journey on the 16 is considerable when getting to work in the morning, with adjustments to childcare now a concern that many will have to consider.\n- Our children travel to school on this service and will now find it harder to travel safely and increase the time to get to school. Hugely disappointing!\n- I like the frequency of the 16 servicing Torphin and it makes sense to extend this service. But we also need the bus to go to Firhill and Watsons for school children. Some people living here may also have bought their house because they could use the bus to get to work thus reducing car use. So we also need the 10 to Torphin. If we HAD to choose I would keep the 10 as it is but would prefer a blended approach.\n- I would like to know whether the no16 route is going to change beyond the extension to Torphin or continues it’s current route? Everyone is assuming the existing route.\n- Could the Bonaly and Torphin service be amalgamated. Up Woodhall Road, terminate at Torphin and return to the village via Bonaly ?\n- It is not about the “free” bustravel it’s about children having to now get two buses to school-the stop at Rustic cottages is busy as it is in the morning, has anyone from Lothian buses travelled the route at 8am when it’s full of school children? Has anyone from Lothian buses travelled the 16 route lately to understand the complaints about the ridiculous long journey time?\n- Streamline the 10 service to service torphin too\n- I would urge some peak time 10 torphin buses to accommodate school children travelling to Firrhill high school and commuters\n- Proposed changes to the 10 service are dreadful for city workers and school children.\n- “Surely the consideration of people in West Colinton’s needs should come into the equation not just service freqyency. There is no indication that the 16 and 10 services are going to synch and therefore there may be a considerable wait or repeated delays to get buses and connect to 10 if wanting to travel to town Craiglockhart GWC etc rather than use the slower route for the 16. Its the lack of consultation the impact on those with mobility issues or other difficulties and the older age group and impact on ability to shop or get to important venues that annoys the most.Its been a difficult time for many with the pandemic and if changes are brought in leading to further difficulties getting about when things are just starting to feel more normal and relaxed about using buses this could & probably will lead to furer isolation and social exclusion”\n- If the connection between the new 10 and 16 services are well coordinated then i have no issue\n- It is frustrating that there is a low frequency of buses, but the 16 route is very different to the 10 route. I realise it is being pointed out that people can either change buses or walk from Woodfield Avenue to Colinton village. These options all have issues, including additional cost, longer journey time, and a long walk along Woodhall Road alone in the dark will be considered a safety risk for vulnerable people. All these issues make it more likely that people will continue to choose cars as transport over buses.\n- Why not increase the number of buses?\n- Living in Bonaly I can sympathise with West Colinton residents at the proposed loss of No 10. Equally, I find current No 10 service to Bonaly quite restrictive.\n- The number 10 to Torphin is a much appreciated service and we’d be really upset to lose it. Taking the 16, or attempting to co-ordinate a change of buses, would significantly lengthen the journey into town. Surely it could be possible to plan a 10 route so that the same bus could serve both Bonaly and Torphin? It would make the journey slightly longer but would be much more convenient than travelling via Oxgangs/Braids/Morningside!\n- The removal of the number 10 will make travel into town longer via morningside (a congested route already) and will probably lead to more just using the car. The face that there has been no consultation is also very poor, likewise the fact that there is talk of proposed changes to the 16 route.\n- “Whilst i understand the need to improve services this does not feel like an improvement for the residents who use the Torphon service. Would it not make more sense to edit/combine the Torphin and Bonaly to one route as we had previously? This means that both areas benefit from an increased number of services whilst still allowing the residents to benefit from a 20 minute link to town instead of the almost 1 hour it takes on the 16.\n- I dont qualify for free travel and already have to take 2 buses to and from work. These changes would mean i needed to add another journey thus increasing my costs as well as the travel time by a a minimum of 30 mins each way as you can bet that the schedules wont match up nicely. As a key worker who has worked in healthcare throughout the pandemic the thought of adding extra time onto my already long shifts is disheartening and ultimately would presenta verydifficult decision to leave my current role or move away from Colinton.\n- For many the 15/20 minute walk to the villiage is not a hardship however on dark, wet and winter nights that has a severe impact on my feeling of safety in my local area.\n- The extension of the night bus when it began to include Torphin is invaluable so i fully respect the need for change. This simply is not the right change.\n- A final point is that a single decker 45 service cannot possibly manage the volume of pupils who rely on the no 10 to take them to school (gwc and heriots) and the bus stop at rustic cottages is dangerous at the best of time and causes massive traffic issues as it is let alone when you add multiple extra passengers. Pedestrians struggle to get past queues safely end frequently end up using the road to pass.\n- Thank you for taking the time to look into this.\n- A consultation would be best so that there is a debate on the pros and cons of services to Torphin with an outcome being a better understanding for all parties\n- Please clarify the new 16 route – imp to make a decision. Current route would add significantly to travell time\n- Can’t get to firrhill from Torphin as 16 takes you down towards Redford\n- I am not supportive of a more regular bus going down Woodhall Road which is a narrow road and has a narrow pavement (one side only at many points). This will be dangerous for young families. In addition, I do no support a change which means children will have to change bus to get to the local high school. I do not believe this is practical or in line with the council’s ‘safe routes to school’ obligation. It is impractical to take a number 16 into town as the journey time is much longer.\n- It would matter less if Lothian Buses changed the pricing structure to accommodate that bus changes are required as a result of route changes. Not everyone gets free bus travel so whilst we all need to be flexible about changing buses to make a journey not served by a direct route, we should not be penalised financially for doing so. In London the travel system accommodates changes required but here you are penalised if your single journey for a day turns into two buses being taken, never mind the wait times to connect.\n- At least some torphin 10s should be retained, especially during rushour when the 16 will be far too slow.\nComments from those in favour of the status quo\n- Definitely makes it more difficult for our kids to get the bus directly to school.\n- My son uses Craiglockhart gym regularly and will now need to get 2 buses there.\n- Longer travel time to get to work.\n- Feel that Lothian buses have made no attempt to consult with local residents.\n- Have bus times been coordinated if we choose to get a 16 into the village then transfer to the 10 then?\n- Cost implications!\n- I have a teenage daughter that uses the 10 everyday from the west mill stop to get to school – this ‘straight past firrhill’ service is cut out with the proposed change\n- The proposed changes will increase our commute to work in town. It will also impact our daughter when she moves to high school.\n- The detour through Morningside on the number 16 is a step back. Has anyone thought of the school children?\n- If the service has to be changed could we at least keep a more direct route into town at peak times. As the crow flies the 16 route isn’t much longer but the trawl through Morningside traffic takes much longer and doesn’t allow for quick transport to Napier, Craiglockhart, Meggetland and Polwarth.\n- The present service works well. What is being proposed might increase the frequency but if it doesn’t serve what customers need it is totally pointless!\n- Kids use no 10 to get to school, they can’t use a no 16\n- The 16 is too long and indirect to be considered a realistic option for those who live in colinton and get the bus to work. Also not ideal for school children – yes they can get too buses but the the waiting time in between makes this very inconvenient\n- This change means we have no direct access to our local high school, our commute to work will be 20+ minutes longer (both based in centre of town) and I see no benefits to the new system\n- If it ain’t broke don’t fix it!\n- Mental\n- These proposed changes show little understanding of the needs of the community. Frequency of service has never been an issue for those in West Colinton – easier public transport to schools, GP services, supermarkets etc. is far more important. The proposed changes significantly impact on these, particularly for younger families and older people. These changes would make most journeys less convenient and are likely to discourage use of public transport, therefore (cynically) allowing LRT to argue for reduced services in future. The lack of any consultation over the changes is particularly galling – LRT should be responsible to the community that pays for them.\n- The current service provides a direct and efficient route for commuters into the city centre, direct access to local secondary schools, sports facilities and supermarkets. The proposed changes are not an appropriate alternative. What evidence has been used to support these changes and what consultation and impact assessment has been undertaken with passengers or disability groups. I thought the policy was to improve bus services not make them worse. This will inevitably force people back into their private cars snd cause parking issues elsewhere in the network. Very very frustrated.\n- We live at torphin terminal. This will leave the kids with no easy bus route to school at firrhill nor all their after school activities at meggetland or craiglockhart Edinburgh leisure – their two lnearest sports facilities. We will almost certainly use the car more as a result. If change must be made then the number 10 should be re routed and cover both bonaly and torphin. There is not enough space on the number 10 home from school as it is without reducing services. It’s not so bad in the summer but we have long cold dark winters and this is a real negative step . It also defeats the purpose of their new free bus pass !!\n- Totally agree with all of the points made by the Councillor above. I would like to add that it would also affect those travelling to Colinton Medical Practice, St Thomas Aquinas , Heriots and other schools, places of work and destinations in the city .\n- It’s not going to work for me having to get the 16 into town. I work in the west end and have to get my children to child care beforehand. I will now need to drive and park at Craiglockhart as I won’t have enough time to walk into the village. The number 16 takes too long and I won’t get to work on time. Why change something that works perfectly? What about the children who need to get to Firrhill/Watsons when it’s raining and they live up Torphin bank/Campbell park? What about the elderly who use the bus for tesco and the doctors?\n- Please keep it as it is\n- This change would have a huge impact on access to schools and local amenities for the most vulnerable people in this community – children getting to school, older people, and those with mobility issues. This change would create more cars on the road. It is also a much, much longer route via Morningside into town, not slightly longer – the traffic on Morningside Road can be incredibly busy and no one commuting into town would choose the number 16 route. The current number 10 is also the best bus route to serve staff, patients and visitors to the Royal Edinburgh Hospital.\n- Either remain as it is or run no10 via Torphin and Bonaly. No access with proposed service to Craiglockhart or Meggatland,\n- I need a direct service to get to GWC\n- “I have 2 sons at Firrhill, one of whom is diagnosed with juvenile arthritis and one who is waiting a possible diagnosis. Both are fit and independent boy, however they have periods of time when they have difficulty walking. The no 10 is essential for them for independence and ease of access to school. Changing buses would be hard when you’re finding it difficult to walk.\n- The No10 provides an essential direction connection to the city centre and is much used and loved in this community. “\n- I travel to GWC for work. This new service means I would have a considerable walk at each end of my journey which I find completely unacceptable. The time involved is grossly unfair for work travel. The idea of getting two buses for such a short journey is ridiculous.\n- Would prefer the current service to continue but would also be happy with consultation over any proposed changes.\n- Will make the bus less appealing both for my kids travelling in to Heriot’s and my husband commuting into Central Edinburgh for work. Disappointed. Grateful if pressure can be applied on our behalf.\n- Increased frequency only helps if it makes journeys more convenient, the proposed changes have the opposite impact.\n- “We will use car and van transport much more.\n- This change will make the trips to school and sports activities more dangerous. “\n- I travel from Woodfield Avenue to Polwarth. I will now be unable to make this journey, and my kids will be unable to take the bus to Firrhill high school. It wouldn’t be so bad if we could board the Bonaly bus at Grant Avenue, however if I were to do this I’d be told to get off the bus at Bonaly store as well as paying 2 bus fares. This change is not helpful at all. Not everyone is travelling into the city.\n- “I work in Leith Street. The length of journey on the number 16 bus route is ridiculous. I do not qualify for a free bus pass and should not have to take 2 buses to get into town nor pay for 2 extra buses per day. It can already take nearly an hour to get to Leith Street on a 10, any longer is just unacceptable.\n- My son is at school at Firhill HS. No direct bus route to his school is again ridiculous. There’s absolutely no need to change the No 10 Torphin. Lothian Buses have not given any thought to how this change will affect so many people trying to get to work and school “\n- “It is very disappointing that a perfectly good bus service is being changed without any consultation with the local residents.\n- I have lived in Colinton for over 20 years and my children used the 10 bus service to reach their school at Tollcross. Local children going to the same school will now have to walk to Bonaly Avenue to catch this bus. I personally took the 10 bus through Bonaly this morning at 8.45am. It was horrendous due to the bus, moving cars, pedestrians and parked cars, especially coming down Dreghorn Loan. Basically it just all comes to a stop. Whereas the bus has much better, safer and quicker route coming down from Torphin along Woodhall Road.\n- Has anyone actually examined the Number 10 driving round Bonaly at rush hours? “\n- Definitely think it would be much worse if no number 10 coming to colinton as that is how our family travel to work and school just now and this would cause major disruption and delay on getting to our destination taking the 16.\n- I use the number 10 to get to work (GWC) and my daughter’s nursery. The extra time to swap buses or walk to a further bus stop will be a big impact on our day to and from work/nursery.\n- Cutting off part of a community. Will have to take the car to get my two children to nursery now in Craiglockhart. It is not free for me or feasible with working in town (to then get on THREE buses to work then THREE home) to take two children on two buses in the morning to nursery when there is a 10 bus stop outside my door that services is perfectly fine.\n- No doubt Lothian Bus Co will disregard customer comments\n- These changes remove frequency of provision to areas people actually need to go to. A service 16 from Torphin is a service of no use to man nor beast and actually makes the provision of a service much worse than we currently have.\n- Removal of the 10 to Torphin means a direct route to town would require 2 buses, and therefore increased cost, or else walking all the way to the stop at the doctors surgery. The 16 is a circuitous route that takes much longer and is not desirable as an alternative\n- My child gets the bus to and from Oxgangs Primary school every day from Woodfield Avenue and changes will result in a lot more added stress and worry for us as he will have to walk to Bonaly on his own or change buses.\n- The proposed change would make it hard for my son to get to Firrhill High and for me to get into town for work. Getting two buses or walking twenty minutes to Bonaly is not ideal especially in the winter.\n- Why would you create a bigger problem with traffic in our city as with these new change’s,more people will drive . This city is already behind our counterparts with its transport system, we are a joke\n- I’m so disappointed with the proposed change it will have a massive impact on me and probably result in me having to drive to work rather than get public transport.\n- 16 is a very long route and won’t help firhill\n- I am very happy with both the frequency of the number 10 torphin bus, and the route – it is the quickest route to city west end that i use for work. I have no need at all to catch a 16 bus to morningside – it takes so long, and does not pass any places i use the bus to go to. I catch the bus to work, but i am part time and is not cost effective to get a bus pass. I am a busy working mother and i only just have time to run for the 10 torphin bus at woodfield ave stop in the mornings as it is – i literally could not get to work on time if i had to walk 20mins to westgarth ave stop, or faff about catching a 16 and waiting for the timetable to match and changing for a 10 (its ludicrous!). I am actually really worried what i am going to do, as my office are now asking all staff to come into the office, but i just cant squeeze that in around school hours and journey times if this goes ahead. As for an increased frequency along woodhall road, i dont want it, the paths are very narrow and the busses go too fast – it just increases dangers for primary children walking to bonaly primary and back (which are already a local concern). The 16 bus will be empty on the extended torphin section – i dont know of anyone who would use it (not regularly, like for work/school, which are the main journeys the number 10 is used for daily). It makes no sense at all! If lothian busses want to ‘streamline’ their services i can not understand at all why the 10 service can not simply go around bonaly, then up to torphin, turn around and go back around bonaly! – it would not miss any stops, and in my opinion it makes much more sense for the bus to wait, change drivers etc up at torphin, where there is a big turn around (it is much better than the current place the 10 bonaly bus waits outside the bonaly corner shop totally in the way of cars in a busy area by the primary school). The number 10 bus is the bus that serves colintons amenities, it goes past colinton dr surgery, allurmuir health centre, firhill and george watsons schools, both napier university campuses, sports facilities at craiglockhart tennis club, thistle tennis club, meggetland, the local supermarket at tescos, the parish churches, the scout hall…. all the places local residents want/need to go to. The 16, well that just goes around the houses over morningside via redford and just is not a useful route at all. I never catch the 16 from princes street, it takes double the journey time to colinton, over an hour – even as a night bus, its just so long, i rarely use it. I hope this decision is reversed, it makes NO SENSE. There is no neccesity to have more frequent buses up at torphin, it will be empty, 5 buses an hour to morningside! – what is the justification by passanger numbers for that!, but taking away the 10 torphin service, a really useful well used local service that serves the local community/amenities/area is the opposite of what the council say they want people to do (which is make more people choose local journeys on public transport!!!!!). I am very unhappy. I will add that there is a huge disbelief about this decision in my local street whatsapp group (woodfield avenue) – the woodfield avenue number 10 torphin bus stop is always busy at commuter times (every day at least 15 wait at that stop).\n- There is absolutely no need to make changes to either service.\n- This proposed change will cause our household to drive more to save time & get where we need without time delays\n- This change is a massive detriment to the residents of Colinton/Woodfield. The children cannot get direct bus to school, many people will have huge changes to their work commute. The no 16 coming up to Torphin does not add anything to the service. The current number 10 is an extremely popular service that many residents rely on\n- I believe the school kids should have access to get to school or the local fitness centre without having to get two buses. Elderly people struggle a lot to get one bus without added confusion to doctor surgeries or Tesco. I would think of moving from this part of Colinton if it does not change.\n- This proposed change is very disappointing and would make the bus service much less useful to me and my family (I live on Torphin Road). The 16 route doesn’t go to the places we frequently visit and the significant added journey time would encourage me to drive rather than take the bus – which is really not what we should be aiming for either from a congestion or environmental point of view.\n- the 10 is a far more direct route and with kids at high school this is the best option when they don’t walk. I don’t have an issue with the 16 going to Torphin as this would improve access to morningside etc but in addition to the 10 not instead of. Saying the school kids can swap bus in the village is ridiculous as they would have to wait twice as it is unlikely that the busses will align time wise.\n- The proposed changes will have a seriously detrimental effect on my ability to continue with normal activities including staying healthy through use of the gym.\n- Lack of transport for school children is a significant concern as this is a very family orientated area.\n- If we do have to have the 16, could they send a 10 to Torphin once an hour?\n- There will be no bus for those travelling to George Watson’s. For some this will mean driving, but for some parents who work early it will mean children having to walk 5 miles into school!\n- The current number 10 route provides a direct practical route to key area such as firhill Craiglockhart Watson and can be in prince’s Street in 30 minutes. At rush hour the 16 takes 20 minutes longer into town. These changes will simply put people off using the bus. Is there any evidence for anyone asking for these proposed changes?\n- The no 10 from Torphin is the preferred route by most who use it to go to Craiglockhart, various schools and the West End. The no 16‘s route is not a substitute for this, especially during week days\n- “Most ridiculous decision ever by LBs.\n- Those most impacted are our young & old – but that’s OK according to LB, they don’t pay. Utterly disgraceful response and badly thought out. The changes effectively cut of the west side of Colinton from the most efficient route to town and our core catchment schools (Firrhill & Watsons) and adding significant journey times for Heriotts.\n- Was there a groundswell of objections to the Torphin 10, and demand for change from residents? No.\n- There was/is no issue with frequency.\n- “”If it ain’t broke……”””\n- The number 10 needs to be kept as it is to provide high school children with a safe and effective service to their education\n- I would like the present service with increased service provision. However if that’s not possible, then increased volume of buses is likely better in the long run, I do agree that the 16 route to town takes longer therefore it’s a less preferable option for many. However you can walk to the 10 in a short amount of time. Another option would be a “”combo”” ticket for Colinton allowing people to swap for the last section if they don’t feel they cant walk the last section with increased volume of buses this might work well. Finally your survey is rather frustrating as it doesn’t represent the options particularly well. It would be good to understand more details on the logic of the 10+ 16 swap.\n- It seems to me a hotch potch approach. The 10 service as is from Colinton to town centre is largely excellent and a flagship for Lothian buses. Surely extending the 16 to incorporate the Bonaly loop is better if costs have to be cut?\n- Half of Colinton will double commuting time or double costs and time if changing buses.\n- The proposed change is not a way to get people back to work, back to shopping or eating out or away from cars. Please rethink.\n- Local children use this service to get to and from school safely.\n- Could alternate the No10. Between Colinton and Torphin and the same with the 16. Gives both options. Not increasing frequency but maybe compromise.\n- The service is excellent at present. The 16 takes a much longer route into town so people will be less likely to use it.\n- Thank you for trying to sort this out Scott\n- Foe efficiency gains, I understand if you need to cancel no 10 Bonaly route, after all its a short walk to the no 16 bus.\n- This change will seriously inconvenience people living in parts of Colinton. The impact on the elderly will be significant. Free travel should not mean a second rate service.\n- These “improvemens” will almost double the journey time to the centre of Edinburgh !\n- To encourage reduction in car travel, Lothian buses should be increasing service level not making it harder. Connections to schools, sports facilities, supermarkets are essential and should be serviced more than they currently are – not less. I’d rather remove the free travel to ensure the services are as efficient as possible.\n- “This as a terrible move for commuters and school children. The No16 takes far to long to get into the city Center and many relying on this service will add an extra hour on there day traveling or two more bus journeys to try and cut the time slightly.\n- I would like to see the No10 servicing as it always has.”\n- The 10 service to Torphin is essential. The number of children that use that service everyday to access all the schools on route has is amazing. If you remove this service all the children at the Torphin end of the route will be stranded. The car congestion this will create will be huge making the junction at Woodhall road and Bridge road extremely congested as the 16 route does not serve the population in this area. This is totally illogical. Please do not do this.\n- The loss of no 10 overall frequency in this area will increase car use . No 16 is not a useful route to serve the area\n- As a regular user of the 10 from torphin bank into town for work this would materially impact my daily travel. Also my family regularly use the service for shopping at tesco and to go to and from craiglockhart. Our children are also not far off going to Firhill High and lack of servive there would be a problem. These changes have no real positives for us from what I can see.\n- The change means school children cannot get to school…so the free bus pass is rather meaningless.\n- In a time when we are being encouraged to use public transport, I feel this change will force local residents to use the car to make essential journeys!\n- At present Lothian buses provide a great service, why alter a good service?\n- For the distance involved, it seems ridiculous to suggest that using two buses to get from eg Torphin to Firrhill is convenient or constitutes an improvement…\n- “Residents in the Torphin area including secondary school children will no longer have a direct journey to Firrhill High School, Tescos, Craiglochart Sports Centre and Meggetland. I know you can jump off a 16 and jump on a 10 but not all residents have free bus travel. Also the possibility of standing in the rain/snow waiting for your 10 connection\n- The journey time for Torphin residents going into the city centre will also increase. The proposed new route takes you through the bottle necks of Commiston, Morningside and Bruntsfield adding a good 15 minutes onto your journey. “\n- This change will lead to more car use and be detrimental to the connection of our neighborhood to the city\n- “I have selected present service rather than consultation because I am not sure that consultation will lead to a better result. It doesn’t feel like LRT is listening to us yet.\n- I feel very concerned that LRT is proposing completely cutting the 10 service to Torphin – my family have lived here for over 25 years and historically the 10 service didn’t even go to Bonaly. People have chosen houses, flats and job based on the fast service into town and to other local facilities (e.g. Craiglockart tennis centre) and it feels very unfair that they should cut it entirely.\n- If LRT could arrange the timetable a bit more creatively so that the 16 sometimes came to Torphin, sometimes goes to Bonaly, and even sometimes just terminates in Colinton if that saves them money, that would be better, but not at the cost of the Torphin 10.\n- It would be ideal if perhaps one 16 an hour (or more) came to Torphin, and that we still had at least two Torphin 10s per hour, as at present.\n- The proposed changes mean that there will be no buses from Torphin or this area of Woodhall Road to Firrhill, Craiglockhart or Polwarth and that it will take a lot longer to get into town via the number 16 bus. The increased travel time will make it very difficult for commuters like me who only just have time to see off their kids in the morning before getting the bus to work. I choose not to own a car and use the buses very frequently to get to work and to meet friends in Polwarth or to go for appointments or to shop in town. My daughters live 35-40 minutes’ walk from Firrhill High School and this walk is difficult in the winter without a bus route. If they had to change in the village along with all the other many children who get the bus into school the pavement near the GP surgery will be dangerously overcrowded. The additional cost of changing buses for the short journey to Craiglockart or Polwarth will also put lots of current bus users off making sustainable choices and mean that they end up using their cars more, causing even more congestion in these areas. So please ensure that the number 10 continues to serve Torphin at least once or twice an hour. This would be particularly important at rush hour but I think that for everyone it is important that there is at least one bus each hour throughout the day. Before the pandemic there were at least 3 buses a day from Torphin along the 10 route.\n- Whilst I welcome there being more frequent services from Torphin via the 16 route, for the many residents who rely on the number 10 to get to work or school this change is not acceptable because the 16 route is very slow and goes via Oxgangs and Morningside and does not serve a large part of the number 10 route. I understand that LRT may need to make some economies but this could be done without cutting the route.\n- I am passionate about the great network Lothian Buses provides and about promoting active travel – if the council wishes to encourage people not to use their cars or buy new cars then it needs to ensure that we do not lose any routes. Thank you!\n- It’s really important that local residents are consulted on this, especially young people as this could impact their ability to get to school. I’d recommend getting in touch w the MSYPS for Edinburgh Pentlands – they might be good to try to talk to Lothian buses about young peoples views.\n- Please keep at least one no 10 service hourly! Our family (small children, teenagers, working-age people and pensioner) use this bus a lot and the 16 is a poor substitute\n- I am an older resident in Woodfield Avenue. It is very difficult to take a car into the city of Edinburgh, and very difficult and expensive to drive or park almost anywhere in the central or peripheral parking zones. So far I have not mastered the Ring go system. I therefore use the buses to go to Into Edinburgh or Bruntsfield, etc.utilising my wonderful bus pass (thank you for that) I can walk a reasonable distance but have moderately severe osteoarthritis, and have had two total knee replacements. Taking the number10 bus to Torphin is a great relief compared with a Number 10 Bonaly bus. In addition, I would like to draw to your attention that any children and young people attending Firrhill High school, the catchment High School, can take the number 10 from Torphin/Woodhall area directly to school. If the weather is inclement ( wet) they should not be expected to walk a long way before attending school therefore sitting in wet clothes and shoes all day. There are no lockers or changing facilities for outdoor clothes at Firrhill Secondary.\nComments from those that support the changes\n- Due to the previous infrequent service to Bonaly we drove to Westgarth Ave for a better choice of service, polluting the air for a short journey. Those in the Torphin area can use the 16 to the village and transfer to the no 10 which will still allow access to Firhill and other amenities.\n- Happy with increased frequency of both\n- I live in East Colinton/Bonaly so can only see a benefit of this change to me personally.\n- I live in Bonaly so the increased frequency of the 10 is welcomed.\n- Good for people in Bonaly, while not good for those in Woodhall / Torphin.\n- Your commentary leaves me with the impression that you’re not really bothered by Bonaly residents or their needs, an impression you’ve given me on a number of occasions. The current bus service to Bonaly is woeful, especially given we live up a steep hill. Three services an hour for Bonaly might actually make the bus a viable alternative to driving. [Note from Scott – In my election address I give a specific commitment to “Protect and improve the number 10 bus service, particularly at peak times and in the evenings” and have been working with Bonaly residents for some time on the issue. ]\n- You will never please everyone but a more frequent service must be a plus! The 16 route gives direct access to Morningside/Bruntsfield for banking, supermarket, cinema etc and would also give access to the No5 at oxgangs going to Newington for Queens Hall etc.\n- You will never be able to please everyone but a more frequent service must be a plus.\n- This will give a more frequent service and will enable easier travel to Morningside etc. for shops, banks, restaurants etc. No easy answers!\n- At the moment, despite what Lothian Buses have assured me isn’t happening, Bonaly only has one bus per hour between morming and evening rush hour. All the rest go to Torphin. This isn’t acceptable. Going back to every second bus coming to Bonaly would seem to be the best option for everyone.\n“\n“",

Rather than respond to these suggests, the Council have now asked residents to map their suggestions. Given that we are now 10 weeks into lock-down, surely we should be seeing real action? Rather than residents mapping suggestions, the Council should be mapping results!\nI mailed the Council on the 14th of May asking what actions were due to be undertaken in my Ward – 20 days later I have had no reply.\nWe were recently told “segregated cycle-ways are set to be introduced on busy routes to Edinburgh’s two main hospitals“. The map below shows how much extra protection a nurse (like my wife) cycling from the middle of my Ward to the Royal Infirmary would get as a result of this measure. We can do better than this.\nPlease use the mapping tool in the hope that the Council will act to make my Ward safer for everyone. Below is a briefing on how it works.\nOnly a tiny part of the route from my Ward to RIE has been made safer for key workers\nBriefing\nAs part of the Council’s plans to deliver short and long-term measures to make it easier and safer for people to get around our streets for essential trips and exercise, we’re today (Friday 29 May) launching an online mapping tool called ‘Commonplace’.\nSince the Policy and Sustainability Committee approved the report setting out criteria for measures, we have received around 200 suggestions for road closures, widened pavements, segregated cycle lanes and other possible actions from across the city. These are helping to shape our plans for interventions over the next weeks and months.\nWe’re now asking people to help us identify further temporary measures across the city that will have the greatest benefit to public health, and that we can implement quickly.\nSuggestions will be added to a list of projects that we’re already assessing for quick implementation. All feedback received so far has been recorded and will be used along with responses to the Commonplace tool to inform decisions on prioritising further measures.\nWhile we welcome every response, we won’t be able to deliver all the improvements suggested, with any work dependent on available funding, procurement of materials and the availability of contractors. We’ll soon be sharing information on schemes that have been suggested, alongside those that are being progressed, on our website.\nAbout Commonplace\nProvided by Sustrans, Commonplace is an online mapping tool specifically designed to capture feedback on suggestions for temporary road measures in neighbourhoods across the city in response to Covid-19.\nThe tool will be open until Monday 29 June and anyone can use it to highlight specific areas on an interactive map and provide feedback on barriers they’ve experienced, as well as identify improvements. This, along with ideas already shared with us, will help shape our efforts over the coming weeks and months.\nIf you have already sent suggestions for temporary measures you would like to see, there is no need to resend them. All suggestions are being recorded and used to inform the selection of interventions around the city.\nImmediate measures\nAs you know, a programme of changes is already well underway across the city. In the members’ brief issued earlier this week we shared plans for the next phase of improvements.\nAs an update to this earlier briefing, we can confirm that the following measures will now be in place from today (Friday 29 May):\n- partial closure of Stanley Street and Hope Lane between Stanley Street and Christian Grove to traffic provides a low traffic corridor for people to walk and cycle and access nearby green spaces like Figgate Park for exercise\n- closure of Warriston Road to through traffic provides a wide pedestrian and cyclist-friendly space leading to the access for the North Edinburgh path Network. Access to the allotments and Warriston Crematorium will be maintained via Ferry Road.\nFurther information\nSpaces for People programme email spacesforpeople@edinburgh.gov.uk",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_12_23_may-sturgeon-passports-and-which-nationalism-is-best/content_361.html": "Be in no doubt, Theresa May’s unveiling of the new design of the post-Brexit passport is symbolic. It’s a message that, like or loath it, Brexit is coming (report, 23/12/17). Of course, what that Brexit will look like is less than clear.\nWhat’s interesting, however, is how Nicola Sturgeon has reacted to Theresa May’s description of the passport as being an:\n“expression of our independence and sovereignty – symbolising our citizenship of a proud, great nation”.\nThe fact that Ms Sturgeon uses the same kind of rhetoric to describe the smallest SNP policy announcement obviously rankled her a little, so Scotland’s top nationalist responded on Twitter by saying her kind of nationalism was better than Mrs May’s:\n“The open, inclusive, civic, internationalist Scottish independence movement that I’m so proud to be part of could not be further removed from this insular, inward looking, blue passport-obsessed nonsense”.\nThere is, of course, a number of problems with this. Not least the fact that for many years top nationalist have been using mock Scottish passports, which just happen to be blue, as props at political events because symbolism is always more important than action where the SNP is concerned. That’s why we no longer have “bus passes” for older people in Scotland, we have the “Saltire Card” – what vacuous nonsense.\nMs Sturgeon may not feel that Nationalists are inward looking, but it’s her supporters that trawl supermarkets looking for Union Jacks on food produce, boycott “disloyal” Scottish businesses and troll strangers on social media. Indeed, there is nothing more inward looking than taking a hammer to a box of tea cakes because they are deemed not to be Scottish enough.\nI also question Nicola Sturgeon’s inferred position at the head of the independence movement. Many in that movement are now openly questioning her leadership and, more recently, cutting council services to fund tax cuts to people earning £50,000.\nIndeed, rather than posturing on Twitter, perhaps Ms Sturgeon should get on with her day job and start supporting the large section of Scottish society who don’t own a passport because travel overseas is simply unaffordable.",

These patients are clinically ready to move on to a more appropriate care setting either within or outwith the NHS – such as the patient’s home or a care home.\nLabour said the figures showed the need to invest in social care, as the failure of the SNP to invest in social care has increased the pressure on our hospitals.\n[Text is from the Labour press team]",

Despite this, it was recommended to the Committee that planning permission be GRANTED.\nAs a Councillor for the Ward the school sits within, Gavin Corbett asked that a planning “hearing” was held. This would have given Community Groups and the BHS Parent Council the chance to make their case to the committee, but the request was refused. Given the extent of the opposition to this proposal, declining a hearing simply helps undermine local democracy. Many BHS parents (I am one), were keen that a hearing was held so this decision can be subjected to detailed public scrutiny.\nIf you watch the video, however, you will see that it was concluded that the decision be “continued” (i.e. delayed) so that a site visit can be undertaken.\nHowever, Cllr Corbett is reporting that the visit will be just 15 minutes long – 4pm – 4:15pm on the 1st of May. Nonetheless, I want to thank Cllr Corbett for all the work he has done on this.",

The report was published at 6:30pm yesterday – hours after it was given to the press.\nThe key messages appear to be:\n- Removal of “shopping street” measures for pedestrians;\n- Cycle routes to remain; and\n- School schemes face uncertainty.\nNo scheme will be made permanent yet, but will instead be converted from a TTRO (Temporary) to a ETRO (Experimental) – this will mean that changes can be made on an ongoing basis and that the public will be consulted more fully.\nDetails are below for the schemes which touch on my Ward.\nSchools\nAcross the city, these were perhaps the post popular SfP schemes. The Council is proposing to “retain those schemes that have the support of school communities when public health guidance changes”. By the end of 2021 “it is proposed to re-prioritise the School Travel Plan review and work with schools which have had part time vehicle prohibitions under SfP, with a view to developing measures tailored to the individual schools and which have support from the school concerned and the parents”.\nThe new path installed at St Mark’s RC Primary School will be made permanent. Good!\nLanark Road\nThe Council acknowledges that there was “significant net support for removal” of this scheme. It is proposed that this scheme will be retained, however, as the measures have “reduced the effective road width and facilitated the introduction of a 30mph speed limit”. Parking along the route will be reviewed with a view to increasing capacity.\nComiston Road\nAs with Lanark Road, the Council acknowledges that there was “significant net support for removal” of this scheme. It is proposed that this scheme will be retained, however, as the measures have “reduced the effective road width and facilitated the introduction of a 30mph speed limit”. This is ironic as reducing the limit was not part of the initial proposal, but was requested by me after comments from local residents.\nParking along the Route will be reviewed with a view to increasing capacity.\nIt is also proposed to “consider extending the existing bus lane southwards”. This is to address the recently reported northbound queuing on the approach to the Greenbank junction. This should also mean that vehicles waiting to turn right can be more easily passed.\nBraid Road\nThe Council notes “the Braid Road closure attracted the highest level of net support for removal in both the public consultation and market research, though there was also a significant level of support for retention” – it attracted the highest net level of demand for removal.\nThe Council notes, however, that since the consultation started Braid Road reopened southbound – “the road has subsequently been reopened to motorised traffic southbound, with new protected cycle lanes provided. This reopening should reduce southbound congestion on Morningside Road, which had increased in association with the closure.”\nThere is still, however, a lack of coherence between the Braid Road and Comiston Road schemes. We are also being told that the Braid Road restrictions are needed as it “facilitates the Meadows to Greenbank cycling Quiet Connection”, but at the consultation stage for this scheme we were told this wasn’t the case!\nNo change is proposed, but a commitment is given to “monitor traffic levels and journey times on Comiston Road to inform future mitigation measures/decisions”.\nConclusion\nWhether people love the SfP scheme or hate it, there can be no doubt that it has not been handled well. It’s very clear that some were only too happy to exclude the public from the debate. Whilst some schemes may well be popular, there is not much in this report that shows that Council is willing to engage constructively with the public in Edinburgh on the issue. Rather than winning hearts and minds, they are bulldozing opinion related to Braid Road, Comiston Road & Lanark Road.\nFor me, the big issue is the Comiston Road / Braid Road scheme and the failure to deal with them as in integrated corridor. These roads run closely together (200m apart at the most) but we are faced with a botched cycle schemes on each route. I’d rather the council did Braid Road well for cyclists, and provided better support for buses on Comiston Road.\nThe Comiston Road SfP scheme in particular is an issue for me. Before SfP the most dangerous spot was around Buckstone Shops. This has not changed. All the SfP bollards installed there have now been removed as they have been “struck by passing traffic on multiple occasions”. I asked if this meant “bollards are being removed where cyclists need them most?”, and SfP did not reply.\nI remain hopeful, however, that the ETRO process will mandate the Council to listen to residents and give them a greater say on the future of these schemes. Before that happens, however, the Council needs to show some humility and admit avoidable mistakes have been made.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_01_28_no-change-buckstone-ps-boroughmuir-hs-catchments/content_84.html": "There has been speculation recently regarding rising pupil rolls at Boroughmuir High School and how this may force Buckstone PS out of it, and into a new School or Firrhill High School’s catchment. This is because Boroughmuir’s capacity will soon be 1,560, but this is likely to be exceeded in 2023 or 2024 (see table above). Four points on this:\n- Boroughmuir’s capacity issues should not be news, I blogged about it here in 2019 and touched on it in 2021 is part of my review of City Plan 2030.\n- If the projections are correct a new school will be needed or catchment changes will have to be implemented. This does not automatically mean Buckstone PS will be involved in this (other primary schools contribute to Boroughmuir too), but any change will be subject to two consultations.\n- Of course, I will support the needs of local people on the issue.\n- I live in Buckstone, and my kids were well served my Buckstone PS and Boroughmuir HS – so I fully understand the concerns people have about the future of these great schools.\nI have discussed the issue with the Council’s “Head of Strategic Asset Planning”, and he gave me this reply:\nThe latest publication which has mentioned the issue of potential future catchment change for Boroughmuir is the Education Appraisal associated with City Plan 2030.\nI have copied the relevant text (from page 16 of the document) below (note the links at the end to the relevant ECF reports):\n“Boroughmuir High School Growth from the existing catchment population is the main contributor to the accommodation pressures experienced at Boroughmuir High School . An extension to increase the capacity of Boroughmuir High School to 1,560 pupils is currently under construction. Beyond this, the school cannot be extended further on its existing site. To accommodate all pupils forecast from population growth and pupil generation from new development it will be necessary to engage with the school community to consider the options available, including catchment change. The requirement to consider a catchment change to address long-term accommodation pressure was reported to the Education, Children and Families Committee in December 2018 and March 2020.”\nI think the City Plan 2030 would be the most likely source of any recent discussion on this issue because the period of representations was from 7 November to 20 December 2021. The process for the City Plan moving forward can be found at this link.\nAt the moment we have no plans to take forward any engagement on these issues. However, we would engage with all the relevant secondary and primary school communities about potential options before any final proposals were suggested for a statutory consultation.\nI hope this is helpful but please let me know if any further information is required.\nSo basically, there has been no change but the problem is not going away. My understanding, following my discussion with the Head of Strategic Asset Planning, is that the plan for a new school in south Edinburgh was contingent on Redford Barracks being available for housing over the next 5-10 years, but it now looks like any new homes (and pupils) from that site are 10-15 years away. Adjusting catchments remains a possibility, but this will involve first moving pupils to the north out of Firrhill HS and/or Boroughmuir High School (Gracemount HS is not an option). I touch on the feasibility of this here.\nConclusion\nIt looks like the speculation was not well informed, but the problem still needs to be fixed. I expect no real action on the issue until after the election in May. At that point we will need a Council that takes the issue seriously, and the schools involved will need Councillors that stand up for local people.\nNOTE: In 2012 I said the school site was too small in a Scotsman article – see here.",

I did this whilst recognising the hard work Council staff have invested in keeping our roads, footpaths and cycle paths free from ice and snow during what I feel has been quite a hard winter. The importance of their work became clear to me last month.\nOn the evening of the 13th of December I stepped out of the train from London to find Princes Street was like an ice rink. At that point, I did wonder what the rest of the city must be like if Princes Street was not safe. We found out in the Evening News 2 days later.\n71 year old Michael Wilczynski slipped, broke his ankle and had to wait over three hours on the pavement for an ambulance. He was one of at least 21 people who slipped on ice that day and had to call on the NHS. We now know there were 500 such slips in December which resulted in visit to A&E – a huge economic and human cost. I don’t doubt some of these people may have gone on to put extra pressure on our already stressed social care system.\nWe should not underestimate the extent to which many older people fear having a slip like Mr Wilczynski’s. Indeed, I spoke to a retired headteacher last week who said he’d been trapped in his house for five days when we had a snow fall earlier this month. Likewise, a friend from my church told me she had been stuck at home for a week.\nSo if we are going to revisit gritting routes, I would urge the City of Edinburgh Council to give higher priority to areas with greater populations of older people.\nA second consideration must be altitude. My house is in Buckstone – a full 600 feet higher than Leith, and 300 feet above Morningside. Whilst people in my Ward don’t mind looking down on people in Morningside, that extra elevation means we are more likely to get snow and when we do get it is stays for longer.\nWhen we had overnight snowfall on the 25th of December, it took until the 29th for the pavement snow ploughs to reach my Ward. When I went to thank the Council staff for working over the Christmas break, the driver told me he’d been clearing the snow for a few days but had not seen anything like the amount we had experienced in Colinton/Fairmilehead. This was infuriating! Clearly, we need to prioritise based on altitude better.\nA third consideration is resilience. Over the Christmas break I encouraged my constituents to grit the public paths outside their home, request grit bin refills and even ask for a new grit bin if they felt one was needed.\nWhen we had our next snow fall almost three weeks later I found that grit bins were still empty, the system for requesting new grit bins was failing and as a result people are getting hurt.\nOne residents told me about how he watched with his heart in his mouth as two people tried to cycle up an icy West Mill Road – this is a steep street used by many cyclists to access the Water of Leith cycle path. The grit bins were empty and the road was not gritted.\nI have raised all these issues with the gritting team. I received, without asking, an unreserved apology for my constituents and a clear commitment that matters will improve. Notwithstanding the school teacher’s car that skidded on ice last week and landed in my constituent’s front garden, I feel matters are improving.\nThe importance of attitude, the age of the local population and the importance of improving resilience are now on the agenda more than ever. Despite this, I was more than happy to support the request that a review is undertaken on this key issue. I hope that as part of that review the Council engages the public more about how this service is run and what its priorities should be.",

This consultation rejected the Lanark Road scheme largely based on safety grounds, and the current mini-review aims to see if these can be addressed.\nThe survey going out tomorrow will seek the resident’s views on:\n- measures to achieve cycle speed reductions; and,\n- changes to the parking spaces which sit outside protected cycle lanes.\nThe Council have developed proposals which they feel focus primarily on those locations where conflict is most likely – that is where cyclists might be travelling at speed on the inside of parked vehicles. They’ve discussed these options with Community Councillors (I was not invited to this) and they say the comments have helped them inform the proposals.\nI have not been given prior sight of the survey(!), but I was successful in having the area it covers enlarged and I was also given a commitment that local businesses would be included.\nBelow are notes from the meeting with Community Councillors – the discussion was based on the slides I shared here. The discussion sounds constructive, but it appears very little hard data informed proceedings (a concern given the recent RED Internal Audit finding SfP received).\nMeeting Notes\nSfP presented the previously circulated document, outlining the options which had been developed to mitigate cycle speed, and conflict between people accessing parked cars, and people on bikes.\nProposals include the introduction of road markings on the cycleway to encourage people cycling to slow down on approach to parking areas, as well as specific options for revisions at two parking areas: Spylaw Park (by Cranley Nursery), and; Kingsknowe Park (by Dovecot Park).\nSpylaw Park (street)\nThe Council is aware of concerns regarding conflict between parents accessing Cranley Nursery and passing cyclists at this location. Due to its location this section of cycleway is also likely to be less heavily used, and less beneficial to users than the remainder of the corridor.\nThere are two proposed options at this location.\n- Remove the Parking\n- Remove the cycleway\n(NB: SfP clarified during the presentation that there is a third option at this location – to leave it as it currently with both parking and cycleway, and that this will be made clear in any community engagement)\nA Community Councillor stated that cycle counts were being carried out but the Post-Implementation results were not yet available, and that they would not go into granular enough detail to assess this specific location. Though this level of granularity may be available from Strava data, and this can be considered in advance of final decisions being made. However, the assumption that it sees less use than the rest of the route is reasonable.\nA Community Councillor suggested that this area should remain as it is now, with improvements made if possible, and that it would be a retrograde step to remove the infrastructure now it is in place. AG further suggested that the cycleway should instead be extended further west to more effective connect the communities to the West of the bypass.\nOfficers noted that no support was voiced for removing the cycleway at this location, and that this would be considered in developing the public engagement, which would include the option to retain the current layout.\nKingsknowe Park\nThe Council is aware of conflict at this location between people accessing the parked cars and passing cyclists, including reports of near misses and collisions. There are two options at this location:\n- Remove the parking\n- Relocate the parking to the opposite side of the road\n- (Relocating the parking results in a net increase in the number of spaces)\n(NB: SfP explained that due to the occurrence of at least one collision at this location it was not considered a viable option to make no changes here – as such leaving the layout as it is was probably not a viable third option)\nA Community Councillor stated that relocating the parking to the uphill side of the road seemed a sensible move, but asked about receiving deliveries etc for the flats where the parking is currently located.\nSfP explained that loading/unloading, as well as pick-up / drop-off was still permitted on Double Yellow Lines. As such there will still be space for deliveries and other such uses to be carried out from the kerbside. As a brief activity this is permitted to take place from the cycleway where space allows.\nTwo Community Councillors agreed that relocating the parking to the uphill side of the street was a sensible option. Though one noted that electric bicycles can still travel at reasonable speeds uphill – though this was probably acceptable as the assisted speeds are still below what can be achieved when travelling downhill.\nA Community Councillor queried whether the bollards could be removed from the downhill parking bay to provide more manoeuvring space for people cycling.\nSfP explained that this would likely result in vehicles parking closer to the kerb, which would both remove the benefit, and increase the likelihood of ‘dooring’ accidents. Though SfP noted that the bollards have been omitted from the parking areas adjacent to the two nurseries, and adherence does seem to have been good. Nonetheless, the problem is resolved by relocating the parking.\nOfficers noted that there seemed to be a generally favourable view of relocating the parking bay at this location to the uphill side.\nOther Parking Locations\nAt all remaining parking areas the risk of conflict between people cycling and people accessing parked cars is mitigated by the topography. Nonetheless, it is proposed to introduce further markings to encourage people cycling to keep to an appropriate speed while passing parking areas.\nAttendees agreed that this would be a positive change.\nGeneral Discussion\nA Community Councillor suggested introducing timed parking bays at the parking areas with high demand for customers. Officers highlighted that this is not possible using a TTRO, however it would be possible using an ETRO should the schemes be retained for a longer period.\nA Community Councillor queried why we are not paining SLOW on the main carriageway given drivers are being recorded at speeds of 68mph even with the new road design changes. Surely the balance of risk has lost it’s sense of proportionality if we are only concerned about writing SLOW on the cycle lanes? I do support writing it on the cycle lanes before the floating parking bays but why not for drivers also? ‘Traveling Safely’ must surely apply to all road users\nA Community Councillor suggested that the ‘floating’ parking bays should be ‘bookended’ better, eg: with planters, to ensure that they are conspicuous even when lightly used. It was also noted that these bays provide a valuable purpose in traffic calming by requiring passing vehicles to reduce their speed.\nA Community Councillor highlighted that the cycle crossing point at the junction of Lanark Road and Kingsknowe Drive has poor visibility and should be altered to ensure safety.\nA Community Councillor noted that some parking for the golf course has been displaced and that parking around the junctions of Kingsknowe Gardens and Kingsknowe Avenue, with Kingsknowe Road South. AG suggested installing Double Yellow Lines at these junctions to ease parking concerns.\nA Community Councillor expressed support for points made by others, including retaining the parking and cycleway adjacent to Cranley Nursery and relocating the parking at Dovecot Park, and introducing SLOW markings on the cycleway. When asked for his thoughts on extending the cycleway further west the Community Councillor stated that should this be considered it should be alongside further engagement.\nA Community Councillor suggested reducing the speed limit on Lanark Road further to 20mph. Further suggested installing Crossways (Zebra Crossings without Belisha Beacons) at regular intervals in Lanark Road and at Side Roads, and highlighted the need to improve the environment for cycling on Lanark Road between Inglis Green Road and Hutchison Avenue, especially in light of the new developments taking place in the area.\nOfficer’s Response\nOfficers stated that these points would be considered in advance of engagement with residents, and where appropriate the designs, and options, would be updated. In particular, consideration will be given to improving opportunities for crossing the road throughout the scheme, and consideration will be given to the inclusion of a temporary-traffic light controlled crossing. Though officers highlighted that budgetary constraints may create difficulties as such installations are costly due to the ongoing hire costs involved.\nTwo attendees sent further comments.\nA Community Councillor had to leave early but submitted the following questions before leaving, and asked that they be answered:\n- Q: What can be done about enforcement whether that’s speeds (cyclist and cars) or parking illegally?\n- Answer: Enforcement of traffic speeds is carried out by the Police. Police Scotland have carried out enforcement recently following numerous concerns about speeding and are issuing penalties. Speed limits only apply to motorised vehicles as such it is not possible to ‘enforce’ cycle speeds, though it is unlikely that any more than a small minority of cyclists are travelling at speeds in excess of 30mph on this route. The Council is monitoring cycle speeds and will be able to consider whether further mitigations are required in the future.\n- Q: Will anything be done to improve/reduce conflict on the Water of Leith. The largest number of complaints I receive are around inconsiderate cyclists on the water of leith. if we are improving safety for cyclists on Lanark Road, is there a way or justificaiton on directing them away from WoL? Especially what we’ve been referring to as the ‘Strava’ ones?\n- Answer: It is not proposed to actively discourage users from using the Water of Leith, however Lanark Road provides a far more direct route and it is hoped that this will encourage greater use from those people who value speed while cycling.\nA Community Councillor was unable to contribute during the meeting due to technical troubles. However, they sent comments after the meeting, which included:\n- Requirement for pedestrian crossing improvements long overdue\n- Relocation of parking at Dovecot Park supported\n- Cycle crossing at Kingsknowe Drive dangerous due to visibility\n- People are much safer cycling on the new route, though some still choose to stay on road\n- Difficult for motorists joining Lanark Road from side roads due to visibility being obscured by parked cars\n- Don’t agree with banning people cycling on Water of Leith\n- Agreement with 30mph limit, but 20mph not required\n- Speed cameras should be re-instated, query why the only face east\n- Several changes at once, means it’s hard to identify results of each\n- Lack of clarity on what metrics will be used to assess the impact of the scheme",

This frees up valuable footpath space, making it easier and safer for those with mobility problems, buggies and young children to get around.\nThe policy does, however, come with exemptions. Inexplicably, one is the Council’s own on-street advertising structures. One of the others is the Edinburgh Fringe Festival (other festivals are not mentioned), on them the policy says:\nThe Festival represents an extraordinary period in the city’s events calendar, and as an\ninternationally recognised event, it brings with it thousands of visitors which provide\na significant boost to Edinburgh’s economy. Having regard to this, there has been a\nlong-standing acceptance that many of the restrictions that are in place throughout\nthe rest of the year are relaxed. Notwithstanding this, the Council continues to work\nclosely with signage and event organisers and reviews infrastructure each year to ensure it meets with public safety requirements and respects particularly sensitive\nsites.\nThis morning I spotted online that some of the on-street advertising structures promoting Edinburgh Fringe Festival acts did not (in my opinion) meet “with public safety requirements”… or at least common sense (images above). In response, I promptly e-mailed senior people in both the Council and the Fringe Society.\nTwelve hours later I have not had a reply from the Senior Council Officer yet, but the prompt reply I received from the Fringe Society was an education for me:\nThe Outdoor Advertising Scheme promoting acts on the Fringe is not managed by the Fringe Society, it is managed by Out of Hand (OoH) who are contracted by the City of Edinburgh Council. Each site is clearly labelled with a reference and contact details for reporting any issues (highlighted in your first image) which are always dealt with promptly. The Fishmarket Close example you have given was as a result of overnight vandalism and had already been picked up by a daily check made of all sites by Out of Hand, before the complaint came in, and was in the process of being fixed.\nAnd also:\nIn addition to the Outdoor Advertising, and as part of the contract, OoH facilitate an anti-littering campaign for CEC and do an extensive clear up operation of flyposting, chewing gum, etc. from an agreed perimeter around each Fringe advertising site which makes a considerable difference to the cleanliness of the city and 99% all materials produced are recycled at the end of the Fringe (the other 1% is taken home by companies).\nOf course I had to apologise, but I simply did not expect the Council to be responsible for this. Every day is a learning day.\nllll",

If they choose to renew their permit in the summer then it will be valid from October 2019 to October 2020.\nHow to register\n- The quickest and easiest way to register is on our website at edinburgh.gov.uk/gardenwaste\nResidents without internet access at home can use the computers in our libraries. - Residents can also register via phone by calling 0131 608 1100 (option 1, then option 9). Due to high call volumes there may be wait times.\n- Residents can also pay by debit/credit card or cash at the following locality offices:\n- North West Office, 8 West Pilton Gardens, EH4 4DP\n- South East Office, 40 Captain’s Road, EH17 8QF\n- South West Office, 10 Westside Plaza, EH14 2ST\nHow does the service work?\n- We will empty your brown bin once every two weeks all year round.\n- You will need to renew your permit every year before it expires to continue receiving the service.\n- The current permits are valid from October 2018 – October 2019.\n- Permits are not prorated for residents who sign up in February.\n- Residents who signed up during one of the later registration windows (ie February 2019) instead of during summer 2018, will still need to pay £25 to receive collections until 6 October.\n- They can renew their permits this summer to continue receiving a 12 month service after 6 October 2019.\n- Once a resident has signed up we will send them a new collection calendar and permit sticker 6 – 8 weeks later.\n- We will only empty brown bins with valid permit stickers.\n- There is no limit to how many garden waste bins a property can have but there will be a charge of £25 per bin.\n- Residents can share a bin with their neighbours and they will need to agree on one resident acting as the lead for booking and paying for the service.\n- If a resident moves house they can transfer their permit to their new address. They will need to give us six weeks’ notice to update our system and take their brown bin and permit sticker to their new address.\n- Terms and conditions are available on our website http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/gardenwasteterms\nDoes everyone need to pay?\n- Residents who receive Council Tax Reduction (formerly called Council Tax Benefit) do not need to pay for the service but they do need to register to receive it. Other exemptions such as single occupancy discount or Garden Aid do not qualify for free garden waste collections.\n- A small number of residents in the Colinton area have their garden waste collected by Tiphereth and they also need to register and pay to continue receiving the service.\nWhy we’re charging for garden waste collections\n- Our costs are increasing and more people are using our services, whilst our income is reducing. The £25 per year charge was agreed by the Council at a meeting in February 2018. We already have 70,747 brown bins registered across the city, which means we can continue to provide collections to more than 65,000 homes while saving over £1.4m towards essential services for the people of Edinburgh.\n- As garden waste collection is not a statutory service and with reducing budgets and increasing costs, we can no longer afford to provide the service for free.\n- Over 40% of councils in the UK charge for a garden waste collection and others have stopped the service altogether.\n- The £25 charge is lower than many other councils and works out at less than 50p per week.\nFurther information, including the terms and conditions are available on our website www.edinburgh.gov.uk/gardenwaste",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_10_24_in-praise-of-edinburghs-car-club/content_132.html": "Data published by the Scottish Government at the start of the year shows that car ownership is increasing in Scotland, with three million cars now registered here. Although Edinburgh is bucking the trend, we have also seen public transport usage fall as costs have risen.\nThis is a concern as transport accounts for about a third of Scotland’s greenhouse gas emissions – much of it from cars. Although some people are going electric, this is slow in Edinburgh as there are fewer charging points per head of population than any other local authority.\nFor many people car ownership is essential. For others it is a luxury. For most of us, however, it falls somewhere between the two. The convenience cars offer means that people can choose to live far from work or family, but we know this has a downside.\nA phenomenon we have all observed over the past 20 years is the rise in 2 and 3 car households. I live in Buckstone where the roads are slightly narrower as virtually every house has a drive. This is no longer enough – drives are full, and too many 2nd and 3rd cars end up parked on the pavement.\nBuying a car is a big step if you are concerned about climate change. Every kilometre we drive emits 180g of CO2. This is overshadowed, however, by the carbon footprint of constructing a car – a medium-sized new car needs the equivalent of 17 tonnes of CO2 (same as driving 60,000 miles).\nThere is an alternative to purchasing a car that’s not buying a bike or a bus pass. That alternative is joining a “Car Club”. For just £2 per month you get access to a brand-new car. You have to pre-book via an App and pay just over £5 per hour (plus 15p per mile), but you don’t have to worry about MOTs, servicing, insurance, depreciation or even petrol. It’s not for everyone, but it’s great for people who perhaps want to transition out of car ownership or want to avoid buying a second car.\nI’ve joined, and found the system simple and easy if you are organised enough to plan your trips a day or two ahead.

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_10_28_briefing-fireworks-for-personal-use-in-edinburgh/content_83.html": "Bonfire night is fast approaching – below is a briefing on fireworks in Edinburgh, and the Council’s approach to dealing with any issues which arise.\nFireworks and community safety\nThe City of Edinburgh Council (the Council) takes the misuse of fireworks extremely seriously and continues to work in partnership with the Scottish Government and other agencies to minimise the risk of harm to communities including animals. Your email has also been passed to our Communications Team to review the RSPCA toolkit to which you refer, and a summary of the fireworks landscape in Scotland and the Council’s community safety activity ongoing relating to fireworks and bonfires is provided below:\nLegislation\nLegislation on the sale and storage of fireworks is reserved to the UK government while legislation covering the use of fireworks in Scotland is devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government has been looking at the impact of fireworks and bonfires in relation to its ambition for safer communities and in 2019, carried out a public consultation to gather views on the use and regulation of fireworks in Scotland. The Council’s response to that consultation is attached at Appendix 1.\nScottish Government’s Fireworks Review Group\nFollowing the 2019 public consultation, the Scottish Government established a Fireworks Review Group bringing together key organisations with a direct interest in fireworks, including representatives from the fireworks industry, NHS, animal welfare, the emergency services and local government (including the Council), as well as community representatives. In November 2020, the Group produced a report with recommendations to Scottish Ministers on tightening devolved legislation on fireworks in Scotland.\nThe Group had concluded no single tightening of regulation would bring about the desired benefits and that any approach to changes in regulation should be set alongside other actions. These include, but are not limited to, awareness raising campaigns and the facilitation of organised public events so that the desired cultural change and the prevention of unwanted unintended consequences are achieved.\nTaking forward the recommendations\nA number of the recommendations from the Review Group have been taken forward in secondary legislation and changes implemented by these regulations, which came into force on 30 June 2021, included three new measures in relation to the way the general public can use and access fireworks as follows:\n- restrict the times of day fireworks can be used by the general public to between 6pm and 11pm, with the exception of 5 November (when they can be used from 6pm until midnight), New Year’s Eve, the night of Chinese New Year and the night of Diwali (when they can be used from 6pm until 1am)\n- restrict the times of day fireworks can be supplied to the general public to during the daytime hours of 7am and 6pm, alongside existing requirements on retailers around sale and storage licences\n- limit the quantity of fireworks that can be supplied to the general public to 5kg at any one time\nFurther action on the sale and use of fireworks\nThe Scottish Government is looking to make additional changes to improve community safety relating to fireworks and between June 2021 and August 2021, conducted a follow up public consultation on the use and sale of fireworks in Scotland. The Council’s elected members submitted a response which is attached at Appendix 2.\nCouncil community safety activity\nSince 2018, the Council has led a citywide Community Improvement Partnership (CIP) to co-ordinate a consistent partnership response to resource planning for Bonfire Night with a focus on keeping people and animals safe. Membership of the CIP includes Police Scotland, Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS), and representatives from the Council’s waste and street cleansing services, public safety, and the four local areas including housing.\nExamples of the CIP’s planning and prevention work conducted annually are below:\n- Staff conducting street patrols and inspection of fly-tipping hotspots for hazardous and other material so that where necessary, uplifts are arranged to maintain safety in public areas\n- Community safety and housing staff visiting communal stairs and gardens to ensure areas are free from combustible material\n- Liaison with housing associations to agree joint working protocols in areas of mixed tenure\n- Engaging with young people and their parents through targeted joint partner visits to provide advice in relation to safety and antisocial behaviour during the bonfire/fireworks period\n- Organising diversionary activities for young people during the fireworks/bonfire period to discourage antisocial behaviour\n- Licensing and trading standards staff visiting licensed premises selling fireworks to check and advise on fireworks storage and sales\n- SFRS delivering fireworks and bonfire educational awareness sessions in primary and secondary schools to advise young people on keeping safe\n- Partner communications highlighting the importance of safety around fireworks and bonfires through social media and display posters, as well as delivering letters to residents in hotspot areas.\nAppendices\nAppendix 1 – the Council’s response to the Scottish Government Consultation on Fireworks in Scotland (2019); consultation response representing trading standards, community safety, and public safety sectors, incorporating issues raised in motions and amendments from elected members.\nAppendix 2 – elected members response to the Scottish Government Consultation on the Use and Sale of Fireworks in Scotland and tackling the misuse of pyrotechnics (2021).",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_12_16_braid-road-consultation-greenbank-to-meadows-quiet-route_comment-page-1/content_345.html": "23-12-2020 Update – My consultation response.\nBelow is my response to the Quiet Route consultation.\nPoint 1\nI don’t know anyone who seriously opposes the quiet route concept. It is clear, however, that many people living along the route have concerns about the detail of the design. It’s disappointing that, in the eight months since lockdown began, more resources have not been made available to engage with residents living along the route. Indeed, there is no doubt that community engagement is important as it leads to improved outcomes on infrastructure projects. It increases acceptance of decisions as local knowledge from diverse groups shapes and creates inclusive, effective solutions.\nPoint 2\nGreater acceptance of the scheme may be possible if the evidence base for it is shared. It’s disappointing that in the eight months since lockdown began this has not happened.\nPoint 3\nThe Fairmilehead area interfaces with two Spaces for People schemes – those on Buckstone/Pentland Terrace and Braid Road. These schemes have struggled to gain widespread public support due to (1) the lack of community engagement, (2) failure to share the evidence base that justifies their existence and (3) the decision to view both of these as separate units. Pre-Covid, the need to better connect Morningside and Fairmilehead for those able to walk and cycle was clear. Rather than responding to the Covid crisis by working with the community to establish one good quality route we could all be proud of, the Council has stretched limited resources between two schemes and lost the trust of local residents. It is notable that many of those who signed the petition calling for the reopening of Braid Road actually live on or near it. Indeed, it is only now that data is being collected to understand how these schemes interoperate.\nWithin this context, I find the decision to view the (1) Quiet Route, (2) Braid Roads and (3) Buckstone/Pentland Terrace schemes separately as difficult to justify to residents in my Ward. If these schemes truly are to form a route for cyclists between Fairmilehead and the Meadows, there they should be viewed as one and residents should be consulted on the formation of a single coherent route which does not impact negatively on public transport or any local school.\nPoint 4\nIn terms of accessibility, many disabled people depend on cars (both to drive and as a passenger) and taxis. Road changes shouldn’t prevent disabled people from being able to stop near their destination. Changes to usual travel patterns can add to anxiety for all of us, but to some disabled people in particular. The scheme should therefore be seen in this context – continual changes should therefore be avoided where possible, and should be effectively communicated to the public (including disabled people).\nPoint 5\nSteps should be taken to remind residents along the route of the hazard parked cars and overgrown hedges (etc) pose to pedestrians and those with buggies/wheelchairs/guide dogs. This is particularly important on the streets surrounding the schools.\n20-12-2020 Update\nI have received a message from the Council saying that “For clarification, the Greenbank to Meadows measures do not include the closure of Braid Road, this is a separate scheme…”. This is despite the Braid Road closure being highlighted on the Quiet Route map (above) and the Council report on the Quiet Route saying:\nThe Spaces for People review of the measures on Braid Road recommends retaining its closure. This assessment has considered the scheme relationship with both Comiston Road and with the proposals for the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Connection… and later… The current recommendation is to continue with the closure of Braid Road and monitoring of traffic flows on Comiston Road (currently average +11%).\nSpaces for People Team, November 2020\nI asked if the Quiet Route could proceed without the closure of Braid Road and was told: “The opening of Braid Road would have significant issues but these could be addressed if required. So yes, the QR could proceed.”\nI asked why Braid Road was currently closed and was told:\n1. to improve distancing opportunities and road safety at popular exercise spots. to provide spacious alternatives\nSpaces for People Team on why Braid Road was closed.\n2. to paths and routes that are busy with pedestrians and cyclists to safely link together off-road walking and cycling routes\n3. to provide spaces for exercising that are safe from traffic.\n16-12-2020 Post\nLast week I reported that I had discovered that the Council had been running a consultation on the Braid Road closure but did not notify me or people in my Ward. This was because, technically, the closure is outside my Ward! Morningside Ward Councillors had been notified, and I only found out about it when one (Cllr Main) tweeted about it (see screenshot it the foot of this blog). The consultation closed last Tuesday, but I have asked for more time so people in my Ward can learn more about how the closure fits into the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route. The Council have agreed that the consultation will reopen for people in my Ward up until 1700hrs on Wednesday 23rd December 2020 via spacesforpeople@edinburgh.gov.uk. Feel free to copy me into your response, and I will draft a combined submission.\nThe consultation text is below, and a map of the scheme is above.\nPersonally, I don’t think the case for using Covid Powers to close Braid Road has been made and that the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route can succeed without it. Whilst James Gillespie’s Primary School will certainly benefit from the quiet route, closing Braid Road simply forces more traffic past South Morningside Primary School.\nProposed Temporary Cycle Segregation – Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route\nPlease be advised that as part of overall emergency measures we are proposing to implement improvements to help pedestrians and cyclists travel safely while meeting physical distancing requirements.\nThis scheme proposes to create a safe cycling route between the south of the city and the city centre, as well as providing a safe way to walk and cycle to school for several primary schools and one high school. It also improves options for safe cycling to Astley Ainslie Hospital. To achieve this, modal filters (where the street is closed to vehicular traffic) are proposed at the following locations:\n- Canaan Lane north of the Astley Ainslie hospital access;\n- Whitehouse Loan immediately south of the junction with Strathearn Road;\n- Whitehouse Loan immediately south of the junction with Bruntsfield Crescent; and\n- Whitehouse Loan immediately north of the junction with Warrender Park Road.\nAll feedback will be reviewed and where possible the scheme will be further refined. Feedback will be summarised in an assessment feedback form which will be presented to the Council Incident Management Team for approval. Please note that we will be unable to respond to individual emails.\nIf the proposal is approved for implementation, publicity will then be undertaken so that local people are aware of the changes. A dedicated inbox will help us to manage any feedback around proposals – spacesforpeople@edinburgh.gov.uk\nThe introduction of, or changes to, any restrictions will be implemented under emergency delegated decision-making powers using a Temporary Traffic Regulation Order.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_02_16_trinity-academy-faqs/content_501.html": "https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=Q_n94HQVcIg\nBelow is a briefing I received on Trinity Academy from Council Officers.\nWhy are the schools aligned to the Wave 4 Schools Programme in the Capital Investment Programme report to Committee on 8 February 2018 not limited to those for which initial feasibility studies were carried out in relation to refurbishment or replacement?\nThe terms “Wave 3” and “Wave 4” are generic and applied by the Council to the significant investment programmes still required in the school estate after the PPP1 and PPP2 Programmes. These are not terms used across Scotland.\nA report to full Council in August 2015 identified 4 schools (Balerno High School, Liberton High School, Trinity Academy, Wester Hailes Education Centre) from 6 (the other two schools being Currie High School and Leith Academy) for which feasibility studies would be progressed to assess options for refurbishment or replacement of the schools if funding became available. At this time feasibility studies were not taken forward for Currie High School or Leith Academy as it was felt the other schools were higher priority.\nThe feasibility studies are complete and the Trinity study was expanded to include an assessment of the possibility for developing new sports facilities at Bangholm. There has not been any prioritisation carried out in terms of these four schools and no funding has been identified to date for any investment.\nSince the original committee decision and as a result of new information about the structural condition of Currie High School it was agreed at Education, Children and Families Committee in August 2017 that the strategic review of the school estate in the west and south west of Edinburgh would consider all the infrastructure requirements in these areas including Balerno, WHEC, Currie and the proposed new West Edinburgh High School. The new West Edinburgh High School is proposed as a long term requirement in the Local Development Plan Action Programme aligned to the expected population growth of the city. The actual requirements in west and south west Edinburgh will not be known until the current informal consultation and any necessary statutory consultations are completed as part of the ongoing strategic review.\nWhy is the new West Edinburgh School included – shouldn’t this be funded through Development Contributions?\nDeveloper contributions will be received for the new West Edinburgh School but these will not be sufficient to entirely fund a new high school. Due to our statutory education obligations this school will be required. As it cannot be fully funded by developers it is part of the Wave 4 programme.\nWhat it the latest situation with opportunities for government funding towards replacement and/or refurbishment of Trinity Academy?\nThe report to Finance and Resources Committee on 8 February identifies (in Appendix 2) investment in Trinity Academy as an unfunded priority within the Wave 4 Schools Programme. One of the main sources of funding for strategic investment in the school estate is the Scottish Government and while we anticipate another round of Scottish Government funding will be provided at present there has been no announcement of any new funding programme. To ensure we can respond to any requests for funding submissions we are progressing with the ongoing feasibility studies and strategic review consultations. In appendix 4 of the report, a recommendation is made for £25m to be allocated in the Capital Investment Programme for 2018/19 to 2022/23. This could be used as match funding for any future Scottish Government funding programme. The report also recommends that the proposed Capital Investment Programme is remitted for consideration to the Council budget meeting on 22 February 2018. The Scottish Government have indicated they want to work strategically with local authorities in relation to future investment in the school estate. There may well therefore be an opportunity for the Council to secure investment for different reasons including refurbishment and replacement projects such as Trinity or new schools partly required to meet the growth of the city such as the proposed new West Edinburgh High School.\nThere has been no prioritisation carried out in relation to all of the strategic investment requirements and Trinity Academy would be part of any prioritisation process.\nHow will any funding be distributed? Will a prioritisation process be carried out with projects being allocated funds in terms of need or would funds be shared among the projects on the list? Will Trinity’s share of any funding for Wave 4 be smaller if it is to be divided between 6 schools rather than 4?\nAs the criteria of any government funding programme is not yet know it is not possible to confirm exactly how funding would be distributed.

Indeed, I expect Ian Blackford MP will highlight how since 2013/14 the Tories have cut the Scottish Government’s revenue budget by 1.8%. What he won’t say, however, is that his party in Holyrood cut Edinburgh’s budget by 7.1% over the same period – that’s a whopping £226 per person in our Capital.\nAdmittedly, £226 is not a lot of money for Mr Blackford – he earns just under £50,000 per year from his two “second jobs” outside Westminster. Indeed, he even takes money from Westminster to pay a family member that works for him.\nWhilst Mr Blackford is protected, the impact on Edinburgh of these cuts is, however, there for everyone to see. Our streets are potholed. Our litter bins are overflowing. Our community centre opening hours are being cut. The latest insult is that we are being charged £25 to have our garden waste collected.\nIn the past week we have learned that the income of the richest 1% in Scotland has soared by 89% since 2010 and, under the Tories and the SNP, income inequality has widened.\nWhilst Blackford has every right to attack Tory austerity, his complicity in implementing SNP cuts in Scotland must be exposed. With the income of Scotland’s super rich soaring, his party’s income tax changes simply tinkered around the edges, putting only a penny on the rate for those earning over £150,000 per year.\nThe combined impact of SNP and Tory policy is cuts to public services and squeezed living standards for working class people in Scotland, with over 400,000 people in Scotland earning less than the living wage.\nOnly Labour is willing to take an argument to the country that says fighting inequality is in everyone’s interest. We will take action to end austerity, not simply blame others when we hold the powers to act.",

The point is that Scotland chooses not to, and the majority of Scots don’t want a second referendum on the issue.\nI’m quite proud to say that I was a key part of the grassroots campaign to keep Scotland in the UK. I spent some time looking at both sides of the argument before deciding that remaining in the UK was the best way of protecting jobs and services. I understood the many arguments made for and against Scotland leaving the UK, but the fact that there was no independent analysis that showed Scotland would be better off outside the UK spoke volumes to me. So much so that I campaigned right across Edinburgh to protect our hospitals, schools and universities.\nThis does not mean I don’t respect those who voted differently for their own reasons. I hope, however, that they also respect my position with equal measure.\nWell over two years since the 2014 referendum, politics in Scotland has not moved on. The political debate is dominated by “unionists” and “nationalists”, and most ordinary Scots are stuck in the middle. The threat of a second independence referendum hangs over Scotland and, despite Brexit, the economic benefits of independence are still unclear to most Scots.\nI now think it’s perhaps time to do what other countries do and focus our energy on fixing health and education. Indeed, Scotland already has the power to ensure we have the best education system in the world. Let’s focus on making that a reality, not reheating stale arguments from 2014.\nLet’s be defined as a country by our willingness to invest in our children’s future, not by a national obsession with constitutional arguments.",

Although I hope this decision is reversed, I have been quietly concerned about how the Council has been developing its plan for the site.\nSpecifically, I have been anxious about the lack of an opportunity for the community to have a voice (whilst a local MSP is claiming 700 homes are planned for the site!).\nIf we only build homes on the site, it will be a massive missed opportunity – I’d love to see one of the fantastic listed buildings converted to a hotel (that would bring jobs to the area and stimulate the local economy).\nWhatever we do, we must ensure infrastructure is in place to support the development (roads, schools, GPs, etc)\nI therefore last week wrote to the Chair of the Working Group overseeing the site making the points below.\nI am happy to report that I have now been promised a community consultation event before the end of the year.\nLet me be clear, however, just inviting Community Councils will not be enough.\nScott\n==+==\n1. Elements of the local community are showing significant interest in how the plans to manage the future of the Barracks are progressing and they want to be involved. I think, at the very least, we should now be thinking about how we update them – particularly on affordable housing and economic development opportunities (and the infrastructure needed to support it).\n2. Outside what is locally considered to be Dreghorn & Redford Barracks, there are large areas of MoD land – most notably woodland and housing. Can you clarify the future of these areas?\n3. Can notes/minutes from the July workshop that looked at the development opportunities/challenges be circulated? Were any elected members invited to contribute to the workshop?\n==+==",

From listed buildings to the remains of the mock battlefield created during World War One for training, they are part of what defines the wider area. When cycling to work, I regularly pass troops running en mass or see them in Tesco when shopping.\nIndeed, they were a welcome sight during the “Beast from the East” when they helped clear Colinton Primary School of snow, and they also ensured older people living in the area were warm and well provisioned.\nThe downside, however, is that too often they are used by Edinburgh’s nationalists to attack the “British State”. In his recent opinion article (02/10/18), Gordon MacDonald MSP rightly highlighted that the Public Accounts Committee earlier this year found that 20% of service family homes across the UK were lying empty. MacDonald demanded that “the MoD must ensure that they are making proper use of the homes they have at their disposal.” Citing the two Barracks in my Ward as an example, he claimed the MoD is “failing in this duty”.\nIf he had bothered to pick up the phone to the Barracks, he would quickly learn that any empty MoD residential properties in the area are being put on the market for rent.\nMacDonald rightly points out that many service men and women do have a tough time when they leave the armed forces and some end up homeless. The MoD does have a duty of care for these people – indeed, we all do. Given that housing falls firmly within the remit of the Scottish Government, however, I do wonder why MacDonald is so quiet about their record?\nPerhaps he knows that the year-on-year cuts to Edinburgh’s budget he has enthusiastically supported makes it harder for the Council help the well over 1000 people registered as homeless in Edinburgh?\nThere is, however, an opportunity for him to act. Although Dreghorn Barracks is safe, there is a chance Redford Barracks will close in 2022. Will he be demanding that the Scottish Government gives the Council the funding needed to invest in at least part of the site to both help solve the affordable housing crisis in the area, and also provide homes and employment for former service personnel?",

Long live the nationalist revolution!\nWe are assured that the SNP will “roll out” unspecified “innovative and transformative” policies and we can look forward to “new ideas and solutions” to the unspecified “challenges Scotland is facing now and will face in the years to come”. Forward, to the victory of nationalism!\nBetter still, Ms Denham tells us that the SNP will make “the world a better place for our children and young people to grow-up into” and we are told “nothing exemplifies this commitment more than the baby box.”\nOf course, there is nothing bad about the baby box – why shouldn’t every child get the same box of free stuff at birth rather than focusing scarce resources on those that need it most? Who cares if Nicola Sturgeon’s own poverty advisor called it a “gimmick”, that the project is hugely over-budget or that there are allegations of a lack of evaluation due to it being politically driven?\nSo why has Ash Denham used what cynics say is an over-budget politically driven gimmick as something that “exemplifies” the SNP’s commitment to young Scots? Perhaps because young people are starting to see the damage a decade of the SNP has done to their lives?\nMs Denham wants to talk about the “baby box generation”, but what about the generation of Scots that are being let down due to the damage the nationalists have done to education? What about the generation of young Scots, particularly single mums, that have been denied a place at college? What about those university students from the poorest households that had their grants cut by the SNP?\nThis betrayal is why young people are returning to Labour. They know we won’t cut school budgets or hold back the poorest, we’ll do all we can to ensure every young Scot can reach their full potential. They know that with the SNP they get mediocrity, and with Labour they get real change.\nThere’s a buzz amongst young people in our meetings and on the doorstep. They are seeing the Labour party as the radical party who will deliver real change, not gimmicks.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_01_21_scott-arthur-and-sheila-gilmore-for-labours-sec/content_48.html": "This short blog sets out why we want members to support us in our bid for election to our party’s Scottish Executive Committee (SEC) to represent the South Scotland and Lothian Regions. The ballot opens on Friday 28 January and closes on Friday 18 February, and you are being asked to elect two members to the SEC (one of which must be female).\nThe May 2022 Council elections will be a huge challenge for our party, but to make gains we must remain united and focus on taking our positive message to the electorate. We both feel that factionalism is a barrier to our party regaining trust in Scotland, so our approach on the SEC will always focus on unity.\nWe have both campaigned for the party and have played key parts in getting Ian Murray MP, Daniel Johnson MSP and several new Councillors elected. This has taught us that we must listen to voters and offer them a positive alternative to both the SNP and Tories. Voters want to understand what our priorities are, and we need to present them concisely.\nAlthough confidence in our UK and Scottish Leadership is growing, there is more to do. We are both fully committed to improving accountability and transparency within our party. Within that context, we make these four key pledges to you:\n- Where possible, we will consult members on key issues before the SEC meets.\n- If invited, we will attend your CLP meeting to listen to members.\n- We will each provide a written report to members after each SEC meeting.\n- We will expect the General Secretary to investigate any leaks to the media from the SEC.\nOur party needs to unite around the challenges today, not the divisions of yesterday. Voters will not forgive us if we indulge in infighting rather than having positive policies on the covid recovery, climate change and the housing crisis. We are committed to taking our party forward.\nA message from Sheila Gilmore\nI have experience at nearly all levels of the Party: Branch Secretary, CLP Chair, Election Agent, Councillor (1991-2007), and MP for Edinburgh East (2010 and 2015).\nI campaigned for devolution, and still feel there is much more we could achieve through it. The Party needs to be clear on our opposition to independence and develop a strong positive narrative on why we believe the people of Scotland benefit from remaining part of the UK.\nGood policy is important, but we need to turn that into action through electoral success. I am Campaign Co-ordinator for my constituency and was Campaign Manager for Daniel Johnson in May, when we increased the majority and vote share. In 2017 I was election agent for Ian Murray when we substantially increased the Labour vote. While every constituency is different, and one size doesn’t fit all, we need to learn from where we win, including in local councils.\nI support our current leadership team, but aim to be a ‘critical friend’ when it is needed. Leaders need constructive challenge. They need to hear what members are thinking and experiencing through active and well connected CLP representatives.\nAfter years of opposition both in the UK and Holyrood, and with smaller representation in Councils, we often struggle to get our voice heard and have limited resources. We need to find ways to stretch those resources further and make them work more effectively.\nMy enthusiasm and commitment to the Labour Party remains undimmed through all the ups and downs I have lived through. It is those qualities I would bring to the Scottish Executive.\nA message from Dr Scott Arthur\nWe are now on our third Scottish Leader and third General Secretary since I joined the SEC, but I’ve never seen it more united, and I am committed to it staying that way – unity is strength. I’m keen to stay on the SEC to give members a say, but also to help Anas and Jackie take our party forward. I support them fully, but I take very seriously my job to give members a voice.\nAdditionally, I believe in transparency within our party at all levels. This is why I, unlike many SEC members, issue a report to party members after each SEC meeting and have attended several CLPs. Recent reports are here: https://tinyurl.com/ScottsSECReports (case sensitive link).\nAs a proud Labour Councillor, I never miss an opportunity to remind the SEC that winning in Local Government is the first step to us winning in Holyrood. That is why I stood in 2017 for election as a Labour Councillor – my Ward forms part of a strong Labour foundation in the Lothians where Labour Councillors work effectively with Ian Murray MP and our MSPs (Sarah Boyack, Foysol Choudhury Daniel, Johnson & Martin Whitfield) to take our party forward.\nThe May 2022 Council elections are key for our party and the people in our communities that need Labour in power. If re-elected to the SEC, I’ll ensure our party puts everything it has into working with the Trade Unions to win as many Wards as possible, and the support those Councillors after the election. From there, we can start the campaign for Westminster and Holyrood.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_05_22_why-edinburgh-can-always-do-more-to-deal-with-littering-fly-tipping/content_548.html": "The Evening News must be congratulated for today raising the problems our Capital faces in relation to littering and fly-tipping. I’m lucky in my Ward as I have a few residents who set aside their time to pick up litter left by others. Their work helps ensure the area I represent remains the very best place in Edinburgh to live, work and bring up a family.\nAll of them are, however, frustrated by how the Council is finding it increasingly difficult to empty litter bins. Indeed, it is not uncommon for me to report two or three over flowing litter bins in a single day.\nAt last week’s Transport and Environment Committee, however, it became clear that matters may be about to get worse. In order to improve “efficiency”, it appears that bins in our parks and public spaces will be moved to entrances. In my own Ward, Friends of Fairmilehead Park are concerned that moving the litter bin away from the playpark area to the entrance may lead to more litter in the park. Many other parks will be in the same position.\nFly-tipping is another area where the Council could do more. Does anyone seriously think that the plan to charge for garden waste will not generate more fly-tipping?\nSimilarly, the Council currently charges £5 per item to uplift unwanted bulky things like sofas. This is a charge many hard-up households in my Ward simply can’t afford. Recently in Oxgangs I worked with the Council to have bulky items uplifted for free over a two day period. This was a huge success, and will be repeated. Nonetheless, between these events many in my ward must struggle to find the £5 needed to have items uplifted.\nSo whilst fly-tipping and littering is unacceptable, the Council can always do more to help manage it.",

Local residents and the school community worked together to raise awareness of the risks they felt the development posed.\nA total of 376 representations were lodged with regard to the planning application, of which 374 were OBJECTIONS, including those from Tollcross Community Council, the Gilmore Place and Lochrin Residents’ Association, local residents, school parents and boat owners.\nBefore his committee unanimously rejected the application, Edinburgh’s Planning Convener was clear:\n“We went on a site visit and I didn’t appreciate that the front door of Boroughmuir High School is onto the canal – I assumed it was onto Fountainbridge. I can see how vital this space is to the school. Active schools is a big consideration and this is an opportunity for the school to use that space.”\nThis was a great example of Edinburgh’s Councillors listening to the public and taking a stand against over-tourism – in short, it was democracy in action. As Kevin Stewart MSP put it during the progress of the Planning Bill:\n“…developers don’t elect councillors, communities do elect councillors, and they’re the ones who take democratic decisions”.\nSo why is the development now going ahead? Simple – the developer side-stepped local government and successfully appealed to Kevin Stewart’s Scottish Government.\nThis is unfair. It’s not unfair that the developer appealed, but it is unfair that local communities also do not have a similar right where they oppose a planning decision.\nAs part of the debate surround the Planning Bill, there was a move by the Greens, Lib-Dems and Labour to introduce “Third Party Right of Appeal”. This would have given community groups limited powers to appeal bad planning decisions. However, Kevin Stewart MSP rejected this as the SNP and Conservatives pushed through the legislation. Either the SNP or Conservatives could have turned the vote and empowered communities by joining the Greens, Lib-Dems and Labour, but chose not to. Indeed, when supporting the SNP legislation the Conservative spokesperson Graham Simpson MSP declared:\n“I commend this Tory-style bill to the chamber.”\nThe ramifications of this don’t stop with the Boatels. In my Ward I have developers sniffing around the Green Belt and the Redford Barracks site. They know that if their plans are rejected they have the right to appeal. If their plans are accepted, however, the local community has no right to appeal irrespective of how damaging the plans are.\nAs the Scottish Wildlife Trust put it:\n“…the current planning system is unfairly weighted in favour of the developer. Several measures are needed to create a balanced, democratic system that defends our right to enjoy a healthy natural environment.”\nHolyrood had a chance to change this, but instead decided to let developers retain the upper hand.",

This scheme has matched over 3,400 young people with jobs, apprenticeships and training opportunities with 550 employers since it started.\nOne of those companies is Leonardo. Formally known as Ferranti, Leonardo employs approximately 1,800 people in Edinburgh who specialise in “the provision of multi-role surveillance radars and countermeasure systems”. This includes radar for the Typhoon, Norway’s all-weather search and rescue helicopters, the US Coast Guard and for Saab’s Gripen Fighter aircraft.\nWithout any justification, it was alleged in Full Council yesterday that Leonardo had been “condemned” (it was not said by who) for its role in the Yemen War and arms deals with Turkey. It was also suggested, again without any evidence, that Leonardo may not be providing the “right environment needed” to develop skills and “promote the wellbeing” of its employees. The suggestion was that the Council should review Leonardo to ensure if behaved in an “ethical manner”, and consider preventing people working with them via the Edinburgh Guarantee. Indeed, in summing up his debate Councillor Alex Staniforth (Craigentinny / Duddingston Ward) used the word “evil” four times in one minute.\nI accept that nations have a right to defend themselves, and that governments have a duty to stop weapons falling into the wrong hands, or being used in illegal wars. I was left wondering, however, what the aim of the discussion in Full Council was.\nWe know that the Scottish Government provides assistance to arms manufacturers (including those involved in the Yemen), but no concerns were raised about that. We know that Leonardo is a key part of the Edinburgh economy, but no concerns were raised about that. We know that the UK Government sets export controls and licensing for military and dual-use items (not the Council!), but no concerns were raised about that. Indeed, no link was made between Leonardo’s Edinburgh operation, the Edinburgh Guarantee and the awful conflict in the Yemen.\nI would have backed the call if the review was to look at the wellbeing of staff in all the Edinburgh Guarantee employers, but that was blocked. Although I respect and understand the concerns people may have about companies like Leonardo, I fully expect they are a good employer who care about the wellbeing of their staff and how their products are used.\nIt was notable that many of those who backed the calls for Leonardo to be reviewed (including Councillor Alex Staniforth) are members of parties who backed Holyrood budgets which gave millions of pounds to arms manufacturers. Perhaps blocking that should come before limiting the career choices of young people? Or if the Council thinks Leonardo is not welcome in Edinburgh, perhaps it should just say so?",

Both government and private companies are essential to this, and we must have a dedicated focus to tackle this challenge head on.\nAs part of pulling the draft Bill together, I have engaged with charities that represent many rare cancers. I have also spent time engaging with the APPG for Brain Tumours, Dame Siobhain McDonagh and the Glioblastoma campaign she leads, and survivors of rare cancers.\nThis is to ensure that those impacted and most intimately involved in this area have been able to direct the Bill towards a finished product that will have the greatest impact for the community’s they represent.\nThe Bill sets out to 1) provide a structure for accountability and delivery, 2) trigger a review of drug regulations for rare and less common diseases, 3) make clinical trial databases more useful for researchers.\nI hope you will join me in supporting the Bill and if you have any questions, then please reach out to me, my office or one of the many charities who represent the rare cancer community who will be happy to help.\nThe Bill Aims\nThe aim of the Bill is to incentivise research and investment into the treatment of rare cancers.\nIt will achieve this by:\n- Placing a duty on the Government to further support research and innovation for rare cancers.\n- Placing a duty on the Government to review the Orphan Drug Regulations, with respect to rare cancer patients.\n- Ensuring that patients can be easily contacted about relevant research and clinical trials.\nRare Cancers Bill Background\nA Bill to make provision to incentivise research and investment into the treatment of rare types of cancer; and for connected purposes.\nKey statistics\n- 47% of cancers diagnosed in the UK are rare and less common cancers and 55% of deaths from cancer are rare and less common.\n- 180,000 people will be diagnosed with a rare and less common cancer and more than 92,000 people will die from a rare or less common cancer.\n- Despite overall cancer survival rates rising by nearly 10 per cent between 2005 and 2020, rare cancers account for many of the lowest rates of survival, with some having a 1-year survival rate of less than 50 per cent.\n- Five of the six less survivable cancers are considered rare, and between 2002 and 2014 the less survivable cancers received a fraction, only16.6%, of research funding of the more survivable cancers.\nLegislative proposals\nLegislate to appoint named person responsible for the delivery of rare cancer research.\nTo ensure there is adequate oversight of research delivery for rare cancers, by appointing a named person in each nation to provide leadership and advice for the delivery of rare cancer research.\nThis would provide a structure for greater accountability and provide a more strategic approach for the delivery of rare cancer research across organisations.\nLegislating to ensure patient data from national cancer registries across the UK is shared with the ‘Be Part of Research’ Registry.\nTo make it easier for patients with rare cancers to be contacted about relevant research and clinical trials, by ensuring that data from each of the national cancer registries in each nation is provided, in an opt-out process, to ‘Be Part of Research’ (BPoR).\nMandating that the ‘Be Part of Research’ registry must establish a tailored service for rare cancers.\nTo ensure patients can be easily contacted about research, including clinical trials, by creating a bespoke contact registry service for patients with rare cancers and the public as well as improving access to the patient population for researchers.\nReview of Orphan Drug Regulations.\nTo place a duty on the Government to assess whether these regulations are continuing to effectively incentivise the development of drugs for rare conditions (‘orphan drugs’) with severe patient impact and high unmet clinical need.\nOrphan drugs are commonly approved to treat other diseases, but there is little financial incentive for companies to trial their drugs for the treatment of rare diseases.

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_01_12_some-thoughts-on-the-snps-2018-19-budget-allocation-for-edinburgh/content_303.html": "Context\nIn the build-up to the SNP Government’s 2018/19 budget statement Daniel Johnson MSP published an article in the Evening News which explained how since 2013 the SNP Government had taken over £400m out of local government finances despite having received a broadly flat settlement from the UK Government over the same period.\nIndeed, we know that between 2013-14 and 2017-18, the local government Revenue Budget fell by 6.9%, whereas the Scottish Government Revenue Budget fell by only 1.6%.\nThis is why our roads are potholed, why bins go uncollected and why Edinburgh has a huge building maintenance backlog. Indeed, the situation in Edinburgh is worse than elsewhere. Our Capital now has the most poorly-funded budget, £1443 per person, 25% less than other Scottish cities. It represents a cut double that of the Scottish average since 2013.\nPast Cuts\nWe must remember that the Council has for the last few years already reduced staff (by about 1600), pared back on many services and restrained costs by contracting with companies who have poorer wages and conditions than the Council. In addition to this, a substantial amount of Council owned property has been sold. With each passing year demand for services is rising and it is getting harder to accommodate the cuts.\nScottish Government Settlement\nThe UK Government’s budget had three key impacts for the SNP Government. Firstly the Tories, after lobbying from Scottish Labour, agreed to end the anomaly created by the SNP whereby the emergency services in Scotland had to pay VAT – this is a £40m benefit.\nThe budget saw marginal increases in revenue allocations over the next three years of £347m, but once inflation is accounted for this is a real-terms cut. This is the money we use to run existing services.\nThe capital spending allocation, the money we use for building things, is more complex. A welcome £2.1b extra was allocated over the next 3 years. The SNP Government points out that £1.1b comes with restrictions – it is Barnett money that rises from the UK Government’s “Help to Buy” scheme, and in the past the SNP has tended use it to support similar schemes or commercial property development.\nEdinburgh’s Preparation\nIn the build up to the SNP Government’s budget, the Council had been briefed to expect a cut of £30m (even if we increased Council Tax by 3%) and planned on that basis. There were essentially two parts to this. Approximately £10m cuts from 2017/18 which had previously been consulted on (but were paused for a year), plus £20m of new proposals. Reducing library hours (a 2017/18 proposal) was discussed alongside plans ranging from charging for garden waste collection to cutting home to school transport (2018/19 proposals).\nEdinburgh’s Settlement\nWhen Derek McKay’s budget was published, however, the cut was less than we had been warned – but is still a huge £12.2m. He did, however maintain the trend of cutting Edinburgh more than the national average – 5% more to be precise (1.7% compared to 1.6%). Nonetheless, COSLA say Councils need a 5.7% rise just to maintain the status quo (3% for inflation and 2.7% for rising demand).\nEdinburgh has the highest levels of homelessness and housing need in Scotland. This settlement does not recognise our city’s needs, nor does it assist the Council to address these serious issues at scale and with urgency.\nHowever, it is not as simple as selecting £12.2 of services on the list of £30m that went out to consultation. The budget came with a big catch – unfunded pay rises (£2.2m). We will essentially have to make cuts to fully fund this.\nIn addition to this, we need to consider setting aside money to start dealing with the huge building maintenance backlog (£9m), inflationary pressures on rent (£1m) and we need more funding to meet rising demand for social care (£2m has been suggested, but this won’t solve the problems we currently face). This means that even with reluctantly increasing Council Tax by 3% and without accounting for rising demand in services, the budget blackhole could be even higher if we choose to accommodate these demands.\nIn addition to this, we’ll have to anticipate the results of the consultations on South West Schools, support for Gaelic Medium Education and the pressures on funding support for children with additional support needs.\nNext Steps\nCouncil Officers and Labour Councillors now have to think about how we can deliver our manifesto commitments whilst also making these cuts. Finding services and activities to cut will not be easy, but we will soon have the consultation reports from the 2018/19 proposals to offer some context.\nOf course, this is just a draft budget and the SNP is a minority government. The days of the SNP doing deals with the Tories have passed, so we can now expect the nationalists to seek support from the Lib-Dems, Greens or perhaps even Labour if they are to set a budget.\nTribalism in the SNP ranks means that they are unlikely to do a deal with Labour. In any event, Richard Leonard is unlikely to accept SNP tax policy without significant change. We can’t cut Council budgets to fund tax cuts for people earning £50k.\nThe Greens and Lib-Dems, however, may be willing to tinker and seek more funding to help protect local services. This won’t deliver the real change for the many that we need, but it may be enough to the reduce the impact of the SNP’s attack on our Capital.\nNext Year’s budget.\nThe Scottish Government have only given Edinburgh a budget for one year, so it is difficult for the City to draw up a longer-term plan. However, we can expect the cuts to continue and demands for services to rise (the population is increasing and living longer!). Increasingly, services which are not mandatory will come under huge pressure but these services are hardly a luxury. They include school uniform grants, holiday support for children with special needs, breakfast clubs and community centres. Nonetheless, the Tories had a motion passed which asked the Council to “make clear what the Council is spending on non-statutory services”.",

He then declined to say much more on the subject.\nIndeed, when pushed on the issue by the Evening News’s Euan McGory all he would say about the cuts he has planned for education was “you’re asking me to confirm each budget line but I don’t think that’s helpful at this stage”.\nThe cat was, however, let out the bag at the Finance and Resources Committee the next day. The SNP Finance Convener, Alasdair Rankin, point blank refused to rule out any of the education cuts reported by the Evening News and was even unwilling to say any were “ill-informed”. Worse than that, he said he would not be “entirely ruling them” out and the Council “inevitably faces hard choices”.\nCouncillors Rankin and McVey know that as education takes up around 40% of the Council’s budget, it can’t avoid the cuts unless they are amplified elsewhere.\nAs stark as the funding crisis is, we should not accept that the cuts are inevitable.\nWe know that in the 5 years since 2013-14 funding for day-to-day council spending from the SNP Government has decreased by 7.1% but the UK Government only cut the Scottish Government’s revenue budget by 1.8%.\nIt’s time that the Scottish Government’s attacks on council funding ended – that’s the only way to protect education in Edinburgh. Rather than making vague assertions on social media, our capital’s Councillors should all be standing up for Edinburgh.",

This is a tax of around 1% on larger hotels to help the City to deal with the cuts being imposed by the SNP/Tory Governments – it would raise £10m-£20m per year.\nThe key argument against the Hotel Tax is that it would discourage tourists from visiting Edinburgh as an extra £1.50 on a £150 room would simply be too much. The Edinburgh Hotels Association suggest that it would send the message that tourists are “only welcome in Edinburgh at a premium”.\nLo and behold today in the Evening News (report, 2nd January 2018) we find that hotel prices soared by 344% in the week running up to Hogmanay, with average prices hitting £260! Whilst the Edinburgh Hotels Association has much to say about paying a modest levy to improve our Capital for tourists and residents alike, they appear remarkably quiet when it comes to profiteering.\nAlthough there are many great opportunities, let’s not forget that the tourism industry in Edinburgh offers some of the worst conditions and pay. I spoke to a young worker on a zero hours contract who was earning just £7.05 per hour over the festive period, and on one occasion had her shift cancelled via a text message whilst on the bus to work. This is outrageous.\nThe Edinburgh Hotels Association’s vision for Edinburgh becomes clear when they raise the UK’s position in the World Economic Forum’s “Price Competitiveness Index” – we are 135 out of 136 countries. Forget the fact that the UK is 5th for overall Travel & Tourism Competitiveness, they want to focus on price (not quality) – this is a league table topped by Iran and Yemen, with the only western European nations in the top 100 being Portugal (72) and Luxembourg (96). The UK is in the bottom 20 beside France, Ireland and many other European nations.\nMy advice to the Edinburgh Hotels Association would be to set their sights higher, make the industry more competitive by rewarding staff better, and work with the City to make it more attractive to tourists.",

Yes, I know he’s not perfect but I think he is the candidate most able to unite the party in Scotland.\nWhilst Richard Leonard is untested in elected office, Anas Sarwar brings experience from both Westminster and Holyrood. He’s used his intellect, humour and campaigning zeal to take the SNP’s management of our NHS to the top of the political agenda in Scotland. Where has Richard Leonard been in that time?\nLet’s face it, Richard Leonard is only standing as Neil Findlay and Alex Rowley wouldn’t. He’s Plan C right now, but has huge potential if he is able to prove himself in Holyrood. Like Monica Lennon and Daniel Johnson, he’s a potential star of the future but now is not his time. He needs to build his public profile.\nBeing a member of the SEC has given me fresh insight into how disruptive a minority in the CfS and the like can be. I fear that if Richard Leonard wins, it will simply embolden these “hotheads” and divide the party. I’d rather be fighting the Tories and SNP than comrades. Of course, this does not mean all CfS members are a problem – far from it. Cllr Gordon Munro is a proud CfS member, and he has been a great mentor to me in the Edinburgh City Chambers. The fact remains, however, that some CfS members and the like don’t care about the damage they do to our party and are quite happy to feed ammunition to the enemies of our movement.\nThis destructive infighting breaks my heart. That’s why I think we need a leader that can hold the party together, not one that owes a debt to a particular faction.\nSo I’m backing Anas as he will take the fight to the Nationalists (both blue and yellow) whilst uniting the party behind the progressive platform created by Jeremy Corbyn and Kezia Dugdale. I’m backing Anas as he’s our best bet of having a government for the many in Scotland.\nThis decision is not about right v left, it’s about leadership, unity and government.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_11_25_briefing-the-limited-powers-scottish-councils-have-to-deal-with-5g-masts/content_97.html": "Below is a briefing from City of Edinburgh Council on the limited powers given to it by the Scottish Government to deal with applications to erect 5G masts. I found out the hard way that residents have very little say, so I thought it was worth sharing the briefing!\nIntroduction\nThis note outlines the main legislative requirements for both telecommunications operators and the planning authority when assessing the installation or replacement of ground-based telecommunications masts across the city. This note does not address the installation or replacement of other types of telecommunications equipment.\nTelecommunications providers have been tasked with updating infrastructure across Scotland in order to meet the aims of the Scottish Government’s 5G Strategy for Scotland. The Strategy seeks to ensure that the economic and social benefits of 5G connectivity are fully realised in order to make the country more productive and efficient while playing an important role in the transition to a zero-carbon economy and tackling the climate emergency through reduced emissions. The rollout of 5G in the coming years in connection with these aims is expected to result in a significant increase in telecommunication development in the city.\nThe specific technical infrastructure required for 5G means that sharing is not always possible. While some existing 3G/4G services are provided by existing towers or behind church louvres, the size and weight of 5G infrastructure means that it can often be impractical or impossible to accommodate such infrastructure alongside existing antennas needed for 3G/4G.Therefore, it is often more practicable to install 5G equipment at new sites.\n5G internet is a new technology which does not transmit as far as previous mobile broadband and does not pass through physical barriers with the same efficiency. As a densely populated urban area, Edinburgh also faces the challenge of a substantial increase in demand which will require a significant increase in network capacity. The result of these pressures is that there is a need to build new infrastructure in urban areas directly where the demand will be greatest. Service operators are required to meet government targets for coverage of 5G through license agreements issued by Ofcom.\nLegislative Background\n- Class 67 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Order 1992 (as amended) grants permitted development rights to electronic communications operators to undertake certain development without the need for a planning application. The order is applicable only to Scotland. Separate regulations are in place for telecommunications development in England and Wales.\n- These permitted development rights are usually exercised through two different processes, Prior Notification and Prior Approval, depending on whether the proposed development involves the installation of a new mast or the replacement of an existing mast.\n- Not all new electronic communications development can be undertaken through permitted development rights. Some development requires full planning permission. The extensive exceptions to permitted development rights are set out within Class 67.\n- The flow charts on the following two pages provide a basic guide to what type of groundbased masts fall under Prior Approval or Prior Notification, and what the two processes involve. These charts should be read carefully in conjunction with the detailed supporting information on the subsequent page.\nPlanning Process for Ground Based Masts\nNew Ground Based Masts\nPlanning permission is automatically required for any new ground-based masts which are greater than 30 metres in height or exceeds 2 metres in width at its widest point. Planning permission is automatically required for any new ground-based mast within:\n- National Scenic Area,\n- National Park,\n- conservation area,\n- European site,\n- world heritage site,\n- historic garden or designed landscape,\n- scheduled monument,\n- the setting of a category A listed building, ▪ a site of special scientific interest; or ▪ a historic battlefield.\n(hereinafter collectively referred in this Note as “Heritage Assets”)\nPrior approval Process\n- For new masts which are less than 30 metres in height and are not located in one of the above areas, operators must apply to the planning authority to determine whether PRIOR APPROVAL is required in respect of the appearance and siting of the mast. It is important to note that prior approval is different from planning permission.\n- The planning authority has 56 days from the date on which a valid application is received to give the developer their decision as to whether their approval is required, and where it is required, to give the developer a decision on whether or not it is granted. If the planning authority doesn’t respond within 56 days, the works can begin.\n- On receipt of a valid application, the planning authority is required to notify all neighbouring residents within 20 metres of the application site that an application for prior approval has been submitted.\n- Individuals who are notified about an application for prior approval only have 14 days to make comments. This is shorter than the 21 days normally allowed for planning applications.\n- The planning authority can consult with other bodies such as the roads authority and airport if necessary, before making a decision.\n- If the planning authority determines that prior approval is not required, the mast is permitted development.\nIf the planning authority determines that prior approval is required and refuse prior approval, the operator may appeal to the Directorate for Planning and Environmental Appeals (DPEA) if they wish to proceed with the development. If an appeal is submitted, a reporter will then decide whether to uphold the refusal or approve siting and appearance of the mast.\nReplacing Existing Ground Based Masts\nFor works which involve altering or replacing* an existing ground-based mast (including within Heritage Assets), operators must give written notice to the planning authority of their intention to carry out the development at least 28 days before it commences. This is known as PRIOR NOTIFICATION.\n- Operators will generally email the planning authority directly notifying that the mast alteration or replacement will be taking place.\n- On receipt of prior notification of specified works the Planning Authority must make a factual assessment of whether the described works meet the Class 67 requirements on width, height and location of just requiring prior notification, not planning permission.\n- For existing masts which do not exceed 30 metres in height, any replacement mast can be extended by up to 50% of the height of the existing mast. (Example, a 16 metre high mast can be replaced by a 24 metre high mast).\n- For existing masts which exceed 30 metres in height, any replacement mast can be up to 50 metres high.\n- For existing masts above 50 metres, any replacement mast can be increased by up to 20% of the height of the existing mast. (Example, a 55 metre high mast can be replaced by a 66 metre high mast).\n- Replacement’ masts must not be sited more than six metres from the location of the original mast.\n- If the planning authority determines that the works described in the prior notification do not constitute permitted development, it will contact the operator and advise them that planning permission is required.\n- There is no requirement under the planning acts to undertake any neighbour notification when dealing with a prior notification. Neighbouring residents cannot make comments on prior notifications\n- There is no requirement under the planning acts to keep a public register of prior notifications.\n- It is important to note that any complaints relating to replacement masts must be addressed to OFCOM as the regulatory body.\nEmergency Powers\n- Operators have permitted development rights to use land in an emergency* for no longer than 18 months to station and operate moveable telecommunications apparatus which is needed to replace unserviceable apparatus.\n- Operators are required to give notice to the planning authority that they intend to site equipment on land as soon as possible on or after the emergency arises, providing a description and plan of the development\n*An ‘emergency’ is defined as an event or situation which threatens serious damage to human welfare in a place in the United Kingdom.\nHealth Related Issues\n- Many individuals raise concerns about the potential health implications of masts from emission of radiofrequency fields. It is important to note that in accordance with Scottish Planning Policy (SPP), health implications are not a material consideration and cannot be taken into account by the planning authority when a planning application or an application for prior approval is submitted to the planning authority.\n- Notwithstanding the above, all telecommunications development which involves the installation of one or more antennas (including antennas situated within masts), must be accompanied by an ICNIRP declaration. An ICNIRP declaration is a declaration by the developer that the antenna is designed to be in full compliance with requirements of the radio frequency public exposure guidelines of the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection which places limits on the exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields.\nCompetition & Need\n- Planning authorities are not expected to question the need for a service or to prevent competition between operators.\n- It is not for the Council, as planning authority, to question the technical information relating to the requirements for a mast or the site selection process.\nDelegation\nSimplified planning controls including decisions relating to permitted development and the requisite Prior Approval Process are delegated to the Chief Planning Officer. Planning applications relating to telecommunications development are subject to the Council’s Scheme of Delegation under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.\nPre-Application Discussions\nThere is no requirement for pre-application or pre-prior approval discussions. Given the need to meet Government targets in relation to coverage, previous experience and practice has highlighted that applications would be made contrary to advice because of these targets.\nLinks\n- Planning Circular 2/2015: non-domestic permitted development rights\n- Scottish Government – 5G Strategy",

Yes, after lots of chuntering about the need for new powers, the SNP dithered and failed to use them.\nThe impact of this is clear to anyone living in Edinburgh. This year we’ve had an epidemic of weeds on our footpaths, systematic problems with refuse collections and most recently we’ve been struggling to repair street lights.\nIn my own Ward I was recently invited to attend a meeting of Braidburn School’s Parent Council. Braidburn School is a fantastic facility at the heart of my Ward which offers a positive learning environment for pupils aged 3 to 18 years with additional support needs.\nAt this meeting, which was quite emotional at times, I learned that the holiday activities previously offered to children attending the school had been cut by a third. The budget has been largely protected, but costs and demand are rising.\nThese children are literally among the most vulnerable in Edinburgh and the holiday activities are a lifeline for parents who are statistically more liable to suffer everything from relationship break-down to mental health problems.\nI was ashamed that Scotland’s capital was letting these children down. It is an example, however, of how the most vulnerable people in society are paying the price for the combined actions of the UK and Scottish Governments.\nI have since raised the issue with Councillors Perry and Dickie (Education Convener & Vice-Convener respectively), as well as with Council Officers. All care just as much as I do about this service, but the budget squeeze means that they must work within current resources and that means reducing the support available to children with additional support needs. This should shame us all.\nIndeed, this is a non-statutory service so if the current level of cuts continue it will come under huge pressure.\nSoon Derek Mackay MSP will be setting Edinburgh’s 2018/19 budget. Let’s hope that rather than making “marginal” changes, this time he and Nicola Sturgeon think of the children at Braidburn School and enact real change. Real change for the many.",

The snow covered streets provided me with a brief respite, but the state of the roads in my Ward is utterly depressing. Indeed, some appear to have grown under the blanket of snow to such an extent that fitting a manhole cover to them may be easier than patching them.\nIt is important to remember, however, that the problem goes far beyond our roads. This week I received a letter from Cameron, a partially sighted pupil at Braidburn School who uses a wheelchair. He asked me to “please fix the pavement” adjacent to a pedestrian crossing he uses as there is a risk he could fall out of his chair.\nOf course, there is nothing special about Cameron’s experience, you don’t have to be in a wheelchair or be partially sighted to have a problem with our pavements. Indeed, when I went along to have a look at the section of footpath Cameron reported I wasn’t surprised to see the source of the problem was a substandard reinstatement undertaken after a utility repair.\nAll too often utility repairs are not undertaken properly and eventually cause us problems. That’s why the Council must keep on top of utility companies to ensure repairs are done to the right standard.\nThis is where Brian Monteith and I part company. He thinks I’m “utterly wrong” to say that a significant factor contributing to the problem is cuts imposed by the SNP Government. Whereas I agree with Audit Scotland when they reported that road maintenance and inspection funding is around 14% lower than the minimum acceptable. Indeed, I think most people in Edinburgh will agree that potholes have multiplied over the past 10 years irrespective of which Political Party has been running our Capital.\nThe problem we face is that cuts to Edinburgh’s budget over the past 10 years mean that protecting services such as education and social care leads to the road maintenance budget being cut disproportionately.\nYes, Edinburgh must spend its transport funding as efficiently as possible by adopting new methods, materials and technologies. However, let’s not pretend Edinburgh can keep on doing more with less.",

He could have outlined the extent to which his party has been cutting Edinburgh’s budget year-on-year. He could have detailed how the reorganisation of Police Scotland in Edinburgh resulted in a house breaking epidemic. He could even have spoken about how his party want to take Edinburgh’s schools, some of which are the very best in Scotland, out of the control of local democracy.\nOne can only guess why he did not what to talk about this.\nInstead, he opted to question the “Scottishness” of his political opponents in an effort to further divide families, friendships and workplaces with the worst kind of nationalist rhetoric.\nWell I’ve got news for Mr Ross, I’m proud to be Scottish, I work every day to make Scotland a better place and I’m standing as Scottish Labour’s candidate in Colinton-Fairmilehead (Edinburgh).

Instead, they want to hear my positive vision for their community.\nThe truth is though that it’s not my birthplace that Mr Ross really has issue with. It’s the fact that I believe that Scotland remaining in the UK is the best way to ensure every Scot has the chance to reach their full potential.\nI fully understand that Mr Ross has a right to disagree with me.

If the city continues to grow, Edinburgh needs to think how people, goods and services can move around efficiently. Additionally, we have to think about the growing numbers of people commuting into Edinburgh, and how we deal with the climate emergency and air pollution.\nKey to solving all these issues is “modal shift” – getting a greater proportion of people using more sustainable modes of transport. Paramount to this is investing in public transport, but we also have to ensure new developments are better connected to shops etc.\nThe Council’s “City Mobility Plan” sets out how this could be done. This plan sets out what’s needed to deliver a more sustainable, integrated, efficient, safe and inclusive transport system over the next decade.\nThis plan is, however, largely unfunded – the report describes the funding situation as “challenging”. Let me be clear, the Council will need funding from the Scot Gov to deliver this vision.\nA second concern I have is the detail of what the Council hopes to achieve. Normally, SMART objectives (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Bound) are the starting point for any plan. Councillors are being asked, however, to agree the City Mobility Plan without any targets for modal shift in place. We are being told “mode share targets will be set out in a Technical Note to support the monitoring of this Plan”.\nThe plan is not perfect and will evolve in response to funding and other pressures, but it is a good starting point those of us who want people, goods and services to be able to move around our capital efficiently and sustainably.\nPeople will oppose this plan, but they need to explain how they’d solve Edinburgh’s future transport problems.",

The first is the mullet haircut and the second is the belief that simply adding capacity to a road network will relieve congestion. Whilst Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP may have a fine hairstyle, his views on transportation are firmly stuck in the 1980s (report, 11-09-17).\nWhilst the delays on the Queensferry Crossing are frustrating, adding capacity substantially beyond that provided by the Forth Road Bridge is not the solution. Doing so simply moves the bottleneck closer to Edinburgh. We’d have longer queues on St Johns Road and Queensferry Road – key arterial routes cutting through Mr Cole-Hamilton’s constituency that are already overloaded and have significant air quality problems.\nThese problems notwithstanding, experience and the theory of induced demand tells us that simply increasing capacity will generate more traffic, more congestion and more air pollution.\nFurthermore, suggesting taking buses off the bridge will solve the problem shows he’s missing the point. It is not buses that are the problem, it’s the lack of viable alternatives to using a car.\nWe should be thinking about how we can make bus and train travel across the Firth of Forth better, quicker and cheaper. Where commuting by car is the only option, we should have real incentives for car sharing. This is the solution, not fueling the fire by providing more capacity for cars.\nWe need a regional transport policy which has people at its heart, not the motor car. That should be about better public transport in and around our Capital, better cycle routes across the city and safer walking routes in our communities. This is a choice between uniting the Edinburgh City Region with a sustainable travel network, or dividing communities with congested roads.\nIf we can build a £1.35bn bridge, we can design a sustainable transport policy fit for Scotland’s Capital. However, we can’t do that using ideas discredited in the 1980s.",

Out with the City Centre, town centres serve as a focal point for local communities providing a diverse mix of shopping facilities and other commercial and community services.\nOn 18 June the Scottish Government confirmed that, from 29 June, shops with outdoor entrances can reopen. To support this positive change, we are proposing an initial phase of measures targeted to quickly address some of the most pressing issues that people and businesses have told us about. These relate to the narrowness of pavements and street clutter which cause difficulties in achieving safe physical distancing.\nIn this first phase of proposals we aim to create additional space on routes within Morningside and Bruntsfield town centres by widening footways, removing guardrails and street clutter. To widen footways we need to suspend all parking places (apart from loading bays and Disabled persons’ parking places). The streets being considered for these proposals are illustrated in the attached map.\nThe second phase of proposals, which we will share in the coming weeks, will focus on more strategic and complex measures relating to traffic reduction and aiding cycling and public transport provision. Proposals will also align, where possible, with further announcements around the opening of food and drink establishments. We will continue to work with business representatives and individual businesses on how measures can best support town centres as part of the city’s economic recovery. It is essential that the needs of residents and businesses are taken into account as we progress measures benefitting the health, wellbeing and prosperity of the city and region.\nThe proposed measures are part of an overall emergency requirement to re-designate key parts of the road network to facilitate safe travel while meeting physical distancing requirements. Such measures are required urgently to help prevent people from becoming ill or coming to harm by infection from COVID-19 whilst implementing physical distancing requirements.\nThese measures will be implemented under emergency delegated decision-making powers using a Temporary Traffic Regulation Order.\nGiven the urgent nature of these works, normal expectations about community consultations cannot be fulfilled. We urge you to get in touch within five working days or earlier should you want to raise any issues. If you do not have any concerns it would be beneficial if you could also email to let us know. This means we will have responses from all stakeholders and this helps to inform the process.\nPlease note that the deadline for submitting comments is 5.00pm on Friday 26 June 2020.\nIf the proposal is agreed for implementation, formal publicity will then be undertaken so that local people are aware of the changes. A dedicated inbox will help us to manage any feedback around proposals.\nAll comments will be reviewed and summarised in the assessment feedback note to the Council Incident Management Team. Please note that we will not be able to respond to individual emails.",

This frees up valuable footpath space, making it easier and safer for those with mobility problems, buggies and young children to get around.\nThe policy does, however, come with exemptions. Inexplicably, one is the Council’s own on-street advertising structures. One of the others is the Edinburgh Fringe Festival (other festivals are not mentioned), on them the policy says:\nThe Festival represents an extraordinary period in the city’s events calendar, and as an\ninternationally recognised event, it brings with it thousands of visitors which provide\na significant boost to Edinburgh’s economy. Having regard to this, there has been a\nlong-standing acceptance that many of the restrictions that are in place throughout\nthe rest of the year are relaxed. Notwithstanding this, the Council continues to work\nclosely with signage and event organisers and reviews infrastructure each year to ensure it meets with public safety requirements and respects particularly sensitive\nsites.\nThis morning I spotted online that some of the on-street advertising structures promoting Edinburgh Fringe Festival acts did not (in my opinion) meet “with public safety requirements”… or at least common sense (images above). In response, I promptly e-mailed senior people in both the Council and the Fringe Society.\nTwelve hours later I have not had a reply from the Senior Council Officer yet, but the prompt reply I received from the Fringe Society was an education for me:\nThe Outdoor Advertising Scheme promoting acts on the Fringe is not managed by the Fringe Society, it is managed by Out of Hand (OoH) who are contracted by the City of Edinburgh Council. Each site is clearly labelled with a reference and contact details for reporting any issues (highlighted in your first image) which are always dealt with promptly. The Fishmarket Close example you have given was as a result of overnight vandalism and had already been picked up by a daily check made of all sites by Out of Hand, before the complaint came in, and was in the process of being fixed.\nAnd also:\nIn addition to the Outdoor Advertising, and as part of the contract, OoH facilitate an anti-littering campaign for CEC and do an extensive clear up operation of flyposting, chewing gum, etc. from an agreed perimeter around each Fringe advertising site which makes a considerable difference to the cleanliness of the city and 99% all materials produced are recycled at the end of the Fringe (the other 1% is taken home by companies).\nOf course I had to apologise, but I simply did not expect the Council to be responsible for this.

If the decline we have witnessed nationally is to be reversed, we must all take seriously our responsibility to ensure all children can reach their full potential.\nWithin that context, we must remember that the best schools are partnerships between inspirational teachers, motivated children, engaged parents and a supportive community. The building simply facilitates learning, it is the other elements that make it happen.\nThis is why the crisis facing Currie Community High School is so concerning. This school is one of the best in our Capital because of its place at the heart of the community it serves. People are right to be concerned about moving the school and dividing the community.\nWe must take the news that the school building has structural problems seriously, but we must also be careful that they are addressed without harming the life chances of current and future pupils. Personally, I remain to be convinced that the entire building needs to be demolished and replaced elsewhere.\nI also share the concerns of my constituents about the unexpected nature and complexity of the proposals launched by the Council’s Education department. As a local Councillor, I was only told about the consultation after the school’s Parent Council.\nI’m also concerned that no educational impact study has yet been undertaken (this will happen if the proposals reach the next stage) and that my constituents without children at the school were not directly notified. Indeed, I have constituents living next to one of the potential sites who found out about the proposals via the Evening News.\nDespite these problems, the current consultation is really just the first step in the process and I have been assured no decisions have been made yet. I would strongly urge all interested residents to take time to read the proposals and submit their comments before the 9th of February: www.edinburgh.gov.uk/schoolsreview\nAddendum: the consultation has been extended up to the 29th of March.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2023_09_18_edinburgh-eis-on-a-workplace-parking-levy-at-edinburgh-schools/content_183.html": "Last week SNP, Green & Lib Dem Councillors agreed to progress to consult on the introduction of a Wordplace Parking Levy. This was despite some predictable concerns raised by myself in response to an integrated impact assessment published by the Council. Failure to consult on robust mitigation options to deal with (1) displacement parking, (2) support for low paid workers & (3) shift workers will lead to the public opposing the plans and the collapse of the SNP/Green/Lib-Dem Coalition supporting the consultation. Opportunity, time and money will have been wasted.\nFrom Edinburgh EIS\nI am emailing with some comments on the Interim Integrated Impact Assessment that has been carried out in respect of the proposal to introduce a Workplace Parking Levy. In particular, I am very concerned that there is no reference at all to the impact on pupils of introducing such a levy – particularly the impact on pupils in schools in the most deprived parts of the city. The following are some key points that I feel are worthy of much greater consideration by your committee when both deciding on the detail of the forthcoming consultation, and on the final nature of any levy.\nPSAs/other support staff\nYou must be aware that there is a massive issue with both recruitment and retention of our vital Pupil Support Assistants. These people do absolutely crucial work in supporting pupils, especially pupils with additional support needs, yet are amongst the lowest paid workers in the council. We are already at the stage where headteachers in our special schools have had to consider sending classes home due to lack of sufficient PSAs to safely care for pupils, and where successful inclusion in our mainstream classes is not able to be delivered due to the shortage of PSAs. This is one of the major drivers in the surge in dysregulated behaviour in our classrooms that is of such concern. It is also a key barrier to schools being to close the poverty related attainment gap, and to enable pupils to overcome barriers to learning. Imposing a workplace parking levy on these staff is highly likely to make the current crisis far worse, and to have a major negative impact on pupils.\nGeographic issues\nThe IIA does not seem to consider that many schools are based in areas that are not well served by public transport – and this is particularly true for schools in areas with higher levels of deprivation. A workplace parking levy will be a major disincentive for people considering working in those schools – we already know that these schools struggle to retain experienced teachers, particularly in shortage subject areas, so introducing a levy is likely to mean that existing disparities will be exacerbated. It is already the case that supply teachers who rely on public transport will not go to schools in certain areas during the winter months, due to the length of the commute, safety considerations around waiting for buses in the dark etc. This, again, impacts on pupils, as the odds on them getting subject specialist supply teachers are reduced – a workplace parking levy that does not take account of this is likely to lead to greater inequality.\nThe cost of housing in Edinburgh is very high and many staff must move out to afford the size of property required for their family. Retention of experienced staff would become more challenging as they may find employment outwith the city in a local authority which does not expect them to pay a levy. The challenge for staff who live outside the city and need to travel in would be particularly acute for schools in areas that do not have a rich network of different transport options. Once again, it is pupils, and their families, that would suffer from the consequences of this.\nSafety considerations\nThe IIA states that female and LGBT school workers travelling by public transport would be at increased risk of experiencing hate crime. Many of our school staff are already the target of verbal and physical violence within schools, and there are already documented cases of them being subject to abuse and attack on the way to and from work. Travelling on public transport would increase these experiences and lead to a rise in the already high number of cases of work related stress experienced in our schools, and in levels of absenteeism, with all the obvious impacts on pupils.\nOther issues\nYour IIA states that the majority of school workers are women at an age when many will have children in school or nursery provision. In order for children to be delivered and collected from different schools or child care establishments, workers must be able to travel quickly, and to a variety of places, not on direct bus routes, without the fear of their child being left before school starts or after the other children have gone. School workers who are parents of children with ASN, and who no longer have access to after-school provision in Edinburgh, must be able to pick their children up as quickly as possible to avoid anxiety or distress. This simply cannot be managed if travelling on public transport. At present, to travel by public transport would double commute times for school staff with the significant negative effect on their ability to perform their family roles and responsibilities, and on them being able to maintain a good work-life balance. Again, this is likely to lead to staff leaving, and moving to schools that do not present the same transport challenges, so that not only the staff but the pupils will suffer.\nMany school staff would refuse to pay a Work Place Levy simply because they couldn’t afford it. Instead, they will resort to parking on neighbouring residential streets around school building, which will create additional safety concerns for pupils and their families in these areas.\nThese are just a few points, and are obviously entirely focused on schools. I suspect similar considerations will apply for staff working in social work and other parts of the council. I note you will be carrying out a public consultation on the proposal soon, and I hope that this consultation will give scope to explore all the issues that introduction of this levy will raise.\nAs members of the Transport and Environment Committee, I trust you will scrutinise the questions carefully before it goes live, to ensure a high quality and open engagement process. You might well want to engage proactively with the unions to ensure that the full range of impacts of the levy are considered and that you do not find that there are unintended negative consequences from any decisions you take.",

I have never doubted which policies were most important to Labour Councillors in Edinburgh.\nAn Education system which helps everyone reach their full potential was a key part of our campaign in May and was at the core of our negotiations with the SNP to form an administration.\nIn Labour we know that SNP cuts mean we have fewer classroom assistants right across the country and we believe that is part of why education standards have been falling nationally under the Nationalists. That’s why we refused to do any deal with the SNP unless they committed to our plan to increase the number of classroom assistants.\nOf course, the SNP had their own “red lines” and one of them was expanding Gaelic education in Edinburgh.\nThese are just two of 52 commitments the SNP-led minority administration published this week. This is just the start however. We now must cost and prioritise them with input from other parties, and then covert them to measurable objectives within the context of a budget most people expect the SNP/Tory Governments to cut.\nFor example, how many more classroom assistant do we need? Should they be a greater priority than, say, expanding free school meal provision to holiday times or filling potholes?\nLet me be clear, all the commitments will be delivered, indeed the work is already underway in many cases. However, Edinburgh’s 63 Councillors must decide which are greater priorities.\nTo stimulate debate, I raised the hypothetical question of what should be the greatest educationpriority – expanding Gaelic Medium Education or tackling the attainment gap? This was because it’s a good illustration of the multi-dimensional conflicts we face. Yes, Scotland absolutely has a duty to protect the Gaelic language and culture. However, we must also consider the fact that only 10% of kids in Gaelic education come from deprived homes. The average in Edinburgh schools is over 20%, but many have well over 80%.\nI deliberately did not answer that question. However, I note that Councillor Perry (Labour and Education Convener) and Councillor Dickie (SNP and Education Vice-Convener) now have and they say closing the attainment gap is their “top priority” (report, 17/08/19).",

Outrageous!\nI have lived in Edinburgh since 1996 and it fills me with pride that it can attract people from around the world. Walking around our Capital’s streets, however, I also feel a little ashamed about what international visitors see. Our roads are potholed. Too often, our footpaths are grubby and the bins are overflowing.\nThis is not a criticism of the City of Edinburgh Council’s hardworking staff. Budgets have been cut year on year by the SNP Government.\nWorse than that, the SNP Government limits the ability of Edinburgh to raise revenues in the same way cities around the world are able to. Our SNP Government want independence, but give none to our Capital. Hypocrisy!\nLike Rome, New York, Vienna, Amsterdam and Paris, Edinburgh attracts tourist from around the world in droves. In 2014 3,795,000 tourists visited Edinburgh and stayed an average of 3.5 days – that’s 13 million overnight stays.\nUnlike Rome, New York, Vienna, Amsterdam and Paris, however, Edinburgh has no hotel tax. If you stay a night in a New York hotel, the city gains $15. Likewise, in Paris a night in its very best hotel sees that city gain a more modest €1.20.\nEdinburgh’s Labour Councillors are arguing for our Capital to be given the right to set a hotel tax and use the income to make the city a better place for tourists and residents alike.\nA night in an Edinburgh hotel costs from £10 to an eye-watering £1000, with most rooms falling within the £90 to £175 band. Taxing overnight stays in larger establishments at a modest 1% would not impact on the ability of Edinburgh to attract tourists, but would raise £10-20 million for the city.\nA modest tax on this industry would help reverse the cuts to services and help ensure Edinburgh continues to attract people from around the world to visit, study or work.",

Whilst there are parts of the plans we all have questions about, I don’t doubt that overall the scheme will have a positive impact.\nThere have been ongoing discussions at Colinton Community Council regarding the plans since May 2021. After the September CC I concluded that there were two key issues people focused on, and these related to additions sought by the Community Council (plan below):\n1. The proposed roundabout at the junction of Bridge Road and Spylaw Street; and,\n2. An additional pedestrian crossing or crossings on Bridge Road.\nBased on this, I asked to speak to Senior Council Officers. Whilst I do have robust discussions with Officers, I do have a duty to respect their professional judgment and Council policy (the Standards Commission may be interested if I did not).\nOn the roundabout, they were clear that it could not fit in the junction without major engineering works which would change the area significantly (the area where the phone box is sited would be lost). They were also clear that the area did not meet the criteria for an additional pedestrian crossing and the suggested locations may be too close to the junction. They also highlighted that there is a huge backlog in delivering pedestrian crossings (See: https://tinyurl.com/yc2r7hva), and that installing one would exceed the circa £100k budget allocated to the Bridge Road speed reduction scheme.\nIn summary, the Council Officers raised concerns about the technical feasibility of installing a roundabout and an additional crossing. Even if this approach was technically feasible, however, the considerable funding needed would have to be sought in competition with other road safety schemes.\nThey did, however, give a commitment to check speed through the area after their current proposals are implemented and established. They also explained that the pedestrian crossing assessment criteria would soon be updated by the Transport Scotland, and I was given a clear commitment that Bridge Road could be used to test any revised guidance.\nSo whilst I understand some people may be disappointed, I think it is positive that the speed reduction works on both Woodhall Road and Bridge Road can now proceed and help make Colinton safer. I don’t doubt that once work starts the Colinton Community Council will have a part to play in collecting feedback from residents regarding any issues which arise.",

The briefing from Council Officers below provides an overview of the process. Of course, the Council does adapt this process where needed to help people dealing with acute personal problems.\nIs it possible to get an annual figure for the past five years of the arrears owed to the council in terms of council tax?\n| Financial Year | Debt at end of Appropriate Financial year | Collection Rates % at Appropriate Financial year end | Current Historic Debt levels as @31 August 2017 broken down per year |\n| 2016/17 | £9,470,142.41 | 96.42% | £8,748,693.01 |\n| 2015/16 | £9,765,301.28 | 96.12% | £7,239,623.89 |\n| 2014/15 | £10,496,672.08 | 95.36% | £6,312,735.03 |\n| 2013/14 | £14,204,961.57 | 94.70% | £6,412,001.81 |\n| 2012/13 | £13,573,131.09 | 94.50% | £6,870,209.30 |\nThe Council is committed to maximising Council Tax collection and over the last 5 years the Council Tax collection rate has increased from 94.5% to a high of 96.42% achieved in 2016/17.\nTo support Council Tax collection a comprehensive recovery procedure is followed. This includes early reminders and customer engagement, where this is unsuccessful and, consistent with the Council Tax regulations, the Council uses a Sheriff Officer to support debt recovery, where appropriate to do so.\nThese co-ordinated actions result in the ongoing collection of historic debt. An example of the improvements made to historical debt collection is demonstrated by the 2012/13 year-end debt of £13.5M as at 31 March 2013, which has now reduced to £6.9M at 31 August 2017.\nIs it possible to get a figure of the arrears owed to the council in terms of rent?\nThe figure for current tenant rent arrears at end of the 2016/17 financial year, on 31 March 2017 was £6,068,503.93.\nIs there a separate figure for outstanding debt with payments arranged and those with payments not?\nThis information is available and can be provided for any future requests, if adequate notice is provided. On this occasion, however, due to the tight timescale to return this information to you we are unable to provide this for Council Tax collection in line with your required turnaround.\nFor Council Tax, we continue to work with customers to ensure that appropriate payment plans are in place. These are continually reviewed by the Council and the Sheriff Officers. The Council also works with the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) to ensure that appropriate deductions are made from benefit payments. These payments are means tested in line with national legislation.\nIn some instances, it is not possible to trace debtors however these continue to be reviewed on ongoing basis.\nHow does the council pursue arrears? Has the policy of collecting debt changed in the last five years? Does the council act quicker to recover the arrears than they did five years ago?\nCouncil Tax recovery procedures are set out in the Local Government Finance Act 1992 and the Council Tax (Administration & Enforcement) (Scotland) Regulations 1992; S1 1992, S129.\nOur recovery programme was revised in April 2013 and we now operate to best practice timescales in accordance with the relevant legislation. We are legally obliged to send all Council Taxpayers a reminder for any arrears outstanding. Providing the customer brings their account up to date within the allowed 14-day period and continues to pay their further instalments as detailed in their bill, then no further recovery action will be taken.\nIf a customer fails to pay the amount detailed in the reminder, a Summary Warrant is secured and the account passed to the Sheriff Officer for recovery.

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2023_09_03_have-your-say-greenbank-to-meadows-quiet-connection/content_101.html": "Background\nThe Council made changes on roads in Edinburgh during 2020 and 2021 as part of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic with the aim of creating more space and making it safer for walking, wheeling and cycling. Some of these remain controversial due to the way they were implemented.\nPerhaps the most controversial scheme was the closure of Braid Road (now reopened) and the related traffic restrictions on streets including Hermitage Gardens, Braid Avenue, Canaan Lane and Whitehouse Loan. The route is important as it is relatively well used by cyclists.\nIn September 2022, Councillors agreed to keep these changes for another 18 months using an Experimental Traffic Regulation Order (ETRO). This meant it could trial the measures over a longer period when traffic had returned to ‘normal’ levels. The design approved when the SNP/Greens won the vote to reopen Braid Road to two-way traffic has left virtually nobody feeling happy with the scheme – particularly the Braid Road/Braidburn Terrace junction.\nIn June 2023, Labour/LibDem/Tory Councillors won a second vote that means that the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Connection should have its own ETRO. We agreed that it must be reviewed in partnership with local residents. The Council will also improve wayfinding and the materials used throughout the scheme.\nThe Council have now developed options in partnership with Councillors representing Morningside and Fairmilehead to address feedback from residents while retaining a safe route for walking, wheeling and cycling. These options are now ready to be shared with the public, these focus on:\n1. Braid Estate\n2. Clinton Road and Whitehouse Loan\nThe Council now want to hear your views on the proposed amendments to help them identify a preferred option for further technical design work prior to the 18-month ETRO trial.\nIt is important to note that when this was last discussed in Council no party voted for the (re)closure of Braid Road or the complete removal of the quiet route. There is a broad acceptance that (1) we can’t repeat the awful impact closing Braid Road had on public transport on Comiston Road, that (2) cyclists passing through the area need to be protected and that (3) the way in which Braid Road had been reopened had not worked.\nHow to share your views\n- Online: (5th Sept – 22nd Oct): here\n- In person: Council Officers will also be at Morningside Library on 12 September from 1.30pm until 7pm to discuss the project. Pop in to have a chat about the proposed options.\n- Email: rurigdh.mcmeddes@edinburgh.gov.uk\nThe focus will be local residents, but everyone is welcome to contribute.",

The ballot opens on Friday 12 January and closes on Friday 9 February, and you are being asked to elect two members to the SEC (one of which must be female).\nThere can be no doubt that the next 3 years will be a huge challenge for our party. If all goes to plan, 2024 will see Keir Starmer elected as our Prime Minister and that will pave the way for Anas Sarwar having a real chance of becoming Scotland’s First Minster in 2026. To make gains we must remain united and focus on taking our positive message to the electorate. We both feel that factionalism is a barrier to our party regaining trust in Scotland, so our approach on the SEC over the past two years has always been focussed on unity.\nWe have both campaigned for the party and have played key parts in getting Ian Murray MP, Daniel Johnson MSP and several new Councillors elected. This has taught us that we must listen to voters and offer them a positive alternative to both the SNP and Tories. Voters want to understand what our priorities are, and we need to present them concisely.\nAlthough confidence in our UK and Scottish Leadership is growing, there is more to do if we are to consolidate this support.\nWe are both fully committed to improving accountability and transparency within our party. Within that context, we make these four key pledges to you:\n- Where possible, we will consult members on key issues before the SEC meets.\n- If invited, we will attend your CLP meeting to listen to members.\n- We will each provide a written report to members after each SEC meeting.\n- We will expect the General Secretary to investigate any leaks to the media from the SEC.\nWe will ensure our party remains focussed on the challenges of today, not the divisions of yesterday.\nA message from Sheila Gilmore\nI have experience at nearly all levels of the Party: Branch Secretary, CLP Chair, Election Agent, Councillor (1991-2007), and MP for Edinburgh East (2010 and 2015).\nGood policy is important, but we need to turn that into action through electoral success. I am Campaign Co-ordinator for my constituency , was Campaign Manager for Daniel Johnson in May 2021/when we increased the majority and vote share. We carried this into the 2022 council elections where we won an extra council seat and pushed our other candidates to first place in very closely fought contests, where 5 viable parties wee competing for 4 places. While every constituency is different, and one size doesn’t fit all, we need to learn from where we win, including in local councils.\nThe past two years have transformed our prospects. Under the leadership of Anas and Jackie we have now got to a position where Labour is seen as able to win . We need a steady leadership to ‘seal the deal’ with the voters and make sure current disillusion with the SNP translates to votes for Labour. Good organisation is crucial to this.\nMoving forward we also have to start planning for the 2026 Scottish Parliament elections, and that includes ensuring we encourage, grow and support a diverse range of candidates for this and for local councils. Our record is not as good as it could be, and I am keen to ensure that the SEC gives full support to the Scottish Women’s committee and to groups supporting other under represented groups .\nI campaigned for devolution, and still feel there is much more we could achieve through it. We need to start preparing practical policies for 2026, when hopefully we will be able to implement them. The Party needs to be clear on our opposition to independence and maintaining a strong positive narrative on why we believe the people of Scotland benefit from remaining part of the UK.\nI support our current leadership team, but aim to be a ‘critical friend’ when it is needed. Leaders need constructive challenge. They need to hear what members are thinking and experiencing through active and well connected CLP representatives.\nMy enthusiasm and commitment to the Labour Party remains undimmed through all the ups and downs I have lived through. It is those qualities I bring to the Scottish Executive.\nA message from Dr Scott Arthur\nWe are now on our third Scottish Leader and third General Secretary since I joined the SEC, but I’ve never seen it more united, and I am committed to it staying that way – unity is strength. I’m keen to stay on the SEC to give members a say, but also to support Keit and help Anas and Jackie take our party forward. I support them fully, but I take very seriously my job to give members a voice.\nAdditionally, I believe in transparency within our party at all levels. This is why I, unlike many SEC members, issue a reports to party members after SEC meetings and have attended several CLPs.\nAs a proud Labour Councillor, I never miss an opportunity to remind the SEC that winning in Local Government is the first step to us winning in Holyrood. That is why I stood in 2017 for election as a Labour Councillor – my Ward forms part of a strong Labour foundation in the Lothians where Labour Councillors work effectively with Ian Murray MP and our MSPs (Sarah Boyack, Foysol Choudhury, Daniel Johnson & Martin Whitfield) to take our party forward. If all does well, we will build from this base and take more seats from the SNP at the coming General Election. Indeed, I shall be standing against Joanna Cherry KC in Edinburgh South West,\nThe 2024 General Election will be a pivotal moment for our party, and the people in our communities that need Labour in power. If re-elected to the SEC, I’ll ensure our party puts everything it has into working with the Trade Unions to win as many seats as possible, and the support those MP after the election.

It is cynical acts like this that undermine the reputation of all Councillors.\nAs she well knows, all parties in Edinburgh supported my motion last year asking for the School Clothing Grant be increased after I noted that Edinburgh offers one of the lowest levels of support in Scotland – a fact that should shame us all.\nSince then, I have spoken to Council Officers about the work they are doing with “The Cost of the School Day” project. This goes beyond uniforms and encourages people to think about all of the costs associated with attending school, ranging from buses to snacks and trips. I’m hugely proud of how the schools, parents and children in my Ward have engaged with this. It has increased awareness of how child poverty is rising and lets people play a small part in fighting it.\nI anticipate the forthcoming city budget will contain a mention of the steps the Council is taking to tackle child poverty, and that this will include an increase to the School Clothing Grant. The biggest barrier to making real change here is, however, the budget settlement forced on Edinburgh by the Greens and the SNP.\nCllr Mary Campbell, a Green Councillor, was all too quick to call the settlement “good news”, but the 3.6% real terms cut she backed has made it impossible to increase the School Clothing Grant to the level I hoped for and that which the most deprived households need.\nThis is heart-breaking for me, but it is a tragedy for many low income families in Edinburgh who had hoped the council could do more to protect them. Cllr Mary Campbell should be ashamed of this rather than making cynical demands in the Evening News.",

I received this response when I asked the SfP Project Manager for a firm timeline:\nFollowing the Committee decision and amendment we have the following actions to progress:\n- Review proposed design options for south bound reopening of Braid Road and consideration of measures in the Cluny and Midmar area to mitigate the reintroduction of traffic. (Ongoing)\n- Continue dialogue with Lothian Buses regarding journey times on Comiston Road (last report 18/2/21 noting no current delays).\n- Arrange Stakeholders workshop to discuss and agree a design layout and appropriate local traffic mitigation options.\n- Seek final approval from our Corporate Incident Management team.\n- Rescind existing TTRO and draft up revised Temporary Traffic Regulation Notice (and subsequent Order).\n- Revise road layout(s) and reopen Braid Road.\nIn terms of a timeline we are reviewing our design options next week and expect to arrange the stakeholder workshop in the next couple of weeks. We should be able, resource permitting, to reopen Braid Road (in a southbound direction) before the end of March 2021.\nPrimary School Spaces for People Schemes – Bonaly, Buckstone and Pentland Primary Schools\nPeople living around these schools have received letters earlier this week saying these schemes will go ahead. I complained about this as the consultation reports had not yet been circulated. The reports are below.\nNote – The Pentland PS report says they did no receive any comments from me. In fact, I made this comment:\nI have only had a modest level of feedback on these plans from local people and the school community. The common theme from the responses is the lack of consideration given to the Oxgangs Bank entrance which is widely seen as the busiest point on the School. Can the SfP team work with residents and parents on this?\nIn terms of accessibility, many disabled people depend on cars (both to drive and as a passenger) and taxis. Road changes shouldn’t prevent disabled people from being able to stop near the school. Changes to usual travel patterns can add to anxiety for all of us, but to some disabled people in particular. The scheme should therefore be seen in this context – continual changes should therefore be avoided where possible, and should be effectively communicated to the public (including disabled people).",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_08_29_edinburgh-tram-extension-do-the-costs-outweigh-the-benefits_comment-page-1/content_294.html": "After years of debate, Edinburgh’s Councillors are being asked to consider a proposal to extend the city’s tram line (report, 29th Aug 2017). If we get this right, we will stimulate development and economic growth in some of Edinburgh’s most deprived areas by adding capacity to the transport network that connects them to central Edinburgh and the airport.\nLet’s be clear, the status quo is not an option if Edinburgh is to grow in a way that benefits everyone. The city needs to add capacity to its transport network in a way that is sustainable and for the many, not the few. We need a debate around this that focuses on people, not the old cars v trams debate the Tories offer. Consideration of active travel must be at the core of this debate, not just an afterthought.\nMy heart tells me that extending the tram line, if we avoid the problems of the past, can meet this need. Like many Councillors I have already studied the Business Case and asked many questions of the Council Officers in the “data room”. Many of my questions remain unanswered, however, so I will be demanding a response at the Transport & Environmental Committee next week before the vote.\nThe Tories are already making much of the project’s cost and the disruption it will cause. What they are quieter about is the fact that only a third of their number attended the data room, and some may only have made a fleeting appearance. Indeed, one of their number recently attacked the tram in an Evening News column without having even entered the data room.\nI would urge every Councillor and member of the public to put their prejudices aside, ask questions and consider the Business Case on its merits. With the Nationalist Government refusing to back the project as part of the City Deal (despite finding £120m for a roundabout we didn’t ask for), it will mean more debt for our city and increased pressure on bus fares. The question is: do the costs outweigh the benefits?",

This will be published on the Council’s website with specific details being communicated by Secondary Headteachers to parents thereafter.\nEach school is being prepared to ensure all measures required by Scottish Government are fully in place to meet the safety requirements for staff, children and young people.\nMore detailed information on the opening of schools is available in the Local Delivery Phasing Plan which is currently published and will be discussed at Policy and Sustainability Committee on Thursday 6 August 2020.",

However, the vague assertion regarding “affordable housing” in the article warrants further scrutiny.\nEdinburgh is facing a housing crisis. Our Capital has 1,609 households in temporary accommodation, too much of which is of a very poor standard. Indeed, I found out at a community council meeting last week that the situation is so desperate the Council is actually placing people in Travel Lodges across the city.\nSince Christmas two rough sleepers died on our streets and we know that in 2015/16 at least 18 homeless people died in Edinburgh. Worst of all, “affordable” houses are being built in Edinburgh which are simply not affordable to the people we rely on most – care workers, nurses and teachers. All of this should shame us.\nEvery time I hear the Council say they plan to build 20,000 affordable homes between 2017 and 2027 I ask myself who can actually afford them and will it help the 21,000 waiting on a council house in Edinburgh?\nIn 2016/17 just 283 of the 1176 (24%) affordable homes built were for social rent. The remainder of the affordable housing built were simply unaffordable for many people. It is either “mid-market rent” (for households earning up to £39k!) or “Low Cost Home Ownership” (this lets people with deposits of up to 75% buy new homes at a modest discount).\nLabour in Edinburgh has been pushing hard for more of the affordable housing built to be for social rent. We were disappointed that as part of the City Deal our Capital will get not one penny for council housing from the SNP Government and that they also cut funding for affordable housing by £3.2m. Nonetheless, we are winning the argument and hope to see the affordable social housing being built this year hit 430 and in 2020/21 we will build 1043 (see plot below). House-by-house, Labour in Edinburgh is tackling the housing crisis.",

The biggest and most intractable casework issue is housing – evidenced by almost 800 people applying for a single council house in my Ward recently.\nWhilst I have a constant stream of housing casework, other issues can be more seasonal. Without a doubt this time of year is when complaints about road and footpath condition peak. This year we went into winter with many roads and footpaths in a bad state, and the cold and wet weather results in further decline. Road and footpath condition is an issue which the council must, and is, taking seriously.\nHaving inherited a situation where road and footpath maintenance was underfunded in Edinburgh, the current Labour Council Administration allocated £11M of additional funding to the issue despite our capital being Scotland’s worst funded local authority. We are listening to the public, and will resurface whole streets rather than take a piecemeal approach. This means that 420,000m² of road and 170,000m² of pavement improvements will be carried out in 2023/24, compared to pre-Covid yearly averages of 225,000m² for roads and 30,000m² for pavements.\nIn addition to this, we are trialling a state-of-the-art “Pothole Killer” machine which helps automate repairs – so far, it has filled around 8,000m² of potholes.\nWe won’t get footpaths and roads back to where we want them to be in one year, but this investment will help halt the decline.\nIndeed, as part of the 2024/25 budget process I am working hard to get additional funding for roads and footpaths – Despite Edinburgh being Scotland’s worst funded local authority. We will invest wisely and prudently to improve the network. In January we agreed the city’s latest Transport Asset Management Programme which commits to prioritising projects to make the most efficient use of the funding available, as well as exploring new methods and treatments to maximise funds.\nIf you want to know more on this, you can listen to me here talking on Radio Scotland about the issue.\nOur offer for the 2024/24 budget:",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_01_23_briefing-note-braid-road-road-closure-spaces-for-people/content_395.html": "Below is a briefing on why Braid Road is opening to southbound vehicles. I’ve asked for this to be updated by the SfP team to respond to the following questions:\n- Is it not incorrect to suggest traffic on Braid Road is zero? It’s on my running route, and there are still a lot of vehicles using the southern end to access Braid Hills Drive. Certainly not 9,486, but I expect there are still thousands of vehicles per day using Braid Road either side of the closure.\n- Can the air quality results be explained? The LEZ proposed by the Council is based on the premise that fewer vehicles will result in improved air quality.\n- It is noted that Lothian Buses have expressed support for reopening the road southbound. Were they asked about reopening the route to northbound traffic? Can northbound bus transits time data also be shared?\n- Can it be confirmed who provided the “anecdotal” cycle use data for Braid Road?\n- No explanation or justification is given for the continued closure of Braid Road. I normally run through the Hermitage 2-3 times a week as part of a longer circuit, and normally see around 10-20 people between Braid Road and Kirk Brae – a distance of around 2.7km. Sunday mornings are busier (maybe 30-40 people), but there are no issues with social distancing at the Braid Rd entrance. Ironically, the inadequate footpath at the Kirk Brae end (see image below) actually causes more issues. Does this observation align with your data? If so, would a more proportionate response not be simply to widen the footpaths at both the Kirk Brae and Braid Road ends?\nBriefing on Braid Road\nIntroduction\nA section of Braid Road was closed to all traffic between the junction of Braidburn Terrace and the Braid Hills Hotel in May 2020 to provide safer pedestrian, cyclist and wheeling access to the Hermitage of Braid park.\nDuring the period of the closure the Spaces for People (SfP) team have on a regular basis considered the impact of the road closure on adjacent routes, the possible negative impact on air quality on Comiston Road and any delays experienced by Lothian Buses on the A702 routes.\nThis briefing note is intended to provide information gathered as part of the formal review process and make reference to the Review Recommendation to be considered at the Transport and Environment Committee on 28th January 2021.\nImpact on Traffic on Comiston Road\nTraffic Counts have been carried out on Comiston Road at the junction with Greenbank Crescent. These have been compared with baseline counts from 2018 and results are shown in the table below.\nTraffic on Comiston Road is currently around 9.5% higher than the pre-Covid baseline – around 17,000 vehicles per day, compared with 15,500 vehicles per day – the increase on the A702 corridor is far smaller than the amount of traffic previously recorded using Braid Road – 9,486 vehicles per day.\nThe overall level of traffic on these two corridors is significantly less than pre-Covid levels (approx. 32% less on these two routes). The general level of traffic which has returned to these corridors (68% of pre-Covid) is less than the general level across the city (80 – 90%), suggesting the closure has achieved a level of traffic reduction on this route. Though it is possible traffic has moved to other routes in the surrounding area.\nAir Quality\nConcerns have been raised regarding the impact of the Braid Road closure on air quality on the A702, especially on Comiston Road between Greenbank Crescent and Morningside Station. There are two diffusion tube monitoring stations in the area, one at South Morningside Primary School (116 Comiston Rd) and the other further north at the Canny Mans Pub (Morningside Rd). Results from June to October 2020 period, varied between 10-20μg/m3 of Nitrogen Dioxide, which is both lower than the previous year and significantly lower than EU legal limits. This is shown in the graph below.\nIt is worth noting that these are uncorrected monthly recordings. Normally annual measurements are used for comparison, however these will not be available until later in 2021.\nThe monthly measurements suggest the closure of Braid Road has not led to poorer air quality on the A702.\nBus Journeys on the A702\nThe Council has liaised closely with Lothian Buses on a regular basis to determine the impact of the Braid Road closure on A702 bus routes. Lothian Buses have noted that delays have been minimal since the week of August 10th however, in mid -December southbound delays increased as shown in the graph below.\nLothian Buses have noted that traffic routing through residential streets (Cluny Drive to Comiston Road etc) are feeding on to Comiston Road impacting journey times at peak times.\nLothian Buses have expressed support to re-open Braid Road to Southbound traffic to reduce the amount of traffic emerging on to the A702 from side roads between Morningside Station and Greenbank Crossroads. Alternatively, the introduction or additional measure to reduce through traffic from the residential roads between Cluny Drive and Comiston Road could be considered.\nLevel of Cycle use\nCycle counts were carried out on Braid Road shortly after the closure between Thursday 7 May and Wednesday 13 May 2020. During this time an average of 579 cycle journeys used Braid Road each day. Unfortunately, pre-lockdown counts are not available, however, anecdotal evidence suggests that cycle and pedestrian numbers are still significant, even during the winter period, compared to pre-lockdown levels. The most recent count was undertaken between Thursday 10th and Friday 11th December 2020, indicating an average of 168 cycle journeys on Braid Road each day.\nConclusion\nTraffic levels at Greenbank Crossroads remain fairly static at around 17,000vpd, and evidence suggests there has been no negative impact on Air Quality on the A702, southbound bus delays were recorded in mid-December 2020.\nJourney times will continue to be monitored in early 2021.\nThe country is now in a stricter lockdown period and traffic levels across the city have again fallen. Lothian Buses have advised journey times on the A702 routes have returned to normal. However, when the current lockdown eases we may see delays return as traffic levels increase.\nFinally, the recommendation offered to the Transport and Environment Committee is to reopen this route in a southbound direction to mitigate the negative impact of traffic and public transport delays and reduce the level of intrusive traffic using residential streets including Cluny Drive and Braid Crescent etc.\nIt is known that re-opening Braid Road would reintroduce additional traffic into the area. The volume of traffic returning to Braid Road would likely be greater than the corresponding decrease in traffic on Comiston Road. However, there is also a risk that as traffic across the city returns to normal, the level of traffic on Comiston Road will continue to grow in 2021, with likely negative outcomes for public transport journey times and air quality.\nAt the time of completing this briefing the decision to reopen Braid Road is still to be made, the final timing and layout of the proposed Braid Road reopening is still to be finalised.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_04_21_edinburghs-100-seat-buses-are-falling-short_comment-page-1/content_701.html": "Last November I had an article in the Evening News about the accessibility of Edinburgh’s new 100 seat buses. The key issue I raised was that, unlike much of Lothian Buses’ fleet, it was reported that these buses could not accommodate a buggy and wheelchair at the same time.\nFollowing this, I met with Richard Hall (Lothian Buses MD) in December at the formal launch of these buses. We discussed the many benefits of them, and I was assured that both a buggy and wheelchair could fit in the bus within a “shared space”, but mum/dad would have to sit across the aisle – not ideal, but a reasonable compromise.\nSince the buses became operational, however, I have been made aware of three key accessibility issues:\n- A buggy and wheelchair cannot fit in the shared space together (there is even a petition on this).\n- The luggage area is small, and many folded bugged don’t fit there.\n- The middle exit door does not lower to the same extent as the front doors on other buses.\nOn Thursday, I went over these points in a constructive discussion with Lothian Buses. I also discussed their use of second hand buses from London as these also can’t accommodate a buggy and wheelchair together. During the discussion we agreed on a great deal – particularly environmental credentials of these buses and the excellent service Lothian Buses provides. However, they were unwilling to give any ground on the accessibility of these buses. They still say that the 100 seat buses can take a buggy and wheelchair, but now qualify that to say not every buggy will fit.\nI made the point that the fundamental problem here is that Lothian Buses did not consult users as part of the design process for these buses. Although they don’t have to consult anyone, I think involving customers in the design of a service can only be a good thing. The Council actually has an “Active Travel Forum” which could have provided feedback. As good as these buses are, I think they could be better.\nSince 2016 the city has been planning for an additional 47,000 people by 2024, and an additional 102,000 by 2039, taking the total population from 492,610 to 594,712 over the 25-year period from 2014 to 2039. The question is how we accommodate this growth, and it can’t be done by expecting everyone to drive around our capital – public transport has to be attractive and accessible. We have one of the UK’s best bus services, but it needs to improve. It needs to be world class, but these buses don’t quite meet that standard.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_01_20_is-it-time-to-cut-police-funding-in-edinburgh/content_682.html": "The Community Cops in my Ward do a fantastic job – most recently dealing with a huge spike in house break-ins. However, it is the Scottish Government that should be funding them not the City of Edinburgh Council (report, 19/01/19).\nThe £2.6m the Council gives Police Scotland should be being spent on schools, social care, footpaths etc. Let’s face it, the scale of the cuts Edinburgh is facing right now at the hands of the SNP Government means that every penny counts.\nIndeed, although some have been critical of Edinburgh’s SNP Councillors for failing to oppose the cuts to our capitals’s budget, the proposal to slash £500,000 from the £2.6m top-up given to Police Scotland will result in the nationalists breaking their own 2017 Manifesto pledge:\n“We will provide £2.6m per year to Police Scotland to keep our communities safe. We will tackle crime and anti-social behaviour at its root by funding community police and school liaison officers to continue working hard to make our streets safe and secure”.\nBut why stop there, when all of the £2.6m could be used to protect our schools and and vulnerable people from these cuts? This is the decision Edinburgh is now faced with.\nMany other Councils stopped topping up Police Scotland’s funding some time ago, and it is perhaps time for Edinburgh to follow them and demand the Government lives up to its pledge to fully fund policing.\nIndeed, the Police Scotland spokesperson quoted in the Evening News recently was clear that Edinburgh’s Community Cops undertake “essential” work and “these officers are utilised to investigate a range of crimes that occur within our communities”. I am sure most people would agree that this is work that should be funded by the Scottish Government.\nThe reality is that despite the extra £2.6m the Council provides Police Scotland, Edinburgh is not exactly a crime free city. Indeed, the Evening News recently reported (11/01/19) that the EH4 postcode area was ranked fourth in a UK wide analysis of “housebreaking hotspots“, and EH15 was ninth.\nSo despite the concerns I have about the money Edinburgh gives Police Scotland, I am reluctant to see all of it cut overnight without assurances from Police Scotland and the Justice Minister that our capital will get the resources it needs. That must include an allowance for the extra police work that comes with being a capital city with many consulates and civic events.",

These will use libraries for short periods of time, including Colinton Library in my Ward. This is in addition to Oxgangs Library being used for Walk-In Testing.\nIntroduction\nThe Scottish Government invited all local authorities and health boards to submit funding bids to establish and run ‘mobile’ asymptomatic testing centres (ATC) as part of a targeted community testing programme.\nTheir purpose is to drive down Covid19 transmission rates by identifying people in the community who have the virus but have no (or very mild) symptoms and could be spreading it unknowingly.\nThis is a key element of the Government’s strategy for containing the virus as the country gradually opens up from lockdown and Edinburgh’s progress through the levels system is likely to require that sites are up and running.\nCouncil officers submitted a bid and agreement to fund the first six months of operation has now been received. This is likely to be renewed for the second half of the financial year at the same level.\nHow will the sites work?\nAreas of the city with stubbornly high infection rates will be targeted and detailed work is ongoing with NHS Lothian to monitor the trends in the data to plan future deployment.\nWe are looking at a variety of other data including hard-to-reach communities and groups who have been disproportionally impacted by the pandemic.\nIt is intended that two ATCs will operate in the city at one time, with each in place for around three weeks in total (one week set-up, one week open to the local community for walk-in tests and one week to take down).\nThe centres will operate from libraries, which have been chosen as being local and easily accessible venues across the city which communities are familiar with. Staff from Regulatory Services, Libraries and Culture are working jointly to bring together public health, venue management and local expertise so that the ATCs can be as welcoming and efficient as possible. ATCs will not be hosted within the same building as a Symptomatic Testing Centre. These facilities will be provided in separate locations.\nEvery possible step will be taken to minimise the period of time a library is required as an ATC. Arrangements will be made to promote the availability of alternative libraries and services which citizens could use during the period their local library is being used as a testing centre. No ATC will be hosted in a library building during the period when it is in use as a polling place during the Scottish Parliamentary elections.\nThe first ATC will officially open in Craigmillar Library from Wednesday 21 April to Sunday 2 May, with a soft launch on Monday 19 and Tuesday 20 April. The second ATC is scheduled to open to the public for testing at Wester Hailes Library in the next couple of weeks.\nDetails of the libraries currently considered to be suitable as ATCs are shown in the table at the end of this briefing.\nEach site will accommodate up to six testing booths providing up to 480 tests per day (based on an eight-hour opening period), meaning a daily total of up to 960.\nUp to 50 staff may be required and options including bringing back furloughed staff and recruiting fixed term contracts are being explored.\nCommunications will be carefully targeted to reach relevant communities, with messaging focusing on the benefits (to individuals, their families and the wider community) and offering reassurance around safety of testing and its environment. The project team has been in close dialogue with the trade unions in planning the ATCs and will continue to work with them as the community testing programme progresses, to make sure their members are fully informed.\nLibraries identified for potential ATC use: South Queensferry, Kirkliston, Currie, Drumbrae, Blackhall, Stockbridge, Wester Hailes, Colinton, Fountainbridge, Morningside, Central Library, McDonald Road, Gilmerton, Moredun, Piershill & Portobello.",

It comprises a range of practical and radical policies which are focussed on the problems our city and its residents are facing. With these policies enacted we will be in a good place to tackle the cost of living crises, rebuild the economy after the pandemic and respond to the Climate Emergency.\nOur key priorities are:\n- Investing in our services and in our communities.\n- Getting basic services back on track – everything from filling potholes to getting litter bins emptied.\n- Campaigning for Fair Funding for Edinburgh and fighting cuts in services.\n- Working to eradicate child poverty by 2030.\n- Tackling the Climate Emergency to reach the target of net zero emissions by 2030.\nThe manifesto is packed full of policies and ideas, but the key ones for me are:\n- Putting additional resources into increasing the frequency of street bin emptying and street cleaning services.\n- Stopping charging for bulk uplifts, and enforcing the toughest penalties for fly tipping and dog fouling.\n- Making provision of safe travel home for staff a condition of licensing in the night time economy.\n- Prioritising women’s safety on public transport and in public spaces.\n- Retaining and improving our network of public libraries and community centres.\n- Upgrading existing public toilets and increasing the number across the city, including in parks, all to meet accessible and changing room standards.\n- Delivering a programme to upgrade public parks and play facilities.\n- Providing additional funding for home adaptations in council homes, and lobbying the Scottish Government to provide more grants for private renters and home owners.\n- Increasing the number of qualified pupil support assistants to guarantee support for all nursery, primary and first and second year high school classes, and improve their pay and terms and conditions.\n- Working with the voluntary sector to ensure availability of good quality informal youth work provision that meets the needs and aspirations young people in their communities.\n- Establishing a new tourism body for the city that includes local community representatives as well as the tourist industry and councillors.\n- Introducing a presumption against using public spaces and parks for commercial purposes where there is not clear community support.\n- Making payment of the Real Living Wage a condition of any council contracts.\n- Starting a programme to build at least 25,000 council owned homes within 10 years, including enough accessible and larger family homes to meet need. We call on the Scottish Government to match fund the investment coming from tenants’ rents.\n- Requiring 35% of housing on development sites to be for council or housing association homes, with a target of 70% of these being for social rent.\n- Upgrade council homes to keep them warm and help reduce fuel bills, using organisations like the Edinburgh Solar Co-op and supply from renewable sources where possible. We will press the Scottish Government to match fund the investment being put in from rents.\n- Committing to making no more green belt land being allocated to development.\n- Press the Scottish Parliament to reform the planning system to give communities rights of appeal.\n- Increasing the pavement maintenance budget by 20%, increasing the active transport budget to 15% of the total transport budget.\n- Establishing a fast track repair service for dangerous pot holes.\n- Increasing the pedestrian crossing budget by 20%, and review timings to cut waiting time and ensure the less mobile have time to cross.\n- Reviewing winter gritting plans to ensure key walking routes to bus stops, schools, GP surgeries etc are prioritised.\n- Protecting and improving Edinburgh’s bus network. We will review all routes, oppose plans to remove bus stops and will invest in bus shelters. We will also ensure that all new buses provide space for both wheelchairs and buggies.\n- Committing to work in partnership with business and our neighbouring local authorities to find a solution to commuter parking, including improved public transport, park and ride schemes, restrictions on commuter street parking in residential areas, restricting parking spaces in new office developments and other measures to help meet our net zero carbon target.\n- Monitoring the introduction of low emission zones to ensure neighbouring areas are not affected by increased traffic and pollution.\nI hope that these commitments, and the others in the manifesto, will be at the heart of everything the city does over the next five years.",

This is really to solve two problems:\n- Lots of people have embraced healthier lifestyles – more walking, jogging and cycling. However, footpaths are often too congested for people to keep a safe distance from others when walking and many cyclists are finding the roads unsafe.\n- As the lockdown lifts, it appears unlikely (in the short term at least) that people will go back to using the bus as they did before. The Council therefore wants to make the city safer to walk and cycle.\nI have received some ideas from local residents for making travel around my Ward safer for everyone. In short, these focus on making residential areas safer and improving safety for cyclists on key arterial routs through (and into) my Ward. Before I speak to the Council about this, I wanted to give people a chance to rate the ideas and make further suggestions of their own via this survey.\nYou can find the survey here.",

Deaths and injuries should not be seen as inevitable. Since becoming a Councillor I have had to support three sets of parents in my Ward just after their children were hit by a car. All those hurt made a full physical recovery, but these were still heart-wrenching meetings.\nThere’s no doubt that some road users are more vulnerable than others – we know that over 100 pedestrians are hurt on our streets every year, and too many of these are children.\nIn 2018, we became Scotland’s first 20mph city, when 20mph speed limits were extended to cover 85% of Edinburgh’s streets. Independent academic research has shown that not only have speeds continued to fall across the network since then, but both road collisions and injuries have dropped by more than 30%.\nEnforcement, however, remains an issue so I was pleased to learn that problem streets in my Ward will be targeted for speed reduction measures. Experts in the Council’s Road Safety Team will soon be implementing interventions like signage or physical traffic calming measures targeted at improving the safety of the most vulnerable groups.\nEveryone in the city deserves to live on a safe street, and every child should have the right to walk or wheel to school safely. This is why I was pleased to see the Council has launched a consultation on extending the 20mph road network even further. You can take part here.\nIn my Ward, this will give residents the chance to approve the Council’s plans to reduce the speed limit to 20mph on Colinton Mains Drive, Swanston Road (south of bypass), Oxgangs Road North (Firrhill Roundabout to Colinton Mains Drive) & Bonaly Road (south of Bypass). Residents could also urge the Council to go further by including: Redford Road (all), Colinton Road (all), Gillespie Road, Dreghorn Link, Oxgangs Road & Frogston Road West. Residents could also suggest Biggar Road, Buckstone Terrace and Lanark Road.\nAs a driver, cyclist and pedestrian I recognise that extending the 20mph scheme will make our streets safer and reduce accidents. I understand the arguments against cutting the speed limit and other road safety measures, but those against making our streets safer should speak to the parents of children involved in accidents before responding to the consultation.",

This was kept from the public until the BBC reported it on Monday the 11th of May. I asked about the report on Tuesday and was told that the outbreak had been discussed in late February (this has now been retracted) and that Councillors on EIJB were told (they deny this). I was also led to understand the Council Leader was informed at the time, but it now transpires he was told “3 weeks after lockdown”.\nBriefing\nI agreed to provide the factual position with regard to the Reporting Scotland story regarding the Nike Conference last night from a City of Edinburgh Council perspective. In doing so I would flag that contact tracing of potential COVID-19 cases was conducted by the local Health Protection Team in NHS Lothian as per the existing process. Communication to Council Officers was via by the local Health Protection Team in NHS Lothian to our Environmental Health Service as per established infectious disease outbreak procedures. In terms of the facts:\n- The Nike Conference took place 26/27 Feb 2020.\n- Council EH teams were advised by local health protection team on 3 March that there was a ‘suspected case of COVID-19’ which was being investigated and that the Council would be updated when results were confirmed\n- There was then dialogue between the local Health Protection Team in NHS Lothian and our Environmental Health Service whilst results were awaited. On the 6 Mar 2020 the case was confirmed. At this stage the Exec Director and Chief Exec were advised\n- On 6 Mar Chief Exec spoke to NHS Lothian to seek reassurance that CEC will be kept fully informed of the development of cases\n- EH confirmed with HPT that no assistance was required with further contact tracing and given the time lapse and that there was no intervention needed at hotel (the virus is believed to exist in the environment for no more than 72 hours and therefore by the time CEC was first alerted this phase had passed)\n- NHS Lothian were following up with other Health Boards regarding the situation including further tracing if required. The NHS were managing this incident including what information could be shared.\nIt should be noted that the Council stood up the Council Incident Management Team on the 27th February to coordinate the Council’s response to the COIVD-19 crisis and I am confident that in this instance the Council responded in the appropriate manner.",

Whilst this is laudable, residents should not have to even consider doing this.\nFurthermore, based on complaints from people living in my Ward, I have worked with Council staff to have the whole of Buckstone treated alongside parts of Oxgangs and Colinton.\nDespite the need to tackle the problem as soon as possible, Councillor Lesley MacInnes (Chair of the Transport & Environment Committee) appears content to focus on having a robust plan for next year – all she is offering is “talks” with Council Officers and a chance to question them at the mid-August Transport & Environment Committee. Meanwhile the weeds grow under our feed.\nOf course, the underlying problem here is one that the SNP’s Councillor MacInnes does not want to address. Our capital is struggling to cope with weeds, potholes and overflowing bins because her party (together with their Green chums) in Holyrood voted to cut Edinburgh’s budget.\nWhilst she will probably solve the weed problem by robbing some other budget, the right thing to do would be to ask her Holyrood masters for the funding Edinburgh deserves.

I thought it would be useful to lay out the intended schedule of group briefings and opportunities to interrogate the FBC ahead of the decision date.\nThere are two key dates in our decision-making. These are the Transport & Environment Committee of 28th February, when we devote a large part of the agenda to discussion of the FBC. This will then by followed by Full Council deliberations on 14th March.\nAhead of this we wish to provide as many opportunities as possible for councillors to become familiar with the material and, equally, to ask questions of the Tram Team who have populated the FBC.\nGiven that this time of year is dominated by the Budget process and that we have no wish to cut across the time required by that process, we have created a timetable which also takes into account the demands of the February recess period.\nWe are proposing that the Data Room containing the FBC, which will be staffed by various members of the Tram Team to provide answers where required, should run on:\n- Thursday 7 Feb : 4 – 8pm (day of Full Council including evening hours)\n- Friday 8 Feb : 10 – 3 pm\n- Monday 11 Feb : 10 – 3 pm\n- Tuesday 12 Feb : 10 – 8 pm (including evening hours)\n- Wed 13 Feb : 10 – 3 pm\nWe appreciate that the last three dates occur during the recess and that may cause difficulties for some councillors.

Analysis from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has suggested the SNP’s plan to halve APD would save the top 20% of earners £73 per year whilst the poorest would save just £4 on average. In short, cutting APD will increase inequality.\nFurthermore, the SNP Government’s own analysis shows its plan to cut APD by 50% could result in up to an extra 60,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases reaching the atmosphere each year.\nBoth the Tories and the SNP claim that in the longer-term the move will boost the Scottish economy, but neither say how it will be funded in the short term. Will the £300m needed be taken from Education in a move that will further worsen inequality?\nPersonally, I’m have trouble understanding how cutting the cost of a holiday in Florida or Australia boosts the Scottish economy.\nWould it not be better to maintain APD at its current level and invest the money generated in projects which really do boost the economy? Would it not be better to focus cutting inequality rather than making it worse? Perhaps that and the environment should come before perks for Scotland’s middle class?",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_01_11_update-on-colinton-dells-closed-bridges/content_331.html": "January 2022\nColinton Dell Bridges Update – Due to “staff shortages” in the Bridges and Structures team, the Council have been unable to provide the necessary professional expertise to develop designs and contract specifications for the closed bridges in Colinton Dell. They have, however, recently secured the use of their engineering framework consultant (Mott Macdonald) and (after a site meeting in November) received confirmation they will be able to produce designs by February 2022. After the designs are assessed by the Council’s engineers and an Agreement in Principle (AIP) given, the bridges will be procured in April/May with the intention of delivery by October 2022.\nColinton Dell Landslip Update – The Council’s geotechnical consultant has completed all the necessary surveys and have put forward a design for the remedial work which will be required before the path can be reopened safely. The Council are now working on formalising an agreement with a local landowner as an aspect of the design requires for pins to be driven in the bed rock located behind their property boundary. The Council’s consultant is also preparing a bill of quantity for the work to go to tender. The Council will get a better idea of the timescale for the work to be undertaken once a successful contractor has been appointed.\nJanuary 2021\nBelow is a briefing from the Council on the closed bridges in Colinton Dell. The history and wildlife in Colinton Dell make it my favourite part of the Water of Leith Walkway. Generations of local people have used Colinton Dell to restore their wellbeing, but lockdown and the fantastic Colinton Tunnel Mural means that it is now more popular than ever. Whilst the costs of repairing the bridges and dealing with the landslip is not trivial, the Council really does have a responsibility to restore easy access to the area. I know Council officers are frustrated by the situation, but I feel ashamed telling residents that cuts mean the Council can’t do better. Indeed, I was bitterly disappointed that Sustrans blocked the use of Spaces for People funding as I feel this could be a “Spaces for Exercise” project which would be widely welcomed and come with no disruption.\nBriefing\nWith regard to the Pipeline bridge, colleagues in Structures are looking at this with a view to advise on potential options including, the possibility of building the path up and installing a shorter span bridge or a style over the pipe. We are also working with the Water of Leith Conservation Trust to investigate options for volunteer involvement which, if possible, may help to keep the costs down. However, the estimates I have been given suggest the cost is still going to be in region of £20,000. The Water of Leith Conservation Trust have also approached Scottish Water, who are undertaking work in the area, to ask if they would provide any funding to this community project. [Scott Arthur – I asked Scottish Water about this and they declined].\nWith regard to the wooden bridge over the river at Redhall Weir we are continuing to seek funding for this. Again, colleagues in Structures are investigating material options for this bridge however, my understanding is that we are still looking at a cost of over £40,000 and therefore considerable funding will be required.\nWe have investigated the possibility of obtaining funding through the Spaces for People (SfP) project for one or both of these bridges, unfortunately SfP funding is not available for this – Sustrans gave us the steer some time ago that these projects would not be eligible for this funding as they were neither temporary or immediate in nature. A more recent response from SfP when asked if there was ‘any merit in exploring whether we can access some of the SfP money currently being used to develop cycle provision on Lanark Road?’ stated:\n“I am afraid that, as this funding is part of the Spaces for People grant fund we are receiving from Sustrans, and advice they have previously given would still apply here. The current allocation we have against the Lanark Road scheme is fully committed to delivering the changes to Lanark Road and would not be able to cover any additions of this nature, especially at the amounts you have provided. An additional £60k would be approximately a 40% increase in the value of the Lanark Road scheme. While I can see that the Lanark Road Scheme, and these bridge repairs/replacements share some of the same rationale, and can certainly see the value in repairing the bridges in the context of Covid-19, I don’t think that the SfP budget would be able to support this. The only way this could change would be if Sustrans decided that these bridge improvements were eligible – however the SfP team would then need to consider whether they represented the best use of the council’s limited allocation of funds which is already fully accounted for, meaning that any use of SfP budget towards these bridges would likely require the removal of other schemes from the programme.”\nWith regard to the bridge closures in the Dells, we understand the importance of these routes to the local community however, we will not be able to progress works to re-open these bridges until we have secured the appropriate funding.\nThe steps to/from Dell Road are closed due to a landslip. We have appointed a geotechnical expert consultant to undertake a condition survey and report which will include options for proposed remedial works, including associated costs. This is the first step in understanding what will be required to stabilise the slope and reopen the path. We met with the Consultants, following their initial survey work, on 22nd October, we are now waiting on clarification regarding a few points and costed options for remedial works. We had hoped faster progress would have been made however, this has been hindered due to staff resources and sickness. We can only apologise for the delay and will get back to you with a fuller response in due course.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_11_19_services-in-edinburgh-are-being-cut-have-your-say/content_383.html": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmNuXUwHWss\nThe scale of the budget cuts facing Scotland’s capital were made clear in an e-mail that welcomed all of the Council staff to work last month. It outlined how over the past five years we’ve faced cuts amounting to £240m and over the next five years we’ll have to deal with a further £140m.\nDespite the problems facing education, social care and waste collection, these budgets will be further squeezed. Readers should ask themselves how we can hope to improve these key services by cutting their budget? How can we deliver the 7,000 hours of social care that goes undelivered in Edinburgh every week when the Council’s budget is being squeezed?\nWhilst as much as possible I have argued that we protect services used by the vulnerable,, these cuts have sacrificed non-statutory services to protect what we are legally obliged to deliver. Notwithstanding this, everything from waste collection to education is being cut.\nBe in no doubt, this is just the start. If continued, the Council will only provide basic statutory services and those who want something better will have to pay if they can afford to do so.\nEdinburgh residents have a chance to inform this debate by taking part in the Council Budget Engagement Process: goo.gl/Q4dmGP (case sensitive link).\nOne piece of non-statutory provision, however, will not be consulted on. Because policing in the capital is not adequately funded, the Council contributes around £2.6m per year to pay the salaries of well over 50 police officers of various ranks. So not only is Edinburgh dealing with its own funding crisis, it is also making up for the underfunding of Police Scotland.\nThe items up for discussion range from charging for garden waste collection (item 26) to increasing the ticket price for the Scott Monument (item 31). Make sure you have your say.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_03_04_cancer-centre-in-edinburghs-western-general-hospital-under-stress/content_43.html": "It is concerning to read that the cancer centre in Edinburgh’s Western General Hospital may soon not be able to meet the basic needs of patients unless the SNP Government agrees to meet its funding needs.\nMy aunt was treated there and, although cancer took her life in the end, the staff there did all they could to give her the best possible chance of winning her fight.\nAcross Scotland, however, we know cancer units are under huge pressure. Official data shows that most units fail to meet the target of treating 95% of patients with “urgent” problems within 62 days and that performance has been declining for years under the SNP. Indeed, one patient recently had to wait 176 days for “urgent” treatment. Every day must have felt like a lifetime.\nIn Scotland, even being diagnosed comes with its problems. Screening rates are falling, with those in the poorest areas far less likely to get screened. The shameful reality in Scotland is that you are less likely to get diagnosed and less likely to survive cancer if you come from a poorer background.\nWith around 100 people being diagnosed with cancer each day and 3.5% of the population living with the disease, we have to get on top of this problem if survival rates are to improve.\nHowever, NHS staff are already working flat out. It’s time for Shona Robison MSP, the SNP Health Secretary, to listen to those staff and give them the resources they need to tackle Scotland’s biggest killer.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_11_24_edinburgh-briefing-national-planning-framework-4-npf4_comment-page-1/content_118.html": "Below is a Council briefing in the Draft NPF4 – it is a “is a long-term plan for Scotland that sets out where development and infrastructure is needed”. The briefing considers the impact on Edinburgh.\nSummary\nOnce finally approved by the Scottish Parliament the NPF4 will be part of the statutory development plan. That approval is currently scheduled for Summer 2022.\nThe NPF draft has a very strong focus on the need for planning to address climate change impacts and many of the policy areas and considerations reflect what we have put forward in the proposed City Plan. If approved in this or a similar form, it will support many aspects of the plan at Examination.\nIn particular, West Edinburgh is no longer classified as a national development for office/business led development and the commentary on it supportive to the City Plan position. Granton is included as a national development and we will need to consider any procedural implications for this. There is support for brownfield development, higher densities, 20 minute neighbourhoods, public transport (including extending mass rapid transit/tram) and active travel, blue and green networks and on measures to reduce car use.\nThe following is not exhaustive, there will need to be further work including analysing the national policy measures. These are intended to be overarching so that future LDPs do not have to repeat those policies, so it is critical that we are sure those policies are strong enough and comprehensive enough to be effective in supporting LDPs and in making decisions on planning applications.\nWe also need to consider any content of the draft that City Plan does not address.\nOnce that work is complete we will bring a proposed response to the draft to Planning Committee in February.\nStructure\nThe NPF has 4 main sections:\n- Spatial Strategy\n- National Developments\n- National Planning Policy Handbook\n- Delivering our Spatial Strategy\nThere is also a section containing annexes of Outcomes Statement, Housing Numbers and Glossary.\nSpatial Strategy\nThis focuses on creating better places with 4 themes. The strategy sets out that to meet the national net zero target by 2045 significant progress must be made by 2030. It also emphasises the need to invest in nature based solutions to mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss.\nSustainable Places\nThe strategy is to transform the way we use our land and buildings so that every decision we make contributes to greater sustainability through encouraging low and zero carbon design and energy efficiency, reducing the need to travel unsustainably and diversifying and expanding renewable energy generation.\nLiveable Places\nThe strategy is to create places with good-quality homes close to local facilities and services by applying the concept of 20 minute neighbourhoods.\nProductive Places\nThe strategy is to build a wellbeing economy that benefits everyone and every place, with green investment as a key priority to tackle climate and nature crises. It also recognises the changing nature of the way we work and the need for flexibility to facilitate future business and employment that benefits communities and improves places.\nDistinctive Places\nThe strategy is that nature recovery and connected blue and green infrastructure must be at the heart of all future places along with design quality.\nSpatial Strategy Policy Principles\nThe policies to deliver this placemaking are based on 6 overarching principles.\nCompact growth\nLimiting urban expansion where brownfield, vacant and derelict land can be used more efficiently. This will safeguard land to provide the services and resources we will need in the future, including carbon storage, flood risk management, green infrastructure and biodiversity. By increasing the density of settlements we will reduce the need to travel unsustainably and strengthen local living.\nLocal living\nWe will create networks of 20 minute neighbourhoods to support local liveability, reduce the need to travel unsustainably, promote and facilitate walking and cycling, improve access to services, decentralise energy networks and build local circular economies. As an integral part of this, cleaner, safer and greener places and improved open spaces will build resilience and provide wider benefits for people, health and biodiversity, in a balanced way. Virtual connectivity and active travel links will also be important.\nBalanced development\nWe want to support development across Scotland so people have more choice about where they live, learn and work. This will create opportunities for communities in areas of decline, and manage development more sustainably in areas of high demand. In particular, we wish to enable more people to live and remain in rural and island areas, and to actively transform areas of past decline so that we can make best use of our assets.\nConserving and recycling assets\nScotland has many strengths and each place should be planned in a way that works with its distinctive character and identity. We will protect and enhance the assets of each of our places, leaving a positive legacy for future generations. Our focus is on making productive use of existing buildings, places, infrastructure and services, locking in embedded carbon and minimising waste, and supporting Scotland’s transition to a circular economy. This includes nationally significant sites for investment which are well served by existing infrastructure and sustainable travel modes, and excellent propositions for redevelopment across urban and rural Scotland and the islands.\nUrban and rural synergy\nScotland’s urban and rural and island areas, and all of the places in between, can work together and share learning and innovation to achieve better places. Our strategy is for Scotland as a whole, bringing together the contributions of our cities, towns, villages and countryside areas to achieve shared objectives. As part of this, we will improve green infrastructure to bring nature into our towns and cities, connecting people with nature, building resilience and helping our biodiversity to recover and flourish.\nJust transition\nMeeting our climate ambition will require a rapid transformation across all sectors of our economy and society. We must ensure that, as we reduce our emissions and respond to a changing climate, that journey is fair and creates a better future for everyone – regardless of where they live, what they do, and who they are. The pandemic has demonstrated the capacity of our communities to work together and find their own local solutions to shared challenges. Our strategy builds on this, to ensure local people are more able to shape their places and transition to net zero and environmentally sustainable ways of living.\nSpatial Strategy Areas for Action\nThe strategy considers 5 areas for action, Edinburgh is within the Central Urban Transformation Area – Transforming and pioneering a new era of low carbon urban living. This area broadly covers central Scotland from the Glasgow city region and the Ayrshires in the west to Edinburgh city region in the east, including the Tay cities, the Forth Valley and Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park.\nThe other areas are: North and West Coastal Innovation; Northern Revitalisation; North East Transition and Southern Sustainability.\nCentral Urban Transformation:\nWe will only meet our climate change commitments if we make significant changes to the densely populated central belt of Scotland. Our most urban communities hold the key to reducing emissions from the way we live our lives. We need to work together to decarbonise buildings and transport and tackle congestion, make more efficient use of existing land and buildings, connect to renewable electricity and heat networks and create more inclusive, greener and sustainable places that will stand the test of time.\nFor Edinburgh, household projections show there will be a continuing demand for more homes. There has been a strong market, high levels of housebuilding and pressure on infrastructure and there is strong economic performance.\nFor Edinburgh, the default minimum housing land figure has been set at 41,300 as submitted in the response to the relevant consultation, approved by Planning Committee on……….\nIn this area actions will be to:\n- pioneer low-carbon, resilient urban living;\n- reinvent and future-proof city centres;\n- accelerate urban greening;\n- rediscover urban coasts and waterfronts;\n- reuse land and buildings;\n- invest in net zero housing solutions;\n- grow a wellbeing economy;\n- reimagine development on the urban fringe; and\n- improve urban accessibility\nAction 13 Pioneer low-carbon, resilient urban living\nThis area will require concerted effort to develop a network of 20 minute neighbourhoods, and clusters of communities with fair access to a range of services that support sustainable living. Planning should focus on revitalising cities and towns at scale, supporting a finer grained approach to placemaking, and a more intricate mix of land uses and density. This should incorporate networks of natural spaces and blue and green infrastructure, to create health and wellbeing benefits, increase resilience to climate change and support the growth of green job opportunities. The car-based design of some of our places, including many suburban areas and new towns, mean that a significant shift to a more people centred approach will be required. Planning can help retrofit facilities and services into areas where they are scarce, such as predominantly residential areas, to enable better integrated mixed use areas.\nCity, town and neighbourhood centres can be at the heart of this if they are planned to strengthen self-sufficiency and bring services and jobs closer to homes. The recommendations of the recent town centre review can be delivered by supporting a wider range of uses and making the most of their assets. Accessibility will be a key part of the transition and will involve investment in infrastructure and services in line with the sustainable travel and investment hierarchies, to improve fair access and reduce carbon emissions. Active travel networks will need to expand to make walking, wheeling and cycling an attractive, convenient, safe, and sustainable choice for everyday travel. There are significant opportunities for investment in heat networks, energy storage and the circular economy to create more sustainable neighbourhoods.\nAction 14 Reinvent and future proof city centres\nScotland’s city centres are socially and culturally important, supporting our productivity and stimulating innovation and investment. The pandemic has generated severe impacts and longer-term challenges for our city centres. The City Centre Recovery Taskforce is developing a shared vision for their future and the City Centre Recovery Fund will support their recovery and repurposing. This is a nationally significant opportunity to contribute to Scotland’s economic recovery and to achieve a wellbeing economy.\nEdinburgh has similar challenges [to Glasgow] and opportunities for positive change. High interest in investment and associated demand for new homes means that planning will need to help deliver sustainable development that supports the quality of life of existing and future residents. As a capital city with a World Heritage Site at its core, it will be crucial that future development takes into account the capacity of the city itself and its surrounding communities and makes the most of its exceptional heritage assets, places and cultural wealth. The City Centre Transformation Plan supports a move away from a car-based city centre to create a more liveable and attractive place to live, work and visit. The Forth Bridge is also an inscribed UNESCO World Heritage Site, and our rich industrial and cultural heritage remains apparent across the area.\nAction 15 Accelerate urban greening\nThe greening of the built environment, including former industrial areas, is a long-held ambition that we now need to expedite to significantly reduce emissions, adapt to the future impacts of climate change and tackle biodiversity loss. Investment in green infrastructure will support urban sustainability, help to restore biodiversity, contribute to our overall targets for reducing emissions and improve health and wellbeing. By weaving blue and green infrastructure across our urban fabric we can ensure that nature and the outdoors are accessible to everyone, supporting lifelong health and wellbeing and creating places that are more resilient to flooding.\nThe Central Scotland Green Network will continue to bring together environmental enhancement projects. Initiatives such as the John Muir Pollinator Way demonstrate how nature networks can help restore and better connect biodiversity and enhance green infrastructure at a landscape scale.\nAction 16 Rediscover urban coasts and waterfronts\nThe region’s coasts and firths define the area’s history and shapes its sense of place. There is potential to unlock the strategic importance of coasts, estuary and river corridors for climate mitigation, resilience and positive environmental change. Coastal change will need to be managed to build long term resilience and future-proof our waterfronts. Progress has been made to create long-distance walking and cycling routes and to open up access to waterfront spaces and reclaim them as a resource for people as well as industry. There will be a need to tackle coastal erosion, flood risk and storm surges, and to build in natural solutions which work with the unique biodiversity and landscape character of these important places. These coasts are rich in cultural and natural heritage. Along the Inner Forth various projects provide multiple benefits, including flood management, cultural landscape enhancement, habitat creation, access and tourism. Edinburgh’s waterfront regeneration is ongoing with Granton benefiting from an ambitious masterplan, the tram extension to Leith progressing and potential development at Seafield helping to redefine the city’s relationship with its coastline, reusing existing assets and helping Edinburgh to become a more liveable city. A masterplanned approach to regenerating the Edinburgh Waterfront can take into account opportunities for the Port of Leith to service the offshore energy sector.\nAction 17 Reuse land and buildings\nA more liveable Central Belt means that we will need to do more to reuse empty buildings and vacant and derelict land, particularly spaces which have not been used for decades and can be accessed by sustainable modes. This will reduce further urban sprawl and improve local environments. Around 40% of Scotland’s vacant and derelict land is concentrated in the Glasgow city region and its redevelopment is a key priority. Edinburgh has committed to building a significant share of future housing development on brownfield sites…\nA combination of incentives, investment and policy support for productively reusing brownfield land and buildings at risk will be required to steer development away from greenfield locations. Public sector-led development can shape future markets and deliver development in places where change is needed the most and can deliver multiple benefits. Redevelopment should include, but not be limited to, housing development. By de-risking sites and taking an infrastructure-first approach, this land can help to achieve a better distribution of new homes to meet our future needs. This will also reduce pressure in places where growth is no longer sustainable.\nAction 18 Invest in net zero housing solutions\nAs well as building new homes to net zero standards, more will need to be done to upgrade the existing housing stock to reduce emissions and adapt to future climate impacts. Energy efficiency, sustainable accessibility, zero emissions heating solutions and water management will be key challenges. Areas which are largely residential and car-based could be diversified by supporting local businesses to provide services including leisure, active living, hospitality and retail. There is a particular pressure for affordable housing solutions in the south east of Scotland and there is also an opportunity for future housing development to help reduce emissions. Edinburgh has committed to building affordable homes at scale and will need to work with the region to accommodate wider need and demand in a strategic way. Seven strategic sites, supported through the Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal, could accommodate up to 45,000 homes and associated economic and employment benefits including: Blindwells, Calderwood, Dunfermline, Edinburgh Waterfront, Shawfair, Tweedbank and Winchburgh. The need for proposals to be supported by low carbon transport solutions, in line with the Infrastructure Investment Plan and National Transport Strategy investment hierarchies and infrastructure first approach, will be critical to their success. The Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Deal identifies infrastructure investment and includes a commitment from partners to put in place a regional developer contributions framework building on work undertaken to look at cross boundary transport challenges. These interventions and commitments, taken with the additional transport investment made through the Deal, will ensure the city region continues to grow and flourish. Regionally significant services including healthcare and social care facilities and investment in the learning estate is also planned to support future growth and sustain the wellbeing of existing, new and expanding communities. Emissions from our homes need to be very substantially reduced – by 2030, they must fall by 68% from 2020 levels.\nEngineered solutions to adapt our water and drainage infrastructure will be required in some circumstances, but should support more natural benefits as far as possible. There is scope to continue, and extend, the lessons from the Metropolitan Glasgow Strategic Drainage Plan to future proof infrastructure in support of the long term growth and development of Edinburgh. The Lothian Drainage Partnership is taking this forward with projects emerging within Edinburgh and at the ClimatEvolution Zone in East Lothian.\nAction 19 Grow a wellbeing economy\nThis area has a diverse business base and is a key engine of growth for Scotland as a whole. There are many clusters of sites and businesses which form the basis of regional propositions for investment. In line with our aspirations to build a wellbeing economy, opportunities for investment and development should be designed to maximise economic, social and environmental wellbeing, rather than focusing on growth alone. A planned approach can help to target future development in areas of significant economic disadvantage so that new and better jobs are more fairly distributed to help address national, regional and more localised inequality The pandemic has brought obvious challenges but has also unlocked opportunities to take forward new models of working that could better support our wellbeing and improve our places in the longer term. The continued growth of remote and local working and the creation of hubs within groups of settlements could significantly reduce the need to travel, whilst also helping to grow local businesses and communities. Existing offices have the potential to be repurposed to achieve higher density mixed use neighbourhoods with a lower carbon footprint and require careful planning to ensure future communities are properly supported by appropriate services.\nThe Edinburgh City region supports investment in significant clusters including the Bioquarter, Mid Fife, Dunfermline, Guardbridge St. Andrews, Galashiels, Cockenzie, Midlothian and the M8 corridor. A strategy for West Edinburgh is emerging which guides a wide range of uses to create a sustainable extension to the city, with added benefit from associated improvements to the quality of place of existing communities. Proposals focus on locating development on and around existing transport corridors and work is ongoing to improve accessibility including the Edinburgh tram extension. Further investment should take into account the impact of new development on potentially compounding existing capacity constraints and congestion, and prioritise sustainable choices.\nAction 20 Reimagine development on the urban fringe\nWhilst predominantly urban, this part of Scotland benefits from a rich and diverse rural area and there are many areas where town meets countryside. These green areas and natural spaces are key assets, sustaining communities that could become better places to live if we can achieve this in a way that is compatible with our wider aims for climate change, nature restoration and 20 minute neighbourhoods.\nAction 21 Improve urban accessibility\nA focus on community wealth building, together with growing opportunities for longer term remote working, could address the high levels of transport movement by private car and challenges of congestion and air pollution across the area. Local living, including 20 minute neighbourhoods, will help to minimise future commuting and ensure jobs and income can be spread more evenly across the area. Accessibility and transport affordability can support more resilience which benefits communities who are less connected. By putting in place mass transit systems for Edinburgh through plans to extend the tram network, and for Glasgow including the Glasgow Metro and multi-modal connectivity, we have an opportunity to substantially reduce levels of carbased commuting, congestion and emissions from transport at scale Connections to the rest of the UK will be strengthened in the longer term through high speed rail connectivity, with stations expected in Glasgow and Edinburgh.\nNational Developments\nEighteen national developments are proposed to support the delivery of our spatial strategy. These national developments range from single large scale projects or collections and networks of several smaller scale proposals. They are also intended to act as exemplars of the place principle and placemaking approaches.\nSome of the proposals are Scotland – wide and some area or site specific. Relevant to Edinburgh are:\n- Central Scotland Green Network This national development is one of Europe’s largest and most ambitious green infrastructure projects. It will play a key role in tackling the challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss including by building and strengthening nature networks. A greener approach to development will improve placemaking, can contribute to the roll-out of 20 minute neighbourhoods and will benefit biodiversity connectivity. This has particular relevance in the more urban parts of Scotland where there is pressure for development as well as significant areas requiring regeneration to address past decline and disadvantage. Regeneration, repurposing and reuse of vacant and derelict land should be a priority.\n- National Walking, Cycling and Wheeling Network This national development facilitates the shift from vehicles to walking, cycling and wheeling for everyday journeys contributing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport and is highly beneficial for health and wellbeing. The upgrading and provision of additional active travel infrastructure will be fundamental to the development of a sustainable travel network providing access to settlements, key services and amenities, employment and multi-modal hubs. Infrastructure investment should be prioritised for locations where it will achieve our National Transport Strategy 2 priorities and outcomes, to reduce inequalities, take climate action, help deliver a wellbeing economy and to improve health and wellbeing. This will help to deliver great places to live and work.\n- Urban Mass/Rapid Transit Networks This national development supports low-carbon mass/rapid transit projects for Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow. To reduce transport emissions at scale, we will require low-carbon transport solutions for these three major cities that can support transformational reduction in private car use. Phase 1 of the second Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR2) recommended the development of the Glasgow ‘Metro’ and Edinburgh Mass Transit in these cities and their associated regions. In Aberdeen, the North East Bus Alliance has been awarded funding through Transport Scotland’s Bus Partnership to develop the Aberdeen Rapid Transit system identified in the Regional Transport Strategy and being considered in the STPR2. This will support placemaking and deliver improved transport equity across the most densely populated parts of Scotland, improving access to employment and supporting sustainable investment in the longer term.\n- Urban Sustainable, Blue and Green Drainage Solutions This national development aims to build on the benefits of the Metropolitan Glasgow Strategic Drainage Partnership, to continue investment and extend the approach to the Edinburgh city region.\n- Circular Economy Materials Management Facilities This national development supports the development of facilities required to achieve a circular economy. This sector will provide a range of business, skills and employment opportunities as part of a just transition to a net zero economy.\n- Digital Fibre Network This national development supports the continued roll-out of world class broadband across Scotland\n- High Speed Rail This national development supports the implementation of increased infrastructure to improve rail capacity and connectivity on the main cross-border routes, the east and west coast mainlines. Rail connectivity that can effectively compete with air and road based transport between the major towns and cities in Scotland, England and onward to Europe is an essential part of reducing transport emissions, making best use of the rail network and providing greater connectivity opportunities. There can be significant emissions savings of approximately 75% to be made when freight is transported by rail instead of road.\n- Edinburgh Waterfront This national development supports the regeneration of strategic sites along the Forth Waterfront in Edinburgh. The waterfront is a strategic asset that contributes to the city’s character and sense of place and includes significant opportunities for a wide range of future developments. Development will include high quality mixeduse proposals that optimise the use of the strategic asset for residential, community, commercial and industrial purposes, including support for off-shore energy relating to port uses. Further cruise activity should take into account the need to manage impacts on transport infrastructure. This will help maintain and grow Edinburgh’s position as a capital city and commercial centre with a high quality and accessible living environment. Development locations and design will need to address future resilience to the risks from climate change, impact on health inequalities, and the potential to incorporate green and blue infrastructure.\nNational Planning Policy\nThe national policies set out in NPF4 draft follow the strategy approaches set out above. They are intended to replace Scottish Planning Policy and as part of the statutory development plan would not need to be repeated in future LDPs, though there is scope for further locally based policy which remain compliant.\nThe detailed policy provisions go further than the main principles set out in summary here and into provisions in line with those principles which can be applied to decision making on planning applications. Further details of and comment on those policy measures will be provided once there has been more time to consider them.\nSustainable Places\nPolicy 1: Plan-led approach to sustainable development\nAll local development plans should manage the use and development of land in the long term public interest. This means that new local development plans should seek to achieve Scotland’s national outcomes (within the meaning of Part 1 of the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015) and the UN Sustainable Development Goals\nPolicy 2: Climate emergency\nWhen considering all development proposals significant weight should be given to the Global Climate Emergency\nPolicy 3: Nature crisis\nDevelopment plans and proposals should facilitate biodiversity enhancement, nature recovery and nature restoration across the development plan area\nPolicy 4: Human rights and equality\nPlanning should respect, protect and fulfil human rights, seek to eliminate discrimination and promote equality.\nPolicy 5: Community wealth building\nDevelopment plans and proposals should address community wealth building priorities by reflecting a people-centred approach to local economic development. Spatial strategies should support community wealth building; address economic disadvantage and inequality; and provide added social value.\nPolicy 6: Design, quality and place\nDevelopment proposals should be designed to a high quality so that the scale and nature of the development contributes positively to the character and sense of place of the area in which they are to be located.\nLiveable Places\nPolicy 7: Local living\nDecision makers can determine what facilities can reasonably be expected to be accessible from homes, taking into account local circumstances, as well as the role of digital connectivity in providing some services remotely. Local development plans should support the principle of 20 minute neighbourhoods\nPolicy 8: Infrastructure First\nLocal Development Plans and delivery programmes should be based on an infrastructure-first approach.\nPolicy 9: Quality homes\nLocal development plans should identify a housing target for the area it covers, in the form of a Housing Land Requirement. Representing how much land is required, it should at least meet the 10 year Minimum AllTenure Housing Land Requirement (MATHLR) set out in Annex B. Land should be allocated to meet the Housing Land Requirement in sustainable locations that create quality places for people to live. The location of where new homes are allocated should be consistent with the principles of 20 minute neighbourhoods and an infrastructure-first approach. Development proposals for more than 50 dwellings should be accompanied by a statement of community benefit. Proposals for new homes that improve affordability and choice should be supported.\nProposals for market homes should generally only be supported where a contribution to the provision of affordable homes on a site is at least 25% of the total number of homes. A higher contribution than this benchmark may be sought where justified by evidence of need. The contribution should generally be for serviced land within a site to be made available for affordable housing.\nNew homes on land not identified for housebuilding in the local development plan should not be supported.\nPolicy 10: Sustainable transport\nLocal development plans and proposals should aim to reduce the need to travel unsustainably by prioritising locations for future development. The planning system should ensure that the National Transport Strategy 2 Sustainable Travel and Investment Hierarchies are integrated into the appraisal and assessment of development proposals and decisions in order to make best use of existing infrastructure, and reduce unsustainable travel and transport of goods.\nPolicy 11: Heat and cooling\nLocal development plans and proposals should take into account the area’s Local Heat & Energy Efficiency Strategy (LHEES) and areas of heat network potential and any designated heat network zones (HNZ) when allocating land.\nPolicy 12: Blue and green infrastructure, play and sport\nLocal development plans and proposals should identify and protect blue and green infrastructure.\nPolicy 13: Flooding\nLocal development plans and proposals should strengthen community resilience to the current and future impacts of climate change, including identifying opportunities to implement natural flood risk management and blue green infrastructure. Plans should take into account the probability of flooding from all sources. New development proposals in flood risk areas, or which can impact on flood risk areas, should be avoided. A cautious approach should be taken, regarding the calculated probability of flooding as a best estimate, not a precise forecast.\nPolicy 14: Health and wellbeing\nLocal development plans and proposals should aim to create vibrant, healthier and safe places and should seek to tackle health inequalities particularly in places which are experiencing the most disadvantage. The provision of health and social care facilities and infrastructure to meet the needs of the community should be a key consideration.\nPolicy 15: Safety\nDevelopment proposals in the vicinity of majoraccident hazard sites should take into account the potential impacts on the proposal and the major-accident hazard site of being located in proximity to one another.\nProductive Places\nPolicy 16: Business and Employment\nLocal development plans and proposals should set out proposals to meet requirements for employment land, infrastructure and investment in a way which supports a greener, fairer and more inclusive wellbeing economy.\nPolicy 17: Tourism\nLocal development plans and proposals should support the resilience of the tourism sector, including by identifying proposals for tourism development which reflect sector driven tourism strategies.\nPolicy 18: Culture and creativity\nLocal development plans and proposals should recognise and support opportunities for jobs and investment in the creative sector, culture, heritage and the arts.\nPolicy 19: Green Energy\nLocal development plans and proposals should seek to ensure that an area’s full potential for electricity and heat from renewable sources is achieved. Opportunities for new development, extensions and repowering of existing renewable energy developments should be supported.\nPolicy 20: Zero Waste\nLocal development plans should identify appropriate locations for new infrastructure to support the circular economy and meet identified needs in a way that moves waste as high up the waste hierarchy as possible.\nPolicy 21: Aquaculture\nLocal development plans should guide new aquaculture development to locations that reflect industry needs and take account of environmental impact, including cumulative impacts that arise from other existing and planned aquaculture developments in the area, and wider marine planning.\nPolicy 22: Minerals\nLocal development plans should support the 10-year landbank at all times in the relevant market areas, whilst promoting sustainable resource management, safeguarding important workable mineral resources, which are of economic or conservation value, and take steps to ensure these are not sterilised by other types of development.\nPolicy 23: Digital Infrastructure\nLocal development plans should support the delivery of digital infrastructure, particularly in areas with gaps in connectivity and barriers to digital access.\nDistinctive Places\nPolicy 24: Centres\nLocal development plans should support sustainable futures for city, town and local centres and identify a network of centres. This should reflect the principles of 20 minute neighbourhoods and the town centre vision, and take into account how they are connected by public transport and walking, wheeling and cycling.\nPolicy 25: Retail\nDevelopment proposals for retail development which will generate significant footfall in town centre sites should be supported; edge-of-town centre or commercial centres, should not be supported unless they are explicitly supported by the development plan; out-of-town locations should not be supported.\nPolicy 26: Town centre first assessment\nDevelopment proposals for other uses which will generate significant footfall (or in the case of drive-throughs, a significant number of visitors) including commercial leisure uses, offices, community and cultural facilities and, where appropriate, other public buildings such as libraries, education and healthcare facilities and public spaces where people can gather, should only be considered acceptable in out-of-centre locations if a town-centre first assessment demonstrates that it is appropriate.\nPolicy 27: Town Centre Living\nTown centre living should be encouraged and supported. Planning authorities should seek to provide a proportion of their housing land requirements in city and town centres and be proactive in identifying opportunities.\nPolicy 28: Historic Assets and Places\nLocal development plans and their spatial strategies should identify, protect and enhance locally, regionally, nationally and internationally valued historic assets and places.\nPolicy 29: Urban edges\nLocal development plans should consider using green belts where appropriate in some of the most accessible or pressured rural or peri-urban areas.\nPolicy 30: Vacant and Derelict Land\nLocal development plans should seek to reuse vacant and derelict land and redundant buildings as a priority including in proposals to creatively and sustainably repurpose buildings and structures.\nPolicy 31: Rural places\nLocal development plans should set out proposals to support the sustainability and prosperity of rural communities and economies.\nPolicy 32: Natural Places\nLocal development plans should identify and protect locally, regionally, nationally and internationally valued natural assets, landscapes, species and habitats.\nPolicy 33: Soils\nLocal development plans should protect locally, regionally, nationally and internationally valued soils.\nPolicy 34: Trees, Woodland and Forestry\nLocal development plans should identify and protect existing woodland and potential for its enhancement or expansion to avoid habitat fragmentation and improve ecological connectivity, helping to support nature networks. The spatial strategy should identify and set out proposals for the development of forestry and woodlands in their area, in associated Forestry and Woodland Strategies, including their development, protection and enhancement, resilience to climate change, and the expansion of woodlands of a range of types to provide multiple benefits to the physical, cultural, economic, social and environmental characteristics of the area, in accordance with The Right Tree in the Right Place guidance.\nPolicy 35: Coasts\nLocal development plan spatial strategies should consider how to adapt coastlines to the impacts of climate change. Plans should recognise that rising sea levels and more extreme weather events resulting from climate change will potentially have a significant impact on coastal and islands areas, and that a precautionary approach to flood risk including by inundation should be taken. An appropriate strategy for development should be set out that reflects the diversity of coastal areas and communities. This should take account of opportunities to use nature-based solutions to improve the resilience of coastal communities and assets\nDelivering Our Strategy\nDelivering our strategy and realising our collective ambitions requires collaborative action from the public and private sectors and wider communities. Actions will range across different scales and include a mix of strategic and project investments. It will be important to focus implementation and monitoring on delivering strategic actions and key developments.\nWe expect that our approach to delivery will draw on the following key delivery mechanisms:\n- Aligning Resources\n- Infrastructure First\n- Delivery of National Developments\n- Development Plan Policy and Regional Spatial Strategies\n- Local Place Plans\n- Planning obligations\n- Land assembly\n- Masterplan Consent Areas\n- Investing in the planning service",

Kids from poor backgrounds tend to do less well at school. This key factor is part of why we see poverty being passed down from generation to generation in Scotland.\nWe know that under the SNP this problem is getting worse in Scotland. Their cuts and indifference are holding back a generation – this can only result in worsening inequality in Scotland.\nI grew up in one of the most deprived areas of the UK – a council estate in Kirkcaldy during the 1980’s miner’s strike. My route out of that was to work hard at school and go on to complete a degree and eventually a PhD. This solid educational base has led me to a career which has taken me right around the world – from Australia to Brazil, Japan and Dubai.\nIt breaks my heart to say that I had a better deal under Margaret Thatcher than kids growing up in my old street in Kirkcaldy have today. That’s utterly depressing.\nMy experience tells me that education is fundamental to reducing inequality in Scotland and elsewhere in the world. As a lecturer who manages one of the UK’s leading engineering programmes at a Scottish university I continually come across students who must leave university because they simply cannot afford to support themselves.\nWhen elected in 2007 the SNP abolished the “graduate endowment”, a £2,000 fee paid by students after graduation, and Alex Salmond quickly claimed “The rocks will melt with the sun before I allow tuition fees to be imposed on Scottish students”. In a typically modest move, he even had his words literally carved in stone and unveiled in the grounds of one of Scotland’s best universities.\nThe problem is that fees are only part of the cost of attending university, the second part of the equation is living costs. If you come from a wealthy family, there’s a good chance that the “bank of mum and dad” will help with living costs. Poorer students, however, must rely on a bursary from the Scottish Government.\nCurrently the SNP offers the very poorest students a bursary of just £1875 per year. In comparison, ten years ago Labour offered the poorest students a bursary of £2,455 (~£3,000 today).\nThis means that whilst all students benefit from abolition of the £2,000 graduate endowment, the books have been balanced by cutting £4,500 from the bursary awarded to the poorest students on a typical 4 year degree programme. Poor students must fund their studies via debt and/or work.\nThis movement of money from the poorest to the richest at a time of “austerity” is the action of a government that says its number one priority is cutting the attainment gap.\nA few years ago I came across a student from one of the most deprived areas in Edinburgh who as well as studying full-time also managed a small supermarket full-time. He was one of the very best students I have encountered, and was evidence that whilst Scots growing up in poor communities may lack opportunity, they don’t lack commitment, intelligence or ambition. As a country, we must do more to support them.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2024_02_14_why-i-am-standing-for-parliament-in-2024/content_202.html": "If all goes to plan, the UK could elect a Labour Government at the 2024 General Election which will take the challenges our country faces seriously. Such a victory is long overdue, but is by no means certain.\nKey to securing the change the UK needs, is Labour gaining seats in Scotland. To do this we must have strong local campaigns run by strong candidates. We will also need to elect MPs who fully support Keir Starmer and Anas Sarwar if that UK Labour Government is to succeed.\nThis is important if we are serious about protecting workers’ rights, growing the economy, cutting inequality and meeting our climate obligations.\nI love being a Councillor, and this made my decision to stand as an MP incredibly difficult. I know my track record, however, means I am Labour’s best chance of taking Edinburgh South West from the SNP. This is why I am standing.\nI make only one promise to you: If I win, I will make sure your voice is heard at all levels of government, and no problem will be too small for me to help you with.",

I am somewhat cynical about how genuine the SNP are about tackling inequality in Scotland. There is no shortage of nationalists who say they care about inequality, but the reality is their party has an appalling record on the issue. Indeed, SNP policies on everything from cutting the grant for the poorest students to the slashing teacher numbers in Scotland have damaged the life chances of many Scots. My dad, a lifelong Labour voter, always enjoys calling them “Tartan Tories” for good reason.\nDespite my cynicism, I felt the challenge posed by Labours progressive agenda would force the nationalists to propose a budget for Scotland that enabled our country to embark on a process of real change. Despite my cynicism, I have to admit I am disappointed.\nDerek Mckay has introduced a series of tax measures that will mean that somebody earning the living wage will be just 38p per week better off than an equivalent person living in England under the Tories. Meanwhile a Scot earning £50,000 per year is £85 more better off than last year.\nTax cuts for some above average earners (£43,525 to £58,500) and a complete failure to tax the richest at a fair rate will be funded by cutting essential services run by councils. The SNP Group Leader in Edinburgh described this outrage as “positive”, but at least his finance spokesperson was honest enough to admit Edinburgh may be facing a 3% cut in funding (report, 15/12/17).\nAgain, City of Edinburgh Council will be forced to raise the most regressive tax (Council Tax) to help fill this gap because the nationalist government won’t do more than tinker with the most progressive tax (Income Tax). This is an utter disgrace.\nNonetheless, Edinburgh residents concerned about the impact of SNP cuts in their community will be relieved to hear that Nicola Sturgeon’s “international relations” budget is safe! The budget has increased by 25% in just two years to £17.3m and, among other things, funds her jaunts overseas. It’s shameful that at a time when essential services across our capital are being cut, the SNP elite can find extra money to promote themselves on the world stage. I’m sure some of the money is being spent well, but is it really necessary for funding to increase when essential services are being cut? How do the poorest benefit from Nicola Sturgeon promoting herself as “Queen of Scots” overseas?\nBut that’s not the only place where savings can be made. The bungled farm payment scheme, the Named Person fiasco and what Audit Scotland calls an “unacceptable” waste of public money by Police Scotland are symptomatic of a Government that is ineffective and inefficient. Rather than addressing these problems, the SNP elite is simply passing the buck to Councils.\nGovernment is, after all, about priorities and the SNP have shown time and time again how much of a priority those that rely on Council services are.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_09_29_making-edinburghs-tram-safer-for-cyclists/content_195.html": "Below is a briefing on this:\nNew red-surfaced cycle lanes are to be installed at a number of key points along the tram route in Edinburgh’s city centre.\nThe measures, the first in a three-phase project to help all road users keep themselves and each other safe when negotiating the tram tracks, are aimed at demonstrating the optimum angle for crossing the tracks and reminding motorists to give cyclists extra space, particularly where tramlines are concerned.\nThe red-screeded cycle lanes will offer those on bikes the safest route to cross the tram tracks to avoid slipping or getting their wheels stuck.\nA report going before the Council’s Transport and Environment Committee on 5 October details the changes, which will be rolled out over the coming weeks, along with warning signs and a multi-channel publicity and awareness campaign.\nThe campaign will urge all road users to “look out for each other”, stressing the need for drivers to give cyclists ample space when they’re manoeuvring into the safest position for crossing tram tracks.\nThese initial measures, or Phase 1 in the project, involve new road markings at:\n- York Place into Elder Street\n- Shandwick Place into Queensferry Street\n- Princes Street on to Waverley Bridge\n- Princes Street into South St David Street\n- Princes Street into Frederick Street\nThere will also be red surfacing added to the existing cycle lane at Haymarket Yards.\nConsultations have been under way for some time between specialist consultants working on the Council’s behalf and cycling groups, including Spokes and Sustrans, to assess areas of potential conflict between cyclists and tramlines in the city centre and develop proposals for improvements.\nThis work was ongoing when a fatal collision occurred on 31 May at the junction of Shandwick Place and Queensferry Street, in which Malaysian student Zhi Min Soh tragically lost her life.\nOn 29 June 2017, the Council approved a motion calling for a number of actions to be undertaken to improve conditions for vulnerable road users in the city centre and at various locations along the tram route. These actions included undertaking reviews of infrastructure at the junction at the west end of Princes Street where the fatal collision happened, and of tram infrastructure in the city centre and at South Gyle/Edinburgh Park to enhance pedestrian and cyclist safety and convenience. The motion also called for the design of any future tram line extension to reflect Council policies to prioritise pedestrian and cyclist safety and convenience.\nDave Du Feu, speaking on behalf of Spokes, said: “Spokes welcomes the Council’s 3-phase project to tackle tramline-related cyclist crashes and injuries.\n“The Council rightly recognises that many crashes occur because traffic pressures force the cyclist into the tramlines at a poor angle. We therefore particularly welcome the phase 1 “Give Cyclists Space” signs and publicity.”\n“We urge the Council to progress rapidly with the consultations and Traffic Orders required for phases 2 and 3, which entail changes to traffic lights, road layouts, etc. We look forward to discussing these plans.”\n“Furthermore, Spokes welcomes the motion passed at the first meeting of the new Council, promising that any tramline extension would “prioritise pedestrian and cyclist safety and convenience, including consideration of segregated cycle lanes.”\nKatherine Soane, Senior Officer, Transport Integration, Sustrans, said: “Sustrans welcomes the Council’s proposals around crossing tram tracks.\n“This is an excellent first step in getting people on bikes to be more aware of the best angle to cross tram tracks, and we look forward to a more wide-reaching programme around safety where vulnerable road users interact with motorists.”\nThe new road markings will be promoted alongside the following guidance:\nAdvice for drivers\nGive cyclists extra space, not just to the side but from behind. They need time to cycle safely near tram tracks.\nIf you see a cyclist indicating to turn across the tracks, you should stay at least 12 metres behind them – this is the length of 2 ½ cars or a bus.\nAvoid driving on the red cycle lanes when cyclists are turning right at:\n- York Place into Elder Street\n- Shandwick Place into Queensferry Street\n- Princes Street onto Waverley Bridge\n- Princes Street into South St David Street\n- Princes Street into Frederick Street\nThink ahead and signal early. Let other people using the road know what you are doing.\nAdvice for cyclists\nCross the tracks at least at 45 degrees. If you can’t, you should get off your bike to avoid slipping on the tracks or getting your wheels stuck.\nAvoid leaning when crossing the tram tracks.\nTake care when cycling in the rain, the tracks will be slippery.\nThink ahead and signal early. Plan how you will cross the tracks and let people using the road know what you are doing.\nIf there is a red cycle lane where you are turning, please use it as it offers the safest route to crossing the tram tracks.\nKnow your limits. Depending on the situation and your cycling experience, you may prefer to get off your bike at a safe point on the road to continue your journey.\nFurther information\nwww.edinburgh.gov.uk/tramsafety\nPhase 2 in the project, expected for completion by April 2018, will include improvements to Advanced Stop Lines for cyclists and traffic signals apparatus at six city centre locations.\nMeanwhile, Phase 3, expected to be completed in autumn 2018, will include a short length of new segregated cycle lane on Princes Street. This timescale is dependent on successful promotion of redetermination orders.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_10_28_my-answer-to-callum-on-smoking-drinking/content_703.html": "Callum,\nMany thanks for your letter – I am sorry it has taken me so long to reply.\nThe damage smoking and drinking does to our bodies and our country is huge, so I am glad to read you are concerned about it too. When I was 10 I had a Superman poster like the one in the envelope (see below) on my bedroom wall – it told me all I needed to know about smoking. Do you like the poster?\nWe know that roughly 4 out of every 20 adults in the UK smoke – that’s over 9 million people. Tobacco smoking causes an estimated 115,000 deaths in the UK per year. Around 10,000 of these deaths are due to “second hand smoke” – this is where people breath in the fumes from other people’s smoking. The smoking ban in public places means that most “second hand smoke” is now encountered in homes or sometimes in cars. Ask your family if they know someone who has died or been ill due to smoking.\nBefore the 2006 smoking ban, it was possible to smoke in buses, cafes, cinemas and trains – can you imagine how bad that would be! Think about all that second hand smoke! Ask older people in your family if they can remember what that was like and how their clothes smelled afterwards.\nThe Council does not have the power to stop the sale of tobacco, but it does have a duty to make people healthy and happier. On smoking, the plan is for over the next few years to educate young people about how silly it is to smoke. By 2034 the aim is to cut smoking to just 1 in 20 young people at the most. Do you think that’s enough?\nAlthough almost everyone knows smoking is very bad for them, most think alcohol is not so bad – but it still does cause over 7,000 deaths per year! Because alcohol changes the way people think and act, it causes other problems too. It’s estimated that there are over 500,000 incidents of violent crime per year in the UK where the victim believes the offender to be under the influence of alcohol. Ask your family if they know about any of these crimes.\nEven a small amount of alcohol is bad for you, that’s why pregnant women are asked not to drink as it may harm the baby. For people that do drink, doctors say they should have no more than 6 drinks per week and that these should be spread over a few days. Do you think people should drink alcohol if doctors say it’s not safe?\nThe Council can’t stop the sale of alcohol, but it can make sure the people who sell it follow certain rules. An important one is not selling it to children who are under 18 years old. In this envelope (see below) is a sign we gave to shops about this a week or two ago. What do you think about the sign?\nNot drinking alcohol and smoking will help you stay healthy. Two other things you can do is eat healthy food and do lots of exercise. I know you don’t smoke or drink alcohol, but do you eat healthy food and exercise when you can? I hope so!\nThanks again for your letter. I hope my answers have helped you at least a little.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_06_17_crime-briefing-south-west-edinburgh-drug-supply-initiatives/content_591.html": "Below is a briefing on drug crime in South-West Edinburgh.\nIntroduction\nAt the last Locality Committee meeting (April 2018), Chief Inspector Carson reported that drug supply activity in the locality accounted for over half the drug activity in the city.\nConcerns were raised that this was indicative of a disproportionately high drug misuse problem relative to the rest of Edinburgh.\nThis briefing provides context around the relatively high statistics, compared to elsewhere.\nFirst and foremost, it is worth re-iterating that tackling drug and alcohol misuse is one of the 6 key outcomes of the Community Safety section of the Locality Improvement Plan (LIP). Whilst more detail is provided in the LIP, the local approach is based on enforcement and support, both of which are reliant on the ongoing and valued support of a significant number of the key partners identified.\nThe following sections provide a brief summary of the drug supply activity in South West Edinburgh, and the ongoing plans and initiatives to address those issues.\nOverview\nThe Crime Statistics for 2017/18 indicate a significant proportion of Supply of Drugs offences occurring in South West Edinburgh.\nAnalysis conducted by the E Division Analyst Unit has identified 4 key themes in South West, relevant to the supply of drugs in the locality.\nResidential properties, The Royal Mail Sorting Office and HMP Edinburgh account for the main locations for crimes of drug supply. This is indicative of the pro-active nature of drug enforcement activity.\nIn addition, the fourth aspect relates to on-street / open space drug supply. This is relatively low when compared to other localities in terms of the percentage of drugs supply offences that are on-street / open space (the lowest in fact compared to other localities).\nWhile the South West locality accounts for the highest proportion of total drug supply crime for the city, it accounts for the lowest proportion in terms of possession in terms of other localities.\nCannabis is the drug most typically found in crimes of possession and supply, in South West Edinburgh, followed by heroin/diamorphine.\nPrivate / Residential Locations\n36.7% of drug supply (including possession with intent to supply) offences occur within private space. This relates predominantly to dwelling homes.\nThe response to this aspect is heavily reliant on information received from members of the public, which is invariably passed to police in the form of intelligence.\nThat intelligence is then used to crave and execute warrants at relevant addresses.\nResponse: There are both Divisional and Regional Units dedicated to targeting the supply of controlled drugs. Those units enforce Misuse of Drugs Act Warrants across the city, particularly when the enquiry might provide complex on account of, for example, ward / locality / Divisional boundaries.\nLocally, the majority of drug enforcement activity is undertaken by the Initiative Team (LAVRU) based at Wester Hailes Police Station, supported by the Community Policing Team.\nThe focus is on those individuals / groups / families whose behaviour blights local communities. The recent phase of Operation Aftermath saw the execution of warrants in the locality, leading to the recovery of over £65,000 of controlled substances and £4,500 in cash.\nStreet Dealing\nDrug supply offences occurring in public spaces account for 13.9% of supply / possession with intent charges in South West.\nThis is often the ‘end of the supply chain’, but is nevertheless often found in areas that experience associated crime and disorder.\nResponse: Operation Aftermath is designed to not only identify named individuals, but also problematic areas, where the identities of those responsible are often unknown.\nThe last phase of Aftermath targeted specific locations identified – directly and indirectly – by the public, using an array of tactics.\nIn addition, we recognise the significance the physical appearance and structure can have on the behaviour of individuals in communities. As such, we are supporting the regeneration of Westside Plaza with a view to tackling drug misuse and ASB there.\nEnvironmental surveys will assess how the landscape can be adapted, lighting improved, CCTV, signage and generally making areas less welcoming for those who are intent on causing criminality, disorder or otherwise contributing to the fear of crime.\nOfficers will continue to receive briefings to empower them to stop and search individuals who have either (a) been identified through intelligence, or (b) behaved in such a manner in an identified hotspot.\nHMP Saughton\nThe prison is accountable for 20.1% of drug supply / possession with intent to supply charges in South West.\nDrug misuse within prisons is a significant challenge to authorities, but the relationship between E Division, and specifically South West, and prison staff is second to none.\nPrison Liaison Officer PC Tracey Gunn continues to play a pivotal role in that relationship and makes a vital contribution to preventing and detecting illegal activity within the prison estate.\nIt is worth noting that the offence of bringing / attempting to bring drugs into prison is a separate offence and not included in the breakdown of figures outlined in this report.\nHowever, as the locality with geographical ownership of the prison, we plan and undertake operations at the prison to prevent and detect persons trying to get drugs into prison. Similarly, we investigate reports from the prison of offences of this nature.\nPC Gunn liaises with colleagues at prisons around the country to ensure we are abreast of trends and challenges within the prison.\nMail Centre\nThe Royal Mail Centre at Cultins Road is another entity of significance to recorded drug supply in South West.\nPresently, the intended recipient is not relevant in terms of the location of the offence – the Mail Centre is recorded as the location.\nAs such, the Mail Centre accounts for 29.5% of recorded supply charges for the Locality.\nThis may skew what would be perceived to be a true picture of drug activity in South West and this particular recording standard is being reviewed by Scottish Crime Recording Standards. In future, the locus for such an offence may be recorded as the intended recipient.\nSimilar to the prison, joint working and partnership relations are strong and efficient. Staff at the centre are well versed in procedures, and technology is such that detections of attempts to get controlled substances into the city are on the increase (173%).\nThis area is an example of one in which we receive support from Divisional units in relation to investigation, and we continue to support staff at the centre in the detection of offences.\nPrevention, Intervention & Support\nEnforcement is clearly a reaction to the criminality discussed above, and the commitment to that aspect is evident.\nHowever, we fully recognise the need to address the source of the problem also. That’s why we will work with partners to try and impact on demand, and prevent people choosing to misuse dugs. Equally, when they have, we will focus on supporting them get out of that lifestyle.\nAs such, the CAP will incorporate victim support for those afflicted by drug misuse. The work of the CAP is documented in this month’s Area Committee report.\nIn addition, events such as ‘The Slide’ have been introduced in schools, and the Choices for Life event involved inputs and engagement with over 60 youths in the area. These both show children how the decisions they make can affect their lives. Individuals with lived-life experience are highly credible and effective and are excellent at sharing their experience.\nSummary\nThe content of this report is intended to break down drug supply – and associated challenges – into 4 main themes.\nWhilst recent crime figures highlighted that South West Edinburgh accounted for the highest proportion of supply offences in the city, that is not to be interpreted as the locality having a disproportionate problem with drug misuse.\nTwo unique entities – HMP Edinburgh and the Royal Mail Centre – are situated in South West and contribute to recorded crime levels on that basis.\nThe locality enjoys a great deal of intelligence in relation to drug misuse and supply, and in a local Initiative Team ably supported by Community Policing and Divisional resources, are able to act on that intelligence.\nThe Locality Improvement Plan outlines the plan to tackle drug and alcohol misuse and, significantly, acknowledges the importance of support and intervention in addressing the problem.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2023_09_26_scottish-government-funding-for-edinburgh-has-not-kept-pace-with-its-growth/content_115.html": "The 2022 census data published in September shows that the Edinburgh population grew by 7.6% between 2011 and 2022, we now have 264,000 females and 248,700 males in the city. This growth is testament to the quality of life in Edinburgh, and the strength of the local economy.\nIt’s a shame, however, that the Scottish Government funding for Edinburgh has not kept pace. A growing city is welcome, but we need additional funding for schools, GPs, roads, etc. Indeed, the census show that housing building is lagging population growth. The result is higher rents, bigger mortgages and homelessness. Sadly, this is being repeated across Scotland – particularly where affordable homes are concerned.\nIn 2022-23, 3,303 households were assessed as homeless in Edinburgh, and there are now 24,500 households currently on the waiting list for an affordable home. On average, each one advertised gets 196 applications.\nOn the very day in February that his Scottish Government set the budget in Holyrood, Shelter Scotland was protesting outside because the social housing budget was being “slashed”. This came just a few days after Shelter Scotland said the Scottish Government were choosing “to deprioritise social housing in their spending plans by disproportionately slashing that budget”.\nIn August Shelter Scotland intervened again when data was published showing that homelessness was rising across Scotland taking the total number of homeless children to 16,263. Shelter Scotland were again clear on their position by saying the situation was “utterly shameful” and that “there is no mystery surrounding the solution to this emergency, no need for more summits or round tables to puzzle out an answer”. They told the Scottish Government “we need more social housing, and we need it now”.\nI hope Edinburgh continues to thrive in the coming decade, but the Scottish Government must ensure that the taxes and business rates collected here are used to tackle the lack of affordable housing.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_01_15_labour-leadership-poll-the-fight-is-on/content_584.html": "So Labour List /Survation surveyed 3,835 Labour members between 8th and 13th January 2020 via LabourList’s database. The results are a wee bit of a surprise. The first preferences put Rebecca Long-Bailey in the lead:\n- R. Long-Bailey: 42%\n- K. Starmer: 37%\n- J. Phillips: 9%\n- L. Nandy: 7%\n- E. Thornberry: 1%\n- C. Lewis: 6% (now withdrawn)\nTransfers between the change candidates will be important, but clearly this is a blow for those party members that want the party to change course in order to become electable again.\nThere are other interesting points in the (unweighted) data. The people that took part were voted as follows in 2016: 2073 for Corbyn; 1058 for Smith and 704 didn’t take part. Of those that backed Corbyn in 2016, 23% of those that expressed a view backed Keir Starmer. Meanwhile Rebecca Long-Bailey picked up 66% of the same group.\nThose looking for a candidate that will unite the party will be interested in the distribution of preferences. The huge spike for Jess Phillips in the 6th preference column tells us she is the candidate of last resort for a lot of members (50%). Similarly, 27% of members want anyone but Rebecca Long-Bailey. If correct, this may not stop Long-Bailey but it is insurmountable for Jess Phillips.\nThe challenge for the change candidates is winning of 2nd and 3rd preference votes. For example, for Starmer to win he must maximise votes from Thornberry, Nandy and Phillps (assuming more than Starmer and Long-Bailey reach the one-member-one vote stage). Jess Phillips gives very few preferences to Long-Bailey, but Nandy would transfer 14% after either a second or 3rd round knockout. Starmer needs to go all out to maximise his 1st preferences, but also convince those backing other change candidates to offer up their 2nd and 3rd preferences en masse.\nLastly, whilst 66% of members say they have made up their mind the remaining 34% are undecided. Of these, 35% are tilting towards Starmer whilst 34% are considering Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy is third with a respectable 10%. Reaching out to these members with a positive message about making us electable is key for whoever wins",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_12_12_edinburghs-picardyplace-predicament/content_360.html": "Living Streets Edinburgh are correct, we need to think carefully about what’s being proposed for Picardy Place (report, 11.12.17).\nEdinburgh is a growing city. By 2050 it will have grown by 25% and it is important that this growth is undertaken in a way that maintains, or ideally improves, the quality of life we currently enjoy.\nTo address this we need to add capacity to key arterial corridors (e.g. A702) and the city centre road network without adding to congestion. That means we need to make public and active transport much more attractive. Our great bus service must get better. Active transport must be more attractive, safer and enjoyable.\nIn the short-term, we can expect to see the development of a bold plan to enhance public spaces in the city centre with the aim of improving conditions for pedestrians and public transport users. Although this is focused on central Edinburgh, it has potential to set the whole city on a positive trajectory.\nThe ongoing development of that plan is why it is premature to progress the current proposals to redevelop the space at the top of Leith Walk – Picardy Place. The proposals for the area were born over 10 years ago and many argue they are now out-of-step with what Edinburgh needs.\nSo why compromise so much when Scotland’s Capital deserves better? That question takes us to the £850m St James Quarter development and its corpulent car park (1,000 extra spaces). A £60m Growth Accelerator Model (GAM) funding agreement was brokered between the developer, the Council and the Scottish Futures Trust (a shady organisation involved in the SNP Government’s version of PFI). Making substantial changes to that contract will mean renegotiating the £15m allocated in the GAM contract for Picardy Place.\nWithin that context, my view is that we should do all we can to engage the GAM partners in a positive conversation about what’s possible. One that seeks to integrate Picardy Place into the wider discussion about ensuring Edinburgh remains one of Europe’s greatest capitals. We need to think about place making, wellbeing and the economy. We need to think holistically about ensuring Edinburgh is a liveable city.",

The future is now looks even brighter.\nThe Council has now published its 1,400 page draft City Plan 2030 document (download link at the bottom of this blog). This document maps out how the city will develop over the next decade or so. A key driver is ensuring enough land is set aside for 36,911 new homes which are estimated to be needed, and that Edinburgh has sufficient schools, GPs, transport infrastructure etc to cope with them.\nI can’t pretend to have read all 555,582 words yet, but I think the report does look broadly positive for my Ward:\n- After years of campaigning by communities in my Ward, City Plan 2030 offers none of the Greenbelt here for development. The same is the case for all of south Edinburgh.\n- The biggest development area in the whole of Southwest Edinburgh is Redford Barracks. I’m pleased to see that community feedback has been taken onboard in shaping the outline proposals for this site (more detail below), and there will be opportunities for local people to have more say.\n- It has taken a lot of arguing, but the Council now accepts that it can meet its housing supply targets without allocating any further greenspace for development. HOWEVER, Greenbelt allocated in the previous plan will not be removed – especially in Northwest Edinburgh.\n- The strategy of protecting the Greenbelt by using the tram extension to open up brownfield sites in north Edinburgh is now delivering results.\nLooking at the wider city, these are the three key points I noted.\n- Where sites are developed, the Council will take an “infrastructure first” approach – directing new development to where there is existing infrastructure. Where required to support new development, City Plan 2030 requires new and expanded community infrastructure including schools, healthcare, sustainable transport, energy, and waste to support these new communities.\n- For new developments, the 20% “affordable” target has been scrapped – Edinburgh will demand 35%. I’m disappointed that this will not apply to Student Accommodation.\n- All new buildings will use low and zero-carbon generating technologies to be net zero and to address climate adaptation, and the aim will be to move towards 20-minute walkable neighbourhoods. The noted intention is to ensure that new housing development is directed to where residents can access a range of key services within walking distance when this is practicable and reasonable. Developers will be expected to demonstrate their proposal’s walkability to key services as part of their submission.\nListed below are some of the key impacts for people in my Ward.\nRedford Barracks\nThe Council is assuming that the UK Government will proceed with its plans to close Redford Barracks. Its CityPlan2030 document maps out how the city will develop over the next 20 years, and it suggests the Redford Barrack could be redeveloped as a:\n“housing-led mixed–use development which draws the surrounding communities together, through the provision of new connections, open spaces and other community infrastructure” and this will draw “the surrounding communities together through the provision of new connections, open spaces and other community infrastructure”.\nIt is expected that there will be appropriate frontages to Colinton Road, Oxgangs Road North and the rear. The existing parade grounds should be kept free from development, and any new development around them must provide active frontages onto these spaces. The security fence will be removed.\nIt is estimated that the site could accommodate as many as 800 new homes. The redevelopment will respect the history and layout of the site, and it is hoped the War Memorial can be retained (if not, it will be moved). Indeed, it is noted that the site’s military history must be interpreted within the new development.\nThe report notes that there is flood risk on the site which needs to be better understood.\nAll homes on the site will be adequately served with play facilities, and the recreation area to the southeast will be retained and will form a new community park.\nI’m glad that the Council agreed that this scale of development will necessitate improvements to the bus provision serving Colinton (the focus is the 400), and that GP services will also require expansion. The potential for active travel routes between the redevelopment site with schools, Water of Leith etc.\nThe site will also have a “Mobility Hub” this is an accessible place which brings together different transport modes alongside associated facilities, services and information to encourage more sustainable travel. These can include a range of shared mobility services, click and collect, electric vehicle charging, etc.\nThe developer will also fund investment in Firrhill HS and Colinton PS. It is estimated that Colinton PS will require 6 classrooms and a dining/assembly hall extension. For Firrhill HS, a site of around 2.3ha is required for expansion. It is also recognised that additional pre-school provision will be needed.\nThe public will also have a say on individual applications over the next decade, and I will ensure the voices of local people are heard.\nWhen I was elected in 2017 I was sure we’d have seen more clarity on the future of the barracks by now, but today I am less than certain that we will see substantial progress before 2030!\nFairmilehead Area\nThere is no mention in the report other than confirming the Swanston and Winton conservation areas. Buckstone Shops are noted as being a “Local Centre”. St Peter’s, Buckstone and Pentland Primary Schools are noted as needing no additional capacity up to 2030.\nOxgangs Area\nOxgangs is noted as benefitting from the potential redevelopment of Redford Barracks. Oxgangs Broadway is designated as a Local Centre. St Mark’s and Oxgangs Primary Schools are noted as needing no additional capacity up to 2030, but Firrhill High School is flagged as needing room for expansion due to the Redford Barracks redevelopment. Braidburn School is not mentioned in the report.\nColinton Area\nColinton Village is noted as being a Local Centre and the conservation area designation is noted. The potential to establish South Gyle-Pentlands-Swanston-Portobello cycle route is highlited (this looks like an extension to the planned Portobello-Pentlands active travel route). Colinton Primary School is explained as needing room for expansion due to the Redford Barracks redevelopment, and Bonaly Primary School is noted has having no capacity issues.\nBoroughmuir HS, St Thomas of Aquin’s RC HS & St Augustine’s RC HS.\nThere is already significant pressure on the capacity of Boroughmuir HS, and development withing the catchment will result in an estimated further 46 pupils. An extension to increase the capacity of Boroughmuir High School to 1,560 pupils is currently under construction – the demand by 2030 is estimated as 1,705. Beyond this, the school cannot be extended further on its existing site (they built it in the wrong place!). The report notes – “To accommodate all pupils forecast from population growth and pupil generation from new development it will be necessary to engage with the school community to consider the options available, including catchment change.”. I write about this issue here – the blog is now a little dated, but the issues at play have not changed.\nFor St Thomas of Aquin’s RC High School, the report suggests suggests that it will have only limited capacity to provide places for RC pupils generated by new housing developments. Accordingly, contributions of £5,313,509 are sought for the 101 pupils estimated to be generated by new developments.\nFor St Augustine’s RC High School, contributions of £18,465,759 are sought for the 351 pupils estimated to be generated by new developments.",

I contacted the Interim MD of Lothian Buses, Nigel Serafini, yesterday to get his perspective – his response is below.\nYou will see that he is clear that “delays to services of up to 60 minutes” have meant timetables have been “rendered redundant.” The cause is “significantly increased” traffic volumes, roadworks and “new road management measures”.\nAn efficient public transport system is key to getting our city out of the economic slump caused by Covid-19. These delays will only force people out of buses and into cars, a move that will only exacerbate the delays and damage Edinburgh’s tentative recovery. I have passed Nigel Serafini’s e-mail to the Spaces for People team so it can be considered as part of the review of the Braid Road closure.\nI am well aware of the stress these delays are causing people using the route – particularly S1 pupils are their parents. I have spent the last couple of mornings looking at traffic around Greenbank (see here & here), and on Monday (weather permitting) I hope to look at the evening rush hour as I understand that is when delays are worst.\nUpdate from CEC – “I have discussed this with colleagues in Lothian Buses who have advised that these delays are primarily due – as they see it – to the Temporary Traffic Lights at Kaimes Crossroads which started on Monday and finish today, pushing traffic from the A701 to the A702. As such we might reasonably expect the traffic situation to improve next week assuming the TTL operation at Kaimes is complete.“\nNigel Serafini:\nIn planning for the return of schools we increased service levels and provided additional journeys on corridors where we anticipated capacity issues. In addition to these measures we have provided for back-up vehicles and drivers to be deployed as and when we encounter unexpected customer uplifts. This has worked successfully throughout the many phases of lockdown and more recently as schools have re-opened fully. Unfortunately the effectiveness of these measures has been impaired by a number of external factors outwith our control.\nRoad traffic volumes have significantly increased this week coinciding with increased roadworks and new road management measures across the city. This has led to significant congestion and delays to services of up to 60 minutes, causing planned timetables to be rendered redundant. As traffic has slowed, loadings have become heavier and additional journeys have been unable to be in the right place and time to cater for school exit times. We are currently re-working timetables to try and mitigate some of these issues by introducing short workings on some timetables to allow a measure of flexibility.\nAs you will be aware, the compulsory wearing of face coverings on public transport is currently not enforceable by our staff and where family groups or those in ‘social bubbles’ are allowed to travel/sit together we cannot restrict numbers. We have never been asked by the local authority to provide dedicated school transport but we continue to monitor customer numbers and will adjust timetables/frequency’s over the coming days/weeks until hopefully traffic conditions begin to improve.",

I wrote it in response to yet another negative press article about our poll rating in Scotland.\nWithout a doubt these are tough times for Labour in the UK in general and in Scotland specifically. Nonetheless, I’m standing as a Labour candidate in May as ordinary Scots need Labour now more than ever.\nSince I joined Labour in October 2014 it has faced unprecedented electoral “challenges”. We’ve gained thousands of new members, but lost elections on an epic scale. The reasons for this are legion, but they can be traced back to long before the independence referendum. My own view is that the rot started when Tony Blair took us to war in Iraq – that is where we lost the trust of many voters.\nThat does not mean the Blair/Brown governments did not do great things. Doubling NHS spending and lifting 2 million people out of poverty are non-trivial achievements.\nAt the same time Scottish Labour reformed the NHS, rebuilt schools on an industrial scale and banned smoking in public places. What have the SNP and Tories done since then to match our transformative zeal? Divided Scotland and the UK respectively.\nIn 2016 the electorate listened to Labour’s message – Kezia Dugdale set the agenda with a cohesive narrative built around Labour values. The problem was it was overshadowed in the closing weeks of the campaign by the threat of a second independence referendum. The rest is history, a horrible history.\nSeven months after our defeat, the support we lost to the nationalists is beginning to wake up to the SNP’s indifference to social justice, but the constitutional arguments and a lack of trust in Labour remain barriers to them supporting us. There is no sign of the tide of popular support returning as quickly as it left us.\nNonetheless, we can’t afford to weaken further if everyone in Scotland is to have the chance to reach their full potential. We can’t let the challenges we face wear us down. We can’t abandon the people the Labour party was established to protect who are trapped right now between two forms of ugly nationalism.\nAlthough their politics are dissimilar, both the Tory Brexiteers and the SNP are using turbo-charged nationalist rhetoric to fight for different forms of independence. Like Trump, both are intent on blaming others for the problems we face. Both assume the moral high ground. Both will destroy public services and hold back a generation to reach their hollow ideological goal.\nAlthough the need for a Labour Government has never been greater, we can’t pretend we will be back in power in Scotland soon. There is no magic answer or silver bullet. Indeed, we need to stop thinking a change of leader is the answer – we’ve tried that too many times. It’s also clear to me that Labour’s recovery shouldn’t be about right versus left, or rich versus poor. It must be about convincing everyone that social justice is in their interest.\nWe also have to move beyond constitutional arguments by setting out our own position clearly. As a party, we can’t back independence due to the damage it would do to public services. It’s our job to set out the case for a form of devolution (including empowering councils) that works for Scotland. For me, the starting point for that debate is Kezia Dugdales’s speech on the need for a “New Act of Union” – a move towards federalism.\nAs a party we need to step back and think about how voters view us. We must be clear about what we stand for. At every labour meeting I have attended our common cause has been clear, however, too often we struggle to communicate this in a way that resonates. The 2016 manifesto was a huge step in the right direction which I hope we will build on.\nAbove all, however, we need to be bold and positive in everything we do. We must be proud about what we stand for as those values were forged in Scotland: by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone, so as to create for each of us the means to realise our true potential and for all of us a community in which power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many not the few.",

Equally, I welcome the offer Keith Brown MSP, the SNP’s Economy Secretary, has made to the Capital to suggest improvements (report, 10/01/18).\nWhen considering this offer, it is important to think about what Edinburgh needs in terms of infrastructure. It needs housing and we need to support the wellbeing of all our Capital’s residents.\nIt was hoped that the City Region Deal would be focussed on housing and be worth over £1.5b (Glasgow got £1.13b), instead the SNP and Tory Governments each gave our Capital City £300m with the biggest single item being a £120m roundabout.\nWhilst £600m over 15 years is very welcome, it has to be placed within the context of the year-on-year cuts inflicted on Edinburgh and its people by the SNP and Tory Governments.\nFurthermore, back in May we heard, without a whimper of opposition from Edinburgh SNP, that the Scottish Government had decided that the City Deal would not fund the tram extension. It did, however, apparently find £120m to upgrade the Sheriffhall Roundabout on the City Bypass. This neither falls within the remit of the region’s councils nor, I understand, was it part of the City Region Deal bid. Indeed, the SNP Government is arguably short-changing Edinburgh by making the already planned upgrade of Sheriffhall Roundabout part of the deal simply to inflate its finances.\nThere is a conspiracy of silence about this outrage amongst Edinburgh’s Tories and Nationalists as both parties are architects of the deal. However, Keith Brown’s offer is a chance to correct this brazen attempt to short-change our Capital.\nWe should let Transport Scotland continue with its long established plan to upgrade Sheriffhall if it wishes, but we should end the illusion that this is part of the City Region Deal. Instead, we should seek funding to transform Edinburgh and the life chances of its residents.\nFirstly, this should be done by industrialising the construction of high quality, sustainable and truly affordable housing for rent in Edinburgh. What’s more, these homes should be built by apprentices trained in Edinburgh. Secondly, we need to provide a step change in support for active and public transport so people can lead more active lives and so, in the longer term, take some of the pressure of our NHS.\nSurely that would be a better legacy for this generation to leave the next than a £120m roundabout?",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_02_12_a-personal-perspective-on-the-plans-to-remove-trained-teachers-from-edinburghs-nurseries/content_698.html": "The Scottish Government has forced £590m of new commitments on to Councils, but have given them only £495m to undertake the work. Edinburgh has a £35m black hole to fill.\nIt is heart-breaking that the poorest people in Edinburgh will feel the impact of this most. The Oxgangs area of my Ward alone will see:\n- Over ninety-thousand pounds slashed from school budgets;\n- A threat to nursery teacher posts;\n- Community policing cut,\n- Local library opening hours cut; and,\n- The unfair Council Tax will rise by almost 5%.\nMany of these cuts were proposed last year, but were blocked. With regard to removing nursery teachers, I did manage to help win the argument against it. This year, however, it is proving tougher. Below is a message I received from a nursery teacher regarding what she feels the impact will be in attainment.\nFrom a nursery teacher:\nI am writing to you regarding the Early Years Service and Management Reform proposals as stated in the City of Edinburgh Council’s Finance and Resources Committee document, to remove/redeploy nursery teachers and nursery headteachers from their posts in the City of Edinburgh Council nurseries/Early Years teams.\nEdinburgh has a long and proud tradition of providing quality nursery provision within the city. Nursery teachers and headteachers, supported today by a growing team of professionals in modern-day settings, are the reason for this internationally respected tradition. Links to the work of nursery pioneers, supported through courses at Edinburgh University, continue to inform, direct and inspire teachers today. As a nursery teacher and current student taking part in the Edinburgh University Froebel course, I can see the lasting positive impact highly trained, and educated teaching professionals have had on my own experience of attending St. Mary’s nursery in Leith, my practice as a teacher both in Scotland and internationally, my nieces and nephews education and the children in my care.\nRemoving highly trained and educated teaching professionals from nursery/Early Years teams may provide a short-term economic gain; however, the longer-term impact on future social, academic and financial issues will continue to be felt for years to come.\nThe Scottish Government’s ambition is for Scotland to be the best place to grow up. One way they wish to achieve this is to raise attainment and reduce educational inequity across Scotland. In order to accomplish this, more highly qualified teachers are needed to work with children during the most crucial periods in their development. The Scottish Government document, The Early Years Framework, states that the most critical time in a child’s life is during the pre-birth to three years period in ensuring favourable future life chances. The second period is three years to seven years. It is during these critical times that early intervention can support children and families in breaking these cycles of poor outcomes.\nThe Effective Provision of Pre-School Provision project has found that outcomes for children who attend high-quality settings before starting school achieved higher literacy and numeracy levels than those who did not. These findings are similar to those of the Field Report. The Effective Provision of Pre-School Provision project also found that:\n- quality was higher in settings where care and education were integrated,\n- settings with staff with higher qualifications had higher quality scores and the children made more significant progress,\n- having a trained teacher as manager and qualified teachers on the team led to more positive, warm relationships with the children,\n- where education and social development were viewed as complementary and equal in importance, children made more considerable progress,\n- teaching approaches such as ‘sustained shared thinking’, effective and appropriate pedagogy and instructive learning environments all extended learning,\n- children from disadvantaged backgrounds benefitted significantly, from good quality pre-school education.\nThe Scottish Government understands the importance of having highly qualified and educated teachers working with children in a measure to reduce the attainment gap and has invested in the Additional Graduate Programme. The City of Edinburgh Council proposal suggests replacing degree-qualified teachers, some with postgraduate and Masters level education, with Early Years Practitioners. The difference in qualification, educational pedagogy, training and perspective between these two very different jobs is significant. Early Years Practitioners are trained to SVQ3/HNC level, which is SCQF level 7. A degree is SCQF level 10 with subsequent postgraduate levels of 10, 11 and above. Several Scottish universities are now only offering initial teacher training at Masters level, in a bid to raise attainment and outcomes for future generations.\nRecent Care Inspectorate findings show that 4 Scottish local authorities who do not have teachers in nursery are performing well below the national average, and significantly below the City of Edinburgh Council level of 81% (West Dumbarton (32%), Moray (55%), Borders (58%) and Highland (70%)). Dundee council are increasing their numbers of nursery teachers with the aim of closing the attainment gap. Removing teachers and nursery teachers will likely remove the City of Edinburgh Council’s sector-leading status as quality nursery providers and reduce the Care Inspectorate gradings.\nIt is essential that children build stable and consistent relationships with their caregivers as a strong attachment is paramount for their cognitive development. Close working relationships between professionals are also crucial in ensuring a consistent, supportive approach. This will also be harder to develop and nurture if the teacher is not always on-site as part of the nursery team. The example from East Lothian Council has shown that peripatetic teams are not successful, as many teachers leave to work in nursery classes, leading to instability and constant change.\nThe aim to close the attainment gap while supporting all children is an enormous challenge. Ensuring that the youngest children have access to motivated, qualified and educated teachers will help in realising this challenge. I feel it would be a false economy to remove nursery teachers and headteachers from nurseries as it is here at the beginning of a child’s life that the most positive impact can be made.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_12_27_below-average-an-account-of-labours-2019-election-vote-share/content_504.html": "The simple fact is that the party with the most seats wins a General Election in the UK. Nonetheless, there is a tendency to look for other messages in the vote share. The blog is about debunking some of the myths that arise from this. I will look at total votes, vote share based on turnout and vote share based on the size of the electorate.\nTotal Votes\nThe first thing to note here is that the electorate has risen quite steadily between 1979 to 2019, but the total number of people voting has varied considerably.\nThe data shows that the Tory Party’s highest vote over the 1979-2019 period came under John Major in 1992, but in 2019 Boris Johnson came pretty close to beating it. However, Boris coming 101,651 votes short in 2019 is less impressive when you realise that the electorate grew by 4.4 million over the same period.\nWe can also see that Labour lost 2.6 million votes between 2017 and 2019 whilst the Tories gained 329,881. Indeed, despite the rising electoral roll, Labour’s performance was slightly below the average of 10.6 million for the 1997-2019 period.\nIn 2019 SNP recovered around 55% of the 476,868 votes they lost in 2017. Nationalists south of the border in 2019 also failed to reach their 2015 populist surge peak, with the combined UKIP and Brexit vote only showing a modest (12%) increase on 2017.\nVote Share (based on turnout)\nThe first thing we see is that Boris Johnson’s vote share was virtually identical to what John Major achieved in 1992 (he’s actually 0.01% short). Of course, it is bizarre that with just 44% of the votes the Tories end up with 56% of the seats.\nLabour’s vote share in 2019 was well below average for the period of 34.6%, and is almost at the same level John Major reached when defeated by Tony Blair in 1997. What is different in 2019, however, is that the Lib-Dems are substantially weakened and the SNP are now the largest party in Scotland. Nonetheless, despite the dramatic fall since 2017, Jeremy Corbyn stands down as Labour leader with a better vote share than he inherited from Ed Miliband.\nVote Share (based on total electorate)\nHere we see the impact of turnout. Whilst Boris Johnson had a similar vote share and total vote to John Major’s 1992 result, we see that where the whole electorate is concerned his vote share is far worse. Conversely, Jeremy Corbyn’s 2019 defeat had a vote share only very slight lower than that which took Tony Blair to victory in 2005.\nA lot changed between 2005 and 2019, but the problem Labour faces is turnout. The Tories know that higher turnout favours them, whereas Labour’s record is far more mixed.\nConclusion\nNo matter how you look at it, the 2019 election was a bad result for Labour. Despite a fairly average turnout, the Tories were returned to government with a substantial majority. Labour’s performance was below average for the 1997-2019 period and a substantial decline on 2017, but across the board was an improvement on 2010 and 2015.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_07_15_edinburgh-should-be-leading-on-fighting-child-poverty-not-following-others/content_595.html": "There can be no doubt that child poverty in the UK is rising. Under the Brown/Blair Government it fell dramatically as a result of very significant additional spending on benefits and tax credits. Since then, however, things have gone backwards. The number of children living in poverty is set to hit to hit 37% this year – that is more than 1 in 3 children. This exceeds the previous high of 34% recorded in the ‘90s, and should shame us all.\nThe causes of child poverty are complex and the impact long lasting, but right now the combined impact of wage stagnation, high rents, unemployment and welfare reform are combining to create the perfect storm in Edinburgh. Indeed, the ongoing Tory leadership race suggests matters may be about to worsen, as it is has already been shown that Johnson and Hunt’s tax proposals will increase child poverty.\nScotland is little different to the rest of the UK where child poverty is concerned, but but it does have the power to be more different. The Child Poverty (Scotland) Act 2017 places a duty on the Scottish Government to eradicate child poverty by 2030. Holyrood also has significant welfare powers, but have chosen to delay using them. Indeed, the Nationalist Government appeared until recently quite unwilling to use their welfare powers as a tool to tackle child poverty.\nMany people in Edinburgh supported the Poverty Alliance’s calls for the Nationalist Government to increase Child Benefit payments, and ultimately forced this to act one year earlier (2021) than planned for those under six. However, that is almost two years away and children over 6 will have to wait a further year – this is apparently “bold and ambitious“!\nWhilst kids in poor households wait for this benefit to reach their mum’s purse, poverty will manifest itself in many ways. Recently the Edinburgh Trade Union Council (ETUC) wrote to a cross-party group of Councillors raising concerns about “holiday hunger” in our capital.\nI know from my own upbringing in Kirkcaldy what holiday hunger is. The school holidays can be grim affairs for low income families as money must be found for school uniforms and to fill the space left in stomachs normally filled by free school meals. For many households in Edinburgh, this is a tough time of year.\nThe Council’s is, however, trying to address the issue via income maximisation (making sure families claim what they are entitled to) and via the excellent “Discover!” programme. This complements the diverse range of work being undertaken across the city by charities, community groups and, no doubt, grandparents. It is estimated, however, Discover! will reach less than 10% of those eligible for free school meals – and it operates only 3 days a week from just 4 hubs in our capital.\nI had hoped when I was first elected that our Capital could emulate Labour run North Lanarkshire and provide free school meals to everyone that needs it – this tiny Council operates their “Club 365” from 23 hubs. Unfortunately, my proposal to do this was not funded. Instead, “Discover!” was trialled in Oxgangs Primary School in my Ward and also elsewhere in the city in the summer of 2018. This targeted the most vulnerable households in a way that went well beyond just providing free food.\nI raised the Club 365 experience as part of the discussion stimulated by ETUC, and was appalled to see a Nationalist Councillor was silent on Council cuts and the Scottish Government’s intransigence on welfare powers, but instead focused the blame on the UK Government. I accept that the UK Government is the key driving force behind rising child poverty, but I cannot accept the Council and the Scottish Government can’t do more. Why else would the Scottish Government have a target to end child poverty? Why does the City of Edinburgh Council have the Edinburgh Poverty Commission?\nInstead of considering doing more to help the poorest children in Edinburgh, the Nationalist Councillor shared this thought:\nIt won’t surprise you that I believe to have a truly compassionate Scotland where we are able to invest in our public services, end austerity and provide support to our most vulnerable citizens we must become an independent country – able to make our own decisions about our priorities and reject the agenda of tax cuts for the rich while public services and our poorest citizens suffer.\nIn other words, rather than act now she hopes independence is the answer. This is despite no independent economist saying we’d be wealthier as a nation and their economic blueprint being labelled as a “continuation of austerity” by the IFS.\nWe have to do much more than grandstand if we really want to deal with child poverty in our Capital. As someone who grew up in a deprived household I know how difficult it can be for parents to feed their children over the summer break. I find it frustrating that some Councillors in Edinburgh publicly claim to want a “truly compassionate Scotland”, but behind the closed doors of the City Chambers repeatedly block attempts to call both the UK and Scottish Government to account on the issue like the 2 Child Cap. For them child poverty is a political tool, and they are happy for other Councils to take the lead on this.\nOnce the summer recess is over, I hope to again bring a motion to Council which will ask that we learn from Dumfries and Galloway Council, North Lancashire’s “Club 365”, North Ayrshire’s “Wrap, Run and Fun” and “Fife’s “Cafe inc“. Edinburgh should be leading on fighting child poverty, not following others.\nIn the build up to this, I have created a poll on my Facebook page and also Twitter:",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_09_14_update-braid-comiston-road-spaces-for-people-scheme-review/content_238.html": "Below is an update from Council Officers in the ongoing Braid/Comiston Road SfP Scheme review. At the foot of the blog are the notes from the Community Council workshop and the slides which informed the discussion. It looks like an interesting meeting, with two stand-out quotes:\n- The Council appears to be considering allowing parking in the cycle lanes: “it is proposed to remove the Loading restrictions along most of the length of the scheme, and provide gaps in the cycle lane defenders where possible, to provide additional loading opportunities.”\n- There is an acceptance that the road network is now less resilient when road traffic incidents occur: “Accidents can happen anywhere but they are occasional events and should not be the primary concern when planning a road network.”\nThe next step is for a survey of local people to take place. I have asked for an opportunity to comment on the questions and the area included in the survey.\nCouncil Update – Braid/Comiston Road Spaces for People Scheme Review\nAs you will be aware we recently completed a consultation exercise on the potential retention of Spaces for People measures. This was followed by the publication of the report on keeping these measures, which was considered at the meeting of the city’s Transport and Environment Committee on 17 June. The decision to retain or remove measures was based on consultation results, independent market research, a review by technical officers and consideration of how well such changes fit with the Council’s long-term transport policy objectives.\nAt this meeting it was agreed that a final decision on moving forward with the schemes should be made at the 24 June meeting of the City of Edinburgh Council.\nCouncil motion on Braid Road\nThe Council voted to approve the report, with requests from Councillors to review the Comiston Road Scheme and consider options for reopening Braid Road in both directions. Officers have been asked to engage with local residents and local Community Councils to consider:\n- options for Comiston Road, to improve public transport connectivity and reduce impacts on local residents\n- options for the reopening of the Braid Road in both directions, including analysis of impacts on traffic levels, resident connectivity and vulnerable road users walking, wheeling and cycling\nTo help us make more informed decisions, we are also currently monitoring traffic through the area, using cross-modal counters. You can read the full motion here.\nWe have commenced with the required engagement with Community Councils and Local Residents – this engagement will continue over the coming weeks through the following means.\nMeeting with Community Councils\nCouncil officers developed initial proposals which were discussed with representatives from the relevant Community Councils at a workshop on 25 August. Notes from this meeting, along with the slides which were presented, are attached.\nResidents’ Survey\nThe outcomes of this meeting in terms of proposals will be detailed in a survey on the Council’s website. Information regarding this survey will be circulated to residents on affected streets via letter drop. This will allow us to gather a good sample of opinion in the local area in relation to the changes proposed.\nThe results of survey will help us to mitigate the concerns which have been voiced regarding this scheme and will sit alongside the results from the previous consultation when elected members decide on whether this scheme should be retained in the longer term.",

Indeed, I got elected despite my own party’s guidance saying I had no chance!\nI still find it a huge privilege to have been elected to represent the community I live in and find it humbling every time a constituent asks me for help. Every day when I cycle to work from Buckstone and on through Oxgangs and Colinton I can see the impact working with local people has had over the past year.\nYes, I’ve spent a lot of time getting potholes filled, street lights fixed and bins emptied. Keeping our streets clear of litter, snow, weeds & leaves has also become a bit of an obsession. However, I focus on these “small” things so much as I feel first impressions count – the impact of getting them right is significant.\nIn addition to this work in the community, I am also hugely proud that my motion to the Children & Families Committee means that the School Clothing Grant for the most vulnerable households will soon almost double. I also know that my opposition to cuts to our libraries means that there will be no reduction in opening hours.\nLike any politician, I let people know about the things I have been doing in the community. Much of the most important work, however, can’t be spoken about in detail. This ranges from making sure a mum gets the support she needs to support her gravely ill son to trying to get a woman out of hospital to spend her final days at home and helping people who have fallen victim of Edinburgh’s chronic housing crisis.\nIt’s been a big year for me in which I’ve made a load of mistakes, but I also hope I’ve manged to make a difference.

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_04_13_its-time-for-the-snp-to-be-honest-about-pfi/content_545.html": "I’m disappointed that James Duncan and Fraser Grant chose to exploit the concerns of parents at Oxgangs Primary School in an ill-informed attempt to score cheap political points against the Labour Party (letters, 13/04/18). Yes, Labour did use PFI in the past but, unlike the SNP and Tories, we have now abandoned the failed scheme.\nIn 2006 Alex Salmond told Scotland that “PFI was a quick fix and a costly mistake”. If elected he was going to ensure “our public assets can be held in trust for the nation without the unnecessary private profit that is part and parcel of PFI”. Forget the fact that “unnecessary private profit” was never defined, this was about bashing Labour.\nIn their 2007 manifesto, the SNP said: “The Private Finance Initiative was devised by the Tories and has been embraced with enthusiasm by New Labour. However it is really a type of privatisation, with all the disadvantages which that entails.”\nOf course, the same manifesto was less clear on what the SNP alternative was. The public perception soon became that PFI was abolished.\nIn reality, it had been replaced by the SNP’s “NPD” (non-profit distributing) model. Progress was slow, but by 2011 peer reviewed research stated it came at “high economic cost”. The same paper concluded: “The argument of the Cabinet Secretary that NPD will eliminate ‘excessive profits’ is not supported by the evidence.”\nBy 2015 alarm bells began to ring quite loudly. The Guardian reported that the programme will cost the taxpayer £10 billion in borrowing and running costs between now and 2048. Little wonder that Audit Scotland have launched an inquiry into the SNP’s re-branded PFI.\nIn Edinburgh the SNP have procured everything from the new Sick Kids Hospital (now 6 years behind schedule!) to the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service HQ using their version of PFI.\nScottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has pledged to end the use of SNP PFI funding when he becomes Scotland’s next First Minister. I hope James Duncan and Fraser Grant can set aside party differences and back him on that.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_01_22_briefing-edinburghs-bin-crisis/content_704.html": "Below is a briefing issued by the Transport & Environment Convener (Cllr Lesley Macinnes, SNP councillor for Liberton Gilmerton) which expands on a comment she made on Twitter last week.\nAs you will be only too aware, there have been considerable difficulties in the delivery of our waste services to Edinburgh residents, compounded recently by additional pressure from this year’s festive period. I have made it absolutely clear to senior officers that this situation has been completely unacceptable and that immediate further action must be taken to rectify the situation. Edinburgh residents have the right to expect reliable levels of service and to receive a swift response when they have cause to get in touch with the Council.\nI asked officers to come forward with a series of priority actions designed to return us quickly to acceptable, sustainable service levels. These actions have been completed or are ongoing and include:\n- Reviewing our processes to ensure missed collection reports from residents are actioned within target timescales – currently two working days but I have asked officers to investigate the potential for reducing this timescale.\n- A realignment of resource that will allow the service to catch up on delayed collections on the scheduled day of collection or the day after – this is already in place on an interim basis but we will look to make it more permanent to improve the resilience of the service.\n- Improving the way we report delayed collections to residents so that this information is more accurate and timely – using all available channels: online, social media, email, text message\n- An interim review of communal recycling routes to improve reliability and performance pending completion of the wider communal redesign project.\n- Undertaking a lessons-learned review of festive collections in 2018 and providing me with a clear plan for 2019 that avoids the issues we have experienced recently.\n- A review of the services which we offer during the festive period and the bench-marking of these services against other local authorities.\n- A timeline showing the remaining actions required to open our new waste transfer stations to support service delivery.\nFollowing robust discussions with senior officials I have made it clear that these actions must be implemented effectively and produce significant improvements in service delivery. In addition, I have requested that two key reports emerge from this unsatisfactory period. They will examine both the lessons learned from the changes to service delivery and from the festive period.\nYou will, of course, be interested to know what the current position is.\nThe backlog across the city has now mainly been dealt with, although there will be a few pockets of remedial work to undertake, and the service has gone into this week fully on schedule.\nThere will, of course, still be some further issues, such as Christmas tree stragglers, with which to contend in the coming weeks.\nAs a result of the actions described above and a sustained effort within the service, the weekly waste missed bin requests have shown a significant drop of over 45% in the last week. They have returned to levels below the 2016 figures for the same week (1,972 during the last week). We have also seen a further improvement in numbers over the last weekend, as missed bin complaints have been dealt with.\nThis is clearly a position which must be maintained and, indeed, further improved and I have insisted on extremely close monitoring of progress as we move through the next few weeks.\nI am, of course, very aware of the pressures that this situation has produced for councillors in handling residents’ entirely justified complaints and concerns. If you continue to feel that there are further issues which should be addressed please feel free to bring them to my attention as well as to that of the service.\nThe most important task to emerge from this situation is rebuilding the trust of Edinburgh residents in their waste collection service and this will only be achieved by sustained excellence within day-to-day operations. This is a point I have made clearly and forcefully to senior officers and which I expect to be front and centre of everyone’s minds as we move forward. The agreed change to a four day collection system was precisely to build in greater reliability for residents, with regular crews familiar with specific routes and a faster resolution of issues. We now need to see that develop over the next few months to a position where residents can feel much more certain that the council is delivering a complex waste collection system effectively.\nAlongside this effort within service delivery, there are several key strategic developments due to be delivered or progressed through 2019 and I have invited members of the Transport and Environment committee to undertake an informative tour of various relevant projects and sites next week.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_04_27_edinburgh-polling-station-briefing/content_623.html": "With the EU Election fast approaching, I have had a few e-mails this week about the location of Polling Stations. Ironically the Council was about to commission a full review of Polling Stations (including a public consultation), but that has now been delayed due to the unexpected (but welcome) EU Election! Below is a briefing from the Council on the issue.\nYou should check your Polling Card, but as far as I know the polling stations in my Ward are as listed here.\nBriefing:\nPolling Places are determined by decision of Council. The Council has a responsibility to split each ward into Polling Districts and then allocate a Polling Place per District. Those selected are the most accessible and well located buildings in the area. The focus is on the voter trying to ensure that as many voters as possible turn out to vote by providing them with a well sited building that is easy to access and sufficiently large for the voters who are allocated there.\nBy law the Council has to review its allocation of polling places periodically. The last full review of the Polling Arrangements in Edinburgh was in 2013. The next review is scheduled for later this year. It was due to be initiated in this Spring, but the European Parliamentary Elections have delayed that. When the new review starts there will full public consultation with an opportunity to propose new venues. Staff in the elections team constantly review provision and take account of objections and complaints. Where schools are used they will have been determined to be the most appropriate venue in terms of location, capacity and access. Until then we will be using the Polling Places that the Council has previously identified. Changes would be subject to a decision of Council or an emergency decision taken by the Lord Provost and Chief Exec.\nIn the Election Team we do appreciate the disruption that can be caused to children’s education by the closure of schools to allow polling. I am also aware of the impact on parents and carers who need to arrange alternative childcare. However, the Council has identified polling places that serve the electors of a local area in an effort to support democracy and promote participation. We are also aware that changing polling places can impact negatively on turnout so that is also considered.\nYou will be aware that for scheduled election the Council has made an effort to align in service training days with polling day. However, for unscheduled events such as this, unfortunately it is necessary to close the schools that are used as polling places.\nFinally I would note that Poll Cards have now been printed and will be posted this week so we it is now too late to change the polling places that have been identified for these elections.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_12_27_edinburgh-secure-cycle-parking-briefing-note/content_404.html": "Below is a briefing from the Council on the introduction of secure cycle storage.\nIntroduction\n1.1 The issue of residential bike parking is a particularly significant problem for Edinburgh, where here is a high proportion of tenemental properties which have limited space available for bike parking.\n1.2 A scheme to provide secure cycle parking units to alleviate this issue has been introduced in the city.\n1.3 This note provides the information requested by Committee on the details of the scheme, including finances.\nBackground\n2.1 On 21 February 2012, the Transport, Infrastructure and Environment Committee approved a pilot project to trial the installation of covered, on-street, and secure cycle parking for use by residents. The trial scheme started in August 2014 on Lonsdale Terrace, Warrender Park Terrace, South Oxford Street and Douglas Crescent.\n2.2 The trial aimed to alleviate the problem of cycle storage within tenements and to make cycling an easier option for leisure or the daily commute. The trial units have been fully utilised since installation and there are significant waiting lists at each site.\n2.3 On the back of this success a report on the outcomes of the trial was considered by the Transport and Environment Committee on 1 November 2016 and approval was given to roll out the scheme.\n2.4 On 4 October 2018 the Committee approved an increase to the previously approved roll out, along with recommended changes to the contract for installation, management and maintenance of the units.\nMain Points\n3.1 The contract for the roll-out of the secure cycle parking units has been awarded to Cyclehoop Ltd for a five year period (with the option of a further year’s extension). The value of the contract is £576,000.00.\nThe contract is for the supply and installation of 180 units within the first two years of the contract, with each unit capable of storing six bikes. They will also be responsible for the management and maintenance of the units for the period of the contract.\n3.3 Users will pay a monthly charge of £5 to use this service, in addition to an initial deposit. From this, the supplier will set aside £1 per month for each filled space which, based on 80% occupancy of 180 units, would create an annual income of £10,368.00 for the Council. This income will be ring-fenced to assist with the cost of any major repairs not allowed for within the contract and/or potential future expansion of the scheme.\n3.4 A desktop review and site visits has now been undertaken for all locations suggested by residents. The sites where it is proposed to proceed with installations have been identified and consultations have now concluded.\n3.5 For each location, letters were sent to all businesses/residents likely to be impacted directly, up to a maximum distance of 50m, and to ward Councillors and the Community Council. All feedback received will be carefully considered and action will be taken where it is possible to mitigate any issues raised. If there is a significant level of opposition, a decision on the continued progression of a site will be made in consultation with the Convener and Vice Convener of Transport and Environment. Successful sites will then be progressed to installation or commencement of the Traffic Regulation Order (TRO) process, as appropriate.\n3.6 Work has been underway to ensure co-ordination of this project with other parking changes including Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) extensions and the ongoing review of on-street bin locations. Following this, it is proposed to advertise the TRO for around 60 streets in early January 2020, leaving around 17 locations to run concurrently with the CPZ extension phases 1 and 2 TRO in March 2020. This will avoid any duplication of TRO processes and minimise delays to all initiatives.",

I spoke to them specifically about the damage done to the habitat along the verge on Torduff Road (left). They say the verge is co-owned by the Council and a private landowner, with the former owning the strip along the edge of the road. The private landlord would not allow the pipeline to be placed to the south of the hedgerow (s/he is considering installing a solar farm), so it has to go along the verge/road to the north. They have given a clear commitment to replant the area once the work is complete.\nPROJECT MAKING EDINBURGH’S WATER SUPPLY MORE RESILIENT THIRD WAY THROUGH\nA £20 million project to make the drinking water network in the city and beyond more resilient is more than a third complete.\nScottish Water has installed just over 4 km – out of total 12 km – of brand new mains in the southern part of the city which supplies much of Edinburgh and parts of West Lothian.\nThe investment will allow customers to be supplied from two different locations – Glencorse and Marchbank Water Treatment Works – making it less likely that they are left without water.\nThe extended network will also have the capacity to link to other existing and future water supplies across parts of the south of Scotland. It will ensure Scottish Water can provide its customers in Scotland’s capital city, including a growing number of households and businesses, supplied with fresh water around the clock.\nThe network expansion across part of the Pentland Hills – some of it visible from the city bypass and the A702 near Hillend – and has included working in areas where World War One training trenches were constructed. Work is also being carried out in part of the Swanston Conservation Area where any work taking place in April and July must requires extra care and consideration due to lambing season and ground nesting birds.\nThere are a number of burns and streams which run nearby the planned route and all the work being carried out in these areas will take account of salmon spawning season, which Scottish Water continues to liaise with SEPA about.\nWithin the Pentland Hills Regional Park, Dreghorn Woods has been designated by Woodland Trust Scotland as a First World War Centenary Wood. The park must be kept open to the public at all times during construction and measures have been taken to allow the public continued access to the park.\nPark users have praised the Scottish Water and our Alliance Partner Caledonia Water Alliance (CWA) – which is carrying out the work – for the care and attention taken to keep access open in areas where pipes are being laid. Mrs Gillian Brydon, a local businesswoman, got in touch with Scottish Water to say she was “delighted” the route she walked with her dog remained open despite pipes being laid there.\nMrs Brydon, of Edinburgh, uses the route at least three times a week to walk her five-year-old Collie-Labrador cross, Poppy, who is a specially trained search and rescue dog. She commented: “Everywhere the team are working, they make sure metal gates are put up to keep as much access as possible. It is clear they are thinking about people who use the area – dog walkers like me, walkers, runners, cyclists – and it means we can still do our favourite walks. I think this is very much appreciated by everyone who uses the area.”\nAnother Edinburgh resident, who owns horses in the Swanston area, also praised the delivery team for ensuring the temporary signs and notices put up in the area were secure and did not move or flap about creating noises which could frighten the horses.\nThe work includes single and twin pipes – all of which are bright blue and visible on areas of land across the area – being laid to connect Marchbank Water Treatment Works near Balerno and Glencorse Water Treatment Works, south of the city.\nIt is hoped the pipework will be completed by the end of summer after which the area will be reinstated with the work due to be completed by the end of the year.\nOne of the biggest challenges for the team on the ground has been working under the High Voltage Powerlines which cross and follow much of the route of the pipeline. As a result of this CWA arranged overhead cable posts to be setup along the working area as required and height restrictors were also fitted to machinery used on site to minimise the risk of any overhead cable strikes while construction works are underway.\nProject Manager James Kerr, of CWA, said: “We are making good progress with pipe laying activities and are working closely with people who live, work or visit the areas where we are working and make every effort to cause as little disruption as possible. We also recognise that this project comprises a significant investment in the ongoing strategic objectives developed by Scottish Water to provide security of supply to customers both locally and further afield.\n“One example of this is how many walkers in the area have been interacting with teams on site and have said they are pleased the work has not restricted their activities due to the amount of crossing points we have put in alongside the pipeline.”\nScottish Water has liaised extensively with landowners and businesses as well as a range of organisations including Pentland Hills Regional Park and Edinburgh City Council. One example is how the utility has worked with Bonaly Primary School to ensure disruption, including noise or heavy load traffic, is kept to a minimum during busy periods.\nScottish Water’s Director of Capital Investment, Mark Dickson, said: “This major investment will make the drinking water supply in Scotland’s capital and a number of areas nearby far more resilient. Any interruption to the drinking water supply can significantly impact our customers and this project should help minimise this.”\n“From the outset we have been mindful of the number of people impacted by this – including landowners, local businesses and walkers – and thank everyone for their patience and understanding while work is carried out.”\nMore than 170,000 people – residents and businesses – in Edinburgh and West Lothian will benefit from this investment of in their drinking water network.\nScottish Water is committed to minimising disruption and will keep residents, businesses, landowners and land users – including hill walkers using the Pentland Hills – notified of where the work is being carried out and any diversions in place.\nThis project is over and above a £29.5 million investment programme of works by Scottish Water to improve Edinburgh’s water and wastewater systems.\nMarchbank Water Treatment Works takes water from Megget Reservoir – 28 miles away in the Borders – and makes it safe for our customers to use. It uses an ultramodern Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) process which allows raw water to be treated to a much better standard.\nGlencorse Water Treatment Works supplies water to up to 450,000 customers across Edinburgh and parts of Midlothian, with the capacity to provide up to 175 million litres of water every day.",

I hope the Firefighter makes a full and rapid recovery, but my thoughts are also with those that live and work in the area.\nCouncil Briefing\nAs you will probably be aware from local media, fire fighters have spent much of today tackling a large blaze on George IV Bridge.\nIt is believed to have begun in the Patisserie Valerie café early this morning and at least one of the floors in the building has collapsed as a result.\nRegrettably, one firefighter from the scene was hospitalised, although we have subsequently been updated that they are okay.\nCouncil officers continue to work closely with the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, along with Police Scotland and the Scottish Ambulance Service, to respond and to minimise any disruption.\nRoads officers have put a safety cordon around the affected areas and effected necessary road closures, which are likely to remain in force for the remainder of today and are likely to continue into tomorrow.\nThe closures are as follows:\n- George IV Bridge from junction with Royal Mile to junction with Chambers Street\n- Chambers Street to Guthrie Street\n- Victoria Street\n- Candlemaker Row\n- Merchant Street\nUnfortunately, the Central Library will remain closed for as long as the cordon is in place.\nThe Resilience and Communications teams are continuing to liaise with the relevant agencies and Shared Repairs officers are on site to offer structural engineering advice.\nThere has been no request to open a rest centre and we are advised that the residential lets affected by the cordon have now been reallocated to alternative properties via the lettings agent.\nGroup Leaders and City Centre Ward Councillors have been kept updated on the incident.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_07_20_edinburgh-and-south-east-scotland-city-region-deal-heads-of-terms-agreement/content_251.html": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n- The Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region comprises the six local authorities of City of Edinburgh, Fife, East Lothian, Midlothian, Scottish Borders and West Lothian. It is one of the most prosperous and productive UK regions and includes Scotland’s iconic capital city, recognised worldwide for its culture, history and architecture.\n- The city region has a population of approximately 1.4 million people, more than a quarter of the Scottish population. Regional partners calculate that it contributes over £33 billion per year to the Scottish and UK economies.\n- A key driver for the investment in this deal is the opportunity to address inclusion across the region. Prosperity and success is not universal across the region: 21% of children are living in poverty; there is a lack of mid-market and affordable housing; and too many people are unable to move on from low wage/low skill jobs. The deal will address these issues, create new economic opportunities, and is expected to provide over 21,000 new jobs. The region’s new skills programme, alongside improved transport and housing provision, will ensure that businesses and communities across the region will benefit and will be given the chance to take advantage of these exciting new opportunities.\n- Since Spring 2016, the Scottish and UK Governments have been working with local partners to develop a transformational and inclusive city deal for the region that will:\n- Build on the city region’s strengths such as its high growth sectors that will provide the jobs of the future, its world class universities that are working with businesses on ground breaking R&D and innovation and Edinburgh’s world class cultural offer.\n- Address key economic barriers with significant new investment in housing and transport.\n- Address issues which are constraining the region’s economic potential and which match the strategic priorities for growth as outlined in the Scottish Government’s Economic Strategy and the UK Government’s emerging Industrial Strategy.\n- This heads of terms city deal is a tripartite agreement between the Scottish Government, the UK Government and regional partners. Both Governments are committed to jointly investing up to £600m over the next 15 years subject to:\n- approval of final business cases for all projects and programmes;\n- development of a final city deal document and implementation plan;\n- establishment of clear and robust governance arrangements; and\n- the consent of all constituent local authorities and partners.\n- Regional partners have committed to contributing up to £501m to match fund the joint commitment from both governments. Overall this represents a deal worth over £1.1bn of investment.\n- This document represents a “heads of terms” agreement. Further detail on the implementation of specific commitments will follow in a finalised City Deal document. This heads of terms document has been produced for the purposes of outlining the principles of the deal and does not form a legally binding contract.\nTHE COMMITMENTS\nRESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND INNOVATION PROGRAMME\n- Innovation is the lifeblood of the region’s economy. The region is already home to world class research and development activity, much of which acts as an anchor for the development of new products and services through innovation in the private sector.\n- In Edinburgh city centre, approximately 2,400 people are employed in 570 technology led businesses, in close proximity to the University of Edinburgh. Growth has been impressive, with an increase of 58% and 48% in GVA and turnover respectively between 2010-14. Both Governments and local partners recognise the potential to further accelerate the development of key sectors (e.g. data science, robotics, financial services and fintech, agritech, the creative and digital sectors) and to ensure the benefits of this growth are spread across the region.\n- As such the UK Government, Scottish Government and local partners have agreed a transformational Research, Development and Innovation programme (RD&I) for the city region. This will drive further growth in the above sectors of the city region’s economy and will support wider reform and improvement in public service provision.\nKey commitments include\n- The UK Government and the Scottish Government will provide up to £350m of capital funding over a fifteen-year period to support the development of:\n- Data storage and analysis technology that will allow large datasets to be brought together, in a secure environment, from public and private sector organisations. This data analysis repository will allow the development of new products and services within key sectors. It will be based at the UK’s National Supercomputer Centre at Easter Bush and will be connected to a region-wide Internet of Things (IoT) network.\n- Five RD&I sectoral hubs that will draw on the data repository and support RD&I activity in key sectors.\n- The Bayes Centre for data, a facility adjacent to the existing School of Informatics which will provide shared working spaces for world-leading applied researchers, students, existing data science institutes and industry to drive data-driven Innovation.\n- The Quartermile Old Royal Infirmary will bring together researchers, businesses and key public sector organisations to drive RDI& in financial services, fintech, creative and media technology, tourism and public service provision\n- The Usher Institute building within Edinburgh’s Bio-Quarter will house a centre for utilising data at scale to support data-driven health research, medical informatics and population health sciences.\n- The National Robotarium will be co-located on the Heriot-Watt University campus. It will offer access to leading-edge applied research in autonomous systems, sensor technologies, existing micro-assembly equipment. The Robotarium will also have access to the resources of both Heriot-Watt and Edinburgh Universities.\n- Scaled-up incubation space for bioscience businesses and specialist facilities at Easter Bush, delivering alignment with the Roslin Institute’s research excellence in agritech and extensive industry partnerships.\n- A Food & Drink Innovation Campus located at Queen Margaret University which will enhance and grow the nation’s food and drink sector. This will stimulate economic growth based on both national and international markets.\n- An Edinburgh and South East Scotland programme of investment in economic infrastructure, to ensure that businesses and communities across the region are fully able to engage in the data driven innovation opportunities including industrial and business premises, to ensure maximum impact from the innovation investment. Local partners and the private sector will invest significant additional funding to deliver key regional economic priorities including new industrial and business premises at Tweedbank and across Fife.\n- Complementing the Government investment, the private sector and local partners will invest £52m of capital funding to support the development of the RD&I hubs and a further £201m over a 10-year period, to provide a university-led innovation support programme that will:\n- support companies to undertake RD&I activities in the RD&I sectoral hubs;\n- support research and commercialisation of new products and services;\n- create and deliver new Higher Education courses; and\n- support the development of a new generation of entrepreneurs – working in key sectors.\nEMPLOYABILITY & SKILLS\n- The Scottish Government’s recent Enterprise and Skills Review identified opportunities to strengthen regional delivery to achieve better outcomes.\n- Key commitments include:\n- The Scottish Government will support the city region partners to stimulate active collaboration to deliver better outcomes for all of the region and particularly those people facing significant disadvantages to securing and sustaining meaningful, high quality employment.\n- The Scottish Government will invest up to £25m (over eight years) in the regional partnership to deliver an Integrated Regional Employability & Skills Programme. This will reduce skills shortages and gaps, and deliver incremental system-wide improvements to boost the flow of individuals from disadvantaged groups (e.g. young care leavers, workless, and those in low paid or insecure jobs) into the good career opportunities that will be generated through the city region deal investment. This will deliver better impact from existing public, private and third sector investments.\nTRANSPORT\n- This deal will deliver major investments to ensure that Scotland’s capital and its region is served by world class transport infrastructure. The recently published SESplan Cross-Boundary Study of the region has helped to show where transport investment will be most effectively targeted.\n- Partners will put in place a regional developer contributions framework which takes account of work being led by SESplan and the emerging findings of the jointly-produced Cross-Boundary Study. These interventions and commitments, taken with the additional transport investment to enable the innovation and housing projects, will help ensure the city region continues to grow and flourish.\n- Key commitments include:\n- The Scottish Government will invest up to £120m to support improvements to the A720 City Bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout.\n- The Scottish Government will provide £20m investment to support public transport infrastructure improvements identified by the West Edinburgh Transport Appraisal, alongside investment from partners and the private sector.\n- The Scottish Government commits to continuing to work collaboratively with the city region partners on identified regionally-led local transport investment priorities through the establishment of a Transport Appraisal Working group, with an agreed and mutually shared remit and proposed outcomes. Partners will have the opportunity to be involved in and influence the second Strategic Transport Projects Review.\nCULTURE\n- Scotland’s capital city has a world-class cultural offer which is vital in attracting around four million visitors a year who inject £1.3 billion to the region’s economy. The new concert hall unlocked through this city deal will deliver £40m private sector investment and make a significant contribution to the ongoing success of Edinburgh’s cultural offer.\n- Key commitments include:\n- Both Governments will provide up to £10m each (a maximum of £20m) of capital funding to support the delivery of a new IMPACT concert hall that will reinforce Edinburgh’s position as a pre-eminent Festival City.\nHOUSING\n- As part of this deal, a regional housing programme recognises the very significant housing pressures across the region and the need to provide suitable housing to support sustainable economic growth.\n- The regional partners have committed, supported by the Scottish Government to deliver a 10-year ambitious programme of new housing across the region, delivering certainty to SMEs and maximising the economic benefit from the construction process through a substantial increase in off-site construction methods. This will be supported by existing training programmes through the Construction Scotland Innovation Centre.\n- This joint approach between local partners and Scottish Government will support the delivery of significant numbers of new homes across the region. Key to this scale of delivery is the unlocking of 7 strategic sites. These are Winchburgh, Blindwells, Edinburgh’s Waterfront, Calderwood, Shawfair, Tweedbank and Dunfermline.\n- The Scottish Government will support this delivery with the following key commitments:\n- Build on the recently committed additional £125 million between 2018/19-2020/21 to support the regional partners’ 10-year affordable housing programme – subject to successful progress on this initial phase. Work on the next phase of the programme and the associated funding profile beyond 2020/21 to achieve agreed outcomes will begin in 2018.\n- Guarantee on a risk-sharing basis alongside West Lothian Council, up to £150m of infrastructure investment that will unlock up to 5,000 new homes in Winchburgh, West Lothian.\n- Prioritise and work with Local Authorities on a site by site basis to support Local Authority borrowing and share the financing risk of infrastructure delivery required across these sites – learning from the Winchburgh approach.\n- Provide housing infrastructure funding of up to £50m, of predominantly private sector loans, to be spent on projects that will unlock housing in strategic development sites across the region and which will build upon the regional strengths in off-site construction creating new economic and export opportunities.\n- Provide a financing and funding package comprised of consent to on-lend up to £248m and an additional one-off £15m capital grant to enable City of Edinburgh Council to establish a new city region housing company to deliver a minimum of 1,500 homes at mid-market rent and competitive market rent levels.\n- Both Governments will also work with regional partners to maximise the potential contribution of public sector land and property in the region to help unlock further new housing.\n- These interventions will be linked to inclusive growth objectives through the creation of new jobs in deprived areas with investment linked to training opportunities.\nGOVERNANCE AND ASSURANCE\n- Strong and effective leadership and governance is paramount to both successful implementation and in providing assurance to governments, local authorities and wider regional partners. To date, the city region deal has been developed through joint working by the region’s local authorities and two consortiums, one for the business community and one for Higher and Further Education establishments, led by Edinburgh University.\nKey commitments include:\n- Local partners will demonstrate the value for money case for each project and programme before funding is made available. As such, all commitments in this document are subject to the approval of final business cases from the relevant Government, or from both Governments in the case of jointly funded projects.\n- Partners will establish a new model of regional governance that will encompass the best practice approaches identified within the regional partnerships work stream of phase 2 of the Enterprise and Skills Review. Following the recommendations of the Enterprise and Skills Review the model will focus on the needs of the area and will include an integral role for the private and third sectors. The new regional governance will include effective engagement with Scottish Enterprise, Skills Development Scotland and incorporate senior business and industry leadership. In respect of the Scottish Borders, the announcement of the South of Scotland Enterprise Agency will require Scottish Borders Council, all Agencies and Government to take an approach that ensures an effective fit between the governance for the City Deal and the statutory nature of the new Agency.\n- The Scottish Government is developing an Inclusive Growth monitoring framework which will incorporate clear indicators to measure progress towards the five high level inclusive growth outcomes (Economic Performance and Productivity, Labour Market Access, Fair Work, People, and Place) and will expect the City Deal evaluation and monitoring reports to align with this.\n- Local partners will work with both the UK Government and the Scottish Government to develop a final City Deal document, detailed implementation plan with monitoring and evaluation frameworks and associated business cases for all projects and/or programmes receiving funding from the UK and/or Scottish Governments.\n- Local partners will work with both the UK Government and Scottish Government to agree a communications strategy and an operating protocol. Both documents will set out how communications about the city deal and its associated activities are taken forward, in a way that meet the needs of the regional partners as well as the UK and Scottish Governments.\nENDS",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2024_07_20_my-first-week-as-your-mp_comment-page-1/content_348.html": "My first week as the MP for Edinburgh South West was absolutely incredible, and I c It really has been an incredible week for me, marking the start of a new chapter in my life. It’s like first day at high school – you know some people, the rules aren’t clear and you can’t help getting lost. The added complexity is that the school looks like Hogwarts! I hope, however, that Parliament never becomes a normal place for any MP. We have a duty to stay grounded in our constituencies and only use Parliament as a tool to improve them. That’s certainly my plan!\nan’t resist sharing some details.\nIt started at the election count. My agent, Councillor Stephen Jenkinson, and I always thought the seat was winnable, but we believed it would take two election cycles to close the 33% lead the SNP’s Joanna Cherry had over Labour in 2019. However, the response on the doorstep from the start of our campaign suggested the gap could be closed – though we hardly dared believe it.\nAs the ballot boxes were emptied, we quickly noticed that we had a very marginal lead across most of the constituency. A quick chat with Joanna Cherry around 2:30 a.m. confirmed she had drawn the same conclusion. We just had to wait for the votes to be counted.\nBy 5:30 a.m., I was holding a healthy majority of 6,217 (13.6%) and an envelope marked “Member of Parliament.” Inside was a letter confirming I was expected in Parliament just three days later. Within a few hours, Parliament had arranged my travel and hotel.\nAfter just 60 minutes of sleep, my wife drove me to Glasgow on Friday morning to meet Scottish Labour’s other 36 MPs. At this meeting, Anas Sarwar and his team proudly briefed us on what would happen next.\nI spent Saturday with my family and activists, and on Sunday, the congregation at my church prayed for me – an incredibly moving moment. Following this, I met the other Scottish Labour MPs in central Edinburgh, this time with Anas Sarwar and the Prime Minister. This was another incredible moment – they had transformed our party and made it electable again.\nThe next day, I entered Parliament for the first time. I arrived at 10 a.m., and from the very first moment, I was made to feel incredibly welcome by the staff. I am aware that not all MPs have always treated staff well, but I am mindful that I can get nothing done without their support.\nI was met my buddy for a three-hour tour and induction – covering everything from personal safety to visiting the Chamber and having lunch in the Members’ Tea Room, which has separate seating for government and opposition MPs.\nFollowing this, I attended a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party – all 412 of us. The group is too big for any room available in Parliament, so we met in Church House (the Church of England HQ). This meeting was incredible – we were the government, and the people trusted us to serve the country.\nI attended the Chamber on Tuesday morning for a training session, and the new Labour MPs alone managed to more than fill the government benches. I was always told that the House of Commons Chamber is smaller than it looks on TV, and it absolutely is. The Scottish Labour MPs had to leave the training a little early as the Prime Minister had asked to meet us, along with Anas Sarwar and Jackie Baillie.\nWalking along Downing Street was an amazing feeling. We were asked to be purposeful on the way in, so I had to resist the temptation to pat Larry, the Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office. The door opened for us, and we walked up the famous stairs to meet the Prime Minister – a breathtaking experience. The meeting was a chance to talk about how Scotland would benefit from a Labour government and what we could expect from the King’s Speech. The meeting proved that the promise of Scottish Labour MPs being at the heart of the change the government is delivering was being fulfilled.\nThat afternoon, we appointed Sir Lindsay Hoyle as the Speaker. I arrived 15 minutes early for this, but soon discovered that any chance of being squeezed into a seat was already gone. Standing in the Chamber, however, gave me a great view of the process. I can’t say I fully understood what was happening, but it was a great introduction to how energy can quickly build in the Chamber.\nWith the Speaker appointed, we could now be sworn in as MPs. This is done by seniority and length of service, so I was towards the back of the queue. When I was eventually sworn in around midday on Wednesday, it felt like I had officially become an MP – an incredibly humbling moment. The next big event will be my “maiden speech” – usually uncontroversial, brief, and including a tribute to my predecessor in the seat, irrespective of party, and favourable remarks about the constituency.\nI also need to focus on perhaps the most important issue – setting up my constituency hub in Edinburgh South West. This is key to supporting local residents and businesses, but it is likely to take several weeks.\nIt really has been an incredible week for me, marking the start of a new chapter in my life. It’s like first day at high school – you know some people, the rules aren’t clear and you can’t help getting lost. The added complexity is that the school looks like Hogwarts! I hope, however, that Parliament never becomes a normal place for any MP. We have a duty to stay grounded in our constituencies and only use Parliament as a tool to improve them. That’s certainly my plan!",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_07_19_parking-issues-in-portobello-and-the-pressure-warm-weather-places-on-staff/content_169.html": "There is no doubt the sunny weather we’ve seen this week leads to lots of people flocking to our parks, and beauty spots like the Pentland Hills and Portobello. It’s great that so many people want to enjoy all that’s on offer, but the influx of visitors can, of course, put pressure on areas like this.\nI want to minimize disruption to residents and keep our roads and pavements safe. In Portobello specifically, I have asked the Council to undertake extra visits to deter inconsiderate and dangerous parking after a resident complained yesterday. Unfortunately, many of the streets there are unrestricted so the Council can’t carry out enforcement, but I would urge people to report any irresponsible driving to the police. The case for the much-awaited pavement parking ban has never been stronger.\nThis weather, and the boost in people out enjoying the sun, can put an extra strain on our services which are delivered within limited resources, and we also must rely on the public to take responsibility by disposing of litter at the next available bin, taking care with BBQs and, of course, parking and driving safely – or ideally consider taking the bus, walking or cycling to the park or beach if possible. That way we can all enjoy our summer together.\nLastly, I would like to thank the waste, parks and traffic teams for all the work they are doing to keep as safe throughout the heatwave. Their job is difficult all year round, but this heat makes it for more difficult. These staff are asking the Scottish Government for a fair pay rise right now, and they earned it over the last day or two.\nIn the coming months I hope to consider carefully any mismatch between the resources available to these teams, and public expectations of service delivery. This must, however, be done within the planned Scottish Government cut to Edinburgh’s budget.\nIn-terms on the more general impact warmer weather can have on council services, a briefing is below.\nWarmer Weather Pressures on Parks, Waste, Cleansing, Parking, etc\nParks – increased footfall in our parks, resulting in increased littering, damage to parks in some cases (e.g. BBQs scorching of grass), anti social behaviour and an increased need for Rangers to focus on water safety issues (e.g. at the Pentlands reservoirs). We try to undertake additional collections of litter bins, but the increased demands within parks are not usually compensated for in reductions in ‘day to day’ work – this also still needs to be done. Alongside this, we also have to focus additional resources on watering young trees and bedding areas.\nWaste – the main impact in waste is on the welfare of our staff. We need to ensure that they are kept safe in the warm weather and don’t get adversely affected by the heat. This can sometimes mean that there are delays in collections, but we are not seeing that at any scale just now.\nCleansing – as with Parks, the additional demands of managing litter in our open spaces and beaches places a big demand on the cleansing service, with no respite elsewhere – there is still the need to clean the city centre (where more people tend to eat outside in the warm weather and drop more litter), deal with littering and fly tipping complaints, and to ensure that we don’t lose control of cleanliness in our residential areas by over-committing resource to the areas that are busiest due to the warm weather.\nUnfortunately, in the case of Parks and Cleansing, we don’t have access to a supply of additional staff that can provide assistance at short notice, so it invariably means that some other work has to be sacrificed in order to focus on the hotspot areas.\nParking – this is one of the most challenging areas to respond to, as we simply don’t have enough resource to cover all of the areas where people would like us to focus. Whilst we can guess the areas which will be busy, we can’t always be clear on the mode of transport that people will use to get there. As we saw in Portobello yesterday, a lot of people arrived in cars and parked inconsiderately and, in some cases, dangerously. Unfortunately, a lot of the parking issues (pavement parking, double parking etc) were not on regulated streets (where we have a TRO in place and can enforce) and therefore require Police attention – Police colleagues also have a finite resource to work with and tend to need to focus on preventing anti-social and criminal behaviour at the Promenade area as this priority.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_08_21_why-the-forthcoming-budget-may-call-into-question-the-very-existence-of-the-current-coalition-governing-edinburgh/content_696.html": "Daniel Johnson MSP is correct, Edinburgh is a city where we pay the Council more and get less in return (report, 21/08/18). Parking charges are up, but our roads and footpaths are cratered with potholes. Community Centre charges have increased, but opening hours have been cut. We are being forced to pay for garden waste collection, but litter bins are overflowing.\nCouncil Tax has increased 3 times in two years, but social care is at breaking point and words can’t really describe the impact of that on the older generation who made this city what it is today.\nThis is not the fault of the Council’s staff. The problem is that despite us paying more, the Scottish Government cuts and unfunded pay rises they are keen to take credit for mean we still can’t make ends meet. We know that in the 5 years since 2013-14, funding for day-to-day council spending from the SNP Government has decreased by 7.1% but the UK Government only cut the Scottish Government’s revenue budget by 1.8%.\nOn average across Scotland, the SNP have cut Council spending by £148 per person, but in Edinburgh the cut has been even greater – £226 per person.\nLike my Grannie Bess used to say: “You can’t get more for less, you get what you pay for.”\nEdinburgh’s Labour Councillors stand with residents across out Capital in demanding that Edinburgh gets the funding it needs. Indeed, we stand with Daniel Johnson MSP in doing so.\nIt is staggering that SNP Councillors choose to attack those that stand up for Edinburgh rather than join us in calling for Scotland’s Capital to get the funding and powers it needs.\nEvery single Labour Councillor was elected on a pledge to stand up for their Ward and our Capital. The willingness of SNP Councillors simply to pass on cuts from their masters in Holyrood to the people of Edinburgh is in sharp contrast to that solemn pledge and must call into question the very existence of the current coalition governing Edinburgh.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_11_07_update-lanark-road-braid-road-spaces-for-people-schemes/content_450.html": "The Evening News is today reporting that it has been briefed by the Council that the Transport Committee will next week “rubber stamp” the Lanark Road Spaces for People scheme and the continued closure of Braid Road. This is despite the final plans and the details of the recent consultation not yet having been made public.\nLanark Road\nOvernight the “Spaces for People Update – November 2020” report appeared on the Council’s website. For the Lanark Road scheme, the Council is now publicly stating what I reported on the 28th of October – the aim is “to provide a safe, protected cycling route as an alternative to the canal\ntowpath and Water of Leith shared use path...”.\nFinalised plans are not presented. Indeed, the scheme is described simply using 13 bullet points. It is claimed that the scheme will “form part of a longer route intended to provide an alternative to the Water of Leith and Union Canal towpath to enable physical distancing and reduce congestion and conflict on these busy routes…”, but no details of this are provided. The recent consultation gets no mention.\nBraid Report\nThe Braid Road closure also gets a mention in the Council’s report. This has been closed for some time due to the large numbers of people trying to access The Hermitage in early lockdown raising concerns about social distancing. Whilst difficulties maintaining social distancing at site are now much less of a concern, the Council has refused to back down and reopen the road even on a trial basis.\nThe Council is again saying the closure is needed to enable the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route. Although the Quiet Route plans now appear far less ambitious than I previously reported, the Council want to “maintain the existing Braid Road closure and introduce specific measures near the St Peter’s and James Gillespie’s schools to provide a coherent quiet connection from the Greenbank area through to the existing Meadows active travel network”.\n“At present the closure of Braid Road has effectively removed through traffic from the Cluny area. If Braid Road was re-opened in any direction this would re-introduce traffic to this area, primarily on Midmar Avenue and Hermitage Drive which would cause a conflict between general traffic, and users of the quiet route on Hermitage Drive. This could significantly undermine the attractiveness of the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Corridor.”\nCITY OF EDINBURGH COUNCIL\nThe report accepts that the Braid Road closure means traffic on Comiston Road is 11% higher than pre-Covid levels. Whilst this may mean less traffic is passing James Gillespie’s, far more is passing South Morningside Primary School – is more noise and pollution there acceptable? Additionally, added congestion on Comiston Road means buses are delayed and passengers are exposed to Covid transmission risks for longer.\nAgain, no finalised plans have been make public for the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route and there is now mention of the consultation responses.\nLegal Advice\nThere are benefits to the Lanark Road scheme and the continued closure of Braid Road. Both, however, come with consequences for local residents and businesses. In my view, the Council has a duty to present evidence based arguments which show the benefits outweigh the consequences.\nIndeed the use of the Covid TTRO processes removes the rights local people and businesses have to be consulted on these changes. However, using the Covid TTRO process must be a proportionate response to the pandemic. The Council has already been rocked by claims that these powers are not being used properly.\nThe legal position is only mentioned once in the report, and this is only in relation to the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route – “All of the measures proposed have been considered in respect of the legal powers\nassociated with TTRO powers. An assessment of the measures and the associated legislation has concluded that these proposals have been developed to provide access to appropriate areas which enables safe active travel for all ages during the transition through and beyond COVID-19.”\nThat’s it. The “assessment” is not shared and no argument is made to explain why the scheme is proportionate or how it warrants the use of TTRO powers specifically. There is no similar statement for the Lanark Road scheme.\nWe all want safer streets, less pollution and better support for walking and cycling, but this can only happen when the Council works with communities. Time and time again with Spaces for People in Edinburgh we have seen that even the best transport engineers will come unstuck if they don’t draw on local lived experience when drawing up their designs. If the Council wants to go beyond the Covid TTRO remit or can’t show that the benefits of these schemes outweigh the consequences, this is the approach it must adopt.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_03_16_spokes-meeting-cycling-and-the-tram-extension/content_617.html": "With the consultation for the completion of Edinburgh’s tramline to Newhaven about to get underway next week, SPOKES picked a good time to hold their meeting on “Cycling and the Tram Extension”. The meeting got underway with Dave du Feu (SPOKES) outlining how the tram had benefitted active transport in our Capital – not least because bikes have been allowed on board. However, he noted that the tram scheme was arguably responsible for many accidents and one death among Edinburgh’s cycling community. He noted, however, that the death had triggered a safety review and the latest round of “Tram Route Cycle Safety Improvements” is currently out for consultation. The key message here was that the Council should not repeat the mistakes of the past.\nWhilst introducing the Council’s Transport Convenor, du Feu made the point that “temporary” road closures for the construction of the existing Edinburgh Tram project had resulted in at least one hugely positive permanent improvement, the closure of Shandwick Place to cars – an example which the present Council could repeat in the tramline extension project. It was also noted that the City Centre Transformation Project offered huge potential.\nThe Transport Convenor’s talk overwhelmingly focused on the merits of the tram extension. These were arguments that largely agreed with my own, but she did make an explicit link to the Tram Route Cycle Safety Improvements & the City Centre Transformation Project.\nRob Leech (Edinburgh Tram, York Place to Newhaven Project Director) presented the planned route of the project and the likely impact on cycling provision. He made clear that between Pilrig Street and Newhaven his view was that there would be insufficient road width in many places to retain the existing cycle safety measures without losing parking/loading space, and the Council was proposing prioritising the latter. He made clear, however, that this matter and the temporary lane closures on Leith Walk (only one lane southbound will remain open) could be commented on as part of the consultation. To support businesses during this period, Leech stated that the Council would trial using cargo bikes to make deliveries.\nAlthough it was stated that the plan presented in the consultation was a ”straw man”, it was also made clear that the tram route and how the vehicles are powered (via catenaries supported by central pylons) could not be changed – the significant argument for the latter was that they were a sunk cost.\nThis final presentation came from Martin Lings (the City of Edinburgh Council’s Active Travel Officer dealing with existing tramline safety measures). Lings provided a good overview of how the council was trying to reduce the cyclist accident rate along the exiting tram line (ibid) by focussing on accident “hot spots” by applying the very latest international safety guidance. Martin Lings demonstrated a passion for the subject and a clear understanding of the wider cycle network. He openly welcomed Daisy Narayanan being seconded from Sustrans to work on the City Centre Transformation Project. Lings further suggested Narayanan would also be working on the accident “hot spots”.\nFollowing these three short talks, Dr Caroline Brown chaired a discussion session. The main focus of this was the loss of the segregated cycle path on Leith Walk south of Pilrig Street – the feeling was that it was a backwards step. There was a great deal of frustration about this perceived prioritisation of cars over active transport and some attendees felt that perhaps the Council was seeking a compromise where it should be doing what they felt was the right thing.\nThere was a suggestion that the temporary closure of lanes on Leith Walk could be used as an experiment to study the impact of reducing traffic on the route and the plans could be amended if justified. Rob Leech responded saying that would possibly mean making a variation to the contract – a potentially costly business.\nAlthough there was some disappointment about cycling provision, there was very little opposition to the proposal to extend the tram. The meeting ended with Dr Brown suggesting that people take the consultation at face value and engage with it fully once it got underway.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_10_03_a-briefing-from-council-officers-on-the-problems-with-the-changes-being-made-to-the-waste-collection-system-in-edinburgh/content_647.html": "Below is a briefing from Council Officers on the problems with the changes being made to the waste collection system in Edinburgh. The regrettable introduction of charging for garden waste and the move to restrict waste collection to four days per week (Tuesday to Friday) has clearly put huge demands on Council Officers. Nonetheless, mailing out almost 100,000 letters with errors is a costly mistake, I estimate it will have cost £50,000, and will cause further reputational damage. It is becoming increasingly clear to me that major changes to the waste system should be robustly piloted if we are to avoid some of the problems we have witnessed over the past 6 months.\nAs part of the 2018/19 budget setting process, approval was given to introduce a new kerbside collection shift pattern in the waste collection service. This new shift pattern (working from Tuesday to Friday each week) will mean that night time collections of individual bins will no longer be required, residents will have the benefit of having a more consistent collection schedule and there will be less impact on Bank/Public Holiday Mondays as there will be no requirement for collections to be scheduled on these days. This change will affect approximately 175,000 properties.\nAs part of the changes to bin collection days across the city, officers identified that some properties would experience what was felt to be an unacceptable period of time between their normal frequency of collection. A decision was made to offer additional collections this weekend (6 and 7 October) and next weekend (13 and 14 October) for properties that would have a change of more than seven days between the collection date on their old and new calendars.\nAs a result of a data error, in what has been a complex process, a number of properties were given incorrect information about their additional collection in a letter they received last week. We have now written to all affected properties and they will receive letters with the correct information about their additional collections from Wednesday, ahead of the new calendars coming into effect on 8 October. Of the 95,124 properties affected:\n- 52,149 were not told about an additional collection they are due\n- 39,440 were incorrectly told about an additional collection where there isn’t one for their service\n- 3,535 were given incorrect information about the bin type that is due for an extra collection\nIn addition, a small percentage of the properties which had signed up for our new garden waste service received information meant for residents who hadn’t registered for the service. We are quickly contacting all these affected residents and ensuring they receive permits and calendars ahead of the new service starting.\nWe have additional resource in our contact centre to deal with the changes to our bin collection services and residents are encouraged to contact us if they have any questions or issues. They can get in touch by emailing waste@edinburgh.gov.uk or calling us on 0131 608 1100 (option 1, then option 9).",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_09_03_consultation-taming-airbnb-in-edinburgh_comment-page-1/content_265.html": "Below is a briefing from the Council on a consultation which is now underway in Edinburgh. After 10 years of inaction (and actually supporting Airbnb), the Scottish Government have given the Council the powers to reduce the impact of Airbnb. Essentially, these changes will mean that in many instances the Airbnb host will have to apply for a “change of use” in order to operate if the let is not their principle home. You can take part in the consultation here.\n| Briefing We’re seeking views on a proposal for Edinburgh to be short term let (STL) control area. A public consultation approved by the Planning Committee on 11 August, will run from today (3 September 2021) for nine weeks, until the 5 November 2021. If, following the public consultation, the Council gives the go ahead and the proposal is approved by the Scottish Government, the new powers would mean all residential properties, which are not an owner’s principle home, being let as STLs in their totality throughout the local authority area would require approval of a ‘change of use’ to a STL from Planning. Our ‘Choices’ consultation responses for our next local development plan, ‘City Plan 2030’, also showed overwhelming support for us to look at control areas in the Capital. Around a third of STLs in Scotland are in Edinburgh. At the moment, in addition to planning applications made for STLs, to establish whether or not planning permission is required for properties where this is disputed, the Council’s enforcement team looks at each case individually, which is a very lengthy and time consuming process. The introduction of powers to make a control area, follows the Council calling for new legislation to tighten up the control of STLs to help manage high concentrations of secondary letting where it affects the availability of residential housing or the character of a neighbourhood. Also, it will help to restrict or prevent STLs in places or types of buildings where they are not appropriate as well as making sure homes are used to best effect in their areas. Generally renting out a room/s in your house or letting your property whilst on holiday would also still be allowed if Edinburgh became a STL control zone. The Scottish Government is currently consulting on legislation to introduce a new licensing regime next year, which the Council also called for, to address the issues of safety, anti-social behaviour and noise. These issues have all had a detrimental effect on communities as the number of STLs has greatly increased across the city in recent years. The proposal is that all Scottish councils will have to adopt a STL licensing system by October 2022. In terms of the Government’s proposed new licensing regime, if Edinburgh becomes a control area it will be a mandatory condition of any licensing application to have made a planning application or to have planning permission already when providing accommodation that requires it. Further information Q. What is a short term let? A. Details can be found in Annex B of the Scottish Government’s Planning Circular on Short-Term Let Control Areas. Q. How many STLs are Edinburgh? A. There are a significant number of short-term lets in Edinburgh, with the Airbnb platform providing a useful indicator of the scale of this in the city. In the period 2016-2019 there was a substantial rise in the number of both entire properties and rooms registered with Airbnb. Relative to other areas in Scotland the number of Airbnb listings is high making the impact on the city disproportionate. In 2019, 31% of all Airbnb listings in Scotland were in the city of Edinburgh. The next greatest proportion was 19% in Highland followed by 7%. |",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2016_12_31_the-baby-box-an-expensive-unhelpful-stunt/content_242.html": "In the Scotsman today Jane Bradley quite convincingly questions whether the money used by the SNP Government to fund its “Baby Box” scheme could not be better used to target support at those parents who need it most.\nOf course, the debate surrounding universalism versus targeted benefits is age old and extends far beyond Scotland. There are overwhelming arguments for the universal delivery of benefits such as health and education, but it’s important that some others are evaluated to ensure they offer a net benefit to society.\nThe SNP’s “Poverty Tsar” Naomi Eisenstadt CB considered universalism in her report for the Scottish Government. She concluded that universalism can “mean spreading a limited budget too thinly” and that “money should be spent on trying to level the playing field, not, as is sometimes the case, reinforcing ongoing disadvantage”. With the subtlety of a brick, she said “it would be very useful to have a clear and shared understanding of what a progressive universal system would look like”. She went on to say that the SNP could learn a lot from how Labour had delivered Sure Start by targeting it at disadvantaged families.\nOf course, what Eisenstadt is getting at is the chaotic delivery of universal benefits in Scotland. University education is not means tested, but this is funded by means testing and cutting the student grant for the poorest students. We have families using foodbanks, but the SNP extended Labour’s targeted free school meals policy to include the very wealthiest families.\nIt took Nicola Sturgeon almost 4 months to respond to Eisenstadt’s report, and on the same day she promised the Baby Box as a universal benefit. Labour has already noted it contains no support for those needing help with breast feeding, an unacceptable oversight when we know breastfeeding uptake is lower in more deprived areas.\nPerhaps Professor Graham Watt, an expert in community healthcare and deprivation at Glasgow University, was right when he said it was “an expensive, unhelpful stunt”? I guess we may find out if the SNP actually say how this fits into the “progressive universal system” strategy Eisenstadt asked for.",

The first related to policing and the second broadly related to Gaelic education, but their purposes was really to raise the issue of local government funding in Scotland.\nWe’ve had no hint of a settlement from the SNP Government (yes, I know it is early and the Tories are part of the problem), but it is fair to say that most folk expect bad news if the nationalist elite can ever make up their mind. More cuts this year to local government funding may mean that things we cherish will come under huge pressure.\nRaising awareness of this issue was the purpose of the polls. The polls were never intended to be scientific or the basis for any change in my views or those of anyone else.\nIf anyone genuinely felt otherwise, please accept my unreserved apology.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_02_26_derek-mackays-historic-budget-is-heart-breaking/content_92.html": "Derek MacKay MSP, the SNP Finance Secretary, may think his first budget is “historic”, but for those of us who care about fighting inequality in Scotland it is nothing more than a heart-breaking missed opportunity.\nLast year the SNP Government published data showing the top 10% of Scots saw their incomes rise by 15% more than the bottom 40% combined. The data shows the SNP are making no impact on the proportion of people in absolute poverty (lacking basic human needs like food and shelter), whilst the proportion of people in poverty in working households increased.\nMr MacKay’s response to this is to boast about how “99% of taxpayers will not be paying more income tax”. What he really means is that he will not tax the richest to help reduce inequality in Scotland. His priority is a second divisive independence referendum, not helping the most vulnerable people in Edinburgh get on in life.\nAt the weekend in Perth we saw an alternative vision for Scotland. Kezia Dugdale outlined how she will ask Holyrood to increase Child Benefit by just £5 per week to move 18,000 children in Scotland out of poverty in just one year. This is the kind of policy that progressive governments enact.\nSo rather than dividing families, why does Derek MacKay MSP not have a wee chat with Kezia and get his calculator out again to see what he can do to help the poorest households feed and clothe their children? It’s time for him to be “Stronger for Scotland”.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_05_04_spaces-for-people-urgent-review-of-the-greenbank-to-meadows-quiet-route/content_431.html": "Overview\nBelow is an update from the Spaces for People team on an “Urgent Review” of the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route I knew nothing about. Plans above, and the original PDF version is below.\nBased on the briefing below I put three points to the SfP team:\nPoint 1\nCllr Arthur – What actual data was this decision based on?\nSfP – This proposal was based on officer observations and feedback from local residents and councillors. Counts have been conducted (Tue 20th and Wed 21st) and reviewed, and follow on counts are scheduled for next week. Count summary attached (this level of data presentation has taken a considerable amount of time and may not generally be available across other projects). [note the data is linked at the foot of this blog – it is for 7am to 7pm] The change is a very minor modification following an instruction from the Transport and Environment Committee on 22 April to conduct an urgent review due to unintended consequences with the layout at that time. Should problems persist more significant modifications can be considered.\nCllr Arthur – This data suggests (graphic below) that an average of 12,603 vehicles (inc buses) and 250 bikes pass through Greenbank junction from the north or south each day. For Braid Road the daily numbers are 911 vehicles from Hermitage Drive and 336 bikes passing the Hermitage entrance. Note – In May 2020 there were 600 trips daily on Braid Road alone.\nPoint 2\nCllr Arthur – Did the observation today that traffic was falling take into account that many schools were closed for in-service training? Can the data relating to traffic levels be shared?\nSfP – Today’s observations did not specifically consider the impact of school operations, however on previous days the majority of the traffic heading northbound on Braid Road was observed to turn right onto Braid Crescent – following the Quiet Connection. Today the majority of traffic heading northbound on Braid Road at this location was observed to continue along Braid Road.\nPoint 3\nCllr Arthur – What discussions have taken please in relation to the peak-time delays to public transport on Comiston Road? Was this considered today? I raised this with the SfP team last week.\nSfP – Lothian buses have been part of discussions and while there have been some delays recently on the A702 there has been no clear pattern. LB have not raised any concerns with our proposals and we will continue to discuss any issues with LB if and when they emerge.\nBraid Road Urgent Review – Outcome\nAs you are aware Braid Road re-opened to Southbound traffic alongside the introduction of several measures meant to support the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Connection on Monday 19th April.\nAs you are also aware, the layout as installed resulted in some unintended consequences with significant numbers of vehicles travelling north/east from Braidburn Terrace towards Cluny Gardens along the route of the quiet connection until the junction of Cluny Drive and Braid Avenue where traffic is forced to turn left. This resulted in larger levels of traffic in certain streets on the quiet connection (such as Corrennie Drive) than would normally be seen.\nThis traffic quickly reduced over the ensuing week as motorists became aware of the closures, however towards the end of last week it was observed to still be higher than had been hoped. It was also noted that numerous concerns had been raised about motorists finding the layout confusing. Following this input, and in line with instruction from Committee, a review was carried out.\nFollowing this review we have actioned several minor changes to tweak the layout to encourage better driver behaviours in the area, and discourage through traffic from using the streets on the Quiet Connection. These changes are summarised in the attached document.\nMost of these changes have been carried out, and we hope that all changes will have been made within the next week or so. We will continue to monitor the operation of the Quiet Connection through officer observation, consideration of public and elected member feedback and traffic counts at various sites.\nFrom observations on site today it would appear that traffic levels on the Quiet Connection are continuing to fall compared to immediately after the introduction of the scheme, and we will continue to monitor this closely and consider any further changes that may be required.\nWe have received a large amount of correspondence from the public regarding this scheme and will shortly begin responding to all of these now that we have a more established way forward.\nWe will also be making the following changes following specific feedback:\n- Widening the northbound cyclelane on Braid Road immediately north of the hotel\n- Revising the layout of Braid Road between the junction with Hermitage Drive and the Hermitage of Braid path to allow northbound egress from the Hermitage of Braid for forestry maintenance vehicles\n- Adjusting the Rosehill Cycle Lane Defenders at the junction of Braid Road and Hermitage Drive to improve pedestrian desire lines\nPlease let me know if you have any comments or questions on the above and attached.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_06_26_edinburgh-garden-waste-charging-change-to-the-registration-and-payment-process/content_648.html": "Below is the latest briefing from the Transport & Environment Convener (Cllr Lesley Macinnes, SNP Councillor for Liberton/Gilmerton Ward) on charging for garden waste collection in Edinburgh – this briefing has been triggered by some people struggling with a system that forced them to set up their first e-mail account then make their first online payment. Linked here is an article I wrote for the Evening News a few months ago on the risks that come with this charge. Although I did oppose this charge, it became unstoppable in the face of the cuts the Council faces.\nThe new Garden Waste collection is designed to be a mainly online registration service. Customers can complete the simple registration and payment process by following the link at http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/gardenwaste The registration process can be completed at any time that is convenient to the customer.\nWe recognise that not every customer has online access at home and the Council has 21 self help machines in Council local offices that customers can use to register for the service. Staff will be onsite to provide advice and guidance on how to complete the online form. In addition computers in Council libraries can also be used and the service has been designed to allow a friend, relative or representative to register on behalf of someone else. This has already proved to be popular with customers.\nWhere a customer is experiencing difficulty with the online form then they can phone the Council and Contact staff will support the customer to make the application online or, in exceptional circumstances, complete the registration process for the customer. This approach requires the formal Garden Waste terms and conditions to be sent to the customer for approval and when these are returned to the Council we will then contact the customer to take payment. This is a longer process for the customer and we are therefore encouraging customers to use the online form wherever possible. Should the customer have access to email, the terms and conditions can be emailed to them rather than posted in the mail which would speed the process up.\nAs a result, we are not directly advertising a telephone number. However, where a customer is unable to use or access the online form they can call the Council’s waste and environmental line on 0131 608 1100 during normal operating hours. Customers should select option 1 then select option 9 to speak to an agent. Calls for this service are likely to result in longer than normal wait times and again we are actively encouraging customers, who are able to, to complete the online registration form. This will help to ensure phone lines are free for people who can only contact us this way.\nConsistent with the online nature of the service registration process the Council are not actively taking cash or cheque payments. Where customers are genuinely unable to use the online form then payment can be made by debit card via the telephone service, or in very exceptional circumstances the telephone team will discuss other payment options.\nThe Council’s website (http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/gardenwaste) is being regularly updated with related questions and answers. For ease these are included below.\nIf Councillors or the support teams need any advice or are dealing with Garden Waste complaints that need to be resolved then please email these to stuart.woolgar@edinburgh.gov.uk who will arrange for the customer to be contacted.\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS – GARDEN WASTE COLLECTIONS\n- We are introducing an annual £25 fee to collect brown garden waste bins. The new service will run fortnightly throughout the year, instead of once every three weeks.\n- The current free garden waste service will stop on 5 October 2018.\n- If you want to continue receiving garden waste collections after this date you will need to register and pay to receive it by 22 July.\n- The new garden waste service will begin from 8 October. The £25 charge will provide a year’s service, finishing on 7 October 2019.\nWhy we’re charging for garden waste collections\n- Our costs are increasing and more people are using our services. The £25 per year charge was agreed by the Council at a meeting in February and it is estimated it will save £1.3 million each year and allow us to provide a more frequent service.\n- As garden waste collection is not a statutory service, and with budget pressures and increasing costs and demands, we are no longer able to provide the service for free.\n- Over 50% of Councils in the UK charge for a garden waste collection and some have stopped the service altogether.\n- The £25 charge is lower than many other Councils and works out at less than 50p per week. The average cost in Councils who charge is £42.40.\nDoes everyone need to pay?\n- You do not need to sign up for this service. However, if you choose not to sign up you will stop receiving garden waste collections when the free service stops. We will write to residents in the summer to let them know when this is happening\n- If you receive Council Tax Reduction (formerly called Council Tax Benefit) the service will continue to be free, however you will still need to register to receive the service. We will write to residents to let them know when registration is open. If you receive single occupancy Council Tax discount you will not qualify for this reduction.\n- If you are a Garden Aid customer you will still need to pay for the service, unless you are exempt for the above reason (but you will still need to register).\nHow will the service work?\n- We will empty your brown bin once every two weeks all year round. Now we collect once every three weeks\n- You will need to renew your permit online every year before it expires to continue receiving the service\n- Once you have signed up and we have received your payment we will send you a new collection calendar and a permit sticker to put on your bin\n- We will only empty brown bins with valid permit stickers\n- There is no limit to how many garden waste bins you can have but there will be an annual charge of £25 per bin\n- If your garden waste bin is damaged or missing you will need to order a new binbefore 22 July to ensure it arrives in time for the new service starting\n- If you want to share a bin with your neighbours you will need to agree on one resident acting as the lead for booking and paying for the service\n- If you move house you can transfer your permit to your new address. You will need to give us six weeks’ notice to update our system and take your brown bin and permit sticker with you to your new address.\nWhat should I do with my garden waste if I don’t sign up?\n- We would encourage you to continue to recycle as much as possible by using a compost binand our recycling centres.\n- You can also book a special upliftof your garden waste for £35 for up to 28 bags of waste.\n- If you don’t want to keep your brown bin you can fill out a form on our website and we will arrange to collect your bin. This form will be available in October once the free service ends.\nHow do I recycle garden waste?\n- You can find out what to put in your garden bin on our recycling pages.\n- You canfind more information about composting on the Changeworks website (https://www.changeworks.org.uk/what-we-do/waste/waste-reduction-advice-and-behaviour-change/how-to-reduce-reuse-recycle/how-to)",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_09_16_how-roads-maintenance-is-prioritised-in-edinburgh/content_160.html": "I receive a lot of enquiries from constituents asking about how roads maintenance is prioritised and what methods are used. The text below is a briefing from Council Officers on the matter.\nRoads Asset Management\nThe Roads Asset Management Plan (RAMP) is an integral part of the new investment strategy for carriageways and footways. It will be used to balance the long-term capital renewal needs for our network, with the short term need for revenue repair road works, in order to keep the city’s roads well maintained.\nThe RAMP will drive the improvement programme for all aspects of management of the carriageway and footway network including:\n- Developing knowledge of new materials and maintenance techniques;• Suitability for use on Edinburgh’s network;\n- Benchmarking against other local authorities to identify improvements to current practices;\n- Targeting investment to ensure best value and improved lifecycles; and,\n- Critically reviewing the performance of current and future investment.\nCarriageway and Footway Investment Strategy\nThe condition of Edinburgh’s roads is assessed annually as part of the Scottish Roads Maintenance Condition Survey (SRMCS), an independent survey of road conditions in all 32 Scottish local authorities. The survey provides each local authority with a Road Condition Index (RCI) which identifies the percentage of roads that should be considered for investment. Edinburgh’s most recent RCI is 34.6%, based on the SRMCS from 2015/16, placing Edinburgh 16th out of the 32 Scottish local authorities.\nIn 2005/06 capital investment in roads increased from just over £3m per annum to over £16m, increasing to £20m in 2008/09 and to 24.5m in 2013/14. Although the increase in the capital budget saw a significant initial improvement in the condition of Edinburgh’s roads, performance has remained fairly static for the last 6 years, despite sustained levels of investment.\nThe RCI consists of three categories of deterioration: Red, Amber 1 and Amber 2, with roads in the red category being in the worst condition. Up to 2015/16, the majority of carriageways prioritised for investment fell within the red category. Treating the Red category roads only resulted in a small number of carriageway resurfacing or strengthening schemes being carried out each year, due to the cost of these treatments.\nAs part of the development of the Roads Asset Management Plan (RAMP), analysis was carried out on the impact on Edinburgh’s RCI if the Council had continued with the existing approach to roads capital investment. The chart below shows the effect of the previous investment strategy on the percentage of Edinburgh roads falling into the red and amber categories of deterioration (i.e. in need of maintenance investment), over a 20-year period, assuming that capital investment remained at 2015/16 levels. By year 20, the percentage of roads requiring maintenance would increase from just under 35% to nearly 60% while the percentage that fell into the red category rises from 5% to over 10%.\nDespite the relatively high levels of capital investment, there would have been insufficient resource to treat all the roads in the red category. Furthermore, because investment was Localities ‘Surface Enhancement’ works) there was almost no investment going into treating roads in the amber categories, which over time will continue to deteriorate and eventually slip into the red condition category.\nConsequently, modelling work was carried out using the Roads Assent Management Plan, in order to create an investment strategy that would improve the condition of Edinburgh’s carriageway and footway network.\nAs part of this modelling work for the RAMP, alternative scenarios for capital investment were developed. These scenarios were predicated on a more preventative approach aimed at roads that are in the amber condition categories. Investment interventions on these roads require less expensive treatments (e.g. surface dressing, slurry sealing) which improve the condition of the carriageway or footway, extend the design life before resurfacing, strengthening or reconstruction is required. Due to the lower cost of the treatments required on amber condition roads, more can be treated each year. Roads in the red category will continue to be treated each financial year but fewer than in previous years. Once deterioration has reduced throughout the network, more investment can then be diverted back to red category roads. The chart below illustrates the impact of this preventative approach over 20 years, assuming levels of capital investment remain at current levels.\nTreatment Types\nAs part of the work carried out on the investment strategy, surfacing treatments were re-introduced in Edinburgh, treating roads in the amber categories, and local footways in 2016/17. These treatments are currently used throughout Scotland.\nSurface Dressing\nSurface dressing is a process that provides added protection to the carriageway surface, sealing it from the ingress of water while also enhancing its skid resistance. It is a preventative treatment and can extend the useful life of a road by around 10-15 years.The process entails spraying the road with bitumen and covering it with stone chippings. The dressing is then rolled, which together with the actions of slow moving traffic, embeds the stone chips into the surface.\nMicro Asphalt\nMicro Asphalt (also referred to as ‘micro surfacing’, ‘micro’ or ‘thin surfacing’) is a surface treatment for roads; one which is laid over the top of the existing surface to seal and protect it. It consists of a water- based mix of stones and bitumen which is spread over the existing surface by a special machine. It is a preventative treatment and can extend the useful life of a road by around 10-15 years.It can be used when surface dressing is not suitable. It reduces road noise and can rapidly transform a road with extensive patching and utilities reinstatements into one with minimum surface irregularities.\nFootway Slurry Sealing\nSlurry sealing is used to repair imperfections and to seal footway surfaces from the ingress of water to the underlying foundations. It is a preventative treatment which is to be used to extend the useful life of a footway, thereby delaying more significant and costly treatments. It is a semi self-levelling system and is spread by hand using squeegees on top of the existing footway surface. It is expected to provide an even and consistent surface free from trip hazards. It is a preventative treatment and can extend the useful life of a footway by around 7-10 years.Slurry sealing is generally laid to a nominal depth of 6mm but it can also be laid up to 10mm thick where undulations in the existing surface are more pronounced. The process is substantially faster than traditional footway surfacing methods, thus reducing the disruptive impact on residents and businesses.",

There is an argument, however, that the ticket and dividend income could have been used in a better/other way.\n- The construction cost is £156.7m.\n- Taking into account a number of factors, it is estimated there is a 80% chance of delivering the project for £207.3m or less.\n- A second study showed that there is a only a 61% chance of delivering the project for £207.3m or less…. and there is a 80% chance of delivering the project for £257.3m or less. The Council is therefore proposing a contingency fund of £50m.\n- If the project were to cost £257.3m it is estimated that there will be £1.25 of benefit for every £1.00 spent.\n- There are three votes needed to approve the project: (1) Transport & Environment Committee, (2) Finance & Resources Committee & (3) Full Council.",

It is in response to an application to appeal a decision of the City of Edinburgh Council to reject an application to demolish Comiston Farmhouse and replace it with flats.\nI am writing to you to express my heartfelt opposition to the proposed demolition of Comiston Farmhouse and the redevelopment of the plot into high density flats. This is my own personal view and that of the vast majority of the local community I was elected to represent on the 4th of May 2017. Indeed, as part of my election campaign I pledged to protect Comiston Farmhouse as I believe it to be an important local historical landmark. The building may not be listed, but the position it holds at the top of a hill makes is stand out as a classical island surrounded by a sea of more modern, and some would argue more mundane, architecture.\nAlthough the local community is overwhelmingly opposed to the loss of the Farmhouse, it would be wrong to assume they are “NIMBY” types. I feel almost all would be most happy to see the Farmhouse revert to being a family home, but most accept further development within the site is almost inevitable. It is the loss of the farmhouse and the scale of proposed development they oppose, not development per se. Put bluntly, an approach that better reflects the surrounding urban form and interfaces better with local infrastructure would be more acceptable to them.\nThe basis upon which the planning application was rejected was not a surprise to me or anyone familiar with the proposal:\n- The proposed development of the site does not reflect the character of the surrounding residential area and will have a negative impact on the immediate environment. This is exacerbated by the topography, in that the proposed development’s position at the crest of a hill would mean it would dominate the immediate area.\n- The proposed development will be of a density and scale which does not reflect the wider suburban context the Comiston Farmhouse site fits within. If allowed to proceed, it will be completely at odds with the wider setting.\nWhilst both these points are non-trivial, they have been considerably exacerbated by the way in which the developer has interacted with local residents, Council Officers and Councillors. An example of this is the planning hearing where, I feel, the developer often verges on dismissing the views of others. This can be viewed in full here.\nIn addition to the material concerns I have raised in relation to the character, scale and density of the proposed development herein, two other factors are worthy of note. Firstly, the City of Edinburgh Council has now terminated the agreement to sell the site to the developer. Secondly, in addition to the existing protection, the City of Edinburgh Council is in the final stages of processing a Tree Preservation Order for key trees on the site.\nIn conclusion, I hope that the wishes of the local community and the City of Edinburgh Council will be respected when dealing with this appeal and that it is promptly rejected. Rejection of the appeal will enable me to take forward plans myself and other Councillors for the area have drafted to engage the community more fully via the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act in order to find a more acceptable use for the site.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_05_09_a-mandate-for-safer-travel-for-all-in-colinton-oxgangs-fairmilehead_comment-page-1/content_529.html": "Introduction\nThe Scottish Government have given Councils £10m to improve travel safety during the Covid-19 crisis and in the recovery phase. In addition to this, the UK Government has launched £2bn fund which will also support safer travel. These investments are really to solve two problems:\n- Lots of people have embraced healthier lifestyles – more walking, jogging and cycling. However, footpaths are often too congested for people to keep a safe distance from others when walking and many cyclists are finding the roads unsafe.\n- As the lockdown lifts, it appears unlikely (in the short term at least) that people will go back to using the bus as they did before. The Council therefore wants to make the city safer to walk and cycle.\nThe City of Edinburgh has received some criticism for failing to consult on how this money is being spent. This blog is about how I have consulted people in my Ward on the way forward.\nAlthough the Council has done nothing in my ward yet to make walking and cycling safer, I have received many ideas from local residents for making travel easier for everyone. In short, these focus on making residential areas safer and improving safety for cyclists on key arterial routes through (and into) my Ward. Rather than take the proposals straight to the Council I wanted to give people a chance to rate the ideas and make further suggestions of their own. This is important as, hopefully, it will make the Council more likely to take the proposals seriously.\nThe Survey\nI complied a survey of all the ideas on Google Forms and issued it on my Blog and via my mailing list at around 8pm on Tuesday (5th of May). I did not share the blog post until 8pm on Wednesday (via Twitter – see below). I posted it on my Facebook page at around 8pm on Thursday.\nReleasing the survey on this phased way meant that if it was somehow hijacked on social media, I would know the first 24 hours would not be impacted. The responses were as follows: Day 1 – 179, Day 2 – 63 and Day 3 – 50.\nThe people responding to the survey were encouraged to give their postcode and 175 did so. When plotted, it can be seen that the vast majority of the respondents live in my Ward.\nRed = one response from the postcode zone, and blue = more than one. In addition to the responses shown, there were 3 from places outside the area mapped. The full map is here.\nLet me be clear, I think this is the most authoritative survey of the public in Edinburgh on how we improve safety on our footpaths and roads within the context of the Covid-19 crisis.\nResults\nThe survey focused on three key issues:\n- Safer streets for residents – blocking rat runs.\n- Extra protection for cyclists on key routes.\n- Reviews of parking in key areas\nSafer streets for residents – The focus of these proposals was making it safer for people in residential areas to move around by stopping drivers cutting through the area. People were asked if is this was a “Good Idea”, “Bad Idea” or if they were “Unsure”.\nThe results showed that there was overwhelming support for stopping vehicles using Oxgangs Road North as a local shortcut. When unsure responses were removed, there was also clear support for addressing the other local rat-runs.\nExtra protection for cyclists on key routes – The focus of these proposals was making it safer for people using bikes to commute to elsewhere in the city. Again people were asked if is this was a “Good Idea”, “Bad Idea” or if they were “Unsure”.\nThe results showed that there was overwhelming support for improving routes for people on bikes. Even with “Unsure” responses included, there was a clear desire for cycle lanes to be introduced on key routes.\nThis question also asked if there was support for immediately reducing the speed limit on all 40mph roads in my Ward to 30mph – the response was clear.\nAfter “Unsure” responses are removed, support for this proposal sits at 80%.\nReviews of parking in key areas – The focus of these proposals was dealing with parking problems – those generated by the crisis (e.g. people driving to beauty spots to take exercise), and planning for the recovery phase.\nThe results showed that there was overwhelming support for reviewing parking around all schools in my Ward to ensure social distancing can be maintained when they reopen, with 95% of people backing the measure.\nSupport for reviewing parking elsewhere, however, was dominated by uncertainty. Nonetheless, when “Unsure” responses were removed, there was a clear majority in favour of dealing with some of the problems these communities are facing.\nCrossing Points – I also took the opportunity to ask if there were any road crossing points where it may be difficult for pedestrians to maintain social distancing. The word-cloud diagram below shows the responses, but crossing points in Colinton Village were mentioned by 18 people, with one saying:\nColinton Village Pedestrians crossing outside Coop supermarket: path width either side is 1.5m, and southern footpath is not suitable for physical distancing. Worse, the guardrail steals up extra space, pushing pedestrians into live traffic.\nColinton resident\nMany others raised Fairmilehead crossroads:\nThe Fairmilehead crossroads (where the A702 meets the B701) is terrible for pedestrians. The metal barriers make distancing really difficult, and the lights are very unfriendly to pedestrians. It really needs an “all-cross” mode in the sequence. A lot of people cross on red,, but vehicles can travel fast around the bend.\nFairmilehead resident\nA number also raised Oxgangs Avenue:\nThe end of Oxgangs Ave leading onto Oxgangs Road North. The island for pedestrians is very close to where cars are trying to turn – often groups of school children trying to cross at the same time.\nOxgangs resident\nNarrow Footpaths – The last question asked people to identify areas where the footpath is simply too narrow. The word-cloud diagram shows the responses, but Braid Road (just outside my Ward!) was mentioned 20 times. The narrow footpath at the crest of Braid Road was a common concern:\nBrow of hill on braid road – pedestrians always having to walk in the road and can’t be seen by cars and pedestrians can’t see cars either. Lots of families walking that route to access braid hills entrance there.\nBuckstone resident\nBoth road and footpath narrow as Braid Road reaches its high point.\nOthers raised concerns about the Walkway beside the Braid Burn:\nThe path along the Braid Burn from Oxgangs Road North up to Colinton Mains Road, continuing up to Redford Road alongside the care home is narrow and fenced in by flood management defences so not currently a usable alternative to the road if trying to socially distance.\nColinton Mains resident\nWoodhall Road was mentioned by 11 people:\nWoodhall Road after Bonaly Road. Several times I have seen children having to go onto the road to allow people past who have chosen the ‘wall’ side, with traffic travelling well over the 20mph limit.\nColinton resident\nThe width of footpaths in Colinton Village was also a concern:\nAlmost all footpaths are not wide enough to maintain social distancing. Key trip generators and busy roads need to be prioritised. Significant areas that draw in people that are inadequately supported is Colinton Village centre ( this public realm and provision for access by non motorised users is already poor and does not cater well for those with protected charteristics and any area where services are positioned by carriageway.\nColinton resident\nConclusion\nWith almost 300 people completing the survey over a three day period, the the results offer the most credible understanding of the extent to which the community wants the Council to take action to improve everyone’s safety in my Ward. The survey gives the Council the mandate to develop a six point plan to:\n- Reduce rat-running in residential ares;\n- Improve cycle safety on key routes;\n- Review parking in key hotspots;\n- Cut 40mph speed limits to 30mph;\n- Bring forward measures to enable social distancing at key crossing points; and,\n- Review locations where the footpaths are not wide enough for pedestrians to safely pass each other.\nWhat Next?\nI shall be forwarding this blog to the Council and request a formal response. In the interim, if you have not done so already, please complete my survey.\nCllr Scott Arthur, 9th of May 2020",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022-election-address/content_104.html": "It is now almost five years since I was elected to be your Councillor and stand up for the Ward we both live in. It is no understatement to say that the world has changed a lot in that time. We have been confronted with a pandemic, a humanitarian crisis triggered by a brutal illegal war in Ukraine, and there is now a much greater understanding of the risks posed by the Climate Emergency. These combined challenges are a reminder of how fragile life can be, and also what we can achieve when we work together locally, nationally and globally.\nIndeed, working with local people over the last five years has been one of the things I have loved most about being your Councillor. Key amongst these has been working with residents, community groups, and Community Councils Ian Murray MP and Sarah Boyack MSP to\n- Ensure more local roads and footpaths resurfaced, and make the case for more investment.\n- Get the pedestrian crossing installed on Buckstone Terrace, have the developer install grit bins and do all I can to get the development adopted by the Council.\n- Have the woods between Dreghorn Drive and Morrisons repeatedly cleared of litter.\n- Get speeding reviewed on Redford Road, and consult local people (soon) on cutting the speed limit there to 20mph.\n- Help get free insulation cladding fitted to many homes in Firrhill, Oxgangs & Oxgangs Farm, and make the case for more to be done.\n- Have Oxgangs playpark upgraded – it’s now the best wee park in Edinburgh.\n- Oppose development on our greenbelt (see here & here).\n- Have the Council commit to upgrading Fairmilehead traffic lights.\n- Oppose repeated attempts to build on the Winton East site, protect the character of Winton Loan from aggressive commercial development.\n- Organise a successful residents’ meeting to get improvements to the Spaces for People scheme on Bonaly Brae.\n- Have the speed limit on Buckstone Terrace, Lanark Road and (soon) Bigger Road cut to 30mph.\n- Have the roundabout at Hunter’s Tryst subject to a safety review.\n- Support the Colinton Tunnel project, and ensure it is properly sign-posted for visitors.\n- Have Mounthooly Loan gritted more often, and protect the fields to the east of it from development.\n- Work with school Parents Council and Headteachers to deliver improvements.\nWe live in the best part of Edinburgh, but it has been great making it a little better.\nAt city level, I have drafted motions which have focused on some of the most vulnerable people in my Ward. This included improvements to free school meal provision and increasing the school uniform grant for the poorest households. These issues were important to me as my family relied on this support when I was a child in the 1980s, and I feel ashamed that today around 1 in 10 children in my Ward are growing up in poverty.\nOther issues have been harder to fix. I have had success in getting the Council to invest in roads and footpaths in my Ward, but there is more to do. The issue here is Scottish Government cuts – Audit Scotland confirmed in 2019 that Edinburgh is Scotland’s worst funded Council (our Capital gets £1422.40 per head compared with the Scottish average of £1812.90!).\nIt is clear that we have to use the May 2022 Council elections to elect Councillors who will stand up for local people and our Capital. We also need Councillors who will focus on the needs of the people they represent, not vanity projects or constitutional bickering.\nA key focus must also be to improve service delivery and, above all else, we need a Council that gets the basics right. I have seen over the past five years how Council Committees churn out an endless stream of policies and strategies, but spend less time on scrutinizing service delivery than is needed. With council budgets under huge pressure, we have to ensure more than ever that service delivery is a priority. Money must be spent efficiently, staff must be respected and residents must be listened to.\nGreater accountability and transparency is also needed. This is particularly true of how we ensure children and young people overcome the impact that the pandemic has had on education, and how we respond to the Climate Emergency. A glossy strategy alone will not be enough!\nOther candidates will say you should support them in order to oppose Boris Johnston or Nicola Sturgeon, but I think it is better to vote for local issues that matter. A vote for me is a vote for a Councillor who will put his Ward and our city first. It’s a vote for somebody who loves living locally and wants to improve the area for everyone.\nI pride myself in being somebody who even people from other parties agree is a hard-working local Councillor who puts local residents first. I did this when I fought to:\n- Ensure the protection of the greenbelt in my Ward up until 2030 as part of the City Plan.\n- Ensure the Council did not permanently close Colinton’s Public Toilets.\n- Ensure residents are consulted on using the old Colinton Mains Bowling Club site on Oxgangs Rd North for Council housing.\n- Protect Oxgangs & Colinton Libraries from Scottish Government cuts, and win an agreement to have the Covid testing centre moved out of the latter on the 31st of March.\n- Block the SNP plan to reduce the number of bus stops in my Ward by a third.\nThe coming five years will be a huge challenge for our City, and I’ve lived in my Ward with my family for 22 years so I know what’s needing done here. Based on discussions I have been having with local people, my priorities will be to:\n- Ensure the Council works with surrounding Local Authorities to improve public transport links into Edinburgh (including new Park & Rides), and thereby reduce the impact commuter traffic has on Fairmilehead.\n- Work with local residents to have Buckstone Playpark upgraded.\n- Work to protect our greenbelt and the unique character of Swanston Village, and Morton Mains Conservation area.\n- Protect and improve the number 10 bus service, particularly at peak times and in the evenings.\n- Ensure as many people as possible in my ward are no more than 5 minutes walk (500m) of a bus stop, and oppose the removal of bus stops.\n- Protect the character of Colinton Village, and do all I can to support local businesses there and elsewhere in my Ward.\n- Work with residents to improve safety for everyone using Redford Road, particularly pedestrians.\n- Ensure the Council repairs the bridges and landside in Colinton Dell, and maintains the area to the highest standard.\n- Improving public transport to ensure it’s a sustainable alternative to car usage. This is key given the number of homes being built in and around Edinburgh.\n- Work with local people to ensure all the children in my Ward have safe walking and cycling routes to school.\n- Ensure there is zero-tolerance shown to fly-tipping, littering and dog-fouling.\n- Do all I can to support businesses and charities in my Ward, and help them bring more jobs to the area.\n- Improve the condition of our roads and footpaths, and “fix it right first time” with potholes.\n- Work with the Council to ensure it maintains Council homes to the highest standard, and ensure it deals with anti-social behaviour promptly.\n- Ensure that local people have a real say on any proposed changes to the Boroughmuir or Firrhill High School Catchments.\n- Provide study space and develop personalised and targeted tuition programmes to ensure pupils catch up with the education lost due to COVID.\nIf you have read this far, you are somebody who takes your democratic duty seriously and this is why I have explained in detail why I want to work for you. I hope you now agree that a vote for me is a vote for a local champion who will fight for transparency and accountability, and for the Council to get the basics right. All you have to do is rank me first on your ballot paper.",

In 2017/18 work on 756 got underway – this is the first time the record of 639 set in 2005/06 under a Labour led Holyrood has been exceeded. This, however, is not enough.\nLack of genuinely affordable homes in Edinburgh is a real problem for the 3,316 people who presented as homeless last year – many of them mothers seeking to escape domestic abuse. Many of those that need to be housed immediately are placed in temporary accommodation for an average of 10 long months. Where this is not available, a B&B will be considered. Let’s be honest, however, some of the B&B accommodation used in Edinburgh for homeless people is not fit for human habitation.\nAt the start of December Shelter Scotland suggested City of Edinburgh Council’s use of B&Bs could be breaking the law and questioned Scotland’s capital’s ability to cope with homelessness. Since then the former SNP Housing Convener has denied that he ever pledged to end their use by June 2018.\nRecent Evening News reports give a perspective on the tensions at play: “Edinburgh’s ‘rampant’ Airbnb growth ‘hollowing out’ city” (report 28/12/18), “With 12 of Scotland’s top 20 most expensive streets, and eight of the top 10, Edinburgh dominates the table.” (report, 29/12/18) and “Homeless families forced to live in hostels dirtier than crack dens” (report 04/12/18).\nAlthough there is a willingness within the City Chambers to deal with homelessness, the city lacks the resources to do so. The Nationalist Government are letting AirBnB industrialise the conversion of homes to holiday lets and their rent control policy has delivered nothing for Edinburgh’s most vulnerable households. Most recently £39m of “savings” has been forced on Edinburgh by Holyrood whilst the Nationalist Government brags about not raising tax for 99% of Scots.\nEdinburgh is facing a housing crisis and the SNP is not listening.",

This is because consultations can often disproportionately attract responses from people with strong views.\nAs the survey will feature in the forthcoming SfP debate, I thought it was important to ask (1) which questions were asked and (2) how the people who responded were identified.\nWhich question were asked?\nIt appears the survey followed the same basic format of the of the online consultation, so that the responses could be compared. The Council say the survey “uses essentially identical questions as were on the Consultation Hub. The only appreciable difference between this survey and that on the Consultation Hub is that the Market Research asked questions about potential retention or removal of streets using a geographical split of the city. This was not done on the Consultation Hub for software reasons and to keep the survey as short as reasonably practical.”\nLinked below is the survey text.\nWho were asked to complete the survey?\nI asked how the people who completed the survey were identified, and if they matched the demographics of the city population as much as possible.

We asked the MR company to look at the demographics of the sample against the most recent Edinburgh People’s survey to check that it was as representative as possible…. There were respondents from all parts of the city.” … “we asked the MR company to look at the demographics of the sample against the most recent Edinburgh People’s Survey.

Part of what attracts them to our city is our fantastic green spaces. Everything from Holyrood Park and West Princes Street Gardens to the many more humble public parks (like those in my Ward) are part of why Country Living recently awarded Edinburgh the status of the UK’s “Greenest City” .\nThat’s why I was so concerned to read that Glasgow’s DF Concerts thinks Princes Street Gardens could become “Scotland’s answer to the Hollywood Bowl” and urged Edinburgh to look at New York’s Central Park because it has “loads of events”, saying cities like Edinburgh need to “utilise their assets” better.\nThe basis of this approach appears to be that West Princes Street Gardens is a commodity which should again be encircled by barriers so it can be exploited. If this is the approach, it shows no awareness of the history of Edinburgh’s West Princes Street Gardens.\nIn the early 19th century West Princes Street Gardens was accessed by subscription only, and was only open to the general public for free two days per year. In 1876 the city took ownership of the gardens for the public to use free of charge.\nThese gardens and their position below Edinburgh Castle are part of what defines our capital. No other city would contemplate converting this to a “Hollywood Bowl”, so why should we? Would such a thing be contemplated on Washington’s National Mall or Paris’s Parc du Champ-de-Mars? Events have a place on these spaces, but first and foremost they are there for the public to enjoy.\nIndeed, comparing West Princes Street Gardens to the Hollywood Bowl and Central Park is misleading. Hollywood Bowl is actually in the hills outside Hollywood, and events take up a tiny part of Central Park’s 315 hectares (West Princes Street Gardens can fit in to it 26 times).\nI agree that cities like Edinburgh need to “utilise their assets” more, but I also feel that we have to value our public spaces more and not forget the rich inheritance our city ancestors gave us.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_01_20_members-briefing-edinburghs-christmas-and-hogmanay-2019/content_612.html": "There can be no doubt that concern about the impact of Edinburgh’s visitor economy has grown considerably in recent years. I share the frustration about the creeping privatisation of public space in Edinburgh, particularly how people are locked out of public parks and the lack of respect for our heritage. It feels like too many people in this city see profit in everything, and value in nothing.\nCouncillor Donald Wilson has already committed to leading a full review, and I hope the public and all 63 of Edinburgh’s Councillors will get behind that. The briefing below offers some background to this.\nThe review should be more fundamental than how we manage the status quo. There are really three key questions:\n- What scale is right?\n- Is the quality of what we’re offering positioning Edinburgh optimally?\n- Who benefits?\nWhilst we probably want different things from the visitor economy, it’s making a difference to the lives of residents than matters. For me the starting point is to understand what Edinburgh wants to gain from its visitor economy, and then we must deliver that.\nThe Briefing\nMembers will consider reports in the near future relating to the 2019/20 Winter Festivals and, later this year, the Council will launch a public consultation to seek residents’ views on how the Capital should celebrate Christmas and Hogmanay in future years. There is a recognised need for a full conversation with the city on the shape of our winter festivals going forward.\nIn light of this, and following significant press and social media attention recently on Edinburgh’s Christmas and Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, please find below a briefing which addresses a number of key issues about both events, to enable Elected Members to respond to enquiries from constituents.\nIssues Relating to Christmas and Hogmanay 2019\nEdinburgh’s Christmas – Planning Permission and Building Warrant\nAs a result of the National Gallery of Scotland’s capital works programme, it became necessary to amend the layout for Edinburgh’s Christmas. The plans and temporary structures were approved after significant evaluation and assessment by both independent structural engineers and the Council’s engineers. Given the short timescale between approval of the plans and the opening of the events, a retrospective planning application was sought by the operator (Underbelly). This application is currently being processed with a likely determination date of April/May 2020.\nUnderbelly applied for a Building Warrant for East Princes Street Gardens and the warrant was issued by the local authority before Edinburgh’s Christmas opened, as is legally required.\nThe new structure in the gardens improved circulation space within the market and made it more accessible.\nEdinburgh’s Christmas – Removal of the Norwegian Christmas Tree and the Nativity scene from The Mound\nThe Norwegian Tree and Nativity scene were removed in the days between Christmas and Hogmanay to allow for the screen on Mound Place, which is necessary for the Hogmanay Street Party and for safety announcements. The removal of the Tree was undertaken with the knowledge and consent of the Council and the Norwegian Consulate; and the removal of the Nativity scene with the knowledge and consent of the Council.\nThe Mound Christmas tree had been in place since 16 November; its removal from the Mound took place on the same date as the two previous years. The Nativity scene was relocated in 2019 from St Andrew Square where it has been located previously.\nEdinburgh’s Christmas – Reinstatement of Princes Street Gardens\nEvery year, the Council appoints a contractor to reinstate East Princes Street Gardens following the departure of the Christmas market. The reinstatement is overseen by the Council’s Parks Team, delivered by a third-party contractor, and paid for entirely by Underbelly.\nThis year, work to reinstate the gardens has started earlier than usual. The reinstatement works are weather dependent and a target of Easter for full reopening is usually set. However, with good weather it is hoped that this can be several weeks earlier this year.\nThe redevelopment works by the National Galleries of Scotland were delayed and incomplete by the time Underbelly took occupation of East Princes Street Gardens. In recognition of this, a financial contribution towards the completion of the works has been agreed between the Council and National Galleries of Scotland. This work will be delivered alongside the Christmas market reinstatement works.\nEdinburgh’s Hogmanay – Resident and Business Access Passes\nResidents and their guests have never been, and will never be, prevented from accessing their own homes during Hogmanay. The process of asking residents to inform the event organiser how many passes they require for their property is a process that was put in place many years ago.\nThe Street Party attracts over 60,000 people into Edinburgh city centre. A secure arena is erected to control numbers accessing the street (a recommendation from the review of the 1997 street party) and to ensure the safety of those attending. To assist residents and businesses within the arena, a system for access passes was established in the late 1990s. This year, tickets were replaced with wristbands to allow quicker and smoother access through security to resident and business properties. Reports show that this worked successfully. This year, 45 residences submitted requests for more than 6 wristbands compared to 24 in 2018. All requests were accommodated and no access was restricted or refused.\nThe Public Entertainment Licence granted for the Hogmanay events allows the event organiser to restrict access to the licensed premises – in this case, the Street Party arena. However, the Street Party takes place in a mixed residential and business area and access to these properties must be maintained at all times. Given the requirement to balance access against safety and security, the pass system is considered by all agencies to be the best solution. The communications around this will be reviewed for 2020.\nEdinburgh’s Hogmanay – Loony Dook\nFor safety reasons, primarily due to the narrow access route on a set of stairs and the size of the beach, there is a limit on the number of participants taking part at the Loony Dook in South Queensferry. The number, 1,100, is agreed jointly with the local community, the Council and safety advisors.\nThe price of the Loony Dook was set at £10 including a donation to the RNLI by the previous contractor, Unique Events, in 2016. Underbelly set the price at £12, including a £1 donation to the RLNI in 2017 and it has remained the same price since. Underbelly operates the event at a loss to itself of over £7,000: the income after VAT and the donation to the RNLI is £9,912 and the costs – stewarding, policing, safety and production – are over £17,000.\nThe South Queensferry Loony Dook has been part of Edinburgh’s Hogmanay for some years now and is part of Edinburgh’s Hogmanay at the request of the community as a result of the popularity of the event. It is still run in collaboration with some of the founders of the Loony Dook in South Queensferry.\nChristmas and Hogmanay – Consultation, Review and Future\nAt Culture and Communities Committee on 18 June 2019, it was agreed that a review and consultation exercise on the future of the Christmas and Hogmanay events would be undertaken prior to the termination of the current contract in 2022. This would allow sufficient time for the consultation to be completed and to agree a means of delivering the outcomes of that consultation.\nThe format of the consultation is currently being developed and the proposed process will be shared with Members in the coming weeks. The key requirement will be to ensure that all voices within the city, and stakeholders beyond, are heard.\nFactual inaccuracies reported in the mediaThe\nre were several errors in media coverage over recent weeks, including in the Guardian/Observer and via the Press Association. These were highlighted as quickly as possible and subsequently corrected.\nKey facts about Edinburgh’s Christmas and Edinburgh’s Hogmanay\n- The economic impact of Edinburgh’s Christmas is calculated at £113.2m on Edinburgh; £88.2m on Scotland (reported by BOP Consulting in an independent survey of 2018).\n- Edinburgh’s Christmas is a significant draw for people into the city centre – 96% of local people said Edinburgh’s Christmas was an important reason for visiting the city centre; 58% of visitors (non-local) said Edinburgh’s Christmas was their only or main reason for visiting.\n- Edinburgh’s Christmas directly employs over 300 local people.\n- Edinburgh’s Christmas community benefits were valued at £534,000 in 2018/19 (including 26,741 free tickets).\n- Edinburgh’s Christmas provides several free to access events including Winter Windows, 24 Doors of Advent, Light Night and Community Christmas, a new event for 2019 which took Edinburgh’s Christmas direct to 12 communities across Edinburgh over 12 separate days. The Winter Windows event had 1,680 entries from schools across Edinburgh.\n- The economic impact of Edinburgh’s Hogmanay is calculated at £39.2m on Edinburgh; £39.8m on Scotland (reported by BOP Consulting in an independent survey of 2018).\n- Edinburgh’s Hogmanay directly employs over 500 people and, indirectly, an estimated 1,600 other people.\n- The contract has delivered a £1m saving per annum to the Council for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay and Edinburgh’s Christmas compared to the previous contract, which expired in 2017.\n- Public funding now only makes up 27% of Edinburgh’s Hogmanay income (compared to 41% in 2016/17) (figures for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay 18/19).\n- The Edinburgh’s Hogmanay programme delivers free to attend events including the First Footers Family Ceilidh on 1 January and Message from the Skies which runs to 25 January.\n- In 2019/20 there was footfall of over 2.5 million through East Princes Street Gardens and more local people than ever used their 20% EH postcode discount, buying 196,656 tickets: a 23.9% increase on the same events in 2018.\n- 2019/20 saw 18,000 free tickets given away to Edinburgh and Scotland-wide charities and community groups, an increase of 173% on the same events in 2018.",

It’s not uncommon in my Ward, however, to see a gully choked to the gunnels with weeds growing out of it.\nIt is worth also considering, however, what’s blocking the gullies. The Council’s own data makes clear that there has been a marked drop in street cleanliness in Edinburgh, and that it is not meeting its own targets. It’s this material that’s blocking the gullies.\nIt’s not just these basic services where problems exist. Fly-tipping incidents have increased by 91% since 2017. Weeds are now so big in parts of my Ward they are trip hazards. Our capital looks unloved, and Council staff are exhausted playing catch-up.\nI’m a huge fan of some of the strategies the Council has produced over the last few years – it has plans to tackle everything from poverty to climate change. I support and welcome this, but I think all of Edinburgh’s 63 Councillors could do more to ensure the Council is getting the basics right too. That’s about asking questions to find out what the issues are, but it is also about standing up for Edinburgh and ensuring it has the funding it needs. Above all else, we need to be honest about the challenges we face.\n(You can report blocked gullies here)",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_03_07_potholes-lets-not-pretend-edinburgh-can-keep-on-doing-more-with-less/content_599.html": "Having read Brian Monteith’s latest opinion article on potholes I have to say it feels like I’ve found a sole-mate. The snow covered streets provided me with a brief respite, but the state of the roads in my Ward is utterly depressing. Indeed, some appear to have grown under the blanket of snow to such an extent that fitting a manhole cover to them may be easier than patching them.\nIt is important to remember, however, that the problem goes far beyond our roads. This week I received a letter from Cameron, a partially sighted pupil at Braidburn School who uses a wheelchair. He asked me to “please fix the pavement” adjacent to a pedestrian crossing he uses as there is a risk he could fall out of his chair.\nOf course, there is nothing special about Cameron’s experience, you don’t have to be in a wheelchair or be partially sighted to have a problem with our pavements. Indeed, when I went along to have a look at the section of footpath Cameron reported I wasn’t surprised to see the source of the problem was a substandard reinstatement undertaken after a utility repair.\nAll too often utility repairs are not undertaken properly and eventually cause us problems. That’s why the Council must keep on top of utility companies to ensure repairs are done to the right standard.\nThis is where Brian Monteith and I part company. He thinks I’m “utterly wrong” to say that a significant factor contributing to the problem is cuts imposed by the SNP Government. Whereas I agree with Audit Scotland when they reported that road maintenance and inspection funding is around 14% lower than the minimum acceptable. Indeed, I think most people in Edinburgh will agree that potholes have multiplied over the past 10 years irrespective of which Political Party has been running our Capital.\nThe problem we face is that cuts to Edinburgh’s budget over the past 10 years mean that protecting services such as education and social care leads to the road maintenance budget being cut disproportionately.\nYes, Edinburgh must spend its transport funding as efficiently as possible by adopting new methods, materials and technologies. However, let’s not pretend Edinburgh can keep on doing more with less.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_11_10_tipping-point-it-is-time-to-act/content_207.html": "Fly-tipping is the illegal dumping of waste, and can vary in scale significantly from a single bin bag of waste to large volumes of waste dumped from trucks. Fly-tipping differs from littering in that it involves the removal of waste from premises where it was produced with the deliberate aim of disposing of it unlawfully, or as a result of legitimate outlets not being available.\nFly-tipping poses a threat to humans and wildlife, damages our environment, and spoils our enjoyment of our towns and countryside. Furthermore, I know from my professional work in flood risk management that it can cause real problems when it gets stuck in culverts. In my Ward I often report tipping – with Oxgangs House and Oxgangs Street being regular problem areas.\nTomorrow Edinburgh’s Transport & Environment Committee will consider the 2021 “Waste and Cleansing Services Performance Update“. This report updates the Committee on the Waste and Cleansing Services performance for the first two quarters of 2021/22 On tipping, it says this:\n“4.12 Dumping of items seems to reflect a national pattern of illegal behaviour which has been highlighted both by Keep Scotland Beautiful and neighbouring Councils. It’s possible that during the lockdowns people may have been enjoying their local green spaces more, and so are more aware of and more likely to report existing issues, but it is also possible that there is simply a growing national problem with fly-tipping and dumping.”\nThis implies there has been a rise in tipping reports (not quantified in the report), and this is Covid related. The pre-summer “Coalition Commitment” report, however, notes that there have been year-on-year rises since 2017:\nWhen I raised this with the Council, I received this response:\nCertainly recent increases can be attributed to the impact of COVID and I think this has been quite widely reported in national publications. However, as your data shows, we have seen also a big jump from 2017 to 2018. There are a few contributing factors to this I would suggest:\n- Improvements in online reporting which makes it easier for residents to tell us about issues\n- A bit of an increase in proactive reporting. This is particularly relevant in the SW locality where Street Enforcement (formerly Env Wardens) were actively logging items to be lifted.\n- The categorisation of what we capture as being dumped or fly tipped. For us this will include black bags left next to a communal bin for example. Given the number of communal bins we have throughout the City this will form a large proportion.\nIn terms of where the current hotspots are and how things may improve in the future, I received this response:\nThe Communal bin project proposes an increase in the frequency of collection from, in many cases, a twice per week collection to an every other day collection. This should relieve some of the pressure on colleagues in street cleansing who, outside of collection days, will assist in collecting any excess. Alongside the increase in frequency it will also be important to get the comms right. Looking at a recent heat map for dumping and fly tipping enquiries there is quite a high level of correlation to areas served by communal bins. That’s one issue we’ve highlighted through the communal bin project that this is an opportunity to properly engage with people about the responsible way to manage their waste. It’s not something that’s been done recently in my memory.\nI welcome the fact that there is potential for progress to be made with Edinburgh’s tipping problem in the near future. I’m still disappointed, however, that the original report did not contain a fuller assessment of the problem or outline the potential solutions. I’m grateful, therefore, that the Transport & Environment Vice-Convener/Convener agreed to amend the report as follows to ensure the issue is dealt with seriously:\n- Notes that tipping and dumping in Edinburgh has increased year on-year since 2017, and that this selfish and anti-social behaviour blights many communities, as it does in local authority areas across Scotland.\n- Notes that dealing with tipping and dumping consumes significant council resources, and that this money could be better invested elsewhere.\n- Requests a report within three cycles which details the extent of the problem, identifies hotspots and makes clear what options are available to deal with it, including the bulky household uplift service.\nI’m disappointed that this follow-up report is going to take several months to be published, and that it will not explicitly offer free uplift of bulky items (a manifesto commitment of mine), but I think this is a useful starting point.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_08_29_update-on-the-traffic-signals-at-fairmilehead-crossroads/content_95.html": "Below is an update on the traffic signals at Fairmilehead Crossroads. A few years ago I was promised that this junction would be completely overhauled, and that this could address the issues vehicles turning right from Buckstone Terrace on to Oxgangs Road face. This has now been “reprioritised”, but after a bit of fuss the Council has agreed to upgrade the signals infrastructure. As part of this the junction will be improved for pedestrians (esp those with visual impairments) and changes to the right turn on to Oxgangs Road will be considered.\nI am also in the process of asking the Council about the very short green man time of the Biggar Road leg of the junction.\nFairmilehead Crossroads Update\nThank you for your enquiry of 18 August 2021 on behalf of your constituent regarding the introduction of a right turn filter into the traffic signal sequence at the above location. I was sorry to hear of the issues your constituent is experiencing whilst traversing through the junction.\nThe traffic signal sequence currently has a right turn filter for vehicles turning from Biggar Road into Frogston Road West. This movement has a very high flow with the opposing vehicles turning right into Oxgangs Road relatively low.\nTo allow for the introduction of two opposing right turn manoeuvres, they would need to be separately signalled on a red/amber/green signal and the north/south movements stopped to allow for this to happen.\nAlternatively, the north/south movements would have to operate separately as per the current east west movement. However, the current road layout does not allow for the separate signalling of the right turners. If the north/south movement was to run separately this would lead to lengthy delays on all arms of the junction and an increase to pedestrian waiting times.\nAlthough there are junction improvement works programmed for this location we are only upgrading the traffic signal infrastructure and not the actual junction constraints or road layout.\nLike many junctions across the UK vehicles turning right into Oxgangs Road are expected to do so in gaps when it is safe to do so or at the end of the stage during the safety period from one stage leaving green to the next stage receiving a green signal (intergreen). As a measure of comfort, the intergreen period for this manoeuvre has been increased by 40%.\nAs part of the junction improvement works, the junction timings will be looked at in detail to try and find any efficiency measures that can be introduced to improve the overall operation of the junction. However, it should be noted that the current constraints of the junction layout may mean that it is operating as efficiently as it can.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_08_26_is-it-time-to-rethink-how-we-use-slurry-sealing/content_284.html": "Slurry Sealing (AKA micro surfacing) has been used widely for some time to extend the life of bituminous footpaths and roads as it protects the existing surface against further deterioration and the effects of water ingress. It appears, however, that changes in how the surface can be prepared have resulted in non-trivial problems in many parts of Edinburgh. The problem is fully explained in the briefing below which I received from a Council Officer yesterday.\nWhilst I welcome the fact that making the work good will be the contractor’s responsibility, we must recognise the inconvenience this will cause residents and Council Officers.\nFurthermore, the problem raises fundamental questions about the future viability and cost of using this approach. I have therefore asked Council Officers if the use of Slurry Sealing should now be reviewed.\nWeedkilling was carried out several weeks before the slurry surfacing was laid. However, due to environmental legislation we are no longer able to use “residual” weedkillers, which remain active for a period after application, ensuring that the weeds are killed right down to the root and new seeds cannot germinate. We are now only permitted to use “contact” weedkillers which will kill off any visible vegetation but may not always kill the weed down to the root. In addition, it may be possible for seeds caught in cracks in the footway surface to germinate.\nAt the point when the slurry surfacing was carried out there was no visible signs of weed growth and dead vegetation was removed before applying the slurry. I suspect it is a combination of the above reasons, combined with the wet and mild weather we have recently experienced, that has caused the weed growth to be so prevalent.\nThe contractor has been instructed to carry out a further application of weedkiller, remove dead vegetation and repair any defects caused by the weed growth. As this is a design and build contract, the contractor will be carrying out the above works at no additional cost to the Council.\nThe weedkilling is planned to commence on Wednesday 30 August, weather permitting (weedkiller should not be applied when rain or strong winds are forecast), and will take 2-3 days to complete all the sites. The contractor will return after 7-10 days to remove the dead vegetation and apply further weedkiller, if required. They will then repair any damage caused to the slurry surfacing.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_10_22_complaining-about-sean-bells-conduct-was-futile-as-he-was-protected-by-the-old-boys-network-inside-the-council/content_159.html": "Linked below is a summary of a report which investigated the conduct of a Senior Social Worker named Sean Bell. He worked for City of Edinburgh Council for over 30 years until his death in 2020.\nWhen he died it became public knowledge that he had been suspended from the Council and was facing serious criminal charges. The independent investigation triggered by the Council sought to understand how it had dealt with any allegations made against Sean Bell, and whether or not they related to his position as a Social Worker.\nOn Wednesday I spoke to the independent legal team leading the investigation, and read the full 145 page unredacted report (reportedly based on 15,000 pages of evidence). I read this report in the knowledge that Sean Bell has died, so can’t respond to the charges made against him.\nNonetheless, the full report (and the summary is linked below) makes clear that Sean Bell had been accused of bullying, abusive behaviour and misuse of public funds in the workplace, and was not considered by his colleagues to have a positive attitude towards women.\nWhile the Inquiry Team heard from two female CEC employees who spoke positively about SB’s manner, most of the women interviewed by the Inquiry Team were disparaging about him. He was described as a ‘bully’ and, in respect of his general conduct around women in the workplace, he was labelled as a ‘sleaze’ and a ‘dirty creep.’… ….Words such as ‘lecherous’ and ‘predatory’ were used by witnesses when asked to describe SB’s behaviour around women in the workplace.\nOfficial Inquiry Report\nIn addition to this he has been accused of assault, domestic abuse, sexual assault and rape. The alleged events took place over a number of years outside the workplace, but did involve Council staff.\nSurvivors of these alleged attacks made repeated credible formal and informal complaints against Sean Bell over a number of years, often with the direct support of friends and colleagues. It’s suggested that Sean Bell used his status within the Council to systematically undermine and discredit those women making allegations against him.\nHe put a lot of energy into his public and professional persona while the reality was very different. The emotional and psychological abuse continued for many years after. It’s been difficult to watch him reach such a senior position in the Social Work Department and hard to believe that none of his colleagues ever saw glimpses of who he really was.\nSurvivor (quote from media report)\nLet me be clear, even where events take place outside the Council people should still take seriously criminal allegations made against staff. The investigation found occasions where Sean Bell’s line manger should have taken a more formal approach, or perhaps even referred the matter to the Police. Keep in mind that all of these people are well versed in how abusers are able to hide their tracks, and evade being held to account. They also know that abusers should not be working with vulnerable people.\nIt appears that, despite the fact that Sean Bell was trusted to support vulnerable people, an “old boys’ network” within the Council (which he was a member of) sought to deal with the matter informally.\nOne witness told the Inquiry Team that complaining about SB’s conduct was futile as he was protected by ‘the old boys’ network.’\nOfficial Inquiry Report\nMy mum also went to them and asked if they knew what he’d done to me. The response was just that Sean was sorry.\nSurvivor (quote from media report)\nAfter many years of being side-lined and discredited, one of the survivors of Sean Bell’s alleged abuse made a credible allegation again. This time she was listened to and supported, and the Police were called. The case against Sean Bell was so strong that criminal charges were brought forward after just a few days.\nWhen I read the full report I found it unbelievable because it appeared to be a textbook example of abuse – A man charged with protecting vulnerable people using his power and influence to harm the lives of others, and take away their dignity, credibility and self-respect. He appears to have been protected by is own arrogance, and people who appear to have put personal loyalty before helping vulnerable people.\nI’m angry that his death means that Sean Bell won’t face charges in court, but I am glad that the survivors of his alleged abuse will not have to face him again. My anger is balanced, however, by my respect for the brave women who where unwilling to stay quiet, and for the social worker who acted quickly to get the police involved.\nThe report is linked below and will be debated in Full Council next week. It contains quite sickening allegations which may upset some, particularly those with of experience violent or sex based abuse. Please remember that Rape Crisis and Edinburgh Women’s Aid are there to help.\nUpdate – 29-10-21\nYesterday in Full Council we debated the investigation into Sean Bell, a Council Social Worker accused of verbal abuse, violent abuse, sexual abuse, and rape. We had a chance to question Susanne Tanner QC FCIArb who led the investigation and Andrew Kerr (the Council’s Chief Executive). My questions focussed on the “old boys’ network” in the Council, and why the Council’s policies are so deficient. The mood was dark, and a further report on the culture in the Council is due in December. We also learned that only 34 of Edinburgh’s 63 Councillors attended the many sessions to read the full report, and one of those that did attend acted unprofessionally and shouted at the legal team – ironic given that Bell was accused of verbal abuse.

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_08_26_its-time-to-use-cpo-powers-to-deal-with-empty-homes-in-edinburgh/content_676.html": "The latest empty homes report shows that 1,267 properties in Edinburgh had been empty for over 12 months and are not being marketed for sale. No doubt many of these properties will be sitting empty as a result of deaths, and families will be waiting for estates to be settled. Others will be empty as they are undergoing renovations.\nThe vast majority of these empty homes cause no problems. Others are empty for longer periods and do result in problems – overgrown gardens, vandalism and the ever present risk of a fire.\nOne of these problem empty properties is just 280m from my home in Buckstone and has been empty for around 20 years despite being valued at well over £300,000. Since I was elected in 2017 I have been working with local residents, the Police and Council Officers to have it brought back into productive use.\nAlthough the background is complex, it was clear to me last year that there was a lack of communication internally within the Council, and also with external agencies. There was also a reluctance to act due to a separate ongoing action by a bank to repossess the property.\nWhat I hope is a breakthrough came when a Council Officer met with the residents of a neighbouring property so they could explain how the empty home is destroying their quality of life. We heard of how delivery drivers use the back garden as a toilet, how the property flooded when pipes burst in a bad winter and how there had been multiple break-ins.\nThe Council has no repossession powers that the bank does not have. The Council does, however, have compulsory purchase powers. After hearing the personal testimony of residents, the Council agreed to test the use of these powers on empty homes.\nIf all goes to plan, on the 30th of August Edinburgh’s Housing and Economy Committee will agree to test the use of these powers and turn neighbourhood eyesores across Edinburgh in to homes.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_12_24_speed-survey-data-for-the-edinburgh-20-mph-scheme/content_369.html": "Below is an update on the data the Council holds in relation to the 20 mph scheme – including a number of streets in my Ward. Keep in mind these are the average speeds, so some vehicles will be going faster.\nSpeed surveys were undertaken by the 20mph team, both before and after the implementation of new 20mph speed limits, at 82 locations (66 new 20mph streets and 16 streets where a 30mph speed limit had been retained) as part of the pre-planned monitoring programme (the summary of these is not included in the attachment).\nIn addition, two further batches of monitoring surveys have been undertaken by the road safety team following the implementation of the citywide 20mph roll out. These covered 198 more locations, where concerns about perceived non-compliance with the 20mph limits had been raised by members of the public, elected members and council officers. We also have a third batch under preparation, currently consisting of 67 locations, where surveys will be undertaken in spring 2020.\nThe locations and results of the surveys undertaken in Batches 1 and 2 can be found below. The Batch 3 table lists lists the 67 locations to be included in Batch 3. Each traffic survey recorded all vehicle movements, 24 hours a day, over a 7 day period and therefore the full results for each survey include recorded speeds for thousands of individual vehicles. The resultant size of the data files mean that it is not practical to circulate the full results of each survey nor to publish this information on the Council’s website. We have therefore provided the average free-flow speeds and traffic volumes recorded at each location.\nThe Committee report can be viewed here. Following the Committee, it became apparent that, due to an administrative error, the appendix did not contain an exhaustive list of all streets about which concerns had been raised. This has now been rectified, and all streets that have been brought to our attention, from 2016 onwards, should now be included within the 3 batches listed.\nOn streets where an average speed of above 24mph has been recorded, the Council’s Road Safety team will carry out an investigation to determine what additional measures are required to support the reduced speed limit.\nPlease note that the traffic surveys listed in the attached are those that have been specifically carried out by the road safety team following the 20mph roll out, at locations where compliance concerns have been raised. If you request a traffic survey, you may be advised that one has already been undertaken recently for another purpose and, in this case, we will share the results of that survey with you. To ensure the best use of our resources, unless there has been a significant infrastructural or environmental change, we will not re-survey a location if it has been surveyed within the last 3 years.\nMonitoring Surveys – Batch 1 (March – April 2019)\n| STREET | LOCATION | AVERAGE SPEED – FREE FLOW | DAILY AVERAGE VOLUME – TWO WAY TRAFFIC |\n| Abbey Mount | north of Abbeyhill | 24.4 | 4152

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2024_09_14_i-now-must-resign-as-your-councillor/content_20.html": "It has been a huge honour for me to serve you as your Councillor since 2017, but I now must resign.\nAs you may know, I stood in the July 2024 General Election in Edinburgh South West and was elected to serve that constituency. This means our Ward is now actually covered by two Scottish Labour MPs – myself and Ian Murray MP (now also the Secretary of State for Scotland).\nBeing elected as an MP has been truly humbling. Despite an awful inheritance, Labour is driving change. An early step we have taken is to give an estimated 200,000 Scots a pay rise with changes we are making to the Living Wage. We have asked that setting the Living Wage takes into account the cost-of-living crisis, and that we end the nonsense of paying people less simply because of their age. The House of Commons Library tells me that this simple change could benefit over 6000 of the lowest paid workers in Edinburgh.\nWhilst I absolutely love being your Councillor, I don’t feel I can continue to do this job to an acceptable standard whilst also being an MP. I therefore submitted my resignation on the 9th of September 2024, and my last day will be the 16th (Monday).\nMy resignation will trigger a by-election, and myself and Ian Murray MP will join forces with Sarah Boyack MSP to do all we can to get a Labour Councillor elected here so we can all work together to stand up for the area.\nWe have a real chance of holding the seat. In 2022 I won with 33.4% of the first preference votes, with the Tories coming second with 29.9%. The SNP were third (17.2%), and the Lib-Dems came a distant fourth (12.4%). Of course, politics has changed since 2022, the recent general election saw Labour taking every SNP seat in Edinburgh, and the Tories come 3rd in Edinburgh South West (12.2%) and 4th in Edinburgh South (8.5%) – the SNP came second in both seats.\nOnce I stand down as your Councillor, I will no longer be able to accept casework from you in that capacity. Until the election result is known, however, both Ian Murray MP and I can help in our capacity as MPs – no issue is too small. You can check which of us is you MP here.\nMany thanks for all your support and encouragement since 2017, and I look forward to speaking with you when the by-election campaign starts.\nNote – PS – You can see my maiden speech in Parliament here.\nNo comments on I now must resign as your Councillor",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_05_01_richard-leonards-principled-position-on-the-tory-power-grab/content_534.html": "As Scottish Labour is the party that made devolution in Scotland happen, it’s no surprise to me that Richard Leonard has raised concerns about how the Tories are dealing with the repatriation of powers from the EU to the UK. We have to recognise properly the 1998 Devolution Act and acknowledge that the default position for some of the powers returning from the EU as part of Brexit is that they reside with the Scottish Parliament. Yes, some of these powers are highly technical in nature but the Devolution Act must be respected.\nWhilst the Scottish Labour leader’s position may be highly principled, the SNP position is based on a fair degree of grievance and hypocrisy.\nFirstly, the nationalists are seeking the return of these powers to Holyrood simply to pass them back to Brussels, along with many others, at the very first opportunity.\nSecondly, at the same time as demanding these powers reside in Holyrood they are asking the UK Government to retain welfare powers that could have been transferred to Scotland some time ago.\nLastly, Holyrood already has many powers that the nationalists are simply failing to use. On everything from dealing with pavement parking to reducing the impact of AirBnB type holiday lets to introducing a tourist tax the SNP is simply failing to use the powers at its disposal.\nThese three points completely expose the SNP’s “power grab” rhetoric as simply yet another way of seeking artificial arguments with the UK Government to further their obsession with owing division in our country.\nThe SNP need to learn that when in Government they should actually govern. Demanding Labour’s 1998 Devolution Act be respected is fine, but the SNP need to actually use the powers Holyrood already holds to the full to make Scotland a better place to live, work and do business.",

They have also agreed to my request to consider this as one interconnected transport corridor rather than repeating the mistake of viewing it as two independent schemes. Just like the Lanrak Road mini-consultation, the methodology will comprise a meeting with Community Councils which will inform the development of an engagement process with the local community (I have asked about what area this will cover). Below is the statement issued to Community Councils.\nNotification of further engagement on Braid Road/Comiston Road Spaces for People Measures\nAs you will be aware we recently completed a consultation exercise on the potential retention of Spaces for People measures. This was followed by the publication of the report on keeping these measures, which was considered at the meeting of the city’s Transport and Environment Committee on 17 June. The decision to retain or remove measures was based on consultation results, independent market research, a review by technical officers and consideration of how well such changes fit with the Council’s long-term transport policy objectives.\nAt this meeting it was agreed that a final decision on moving forward with the schemes should be made at the 24 June meeting of the City of Edinburgh Council\nCouncil motion\nThe Council voted to approve the report, with requests from Councillors to consider further options for:\n- Reopening Braid Road in both directions\n- Improving transport connectivity on Comiston Road and reduce impacts on local residents\nYou can read the full motion here.\nInvitation to meeting on Wednesday 25 August\nCouncil officers are now developing options to address concerns that have been raised regarding these roads. We are keen to discuss these proposals with you and would like to invite two representatives from the community council to attend an online discussion forum.\nNext steps\nFollowing engagement with the community, we would like to reconvene with you to take you through the feedback and outline officers’ proposals prior to submitting the report to the Transport and Environment Committee on 14 October. We will circulate an invite nearer the time.",

I feel this should be expanded to include businesses and addresses on adjacent streets.\nUpdate – At the foot of this blog is a Q&A section on this briefing.\nUpdate – At the foot of this blog (after the Q&A section) I have included the slide pack that will be the “starting point” for discussions with Community Councils.\nBriefing\nAs you will be aware we recently completed a consultation exercise on the potential retention of Spaces for People measures. This was followed by the publication of the report on keeping these measures, which was considered at the meeting of the city’s Transport and Environment Committee on 17 June. The decision to retain or remove measures was based on consultation results, independent market research, a review by technical officers and consideration of how well such changes fit with the Council’s long-term transport policy objectives.\nAt this meeting it was agreed that a final decision on moving forward with the schemes should be made at the 24 June meeting of the City of Edinburgh Council.\nCouncil motion on Lanark Road\nThe Council voted to approve the report, with requests from Councillors to revisit the infrastructure and design of the Lanark Road corridor. Officers have been asked to engage with Lanark Road residents and local Community Councils to:\n- achieve cycle speed mitigation measures\n- reconsider parking provision where parking spaces sit outside protected cycle lanes, with a view to mitigating potential conflict and safety concerns as soon as practicable on the ground\nTo help us make more informed decisions, we are also currently monitoring traffic through the area, using cross-modal counters. You can read the full motion here.\nWe are now commencing with the required engagement with Community Councils and Local Residents – this engagement will take place over the coming weeks through the following means.\nMeeting with Community Councils\nCouncil officers are now developing proposed revisions to the cycle lanes on Lanark Road which aim to address concerns regarding cycle speed, and conflict at floating parking bays. We will discuss these proposals with representatives from the relevant Community Councils and have invited two representatives from each to attend an online discussion forum next week. At this meeting we will present a number of proposed changes and seek feedback and input on cycle speed mitigation and parking provision.\nResidents’ survey\nThe outcomes of this meeting in terms of proposals will be detailed in a survey on the Council’s website, which will be circulated to residents on Lanark Road via letter drop. This will allow us to gather a good sample of opinion in the local area in relation to the changes proposed.\nThe results of survey will help us to mitigate the concerns which have been voiced regarding this scheme and will sit alongside the results from the previous consultation when elected members decide on whether this scheme should be retained in the longer term.\nFollow up meeting with Community Councils\nAhead of the publication of the report in early September, and following the resident survey, we will reconvene the same group of Community Councils to discuss the findings from the survey. At this meeting officers will present a summary of the feedback from the Survey and outline officers proposals to be considered at the September meeting of the Transport and Environment Committee.\nWe hope that you find this information useful, please let us know if you have any questions.\nQuestions and Answers\nQ. I am concerned that CEC proposes presenting solutions to Community Councils and residents with the aim of gaining feeding. Would a better process not be to engage with residents/businesses to understand what they feel the challenges/opportunities are, and then use the outputs to generate designs for feedback?\nA. The officers will be presenting options within the parameters of the approved motion to generate discussion. This is not a definitive or closed option list but provides ideas of what could be changed to address the points in the motion. Following the Community Council meeting and resident survey the information gathered can be considered and proposals changed.\nQ. It also appears that only those residents living on the Lanark Road will have a say. Can this be expanded to include businesses and addresses on adjacent streets?\nA. This will include businesses within the attached plan. This has been expanded from the original letter drop area.\nQ. Please could you confirm with which Community Councils you are engaging and will elected members receive the final summary and feedback in advance as well as the CCs?\nA. We have invited the following Community Councils: Balerno, Currie, Juniper Green and Baberton Mains, Colinton, Craiglockhart and Longstone. So far we have received confirmation that Juniper Green and Baberton Mains CC and Longstone CC will be in attendance. Elected members will receive the full summary in advance of the TEC.\nQ. Is the letter drop to the same addresses that received notification of the initial works?\nA. We are increasing the letter drop area as per the attached plan. This adds in adjacent streets up to 100-150m from Lanark Road and streets that can only be accessed from Lanark Road such as Hailes Grove.\nQ. And, so I am clear, is the survey both postal and electronic through website?\nA. The letter that will be sent out will provide details of how people can request a paper copy of the survey so it is accessible to people who do not have the internet or who are not familiar or do not like using web based surveys.\nQ. Is the survey subject to market research or any weighting and is it all “in-house” or are other agencies involved?\nA. The survey is not subject to market research but is to inform officer and councillors of the residents opinions on the measures regarding the specific points of the motion and is all “in-house”.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_11_24_edinburgh-briefing-national-planning-framework-4-npf4/content_59.html": "Below is a Council briefing in the Draft NPF4 – it is a “is a long-term plan for Scotland that sets out where development and infrastructure is needed”. The briefing considers the impact on Edinburgh.\nSummary\nOnce finally approved by the Scottish Parliament the NPF4 will be part of the statutory development plan. That approval is currently scheduled for Summer 2022.\nThe NPF draft has a very strong focus on the need for planning to address climate change impacts and many of the policy areas and considerations reflect what we have put forward in the proposed City Plan. If approved in this or a similar form, it will support many aspects of the plan at Examination.\nIn particular, West Edinburgh is no longer classified as a national development for office/business led development and the commentary on it supportive to the City Plan position. Granton is included as a national development and we will need to consider any procedural implications for this. There is support for brownfield development, higher densities, 20 minute neighbourhoods, public transport (including extending mass rapid transit/tram) and active travel, blue and green networks and on measures to reduce car use.\nThe following is not exhaustive, there will need to be further work including analysing the national policy measures. These are intended to be overarching so that future LDPs do not have to repeat those policies, so it is critical that we are sure those policies are strong enough and comprehensive enough to be effective in supporting LDPs and in making decisions on planning applications.\nWe also need to consider any content of the draft that City Plan does not address.\nOnce that work is complete we will bring a proposed response to the draft to Planning Committee in February.\nStructure\nThe NPF has 4 main sections:\n- Spatial Strategy\n- National Developments\n- National Planning Policy Handbook\n- Delivering our Spatial Strategy\nThere is also a section containing annexes of Outcomes Statement, Housing Numbers and Glossary.\nSpatial Strategy\nThis focuses on creating better places with 4 themes. The strategy sets out that to meet the national net zero target by 2045 significant progress must be made by 2030. It also emphasises the need to invest in nature based solutions to mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss.\nSustainable Places\nThe strategy is to transform the way we use our land and buildings so that every decision we make contributes to greater sustainability through encouraging low and zero carbon design and energy efficiency, reducing the need to travel unsustainably and diversifying and expanding renewable energy generation.\nLiveable Places\nThe strategy is to create places with good-quality homes close to local facilities and services by applying the concept of 20 minute neighbourhoods.\nProductive Places\nThe strategy is to build a wellbeing economy that benefits everyone and every place, with green investment as a key priority to tackle climate and nature crises. It also recognises the changing nature of the way we work and the need for flexibility to facilitate future business and employment that benefits communities and improves places.\nDistinctive Places\nThe strategy is that nature recovery and connected blue and green infrastructure must be at the heart of all future places along with design quality.\nSpatial Strategy Policy Principles\nThe policies to deliver this placemaking are based on 6 overarching principles.\nCompact growth\nLimiting urban expansion where brownfield, vacant and derelict land can be used more efficiently. This will safeguard land to provide the services and resources we will need in the future, including carbon storage, flood risk management, green infrastructure and biodiversity. By increasing the density of settlements we will reduce the need to travel unsustainably and strengthen local living.\nLocal living\nWe will create networks of 20 minute neighbourhoods to support local liveability, reduce the need to travel unsustainably, promote and facilitate walking and cycling, improve access to services, decentralise energy networks and build local circular economies. As an integral part of this, cleaner, safer and greener places and improved open spaces will build resilience and provide wider benefits for people, health and biodiversity, in a balanced way. Virtual connectivity and active travel links will also be important.\nBalanced development\nWe want to support development across Scotland so people have more choice about where they live, learn and work. This will create opportunities for communities in areas of decline, and manage development more sustainably in areas of high demand. In particular, we wish to enable more people to live and remain in rural and island areas, and to actively transform areas of past decline so that we can make best use of our assets.\nConserving and recycling assets\nScotland has many strengths and each place should be planned in a way that works with its distinctive character and identity. We will protect and enhance the assets of each of our places, leaving a positive legacy for future generations. Our focus is on making productive use of existing buildings, places, infrastructure and services, locking in embedded carbon and minimising waste, and supporting Scotland’s transition to a circular economy. This includes nationally significant sites for investment which are well served by existing infrastructure and sustainable travel modes, and excellent propositions for redevelopment across urban and rural Scotland and the islands.\nUrban and rural synergy\nScotland’s urban and rural and island areas, and all of the places in between, can work together and share learning and innovation to achieve better places. Our strategy is for Scotland as a whole, bringing together the contributions of our cities, towns, villages and countryside areas to achieve shared objectives. As part of this, we will improve green infrastructure to bring nature into our towns and cities, connecting people with nature, building resilience and helping our biodiversity to recover and flourish.\nJust transition\nMeeting our climate ambition will require a rapid transformation across all sectors of our economy and society. We must ensure that, as we reduce our emissions and respond to a changing climate, that journey is fair and creates a better future for everyone – regardless of where they live, what they do, and who they are. The pandemic has demonstrated the capacity of our communities to work together and find their own local solutions to shared challenges. Our strategy builds on this, to ensure local people are more able to shape their places and transition to net zero and environmentally sustainable ways of living.\nSpatial Strategy Areas for Action\nThe strategy considers 5 areas for action, Edinburgh is within the Central Urban Transformation Area – Transforming and pioneering a new era of low carbon urban living. This area broadly covers central Scotland from the Glasgow city region and the Ayrshires in the west to Edinburgh city region in the east, including the Tay cities, the Forth Valley and Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park.\nThe other areas are: North and West Coastal Innovation; Northern Revitalisation; North East Transition and Southern Sustainability.\nCentral Urban Transformation:\nWe will only meet our climate change commitments if we make significant changes to the densely populated central belt of Scotland. Our most urban communities hold the key to reducing emissions from the way we live our lives. We need to work together to decarbonise buildings and transport and tackle congestion, make more efficient use of existing land and buildings, connect to renewable electricity and heat networks and create more inclusive, greener and sustainable places that will stand the test of time.\nFor Edinburgh, household projections show there will be a continuing demand for more homes. There has been a strong market, high levels of housebuilding and pressure on infrastructure and there is strong economic performance.\nFor Edinburgh, the default minimum housing land figure has been set at 41,300 as submitted in the response to the relevant consultation, approved by Planning Committee on……….\nIn this area actions will be to:\n- pioneer low-carbon, resilient urban living;\n- reinvent and future-proof city centres;\n- accelerate urban greening;\n- rediscover urban coasts and waterfronts;\n- reuse land and buildings;\n- invest in net zero housing solutions;\n- grow a wellbeing economy;\n- reimagine development on the urban fringe; and\n- improve urban accessibility\nAction 13 Pioneer low-carbon, resilient urban living\nThis area will require concerted effort to develop a network of 20 minute neighbourhoods, and clusters of communities with fair access to a range of services that support sustainable living. Planning should focus on revitalising cities and towns at scale, supporting a finer grained approach to placemaking, and a more intricate mix of land uses and density. This should incorporate networks of natural spaces and blue and green infrastructure, to create health and wellbeing benefits, increase resilience to climate change and support the growth of green job opportunities. The car-based design of some of our places, including many suburban areas and new towns, mean that a significant shift to a more people centred approach will be required. Planning can help retrofit facilities and services into areas where they are scarce, such as predominantly residential areas, to enable better integrated mixed use areas.\nCity, town and neighbourhood centres can be at the heart of this if they are planned to strengthen self-sufficiency and bring services and jobs closer to homes. The recommendations of the recent town centre review can be delivered by supporting a wider range of uses and making the most of their assets. Accessibility will be a key part of the transition and will involve investment in infrastructure and services in line with the sustainable travel and investment hierarchies, to improve fair access and reduce carbon emissions. Active travel networks will need to expand to make walking, wheeling and cycling an attractive, convenient, safe, and sustainable choice for everyday travel. There are significant opportunities for investment in heat networks, energy storage and the circular economy to create more sustainable neighbourhoods.\nAction 14 Reinvent and future proof city centres\nScotland’s city centres are socially and culturally important, supporting our productivity and stimulating innovation and investment. The pandemic has generated severe impacts and longer-term challenges for our city centres. The City Centre Recovery Taskforce is developing a shared vision for their future and the City Centre Recovery Fund will support their recovery and repurposing. This is a nationally significant opportunity to contribute to Scotland’s economic recovery and to achieve a wellbeing economy.\nEdinburgh has similar challenges [to Glasgow] and opportunities for positive change. High interest in investment and associated demand for new homes means that planning will need to help deliver sustainable development that supports the quality of life of existing and future residents. As a capital city with a World Heritage Site at its core, it will be crucial that future development takes into account the capacity of the city itself and its surrounding communities and makes the most of its exceptional heritage assets, places and cultural wealth. The City Centre Transformation Plan supports a move away from a car-based city centre to create a more liveable and attractive place to live, work and visit. The Forth Bridge is also an inscribed UNESCO World Heritage Site, and our rich industrial and cultural heritage remains apparent across the area.\nAction 15 Accelerate urban greening\nThe greening of the built environment, including former industrial areas, is a long-held ambition that we now need to expedite to significantly reduce emissions, adapt to the future impacts of climate change and tackle biodiversity loss. Investment in green infrastructure will support urban sustainability, help to restore biodiversity, contribute to our overall targets for reducing emissions and improve health and wellbeing. By weaving blue and green infrastructure across our urban fabric we can ensure that nature and the outdoors are accessible to everyone, supporting lifelong health and wellbeing and creating places that are more resilient to flooding.\nThe Central Scotland Green Network will continue to bring together environmental enhancement projects. Initiatives such as the John Muir Pollinator Way demonstrate how nature networks can help restore and better connect biodiversity and enhance green infrastructure at a landscape scale.\nAction 16 Rediscover urban coasts and waterfronts\nThe region’s coasts and firths define the area’s history and shapes its sense of place. There is potential to unlock the strategic importance of coasts, estuary and river corridors for climate mitigation, resilience and positive environmental change. Coastal change will need to be managed to build long term resilience and future-proof our waterfronts. Progress has been made to create long-distance walking and cycling routes and to open up access to waterfront spaces and reclaim them as a resource for people as well as industry. There will be a need to tackle coastal erosion, flood risk and storm surges, and to build in natural solutions which work with the unique biodiversity and landscape character of these important places. These coasts are rich in cultural and natural heritage. Along the Inner Forth various projects provide multiple benefits, including flood management, cultural landscape enhancement, habitat creation, access and tourism. Edinburgh’s waterfront regeneration is ongoing with Granton benefiting from an ambitious masterplan, the tram extension to Leith progressing and potential development at Seafield helping to redefine the city’s relationship with its coastline, reusing existing assets and helping Edinburgh to become a more liveable city. A masterplanned approach to regenerating the Edinburgh Waterfront can take into account opportunities for the Port of Leith to service the offshore energy sector.\nAction 17 Reuse land and buildings\nA more liveable Central Belt means that we will need to do more to reuse empty buildings and vacant and derelict land, particularly spaces which have not been used for decades and can be accessed by sustainable modes. This will reduce further urban sprawl and improve local environments. Around 40% of Scotland’s vacant and derelict land is concentrated in the Glasgow city region and its redevelopment is a key priority. Edinburgh has committed to building a significant share of future housing development on brownfield sites…\nA combination of incentives, investment and policy support for productively reusing brownfield land and buildings at risk will be required to steer development away from greenfield locations. Public sector-led development can shape future markets and deliver development in places where change is needed the most and can deliver multiple benefits. Redevelopment should include, but not be limited to, housing development. By de-risking sites and taking an infrastructure-first approach, this land can help to achieve a better distribution of new homes to meet our future needs. This will also reduce pressure in places where growth is no longer sustainable.\nAction 18 Invest in net zero housing solutions\nAs well as building new homes to net zero standards, more will need to be done to upgrade the existing housing stock to reduce emissions and adapt to future climate impacts. Energy efficiency, sustainable accessibility, zero emissions heating solutions and water management will be key challenges. Areas which are largely residential and car-based could be diversified by supporting local businesses to provide services including leisure, active living, hospitality and retail. There is a particular pressure for affordable housing solutions in the south east of Scotland and there is also an opportunity for future housing development to help reduce emissions. Edinburgh has committed to building affordable homes at scale and will need to work with the region to accommodate wider need and demand in a strategic way. Seven strategic sites, supported through the Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal, could accommodate up to 45,000 homes and associated economic and employment benefits including: Blindwells, Calderwood, Dunfermline, Edinburgh Waterfront, Shawfair, Tweedbank and Winchburgh. The need for proposals to be supported by low carbon transport solutions, in line with the Infrastructure Investment Plan and National Transport Strategy investment hierarchies and infrastructure first approach, will be critical to their success. The Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Deal identifies infrastructure investment and includes a commitment from partners to put in place a regional developer contributions framework building on work undertaken to look at cross boundary transport challenges. These interventions and commitments, taken with the additional transport investment made through the Deal, will ensure the city region continues to grow and flourish. Regionally significant services including healthcare and social care facilities and investment in the learning estate is also planned to support future growth and sustain the wellbeing of existing, new and expanding communities. Emissions from our homes need to be very substantially reduced – by 2030, they must fall by 68% from 2020 levels.\nEngineered solutions to adapt our water and drainage infrastructure will be required in some circumstances, but should support more natural benefits as far as possible. There is scope to continue, and extend, the lessons from the Metropolitan Glasgow Strategic Drainage Plan to future proof infrastructure in support of the long term growth and development of Edinburgh. The Lothian Drainage Partnership is taking this forward with projects emerging within Edinburgh and at the ClimatEvolution Zone in East Lothian.\nAction 19 Grow a wellbeing economy\nThis area has a diverse business base and is a key engine of growth for Scotland as a whole. There are many clusters of sites and businesses which form the basis of regional propositions for investment. In line with our aspirations to build a wellbeing economy, opportunities for investment and development should be designed to maximise economic, social and environmental wellbeing, rather than focusing on growth alone. A planned approach can help to target future development in areas of significant economic disadvantage so that new and better jobs are more fairly distributed to help address national, regional and more localised inequality The pandemic has brought obvious challenges but has also unlocked opportunities to take forward new models of working that could better support our wellbeing and improve our places in the longer term. The continued growth of remote and local working and the creation of hubs within groups of settlements could significantly reduce the need to travel, whilst also helping to grow local businesses and communities. Existing offices have the potential to be repurposed to achieve higher density mixed use neighbourhoods with a lower carbon footprint and require careful planning to ensure future communities are properly supported by appropriate services.\nThe Edinburgh City region supports investment in significant clusters including the Bioquarter, Mid Fife, Dunfermline, Guardbridge St. Andrews, Galashiels, Cockenzie, Midlothian and the M8 corridor. A strategy for West Edinburgh is emerging which guides a wide range of uses to create a sustainable extension to the city, with added benefit from associated improvements to the quality of place of existing communities. Proposals focus on locating development on and around existing transport corridors and work is ongoing to improve accessibility including the Edinburgh tram extension. Further investment should take into account the impact of new development on potentially compounding existing capacity constraints and congestion, and prioritise sustainable choices.\nAction 20 Reimagine development on the urban fringe\nWhilst predominantly urban, this part of Scotland benefits from a rich and diverse rural area and there are many areas where town meets countryside. These green areas and natural spaces are key assets, sustaining communities that could become better places to live if we can achieve this in a way that is compatible with our wider aims for climate change, nature restoration and 20 minute neighbourhoods.\nAction 21 Improve urban accessibility\nA focus on community wealth building, together with growing opportunities for longer term remote working, could address the high levels of transport movement by private car and challenges of congestion and air pollution across the area. Local living, including 20 minute neighbourhoods, will help to minimise future commuting and ensure jobs and income can be spread more evenly across the area. Accessibility and transport affordability can support more resilience which benefits communities who are less connected. By putting in place mass transit systems for Edinburgh through plans to extend the tram network, and for Glasgow including the Glasgow Metro and multi-modal connectivity, we have an opportunity to substantially reduce levels of carbased commuting, congestion and emissions from transport at scale Connections to the rest of the UK will be strengthened in the longer term through high speed rail connectivity, with stations expected in Glasgow and Edinburgh.\nNational Developments\nEighteen national developments are proposed to support the delivery of our spatial strategy. These national developments range from single large scale projects or collections and networks of several smaller scale proposals. They are also intended to act as exemplars of the place principle and placemaking approaches.\nSome of the proposals are Scotland – wide and some area or site specific. Relevant to Edinburgh are:\n- Central Scotland Green Network This national development is one of Europe’s largest and most ambitious green infrastructure projects. It will play a key role in tackling the challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss including by building and strengthening nature networks. A greener approach to development will improve placemaking, can contribute to the roll-out of 20 minute neighbourhoods and will benefit biodiversity connectivity. This has particular relevance in the more urban parts of Scotland where there is pressure for development as well as significant areas requiring regeneration to address past decline and disadvantage. Regeneration, repurposing and reuse of vacant and derelict land should be a priority.\n- National Walking, Cycling and Wheeling Network This national development facilitates the shift from vehicles to walking, cycling and wheeling for everyday journeys contributing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport and is highly beneficial for health and wellbeing. The upgrading and provision of additional active travel infrastructure will be fundamental to the development of a sustainable travel network providing access to settlements, key services and amenities, employment and multi-modal hubs. Infrastructure investment should be prioritised for locations where it will achieve our National Transport Strategy 2 priorities and outcomes, to reduce inequalities, take climate action, help deliver a wellbeing economy and to improve health and wellbeing. This will help to deliver great places to live and work.\n- Urban Mass/Rapid Transit Networks This national development supports low-carbon mass/rapid transit projects for Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow. To reduce transport emissions at scale, we will require low-carbon transport solutions for these three major cities that can support transformational reduction in private car use. Phase 1 of the second Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR2) recommended the development of the Glasgow ‘Metro’ and Edinburgh Mass Transit in these cities and their associated regions. In Aberdeen, the North East Bus Alliance has been awarded funding through Transport Scotland’s Bus Partnership to develop the Aberdeen Rapid Transit system identified in the Regional Transport Strategy and being considered in the STPR2. This will support placemaking and deliver improved transport equity across the most densely populated parts of Scotland, improving access to employment and supporting sustainable investment in the longer term.\n- Urban Sustainable, Blue and Green Drainage Solutions This national development aims to build on the benefits of the Metropolitan Glasgow Strategic Drainage Partnership, to continue investment and extend the approach to the Edinburgh city region.\n- Circular Economy Materials Management Facilities This national development supports the development of facilities required to achieve a circular economy. This sector will provide a range of business, skills and employment opportunities as part of a just transition to a net zero economy.\n- Digital Fibre Network This national development supports the continued roll-out of world class broadband across Scotland\n- High Speed Rail This national development supports the implementation of increased infrastructure to improve rail capacity and connectivity on the main cross-border routes, the east and west coast mainlines. Rail connectivity that can effectively compete with air and road based transport between the major towns and cities in Scotland, England and onward to Europe is an essential part of reducing transport emissions, making best use of the rail network and providing greater connectivity opportunities. There can be significant emissions savings of approximately 75% to be made when freight is transported by rail instead of road.\n- Edinburgh Waterfront This national development supports the regeneration of strategic sites along the Forth Waterfront in Edinburgh. The waterfront is a strategic asset that contributes to the city’s character and sense of place and includes significant opportunities for a wide range of future developments. Development will include high quality mixeduse proposals that optimise the use of the strategic asset for residential, community, commercial and industrial purposes, including support for off-shore energy relating to port uses. Further cruise activity should take into account the need to manage impacts on transport infrastructure. This will help maintain and grow Edinburgh’s position as a capital city and commercial centre with a high quality and accessible living environment. Development locations and design will need to address future resilience to the risks from climate change, impact on health inequalities, and the potential to incorporate green and blue infrastructure.\nNational Planning Policy\nThe national policies set out in NPF4 draft follow the strategy approaches set out above. They are intended to replace Scottish Planning Policy and as part of the statutory development plan would not need to be repeated in future LDPs, though there is scope for further locally based policy which remain compliant.\nThe detailed policy provisions go further than the main principles set out in summary here and into provisions in line with those principles which can be applied to decision making on planning applications. Further details of and comment on those policy measures will be provided once there has been more time to consider them.\nSustainable Places\nPolicy 1: Plan-led approach to sustainable development\nAll local development plans should manage the use and development of land in the long term public interest. This means that new local development plans should seek to achieve Scotland’s national outcomes (within the meaning of Part 1 of the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015) and the UN Sustainable Development Goals\nPolicy 2: Climate emergency\nWhen considering all development proposals significant weight should be given to the Global Climate Emergency\nPolicy 3: Nature crisis\nDevelopment plans and proposals should facilitate biodiversity enhancement, nature recovery and nature restoration across the development plan area\nPolicy 4: Human rights and equality\nPlanning should respect, protect and fulfil human rights, seek to eliminate discrimination and promote equality.\nPolicy 5: Community wealth building\nDevelopment plans and proposals should address community wealth building priorities by reflecting a people-centred approach to local economic development. Spatial strategies should support community wealth building; address economic disadvantage and inequality; and provide added social value.\nPolicy 6: Design, quality and place\nDevelopment proposals should be designed to a high quality so that the scale and nature of the development contributes positively to the character and sense of place of the area in which they are to be located.\nLiveable Places\nPolicy 7: Local living\nDecision makers can determine what facilities can reasonably be expected to be accessible from homes, taking into account local circumstances, as well as the role of digital connectivity in providing some services remotely. Local development plans should support the principle of 20 minute neighbourhoods\nPolicy 8: Infrastructure First\nLocal Development Plans and delivery programmes should be based on an infrastructure-first approach.\nPolicy 9: Quality homes\nLocal development plans should identify a housing target for the area it covers, in the form of a Housing Land Requirement. Representing how much land is required, it should at least meet the 10 year Minimum AllTenure Housing Land Requirement (MATHLR) set out in Annex B. Land should be allocated to meet the Housing Land Requirement in sustainable locations that create quality places for people to live. The location of where new homes are allocated should be consistent with the principles of 20 minute neighbourhoods and an infrastructure-first approach. Development proposals for more than 50 dwellings should be accompanied by a statement of community benefit. Proposals for new homes that improve affordability and choice should be supported.\nProposals for market homes should generally only be supported where a contribution to the provision of affordable homes on a site is at least 25% of the total number of homes. A higher contribution than this benchmark may be sought where justified by evidence of need. The contribution should generally be for serviced land within a site to be made available for affordable housing.\nNew homes on land not identified for housebuilding in the local development plan should not be supported.\nPolicy 10: Sustainable transport\nLocal development plans and proposals should aim to reduce the need to travel unsustainably by prioritising locations for future development. The planning system should ensure that the National Transport Strategy 2 Sustainable Travel and Investment Hierarchies are integrated into the appraisal and assessment of development proposals and decisions in order to make best use of existing infrastructure, and reduce unsustainable travel and transport of goods.\nPolicy 11: Heat and cooling\nLocal development plans and proposals should take into account the area’s Local Heat & Energy Efficiency Strategy (LHEES) and areas of heat network potential and any designated heat network zones (HNZ) when allocating land.\nPolicy 12: Blue and green infrastructure, play and sport\nLocal development plans and proposals should identify and protect blue and green infrastructure.\nPolicy 13: Flooding\nLocal development plans and proposals should strengthen community resilience to the current and future impacts of climate change, including identifying opportunities to implement natural flood risk management and blue green infrastructure. Plans should take into account the probability of flooding from all sources. New development proposals in flood risk areas, or which can impact on flood risk areas, should be avoided. A cautious approach should be taken, regarding the calculated probability of flooding as a best estimate, not a precise forecast.\nPolicy 14: Health and wellbeing\nLocal development plans and proposals should aim to create vibrant, healthier and safe places and should seek to tackle health inequalities particularly in places which are experiencing the most disadvantage. The provision of health and social care facilities and infrastructure to meet the needs of the community should be a key consideration.\nPolicy 15: Safety\nDevelopment proposals in the vicinity of majoraccident hazard sites should take into account the potential impacts on the proposal and the major-accident hazard site of being located in proximity to one another.\nProductive Places\nPolicy 16: Business and Employment\nLocal development plans and proposals should set out proposals to meet requirements for employment land, infrastructure and investment in a way which supports a greener, fairer and more inclusive wellbeing economy.\nPolicy 17: Tourism\nLocal development plans and proposals should support the resilience of the tourism sector, including by identifying proposals for tourism development which reflect sector driven tourism strategies.\nPolicy 18: Culture and creativity\nLocal development plans and proposals should recognise and support opportunities for jobs and investment in the creative sector, culture, heritage and the arts.\nPolicy 19: Green Energy\nLocal development plans and proposals should seek to ensure that an area’s full potential for electricity and heat from renewable sources is achieved. Opportunities for new development, extensions and repowering of existing renewable energy developments should be supported.\nPolicy 20: Zero Waste\nLocal development plans should identify appropriate locations for new infrastructure to support the circular economy and meet identified needs in a way that moves waste as high up the waste hierarchy as possible.\nPolicy 21: Aquaculture\nLocal development plans should guide new aquaculture development to locations that reflect industry needs and take account of environmental impact, including cumulative impacts that arise from other existing and planned aquaculture developments in the area, and wider marine planning.\nPolicy 22: Minerals\nLocal development plans should support the 10-year landbank at all times in the relevant market areas, whilst promoting sustainable resource management, safeguarding important workable mineral resources, which are of economic or conservation value, and take steps to ensure these are not sterilised by other types of development.\nPolicy 23: Digital Infrastructure\nLocal development plans should support the delivery of digital infrastructure, particularly in areas with gaps in connectivity and barriers to digital access.\nDistinctive Places\nPolicy 24: Centres\nLocal development plans should support sustainable futures for city, town and local centres and identify a network of centres. This should reflect the principles of 20 minute neighbourhoods and the town centre vision, and take into account how they are connected by public transport and walking, wheeling and cycling.\nPolicy 25: Retail\nDevelopment proposals for retail development which will generate significant footfall in town centre sites should be supported; edge-of-town centre or commercial centres, should not be supported unless they are explicitly supported by the development plan; out-of-town locations should not be supported.\nPolicy 26: Town centre first assessment\nDevelopment proposals for other uses which will generate significant footfall (or in the case of drive-throughs, a significant number of visitors) including commercial leisure uses, offices, community and cultural facilities and, where appropriate, other public buildings such as libraries, education and healthcare facilities and public spaces where people can gather, should only be considered acceptable in out-of-centre locations if a town-centre first assessment demonstrates that it is appropriate.\nPolicy 27: Town Centre Living\nTown centre living should be encouraged and supported. Planning authorities should seek to provide a proportion of their housing land requirements in city and town centres and be proactive in identifying opportunities.\nPolicy 28: Historic Assets and Places\nLocal development plans and their spatial strategies should identify, protect and enhance locally, regionally, nationally and internationally valued historic assets and places.\nPolicy 29: Urban edges\nLocal development plans should consider using green belts where appropriate in some of the most accessible or pressured rural or peri-urban areas.\nPolicy 30: Vacant and Derelict Land\nLocal development plans should seek to reuse vacant and derelict land and redundant buildings as a priority including in proposals to creatively and sustainably repurpose buildings and structures.\nPolicy 31: Rural places\nLocal development plans should set out proposals to support the sustainability and prosperity of rural communities and economies.\nPolicy 32: Natural Places\nLocal development plans should identify and protect locally, regionally, nationally and internationally valued natural assets, landscapes, species and habitats.\nPolicy 33: Soils\nLocal development plans should protect locally, regionally, nationally and internationally valued soils.\nPolicy 34: Trees, Woodland and Forestry\nLocal development plans should identify and protect existing woodland and potential for its enhancement or expansion to avoid habitat fragmentation and improve ecological connectivity, helping to support nature networks. The spatial strategy should identify and set out proposals for the development of forestry and woodlands in their area, in associated Forestry and Woodland Strategies, including their development, protection and enhancement, resilience to climate change, and the expansion of woodlands of a range of types to provide multiple benefits to the physical, cultural, economic, social and environmental characteristics of the area, in accordance with The Right Tree in the Right Place guidance.\nPolicy 35: Coasts\nLocal development plan spatial strategies should consider how to adapt coastlines to the impacts of climate change. Plans should recognise that rising sea levels and more extreme weather events resulting from climate change will potentially have a significant impact on coastal and islands areas, and that a precautionary approach to flood risk including by inundation should be taken. An appropriate strategy for development should be set out that reflects the diversity of coastal areas and communities. This should take account of opportunities to use nature-based solutions to improve the resilience of coastal communities and assets\nDelivering Our Strategy\nDelivering our strategy and realising our collective ambitions requires collaborative action from the public and private sectors and wider communities. Actions will range across different scales and include a mix of strategic and project investments. It will be important to focus implementation and monitoring on delivering strategic actions and key developments.\nWe expect that our approach to delivery will draw on the following key delivery mechanisms:\n- Aligning Resources\n- Infrastructure First\n- Delivery of National Developments\n- Development Plan Policy and Regional Spatial Strategies\n- Local Place Plans\n- Planning obligations\n- Land assembly\n- Masterplan Consent Areas\n- Investing in the planning service",

The issue stems from the way Braid Road was reopened to two-way traffic, and the knock on impacts in the “Braids Estate”. We have had complaints from residents about genuine road safety issues in the area. There is also LOT of bad feeling about the way consultations were used by the previous transport committee.\nWe asked Officers to consult locally on solutions, and the outcome was considered today. There were basically three options which were all workable as far as I am concerned (but come with positives and negatives). The 5 parties on the Committee, however, managed to find 4 positions between them… so some compromise was required to reach a majority.\nThe Committee opted to listen to local residents and replace the existing modal filters (planters or other barrier) with a fully segregated cycle route through the area along Hermitage Drive and Braid Avenue (a common cycling route), with safety improvements for pedestrians and cyclists at junctions.\nWe took on board wider concerns and also agreed:\n- That Braid Avenue and Braid Road (north of Hermitage Drive) are not primary traffic routes, and this should be reflected in their layout and design.\n- Speed reduction measures should be installed on Hermitage Drive, Midmar Drive, the of Braid Road (southern extent) and Braid Ave were there are known speeding issues.\n- Consideration should be given to providing a parking space for Blue Badge holders as close as possible to the Hermitage of Braid entrance.\n- The TEC Convener should write to Police Scotland requesting that Safety Cameras Scotland to enforce the known speeding problem on the southern half of Braid Road and other speeding sites identified by the Council (e.g. Bridge Road, Swanston Road and Woodhall Road).\n- Any necessary updates to local School Travel Plans are made.\nThere was no change to quiet route north of Cluny Gardens other than installing a modal filter on Clinton Road.\nThe full consultation report is here.\nThe full Evening News report is here.",

This had a huge impact and, despite their lack of credibility on either issue, it powered them to victory in 2015 & 2017.\nDay-by-day since then the reality of the SNP’s record in government has been shown to be in sharp contrast to their 2014 rhetoric. We’ve seen public services go backwards whilst Nicola Sturgeon obsessed about a second divisive independence referendum that Scotland didn’t want. Voters saw that the SNP were simply using fighting inequality and austerity as a vehicle for furthering their constitutional obsession.\nNowhere was this more stark than the council elections. People saw that whilst SNP local government manifestos across Scotland had a clear commitment to tackling “Tory Austerity”, none were willing to say they’d do anything about cuts imposed by the Scottish Government.\nSo whilst it’s correct that the SNP lost votes on the 8th of June due to their constitutional obsession, Labour won votes because of the clear commitment we had to fighting austerity imposed by Westminster and Holyrood.\nWe were clear that we’d protect the poorest by opposing austerity and the Scottish Government’s willingness to cut services for the vulnerable rather than use its revenue raising powers. We were just as clear about this as the damage we feel independence would do to Scotland.\nThat’s why I will be arguing that Edinburgh’s Labour Councillors should not back any city administration that’s unwilling to oppose cuts inflicted on our capital by the Scottish Government. I also want to see the city administration make a clear commitment to protecting the benefits the UK and EU single markets give Edinburgh.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_07_16_a-very-public-apology-to-the-edinburgh-snp-group/content_281.html": "New relationships are always difficult. Expectations must be managed and boundaries must be respected. People get stressed, make mistakes and learn lessons.\nThis week the SNP Group in the City of Edinburgh Council have made three complaints about two of my recent blogs. These complaints are not without merit (more on that later), but I do wonder if the issue here is also a clash of cultures. In 2015 it was widely reported that SNP candidates had to sign an agreement saying they would not “publicly criticise a group decision, policy or another member of the group”. At the time this was described by other parties as a “snub to civil liberties” and “Stalinist”. I’ve no problem with the SNP having its own internal rules, but the Labour Party has its own rules – these are the only ones I’m obliged to respect.\nOn to the complaints. The first two, which I have not actually seen yet, I understand relate to my blog notionally on, erm, weeds (it is actually a blog about SNP cuts to Edinburgh’s funding). My point on weeds was simple – the Full Council (debate video here) was right to forward this issued to the August Transport and Environment Committee (TEC) so that a robust approach is in place for 2018. However, I felt Cllr Lesley Macinnes (TEC Convener) should have also stressed in an Evening News article that staff were working hard on this issue right now. My blog sought to highlight that weeds are an issue in my Ward (there are weeds several feet high on one of the main routes through it) and we need to tackle it now. The problem across the city it is causing huge damage to our reputation with tourists. Indeed, this week I received this from a lady that had just returned to Ireland after a short visit to Edinburgh:\n“I visited my son who lives in Edinburgh last week and I was appalled at the litter and weeds everywhere. He lives in the Summerside area of Edinburgh. I arrived on Wednesday and by Friday morning I could not cope any longer, I took my spade and fork and dug the weeds and cleaned the litter on the street near his house. Its a shame to see Edinburgh in that state, it looks like a city falling into dereliction.”\nMy blog was not about me opposing the motion to refer the weeds problem to TEC (I support it). It was not because I feel chemicals are the only way to deal with weeds (I have concerns about their use). It was not because I hate biodiversity (I don’t). The blog was about me representing my constituents and suggesting the City of Edinburgh Council should be seen to be tackling the problem right now (that is now happening) as well as planning for 2018. I am willing to accept that those points may not have been clear in my blog (all my blogs are within the 200-300 word limit set by newspapers for letters) and I apologise for that unreservedly.\nThe third complaint relates to housing – a much more important issue. On the 29th of June Cllr Steve Burgess and principally Cllr Susan Rae (both Scottish Greens) had a motion passed by Full Council (debate video here) which was a “call for a report on the steps that need to be taken to implement a city-wide Rent Pressure Zone to limit increases in high rents in the private rented sector” – A move which I wholeheartedly support.\nOn the 10th of July Cllr Kate Campbell posted a blog on the SNP website which made some good points but also said she was “delighted” that a “motion on creating a rent pressure zone in Edinburgh was passed at council”. Not only was she wrong about what the motion entailed (the difference is more than semantics), she also failed to mention the fact that it was proposed by the Scottish Greens.\nThe blog contained other errors and omissions relating to Scottish Government policy. Given that those policies are not endorsed by the City of Edinburgh Council, I felt completely free to offer an alternative view on SNP housing policy via my blog.\nIn her “formal” complaint about my blog to the Labour Group Whip, Cllr Kate Campbell described my blog as “a pretty silly piece” and “unhelpful”. I’ve no problem with the first point, but I do wonder who my blog was unhelpful to given that it focused on SNP policy? The SNP? Private landlords?\nI don’t really see it as being my job to be helpful to other political parties. If politicians put forward their opinions, they should be willing to have those views challenged. That’s exactly what Cllr Lesley Macinnes did when she publicly attacked me in the Evening News on Friday!\nCllr Kate Campbell did raise one further point in her complaint which relatied to a misjudgement I did arguably make. Duncan Hothersall made the point on twitter that Cllr Kate Campbell was “bemoaning ‘brutal austerity’ in Edinburgh. Tories cut grant by 1.5%. SNP cut council funding by 4.6%.”. I replied with a link to my blog and copied in Cllr Kate Campbell saying “I wrote a brief response to @KateC_SNP earlier”. Cllr Kate Campbell has said that I did not need to copy her in – she is absolutely right, and I apologise unreservedly for that.\nIn conclusion, new relationships are always difficult. Expectations must be managed and boundaries must be respected. People get stressed, make mistakes and hopefully learn lessons. However, nobody benefits from having a controlling partner.\nKey questions:\n- Will I continue to stand up for my constituents? Yes!\n- Will I continue to defend Edinburgh against Scottish Government cuts? Yes!\n- Will I continue to stand up for my party’s values? Yes!\n- Will I challenge views from other parties that I don’t agree with? Yes!\n- Will I be more careful about how I do that? Yes!\nImportant: these are my views alone and not endorsed by anyone else!",

I embraced its vibrancy, diversity and inclusiveness. My abiding memory of that summer was that, compared to Dundee, the large number of people on the streets meant I always felt safe when walking around the city at night.\nSince then, however, in my view the Edinburgh’s Festivals have changed. The old experience is still there I’m sure, but it’s drowned out by a bigger and much more commercial offering – this perhaps reflects changes we’ve seen elsewhere in society. One estimate puts the value of the Festivals as being £1 billion.\nAlthough some people do make valid points about the nature and character of Edinburgh’s Festivals (particularly the Edinburgh Festival Fringe), most of us remain proud that people from around the world want to come to Edinburgh to enjoy the Festivals, explore our fantastic city and gamble with our weather. Like me, however, they want visitors to see Edinburgh at its best. Whether visitors are from Newtongrange, Newcastle or New Zealand, Edinburgh residents want to be proud of what they see when they come here. Like me, they want bins emptied, potholes filled and weeds cleared from footpaths. It’s easy to dismiss these problems, but first impressions really do count.\nHarder to dismiss, however, has been the creeping privatisation of public space in our cities. The impact of this means that amenity is lost for visitors and residents alike. Three examples:\n- I am a fan of Edinburgh’s “A-Board Ban” which means footpaths can’t be used to display temporary on-street advertising structures. This frees up valuable footpath space, making it easier and safer for those with mobility problems, buggies and young children to get around. Whilst it may be right that the Edinburgh Festival Fringe is shown some flexibility on this, the exemption they have has gone much further than expected.\n- One of the great things about Edinburgh, is the unexpected fantastic views people encounter just walking around the city. However, the creeping privatisation of public space means these views are now being blocked to support commercial activity or to host advertising.\n- Outside my Ward, one of the best views in Edinburgh is looking from Princess Street, across the gardens, up to the castle. This view is part of what defines Edinburgh and on any day of the year pedestrians (both residents and visitors alike) can you found photographing it. The problem is that these same people can also view ticketed events in Princess Street Gardens so on “safety” grounds a wooden barrier was erected last year and nobody quite knew what to do (see here and here for big talk, and here for the u-turn. This year we have a “curtain style” barrier and access is denied to large sections of the footpath on the south side of Princes Street. The barrier also extends around a large portion of Princes Street Gardens and access is via a £35 ticket. Creeping privatisation essentially means that increasingly the public can’t fully access public parks.\nWhat is interesting is that those that support the ever-increasing impact on public space are unwilling to enter a debate about the loss of amenity. Instead, they suggest that those who question their agenda are somehow “anti-tourist”. Indeed, Steve Cardownie recently referred to those who are trying to make Edinburgh better for residents and visitors alike as the “wet blanket brigade and other assorted naysayers”, and followed this up with a second article written as if he were one of them – Grumpy McGrump. Written in the “what have the Romans ever done for us” style, it focuses on the many positives of the festival without really considering how it could be improved.\nBuilding on this Cardownie’s argument a fellow Nationalist his, Council Leader Adam McVey, recently took to Twitter to tell the world that the £35 Glasgow’s DF Concerts were charging for access to concerts was affordable to “young people” and “working class people”, and that £145 may be acceptable. Again, no comment was made about the loss of amenity. The reality is that McVey appears a little out-of-touch as many young working class people in my Ward are struggling to pay their rent right now, never mind paying £145 for a concert ticket.\nTo be absolutely clear I am not saying these concerts should stop, although I know that those who support the creeping privatisation of public space will try to characterise my argument in that way. I do, however, reject the argument that they can’t happen without compromising pedestrian safety on Princes Street and, as I said elsewhere, we need to protect our parks from creeping privatisation.\nThat’s why I was recently concerned to read that Glasgow’s DF Concerts thinks Princes Street Gardens could become “Scotland’s answer to the Hollywood Bowl” and urged Edinburgh to look at New York’s Central Park because it has “loads of events”, saying cities like Edinburgh need to “utilise their assets” better. The basis of this approach appears to be that West Princes Street Gardens is a commodity which should be encircled by barriers so it can be exploited. Similarly, the Scotsman is reporting that the gardens may be used to screen “major sporting events”.\nIt may well be that these changes are for the best, and the city may benefit from them. I can’t help thinking, however, that we can do better. The Scotsman article also notes that the Gardens may well be used for bite-sized Tattoo performances. Would it not be great if this was opened up to people for free?\nIn July this year the National Mall parkland in the USA was used as a place to celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing. These fantastic events (video link below) were attended by thousands of people for free. I’d much rather that Edinburgh’s public parks was used for this type of inclusive event rather exclusive events for those that can afford it.\nWhether it is obscured views or cluttered pavements, visitors must leave Edinburgh thinking we take our heritage for granted. We have to remember it’s our built and cultural heritage that makes Edinburgh special, not boarded up parks and blocked pavements.",

The King and members of the Royal Family will arrive on Monday for the Ceremony of the Keys, followed by a historic procession up the Royal Mile and a service at St Giles’ Cathedral, where the Queen will lie at rest before leaving for London late afternoon on Tuesday.\nHer Majesty’s coffin will then lie at rest in St Giles’ Cathedral, guarded by Vigils from The Royal Company of Archers, to allow the people of Scotland to pay their respects. Members of the public who wish to do so will be able to view the coffin at rest from 5pm on Monday 12 September and conclude the following afternoon.\nWith the city centre already filling up with crowds of mourners, we’re urging people to plan ahead and avoid any non-essential travel on Sunday along the line of the cortege route as people pay their respects to Her Majesty The Queen.\nThousands are expected to gather along the route, and anyone wishing to come along is being urged to do so safely, plan ahead and allow extra time, taking account of local and city centre road closures, weather conditions and the likelihood of spending many hours at the roadside. We will continue to update our dedicated webpages with the latest advice and road closures.\nLying in Rest\nHer Majesty The Queen will lie at rest at St Giles’ Cathedral following the Service before the coffin’s journey to London. Members of the public who wish to do so will be able to view the coffin at rest and pay their respects. This will begin at 5pm on Monday 12 September and conclude the following afternoon.\nThere is expected to be a high level of interest and a queuing system will be in place. The Scottish Government will provide further details on arrangements tomorrow.\nPlease be aware that this may involve standing for a number of hours in challenging weather conditions, so come prepared.\nSecurity checks will be in place at St Giles’ and certain restrictions will apply on mobile phones. Photography /recording is not permitted.\nThe queue will pass a number of locations where refreshments can be bought.\nBooks of Condolence\nWe have set up both virtual and in person Books of Condolence for the public to sign.\nVolunteers\nThe Chief Executive has issued an appeal on behalf of Police Scotland asking for volunteers for the ceremonial events taking place from tomorrow who can offer support as marshals. This isn’t a formal stewarding role as police officers and stewards will be present. The volunteers will instead provide assurance and help the public feel safe and cared for. This appeal has also been sent to partner organisations and local authorities.\nFurther updates\nA full list of ceremonial events taking place across Scotland has been published. For the most up-to-date information, please visit our dedicated web page, the Scottish Government and Royal Household websites. The @edintravel traffic information team will be carefully monitoring the city’s roads, sharing the latest information on disruption and diversions on Twitter. Lothian Buses and Edinburgh Trams will be keeping people informed about their services.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_09_29_interim-survey-results-improving-buckstone-play-park/content_87.html": "Introduction\nMany thanks to everyone who has responded to my survey regarding Buckstone Play Park and the potential to improve it. I’d hoped to get 100 responses, but after just one week I had 201. The survey is still open and 258 people have now completed it.\nMy wife and I have lived in Buckstone since 2000, and both our kids (now 18 & 23) grew up loving the play park here (and the one in Fairmilehead Park). Since then, the park has been expanded and should last a few more years. There is a feeling, however, that it is now a little dated. Lockdown has highlighted to us all how important parks are, and over the past year many local parents and grandparents have contacted me asking if Buckstone’s play park can be improved. It is within than context that I drafted the survey.\nIt is important to note that I only want to use the survey to understand what people want. It is not a referendum, and I am hopeful that if we can improve the park we can reach an outcome that everyone is happy with!\nInterim Survey Results\nIn this section of the blog I hope to run through some of the key outcomes from the survey so far.\nIn terms of making the park more accessible for everyone, many thought that the access path could be improved and that equipment added to support kids with disabilities. Specifically, swings and sensory elements were mentioned.\nOverall, I think that it is clear that that people feel the park has been overlooked and there is an appetite for change. Many people noted that an improved park may acts as a better focal point for the community.\nI spoke to Council Officers a few weeks ago, and they agreed to cost the preferred options. Based on the survey, I shall ask for request costs for:\n- A skate park;\n- A flying fox;\n- A timber climbing fort / slide / play house; and,\n- An improved access path.\nI shall also seek advice on how kids with disabilities can enjoy the park more.\nOnce we have costs and plans for this, we can discuss the plans within the local community and consider the next steps.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2016_12_14_the-snp-abolished-pfi-or-did-they/content_68.html": "In 2006 Alex Salmond told Scotland that “PFI was a quick fix and a costly mistake”. If elected (he was), he was going to ensure “our public assets can be held in trust for the nation all without the unnecessary private profit that is part and parcel of PFI”. Forget the fact that “unnecessary private profit” was never defined, this was about bashing Labour.\nIn their 2007 manifesto, the SNP said: “The Private Finance Initiative was devised by the Tories and has been embraced with enthusiasm by New Labour. However it is really a type of privatisation, with all the disadvantages which that entails.”\nOf course, the same manifesto was less clear on what the SNP alternative was. The public perception soon became that PFI was abolished. An easy mistake to make:\nIn reality, it had been replaced by the SNP’s “NPD” (non-profit distributing) model. Progress was slow, but by 2011 peer reviewed research stated it came at “high economic cost”. The same paper concluded: “The argument of the Cabinet Secretary that NPD will eliminate ‘excessive profits’ is not supported by the evidence.”\nIn July this year the alarm bells began to ring quite loudly. The Guardian reported that the programme will cost the taxpayer £10 billion in borrowing and running costs between now and 2048.\nThe same document quoted a leaked SNP Government memo concerning the projects: “Any perception of public sector control over the [project] delivery company must be avoided.” The problem was that misinterpreting EU rules was expected to cost millions in lost expenditure as it had to match the private spending under the NPD programme with money borrowed from the Treasury – equivalent of £932m.\nNow details of the Dumfries Hospital have come to light. This project cost £212m to build, but the interest on the loan tops £160m: “According to documents released by NHS Dumfries & Galloway under FoI legislation, the consortium – whose members include insurance group Aviva and building firm Laing O’Rourke – is charging an interest rate of 5.1% on borrowings of £218m. This results in the consortium earning more than £100m in interest payments from the public sector. It is also charging 11.3% on a further £24.2m in ‘subordinate debt’, which will earn financiers £37.5m in interest. If Scottish ministers had instead used public borrowing they would expect interest rates from the state-run national loans fund of about 1.6%.”\nLittle wonder that Audit Scotland have launched an inquiry into the SNP’s re-branded PFI.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_08_14_briefing-princes-street-screens/content_536.html": "Below is a briefing I received on the now infamous screens erected along Princes Street to prevent people from seeing concerts in Princes Street Gardens for free.\nYou will no doubt be aware of the recent concern around the screens on Princes St erected as a public safety measure as part of the Summer Sessions concerts. You may know that these were removed yesterday in response to public concern.\nDiscussions between the Council, Police Scotland and the event organisers have taken place yesterday and today. In all these discussions, public safety has been of paramount importance, particularly with respect to the potential for crowds gathering on Princes St to try to view the event from outside the ticketed arena. Following further advice from both Police Scotland and Public Safety officers today, the following have been agreed as a set of measures which achieve the balance of respecting the setting and public amenity, whilst putting public safety first:\n- Pedestrian barriers will be erected after 14:30 halfway across the southern pavement;\n- The screen will be erected no earlier than 16:00 on the day of a concert (subject to review by Police Scotland and Council officers);\n- The screens will be completely removed immediately after each concert;\n- The screens will be mounted on the stone plinth of the railings meaning they will be lower than previously.\nThe screens will be therefore be lower than they were before and, importantly, they will be removed immediately after each performance. The benefit to this approach is that both sides of the Princes Street will be accessible, meaning minimum disruption for passers-by, maximum public safety precautions and clear views of the Gardens and the Castle at all other times.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_02_05_update-the-momentum-is-growing-for-returning-oxgangs-library-to-the-community/content_138.html": "Last weekend I reported on my Facebook page that I had had a steady flow of complaints over the past few months about the continued closure of Oxgangs Library for Covid testing, but these had intensified recently.\nI outlined how I had been raising concerns inside the Council almost every week, but the Scot Gov will not give up the building. I made clear that I even suggested they put a testing portacabin in the carpark, but they are not interested. My stated position is that when the contract with the Scot Gov ends on 31st of March, I shall oppose a renewal unless there is absolutely no alternative.\nFollowing my Facebook post (and even more complaints from local people), on Monday I had separate meetings with both Sarah Boyack MSP and Cllr Cammy Day (Deputy Leader of the Council). Sarah Boyack MSP is equally concerned about the situation, and offered to write to the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care (Humza Yousaf MSP) making clear the concerns of the community.\nMy meeting with Cllr Cammy Day was equally productive – he offered to write to the Chief Executive of the Council making clear that Oxgangs Library should now be returned to the community. Indeed, the press have become aware of this and it was reported by the Evening News today.\n“Oxgangs library needs to reopen, but if they want to put a pop-up centre in the car park we’re more than happy to work with them on that.”\nCllr Cammy Day (Deputy Leader of the Council)\nIn his letter to the Chief Executive, Cllr Day says: “I ask that you now write to the UK and Scottish governments, advising them that whilst we remain fully supportive of the vaccine and test programs, we require the use of these libraries returned for public use with immediate effect. I would ask this is taken forward as a matter of urgency and I look forward to a plan of action.”\nFollowing this, the Council’s “Head of Libraries, Sport and Wellbeing” contacted me making clear that in the interim she is “continuing to explore options for the provision of temporary library services at Oxgangs Library”. She has advised me that from next week there will be a temporary mobile vehicle service for Oxgangs on a twice weekly basis. The temporary mobile library service will be provided on the street at Oxgangs Bank, close to the Oxgangs Library site, and will be available every Monday evening (5pm to 7.30pm) and every Thursday (10am to 4.30pm). The provision will start on the 7th February and will provide the following services:\n- Customers borrowing, returning and reserving library stock;\n- Bus pass applications;\n- Hey Girls sanitary provision;\n- Hearing aid batteries;\n- Food recycling bags; and,\n- Lateral flow test kits.\nIn addition, the local library staff team will be on hand every Monday morning (10am to 1pm) at the Pentlands Community Centre, (on Oxgangs Brae), to offer access to a limited range of services. Residents are asked to call in advance to book a visit on 0131 445 2871.\nAll this is welcome progress, but we still don’t have the library back. People in my Ward deserve better than a limited range of books and services in a mobile library.\nOxgangs Library sits at the heart of the community, and is a friendly place where people come to meet, learn and relax. Lending books is only a small part of the benefits it delivers, it’s the support for children and young families that is missed most. With the exam season fast approaching, the study space it provides for young people living in overcrowded accommodation in Oxgangs and Firrhill is invaluable.\nOxgangs & Firrhill are acknowledged as areas of social deprivation where there is little for children and young families to do. Within that context, the continued closure of Oxgangs Library is having a significant negative impact on the wellbeing of some of the most vulnerable young people in my Ward. We need to do all we can to find an alternative location for the testing facility, and reopen the Oxgangs Library to the community as soon as possible.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_10_15_briefing-2018-19-flu-jab-programme-has-started/content_627.html": "Below is a briefing on the Winter 2018/19 Flu Jab Programme. There is some confusion this year as the “Fluad Jab” is only available to over 75s in Scotland (over 65s get it in England). However, all other eligible people (see table below) will get the usual jab as normal. That includes people like my wife (she’s a nurse) and myself (I have a cardiac pacemaker).\nBriefing\nFlu had a major impact on the lives of many in 2017, with an increase in both the number of reported flu cases and hospitalisations due to flu. The impact was felt in all walks of life and is one of the most unpleasant illnesses today, and in some cases, particularly for our most vulnerable can be fatal. Flu has a financial impact with days lost to sick leave impacting on business productivity and services reduced\nAs a result, this year’s campaign, commencing on the 1 October 2018 is focused on highlighting the serious nature of flu, urging those eligible for the vaccine to act early to ensure they are ready for flu ahead of winter.\nBy ensuring we vaccinate as many of the population as possible we can break the chain, protect the population and reduce the impact.\nEligible groups for the free vaccination include anyone with a health condition, people aged 65 and over, pregnant women and children from age 2 until the end of primary school.\nMyths and facts about flu\nMyth – Only old people get flu\nAnyone of any age can catch flu – but certain people are more at risk of serious side effects. This group includes older people, who are at risk because of their age, but also people of any age even if they feel fit and healthy who have certain long-term medical conditions like heart, lung, liver or kidney problems or lowered immunity due to disease or treatments. Pregnant women are also at greater risk. People of all ages are seriously affected by flu every year.\nMyth – The flu vaccine hasn’t been tested, it’s not safe!\nA complete myth – All vaccines, including flu vaccines, have to be tested before they can be licensed in the UK, and they have to be licensed before they can be used. Also remember that flu vaccines have been in use since the 1960s, and around a million doses are administered every year in Scotland alone – it’s one of the most commonly administered medicines. Like all medicines, some patients will experience side effects to flu vaccination but these are generally mild and usually resolved without treatment.\nMyth – There’s mercury in the vaccine\nThere is no mercury present in the vaccines used in Scotland. One vaccine may have a tiny amount of ethylmercury or ‘thiomersal’ left in it from the manufacturing process but, ethylmercury is completely safe. You would get more mercury from a single tuna sandwich than from the flu vaccine.\nMyth – It’s dangerous for pregnant women and their babies to be vaccinated\nWhen you’re pregnant, your immune system changes, so women are at greater risk of complications from flu, such as having a miscarriage or going into premature labour. The flu vaccine will protect you and your unborn child and it can also protect your baby for three months after birth providing extra peace of mind during that crucial first stage. The vaccine is offered free to all pregnant women and is endorsed by the Royal College of Midwives as well as Scotland’s Chief Medical and Chief Nursing Officers.\nMyth – Flu is just a bad cold\nColds and flu are caused by different viruses and the effects vary hugely. Colds come on gradually (runny nose, then sore throat then a cough) but flu hits you straight away and most commonly with a fever. Flu is a much more dangerous virus which can lead to serious infections and illness. It’s a contagious disease of the respiratory tract (nose, throat, and lungs) that can lead to complications including pneumonia, bronchitis, meningitis and encephalitis. It can cause worsening of chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure, asthma, or diabetes.\nAmongst even healthy people flu can disrupt your work and social plans for up to two weeks and you can expect to have a fever, headaches, extreme tiredness, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, and body aches.\nMyth – Antibiotics can cure flu\nAbsolutely not! Antibiotics kill bacteria. Flu is caused by viruses, which don’t respond to antibiotics. Sometimes people who experience complications as a result of flu can be given antibiotics because they develop a secondary bacterial infection (such as bacterial pneumonia) – but this is not flu itself, instead, it is the result of the body being weakened by the virus and letting bacteria take hold. The best way to protect yourself against flu is to get vaccinated as early as possible.\nMyth – The flu vaccine protects you straight away\nIt actually takes about ten days for you to be protected against flu after you get the vaccine – so theoretically you could be immunised and then pick up flu before you are fully protected. That is why it is best to get the vaccine as early as possible and before there are lots of flu viruses circulating.\nMyth – The flu vaccine will stop me from catching a cold\nNo, it won’t. The flu vaccine protects you against flu viruses. Colds are caused by other less serious viruses that are completely different from flu. You may still get winter colds after getting the flu vaccine, but you’re much less likely to get flu itself, which is potentially a much more serious condition.\nFact – Coughs and sneezes spread diseases\nFlu viruses are spread by spluttering, sneezing and other ways of sharing your germs. In fact, one sneeze from someone with flu can project between 2,000 and 5,000 particles of virus-filled droplets at a speed of 100mph. Anyone within 30 feet of that sneeze is unlikely to avoid those droplets and therefore could become infected.\nVisit http://www.nes.scot.nhs.uk/flu/hcw for more myth-busting facts.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_07_06_briefing-surface-water-flooding-in-edinburgh-4th-of-july-2021/content_245.html": "Below is a note from Council staff on Sunday’s flooding in Edinburgh. Below that is a update from the gully team from a couple of weeks ago on the progress they were making in my Ward.\nFlooding in Edinburgh – 4th July 2021\nYou will no doubt be aware of the localised, but significant, surface water flooding that we experienced in a number of areas of the city yesterday afternoon and evening.\nI thought it would be useful to provide you with an update on action taken to date and some background information on our operations.\nThe Gully Team worked throughout last night and today to respond to reports of flooding. This team has also been supported by additional resource from the Roads Operations service in order to respond to as many reports as possible, as quickly as we could.\nUnfortunately, the significant rainfall intensity that we experienced was way beyond the capacity of the road drainage system. There were a number of examples across the city where road drains were surcharging due to the Scottish Water sewer network also being at capacity. As you would expect, we are working with Scottish Water to identify these locations and any potential solutions to prevent future recurrences.\nMuch of the flooding subsided relatively quickly after the rainfall intensity reduced, which would indicate a lack of capacity in the drainage network as opposed to blocked road drainage. At the time of writing, there is no known location where there is still standing water.\nIn addition to responding to the flooding and any clean ups that are required, Roads Operations have also been responding to damaged manhole covers. Where these covers are the responsibility of Scottish Water, we have been making them safe and then passing them on to Scottish Water for fuller repair or replacement.\nMembers will be aware that we operate a target schedule of every two years for gully emptying. In addition, we have an enhanced six monthly emptying frequency for the sensitive locations in the city where there are known hotspots for surface water flooding. I can report that the sensitive location routes had been completed in advance of the adverse weather event. In addition, over 10,500 gullies had been attended to in the last four months alone in line with our wider maintenance schedule.\nI appreciate that you may be contacted by constituents who have, unfortunately, experienced water damage to residential or commercial properties. If this is the case, we recommend that these constituents are advised to contact their insurance company as a priority. If you do feel that there is a complaint that you feel warrants further investigation then please email Roads.GullyCleansing@edinburgh.gov.uk.\nIf you would like to discuss any of the content of this note, or any other related matter, then please feel free to contact me directly.\nWard 8 Gully Maintenance (15th June 2021)\nWe are making progress all be it slowly, I am not sure any of us knew the extent of the backlog and issues we would face when we applied for the drainage team and it does certainly have it’s challenges but we are starting to seeing a difference.\nWe now have two of our three new vehicles, one old one and one on hire. We are working through the back log of add hoc reports as well as making inroads into the scheduled routes.\nThe works supervisor advises the ward 8 reports have all been done with the exception of any that had parked cars and the ones I have just raised that he hasn’t seen yet, the scheduled routes in ward 8 are being done and once we have a list of any gullies that could not be accessed a Traffic Order will be raised to ban the parking to allow any left to be cleaned. We have even cleaned the gullies and poly channels on the Colinton Bridge.\nThis progress is being echoed across the city where we are starting to see less reports coming in which is letting us keep the lorries on routes. We can see up to 50 gullies cleaned a day per vehicle on a route as appose to as few as 10 if the lorry is on add hoc reports as these can be scattered over several areas.\nThe repair team have also been very busy and we are working through some very long standing issues that have been repeatedly causing flooding issues for some time. One such job we have just completed near Ratho, Scottish Water had sent a mole up a footway to pull a new main through, this ran up a gully line for about 50m. This had been left to flood each time it rained for a number of years. We now have a new line in and no flooding and Scottish Water will be recharged for this.\nI am not under any illusions we are there yet or that things will ever get quiet but it is moving in the right direction.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_01_12_briefing-three-problems-on-the-water-of-leith-walkway_comment-page-1/content_614.html": "May 2020 Update\nThe blog below is from January, I have now had this update from teh Council:\nUnfortunately our funding application to the FCC Communities Foundation has been unsuccessful. Obviously there is little we can progress at present however, later in the year (after the Covid-19 crisis) we will be investigating options and seeking funds elsewhere. If anything, it is more likely that we will be able to obtain funding for the Pipeline Bridge in the first instance. Due to the limited access and costs we may have to think differently for the bridge over the river at Redhall Weir. Options which have been discussed include:\n- Removing the bridge and replacing it with a downgraded structure i.e. a much narrower pedestrian only footbridge.\n- Removing the bridge deck and replacing from one side part way across to create a view point in the middle of the river – initial thoughts are that this would not cost effective and we may be able to get a replacement bridge for around the same cost.\n- Removing the bridge deck but not replacing it – obviously this is not a desirable option however, it depends on funding available.\n- Leaving the bridge as a closed asset. This would be far from ideal as the structure would remain an eyesore and a burden to continually check the barriers/signage, again not a desirable option.\n- Prior to the installation of this bridge (which I am led to believe was the 1970’s) there were large boulders which people used as stepping stones. This was mentioned to me by the Water of Leith Conservation Trust, after discussion it is thought this would not be safely achievable.\n- I have also briefly discussed the potential for crowd funding with the Water of Leith Conservation Trust. We are looking at a substantial amount of money to replace the bridge and I don’t know if this would be seen as achievable via crowd funding.\nPlease note no decisions have been made nor will they be made without further investigation and discussion later in the year.\nJanuary 2020 Blog\nOn the 31st of December 2019 the Evening News carried an article about the long-term closure of the Water of Leith path between Sunbury Bridge and the steps at Dean Path. In the article Ian Johnston made the point that:\n“…the Water of Leith is a particularly wonderful part of Edinburgh – something I appreciated more on my return to the city – and it would be a terrible shame if the path continues to remain in its current truncated state for much longer.”\nI have spoken to Council’s Natural Heritage Officer about this and was given this response:\n- The Council (“CEC”) has raised legal proceedings against a number of parties in respect of the landslip at the Dean Path.\n- Before steps can be taken to reopen the path, the causes of the slippage require to be identified and measures to prevent further slippage implemented.\n- Public safety and future amenity of the area remain paramount.\n- CEC have authorised the use of funds to jointly meet the cost of specialist engineers to design and provide costings for the retaining works.\n- Technical experts appointed by CEC and other parties respectively have now identified potential engineering solutions.\n- Legal proceedings remain paused while parties explore resolution.\n- Discussions are on-going with a view to agreeing these between CEC and the neighbouring owner(s).\nSo it looks like there is no immediate solution to the problem.\nI also raised the complaints I have received about two closed bridges in Colinton Dell. Both are outside my Ward but lots of my constituents use them – below is the response I received from the Council:\n“With regard to the two bridge closures in the Dells, referred to in points one and two of your email, we do not have a timescale for the reopening of these. However, I can confirm a grant application has been submitted to FCC Communities Foundation, included in the application is improvements to the path/steps/drainage on the access path to/from Dell Road (by Colinton Kirk), the installation of a new Pipeline Bridge, the removal and installation of a new bridge over the river parallel to Redhall Weir. The application should be considered by the Board of Directors on 04 March 2020 who will decide whether the project should be funded. A capital bid has also been applied for internally and we should receive an answer regarding any potential funding by the end of February 2020.”\nSo it looks like there is no immediate solution to these issues either.",

In summary it shows:\n- Close road to vehicular traffic on Buckstone Loan East at Buckstone Close maintaining access for pedestrians and cyclists\n- Prohibit vehicles on Buckstone Circus [SA – I think this is Buckstone Circle, I am waiting on confirmation.], maintaining access for pedestrians, cyclists, residents, school deliveries and waste collections.\nGiven the urgency to make the required changes any comments relating to these proposals should be received by 5pm on Thursday 10th September 2020 to spacesforpeople@edinburgh.gov.uk. [SA – I assume this date is an error, I am waiting on confirmation.]\nAll feedback will be reviewed and where possible the scheme will be further refined. Feedback will be summarised in an assessment feedback form which will be presented to the Council Incident Management Team for approval. Please note that we will be unable to respond to individual emails.\nIf the proposal is approved for implementation, publicity will then be undertaken so that local people are aware of the changes.

For many households, however, recent days would have been dominated by trying to find the time and money to equip Edinburgh’s future doctors, engineers and carers with a school uniform. The financial challenge this poses many in Edinburgh is a reminder of the inequality present in Scotland’s capital.\nI am hugely proud that my motion in Council this year resulted in Edinburgh’s school clothing grant no longer being one of the worst in Scotland. I am really disappointed, however, that despite a further top-up from the Scottish Government, Edinburgh still can’t offer the very poorest households the £129.50 charities say is needed. Indeed, the £100 Edinburgh offers does not compare well with the £135 available in neighbouring Labour run West Lothian.\nI know from my own upbringing in Kirkcaldy that the school holidays can be grim affairs for low income families as money must be found for school uniforms and to fill the space left in stomachs normally filled by free school meals.\nI had hoped that our Capital could emulate Labour run North Ayrshire and provide free school meals right through the summer. Unfortunately, my proposal to do this was not funded. Instead, a more targeted scheme branded “Discover!” was trialled in Oxgangs Primary School in my Ward and also elsewhere in the city. This targeted the most vulnerable households in a way that went well beyond just providing free food.\nAt city level, I know that this scheme supported families with a range of problems – from mothers who were victims of domestic abuse to armed forces families struggling to deal with post-traumatic stress disorder.\nAlthough I still hope that Edinburgh will next year follow in the footsteps of North Ayrshire, I hope “Discover!” is not lost as when I visited the Oxgangs Primary School I have never been so impressed by the commitment of Council staff, or so proud to say I am an Edinburgh Councillor.\nWhen I was there I saw parents sharing their experiences, lonely children building friendships and everyone coming together to share a filling plate of cheesy pasta (see image). I was proud that our capital is using what little money it has to help those in most need, but I can’t help wondering what more we can do if the Council was better funded.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_02_08_edinburgh-tram-extension-update-briefing-the-costs-have-surged/content_673.html": "Below is a briefing from Council Officers on the progress made in building the business case for completing (or some people say extending) the line to Newhaven. The Outline Business Case was approved last year based on an estimated cost of £165m, so it’s incredible to see that’s already risen by ~20% to £196m, & may surge further to £207m. The revised business case will be interesting.\nA data room is being made available to all Councillors to scrutinise the Final Business Case (FBC) for taking the Trams to Newhaven.\nThe FBC sets out the case for taking trams to Newhaven and outlines the project cost and timescales for councillors to base their final decision on when it goes to Council on 14 March.\nThe FBC has been developed using best practice for major capital projects from both HM Treasury (Green Book) and Scottish Government (STAG) and, after a thorough tendering process, outlines that the project can be delivered within a budget of £196.0m. This figure includes a significant additional risk allocation as well as funding to support local business through the construction process. If “optimism bias”, a percentage added to an overall project cost in order to mitigate potential under-estimation of risk by a project team, is added at 6% (in line with Scottish Government guidelines), the project total is £207.3m. This would still be affordable and self-financing and would not divert funds from other Council services. The number of passengers projected to use the system in year one is almost 16 million, nearly double the patronage forecast for the existing Airport to York Place line in the same year.\nThe cost reflects the outcome of a comprehensive procurement exercise and the inclusion of a six-month ‘Early Contractor Involvement’ (ECI) period to allow the project team and the appointed contractor to refine the construction programme and approach.\nTo provide further assurance, the project team also tested the FBC against the risk of similar, past, completed tram projects using an approach developed by academics from the University of Oxford’s Saïd Business School. The data showed that the project is more likely than not to be delivered within budget, but they also recommended that the Council considers providing an additional risk allocation of up to £50m for all eventualities.\nEven in this unlikely scenario, the project would still be delivered without putting additional pressure on Council budgets and would represent value for money for the tax payer, deliver significant economic, social and environmental benefits and would be affordable within the overall financial model.\nThis whole approach has been subject to significant scrutiny from professional experts, as well as following the Council’s audit processes.\nThe dates for the data room, where elected members can discuss the FBC in detail with officers, are as follows:\n| Date, time | Venue |\n| Fri 8 Feb: 10am until 3pm | Mandela Room |\n| Mon 11Feb: 9am until 8pm Tues 12 Feb: 9am until 8pm Wed 13 Feb: 9am until 8pm |\nDean of Guild Waiting Room (all 3 days) |\n| Mon 4 March: 9am – 5pm | Diamond Jubilee Room |\n| Tues 5 March: 9am – 5pm | The Dunedin |\n| Wed 6 March: 9am – 5pm | The Dean of Guild Waiting Room |\nThe opening of the data room marks the beginning of the final decision-making process on the Edinburgh Tram York Place to Newhaven project, which completes the originally envisaged Phase 1a of the Edinburgh tram network. The full Final Business Case will be made public later this month as part of the agenda for the Transport and Environment Committee’s 28 February meeting. A further report on the award of the ‘swept path’ and infrastructure and systems contracts will go to Finance and Resources Committee on 7 March 2019, followed by the final decision on taking trams to Newhaven by Council on 14 March.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_08_29_edinburgh-tram-extension-do-the-costs-outweigh-the-benefits/content_227.html": "After years of debate, Edinburgh’s Councillors are being asked to consider a proposal to extend the city’s tram line (report, 29th Aug 2017). If we get this right, we will stimulate development and economic growth in some of Edinburgh’s most deprived areas by adding capacity to the transport network that connects them to central Edinburgh and the airport.\nLet’s be clear, the status quo is not an option if Edinburgh is to grow in a way that benefits everyone. The city needs to add capacity to its transport network in a way that is sustainable and for the many, not the few. We need a debate around this that focuses on people, not the old cars v trams debate the Tories offer. Consideration of active travel must be at the core of this debate, not just an afterthought.\nMy heart tells me that extending the tram line, if we avoid the problems of the past, can meet this need. Like many Councillors I have already studied the Business Case and asked many questions of the Council Officers in the “data room”. Many of my questions remain unanswered, however, so I will be demanding a response at the Transport & Environmental Committee next week before the vote.\nThe Tories are already making much of the project’s cost and the disruption it will cause. What they are quieter about is the fact that only a third of their number attended the data room, and some may only have made a fleeting appearance. Indeed, one of their number recently attacked the tram in an Evening News column without having even entered the data room.\nI would urge every Councillor and member of the public to put their prejudices aside, ask questions and consider the Business Case on its merits. With the Nationalist Government refusing to back the project as part of the City Deal (despite finding £120m for a roundabout we didn’t ask for), it will mean more debt for our city and increased pressure on bus fares. The question is: do the costs outweigh the benefits?",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_07_06_the-weeds-are-growing-under-our-feet_comment-page-1/content_262.html": "Edinburgh residents are right to be concerned about the weed problem the city faces (Report, 06/07/17). As Scotland’s capital city, it’s a disgrace that we have weeds several feet high awaiting visitors from overseas.\nSeveral people in my Ward tell me that they themselves have been tackling the problem on their own street. Whilst this is laudable, residents should not have to even consider doing this.\nFurthermore, based on complaints from people living in my Ward, I have worked with Council staff to have the whole of Buckstone treated alongside parts of Oxgangs and Colinton.\nDespite the need to tackle the problem as soon as possible, Councillor Lesley MacInnes (Chair of the Transport & Environment Committee) appears content to focus on having a robust plan for next year – all she is offering is “talks” with Council Officers and a chance to question them at the mid-August Transport & Environment Committee. Meanwhile the weeds grow under our feed.\nOf course, the underlying problem here is one that the SNP’s Councillor MacInnes does not want to address. Our capital is struggling to cope with weeds, potholes and overflowing bins because her party (together with their Green chums) in Holyrood voted to cut Edinburgh’s budget.\nWhilst she will probably solve the weed problem by robbing some other budget, the right thing to do would be to ask her Holyrood masters for the funding Edinburgh deserves.

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_08_03_what-next-for-the-lanark-road-spaces-for-people-scheme/content_171.html": "Today a mini-engagement activity gets underway which will help define the future of the Lanark Road Spaces for people scheme. This is happening because a recent consultation indicated that there was widespread opposition to the scheme, and that the main issue was safety.\nTo date, the public debate has been dominated by those who either strongly oppose or strongly support the scheme, and many people have been stuck in the middle. The polarisation of the debate in this way is partly due to the Council’s unwillingness to work with the local community to define the aims of the scheme, and co-design the response. The binary nature of the debate means often it can appear that we have to choose between the safety of cyclists and that of vulnerable pedestrians. The reality is that we should be focused on a scheme that treats everyone’s safety as equally important.\nWe should be aiming for zero accidents, rather than transferring the risk from one group to another (e.g. via floating bus stops!). For this to happen, however, those who either strongly oppose or strongly support the existing setup will have to compromise.\nHaving looked at the options the Council is using as a starting point (which were approved by Labour, Green, SNP, Independent, Lib Dem and Tory Councillors), the key one impacting on my Ward is just east of Gillespie Crossroads – a short section on the north side of the road between number 432 and Spylaw Park. The concern here is that there is a conflict between parents children accessing Cranley Nursery and passing cyclists. The Council is suggesting the existing lane is retained and floating parking spaces are removed (or vice versa). The existing setup is shown below.\nRemoving a short section of cycle lane here to reduce the conflict between children and cyclists has been described by one opponent as “ripping out protected cycle space in SW Edinburgh for extra on-street parking“. This is not correct as this is not a protected cycle lane (there are no bollards etc) and there will be no increase in parking. The Council’s argument for removing this short section of cycle lane is “anyone cycling on this section is likely to have cycled in from Lanark Road West and will thus likely be capable of cycling around the parking area”. There is some logic in this argument, but it clearly needs to be explored and challenged as part of the consultation.\nA second issue which the mini-engagement activity will consider is the ‘floating parking’ on downhill sections of the route. This is were the kerb and parking spaces are separated by a cycle lane (see image below). The issue here is that on the downhill sections of Lanark Road there is a risk that somebody alighting from a vehicle may be struck by a cyclist. I rode this section today, and was able to reach 24.4 mph with no real effort. The combination of my momentum and the poor running surface is potentially deadly – and there has already been an accident involving a toddler and an adult cyclist. I have spoken to the wife of the cyclist, and I understand he is strongly opposed to floating parking after his experience. It therefore appears correct, if the lanes are to stay, to consult on moving the parking to the uphill side of the road.\nI spent 2 hours (and cycled 30km) looking at the Lanark Road and Water of Leith Walkway today from Inglis Green to Balerno. There’s lots of debate about the future of both, but I hope everyone can agree the running surface on the Lanark Rd cycle lanes is abysmal! Even if the Lanark Road scheme was perfect, however, its success will always be limited.\nAt its west end the Lanark Road SfP scheme terminates just short of Gillespie Crossroads. The westward Lanark Road is too narrow to include any sort of protected feeder cycle lane (but the footpaths do need widened in places), and is not a comfortable cycling experience (see video – speeded up & normal speed). Those that proposed the scheme believed that cyclists would switch from the Water of Leith Path to the Lanark Road SfP scheme at Colinton. This probably looks great on Google Earth in some distance consultant’s office, but the hill makes it an unlikely proposition in the real world.\nAt the east end of the scheme, cyclists are dumped into the Inglis Green Road/Lanark Road/Slateford Road/Craig Lockhart Avenue interchange. This is not fun – CrashMap reports 125 accidents involving personal injuries over the past 22 years (see below).\nThese connectivity problems to the east and west are perhaps why the strongest supporters of the Lanark Road SfP refuse to say what level of usage would mean it could be called a ‘success’. Of course, there are other ways of measuring success (e.g. accident reduction) – this is something the local community should consider as part of the consultation. Indeed, a longer term plan and timeline from the Council on how Lanark Road SfP can be part of a larger cycle network would also be useful.\nOpponents of the Lanark Road SfP will point to the Union Canal Towpath and the Water of Leith Walkway as alternatives for cyclists. My view is that the Union Canal Towpath east of Meggetland should be avoided as it is at capacity. When not busy, however, it is a great route. The Water of Leith Walkway between the Union Canal and Balerno (NCR75) is good but a bell is needed (see video – speeded up & normal speed), and will get better if the plans to improve the surface are realised. Its main drawback is the lack of lighting (not easy to fix), so it does not work as a commuting route over the winter. Indeed, lone cyclists/walkers may not feel safe at any time of day/year.\nSo if there are limitations on cycling on the broad Lanark Road corridor, how do we cut congestion and reduce emissions along the route? The answer here, as for most of suburban Edinburgh, is public transport. I’d love it if people in Balerno & Currie had a safe cycling route into the city and other places of employment etc, but the reality is that if we are to tackle the climate emergency we have to look to making public transport more attractive. Once the future of Lanark Road SfP is settled, we need to give the same energy to improving public transport.",

Local residents have been issued letters (copy at the bottom of this post) explaining that this is due to safety concerns.\nI put a number of questions to Scottish Water on the issue:\nMe: When will the replacement trees be planted?\nScottish Water: The best time for tree planting is late autumn, so subject to approval from Forestry Scotland we would plan to remove the remaining conifer trees around Sept and we will plant new trees shortly after this (Oct/Nov) this year.\nMe: Will the trees be checked for nesting birds? What will happen if any are found?\nScottish Water: The trees have been checked for nesting birds this morning (20/04/20) by our ecologist. I am advised that no nests were found in the 11 trees concerned.\nMe: Are there any plans to remove litter etc from the woodland?\nScottish Water: I’m presuming you mean litter like cans, bottles, crisp packet type litter. In which case, yes, we will arrange a litter clear up when the Covid-10 restrictions are eased.\nI now have the safety audit and tree inspection that was undertaken on Scottish Water’s “woodland plantation”. Scottish Water provided the report along with this comment:\n“I would like to reassure you and the local community that Scottish Water have no intention of developing this part of the site and we will be replacing the trees we are removing by replanting across the area of woodland. We will develop a plan for this in conjunction with Scottish Forestry and share these plans with the community. I’d like to thank you for sharing information with the local community on Facebook and helping us keep people informed.”\nReading the report, it is clear that eleven trees were recommended for urgent removal on safety grounds. The report says “the plantation as a whole has limited future potential and is becoming an increasing liability to the site. It is recommended that this be removed in its entirety within 12 months” and “replanted with a range of more suitable species”.\nThe report points out that the trees are within “striking distance” of Scottish Water’s offices and “the trees are of large size and stature and have the capacity to cause significant damage or injury should they collapse onto a target. The conifers are becoming increasingly vulnerable to windblow given their age, height and growing environment”.\nThe report highlights that in March 2020 a single tree on the eastern edge of the woodland “uprooted and fell towards the office building, striking and damaging the outer cladding above the cafeteria”. Examination of the stump did not reveal any indication of a problem and the tree appeared to have been healthy, but it was noted the ground conditions allowed only shallow rooting.\nIn early March 2020 a single tree on the eastern edge of the woodland uprooted\nand fell towards the office building, striking and damaging the outer cladding\nabove the cafeteria. The tree was a sitka spruce set back some 18m from the\nbuilding line. Examination of the stump did not reveal any indication of decay\nand the tree appeared to have been healthy at the time of failure. The tree had\nuprooted at the base, and the exposed root plate revealed shallow rooting.\nThe report states that given the size of the trees and close proximity to the building and road/footpath “there is clearly the risk of significant damage to property or injury to person”. The survey concluded that “selective tree removal or thinning work would only increase the risk of windblow to the remaining exposed trees”. It is recommended that the plantation is felled and replanted within 12 months, and this should be used as an “opportunity to create a more attractive and sustainable landscape with enhanced biodiversity value”.\nConclusion\nI am sad to see these trees being lost as they help define the area for 70 years, but it is hard for me to argue againt the report (based on my limited knowledge of trees). I admit the report is not unequivocal, but a strong case is made for removing the trees.\nPlease email me for a copy of the report: Scott.Arthur@Edinburgh.gov.uk",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_12_23_edinburghs-circulation-plan-will-help-tackle-its-congestion-crisis_comment-page-1/content_252.html": "Edinburgh’s Circulation Plan aims to “develop and deliver a strategic approach to allocating street space between modes of travel to define the degree of priority to be given to different modes on different streets”. This sounds a bit dull, but it is key to us transforming Edinburgh into a climate ready capital that sets economic development and resident wellbing as key priorities. The plan has already been before Councillors twice (October & December), and will (hopefully) go to consultation after the next iteration in January.\nIt’s becoming increasingly clear to me that the Circulation Plan is needed to both help protect key routes in the city, and also define which transport modes should be prioritised on these routes. The Leith Walk and Picardy Place designs show why this approach is so important. The last Council administration tried to please everyone by endlessly compromising, and ended up making nobody happy. Pedestrians, disabled people, cyclists, car owners, public transport providers and businesses have all raised concerns with me.\nAs we plan to move to a more sustainable transport system in Edinburgh over the next decade, it is important that we learn lessons from Leith Walk and show leadership in applying them in our other town centres to solve their problems. Right now places like Morningside Road are awful for pedestrians, and the congestion there delays thousands of people using buses every day.\nFor many routes in our city, we have to accept that there is only room to accommodate two transport modes to the highest standard. With the Circulation Plan consultation, we shall be asking residents and businesses about how this can be done and how ambitious we should be. In central Edinburgh and our town centres we shall need to ensure we have a world class pedestrian environment with first-class public transport connectivity and cycle access.\nDoing this will come at a cost. In recent days at the Leith Walk/London Road junction I have seen first-hand how a minority of people are willing to put personal convenience before the safety of others when changes agreed by the last administration were enacted. The fact that many people are not aware of what the changes at these junctions are trying to achieve tells me that we need to engage with residents better.\nWe shall have to work with residents and businesses in places like Brunstfield/Morningside, Corstorphine, Gorgie/Dalry, Leith/Leith Walk, Nicolson Street/Clerk Street, Portobello, Stockbridge and Tollcross to better manage parking and loading to cut congestion, and sustainable transport access for all. This will not be easy, but we will learn from similar cities which have made this transition. We’ll also learn from the Spaces for People scheme failures in areas like this, and make all of these places more welcoming in order to support local traders.\nI also recognise that for Edinburgh to thrive, goods and services must be able to freely move around our Capital – Labour in Edinburgh is not ashamed to say it supports economic prosperity and good employers. We will ensure key routes connecting to the city centre have the capacity to ensure Edinburgh goes from strength-to-strength, whilst also working with companies like Farr-Out-Deliveries on “last mile” logistics. At the same time we will see city centre parking reducing as public and active transport connectivity improves.\nI want to be clear that the Circulation Plan won’t just help us manage town centres and key routes, it will also help us deal with the “rat running” traffic which blights many communities. We will start by using the framework the Circulation Plan provides to protect zones around schools (“School Zones”) from the unwanted invasive traffic many communities struggle with.\nSo far I have been pleased with the response to the Circulation Plan from all political parties, businesses, residents and key stakeholders. Indeed, I feel there is enthusiasm for going further. With this in mind, the next iteration will be more ambitious and will start to show how the plan can be used to reduce congestion and cut traffic by 30%, and we will test the appetite for this via the consultation process.\nThere will be those who oppose Edinburgh moving towards a more sustainable transport system, but they often do this without proposing an alternative. Edinburgh is already a congested city and land has just been set aside to build 37,000 more homes by 2032. Inaction will not solve Edinburgh’s congestion crisis, but it will make it harder to tackle.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_05_27_is-anyone-really-surprised-by-the-snps-sustainable-growth-commission-report/content_586.html": "In the build-up to the 2014 independence referendum the SNP issued every home in Scotland with a fake newspaper. The nationalists were not silly enough to put Alex Salmond on the cover, but what was there alongside a quote from Nicola Sturgeon saying the referendum would be “a once in a lifetime opportunity” was a claim that every Scot would be due a “£600 Indy Bonus” if we voted Yes.\nOf course, this claim was cobblers as no independent expert was willing to say we’d be wealthier if Scotland left the UK. Although it was always clear to me that we’d be poorer with independence, like many others, I’d have been much more likely to consider voting Yes if the SNP had been honest about Scotland’s finances.\nIn the intervening time much has happened. The oil price crashed. The UK voted for Brexit. The SNP’s record in Government caught up with them. Rather than deal with these issues, the nationalists have put independence back on the agenda.\nThis week the SNP published their “Sustainable Growth Commission” report to restart the divisive independence debate. It is important to note that this is a report for the SNP, written by people who support the SNP with the aim of telling Nicola Sturgeon exactly what she wants to hear. Nonetheless, despite making a range of optimistic assumptions and allowing people to conclude we’d all be better off by £4,100, the report concedes that independence would come with at least 10 years of cuts and over that period we’d let the rest of the UK set our interest rates. Is this really a surprise to anyone?\nWhat’s now clear is that independence won’t deliver the real change many people who voted yes wanted. The Commission’s report does make it clear that there is much that can be done with Scotland’s existing powers if the SNP had the courage to use then. Indeed, we already have the economic and welfare powers needed to tackle in equality in Scotland. The only thing that is stopping us is a timid government obsessed with our constitution, not our people.",

I hope, however, that Parliament never becomes a normal place for any MP. We have a duty to stay grounded in our constituencies and only use Parliament as a tool to improve them. That’s certainly my plan!\nan’t resist sharing some details.\nIt started at the election count. My agent, Councillor Stephen Jenkinson, and I always thought the seat was winnable, but we believed it would take two election cycles to close the 33% lead the SNP’s Joanna Cherry had over Labour in 2019. However, the response on the doorstep from the start of our campaign suggested the gap could be closed – though we hardly dared believe it.\nAs the ballot boxes were emptied, we quickly noticed that we had a very marginal lead across most of the constituency. A quick chat with Joanna Cherry around 2:30 a.m. confirmed she had drawn the same conclusion. We just had to wait for the votes to be counted.\nBy 5:30 a.m., I was holding a healthy majority of 6,217 (13.6%) and an envelope marked “Member of Parliament.” Inside was a letter confirming I was expected in Parliament just three days later. Within a few hours, Parliament had arranged my travel and hotel.\nAfter just 60 minutes of sleep, my wife drove me to Glasgow on Friday morning to meet Scottish Labour’s other 36 MPs. At this meeting, Anas Sarwar and his team proudly briefed us on what would happen next.\nI spent Saturday with my family and activists, and on Sunday, the congregation at my church prayed for me – an incredibly moving moment. Following this, I met the other Scottish Labour MPs in central Edinburgh, this time with Anas Sarwar and the Prime Minister. This was another incredible moment – they had transformed our party and made it electable again.\nThe next day, I entered Parliament for the first time. I arrived at 10 a.m., and from the very first moment, I was made to feel incredibly welcome by the staff. I am aware that not all MPs have always treated staff well, but I am mindful that I can get nothing done without their support.\nI was met my buddy for a three-hour tour and induction – covering everything from personal safety to visiting the Chamber and having lunch in the Members’ Tea Room, which has separate seating for government and opposition MPs.\nFollowing this, I attended a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party – all 412 of us. The group is too big for any room available in Parliament, so we met in Church House (the Church of England HQ). This meeting was incredible – we were the government, and the people trusted us to serve the country.\nI attended the Chamber on Tuesday morning for a training session, and the new Labour MPs alone managed to more than fill the government benches. I was always told that the House of Commons Chamber is smaller than it looks on TV, and it absolutely is. The Scottish Labour MPs had to leave the training a little early as the Prime Minister had asked to meet us, along with Anas Sarwar and Jackie Baillie.\nWalking along Downing Street was an amazing feeling. We were asked to be purposeful on the way in, so I had to resist the temptation to pat Larry, the Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office. The door opened for us, and we walked up the famous stairs to meet the Prime Minister – a breathtaking experience. The meeting was a chance to talk about how Scotland would benefit from a Labour government and what we could expect from the King’s Speech. The meeting proved that the promise of Scottish Labour MPs being at the heart of the change the government is delivering was being fulfilled.\nThat afternoon, we appointed Sir Lindsay Hoyle as the Speaker. I arrived 15 minutes early for this, but soon discovered that any chance of being squeezed into a seat was already gone. Standing in the Chamber, however, gave me a great view of the process. I can’t say I fully understood what was happening, but it was a great introduction to how energy can quickly build in the Chamber.\nWith the Speaker appointed, we could now be sworn in as MPs. This is done by seniority and length of service, so I was towards the back of the queue. When I was eventually sworn in around midday on Wednesday, it felt like I had officially become an MP – an incredibly humbling moment. The next big event will be my “maiden speech” – usually uncontroversial, brief, and including a tribute to my predecessor in the seat, irrespective of party, and favourable remarks about the constituency.\nI also need to focus on perhaps the most important issue – setting up my constituency hub in Edinburgh South West. This is key to supporting local residents and businesses, but it is likely to take several weeks.\nIt really has been an incredible week for me, marking the start of a new chapter in my life. It’s like first day at high school – you know some people, the rules aren’t clear and you can’t help getting lost. The added complexity is that the school looks like Hogwarts!

The point is that Scotland chooses not to, and the majority of Scots don’t want a second referendum on the issue.\nI’m quite proud to say that I was a key part of the grassroots campaign to keep Scotland in the UK. I spent some time looking at both sides of the argument before deciding that remaining in the UK was the best way of protecting jobs and services. I understood the many arguments made for and against Scotland leaving the UK, but the fact that there was no independent analysis that showed Scotland would be better off outside the UK spoke volumes to me. So much so that I campaigned right across Edinburgh to protect our hospitals, schools and universities.\nThis does not mean I don’t respect those who voted differently for their own reasons. I hope, however, that they also respect my position with equal measure.\nWell over two years since the 2014 referendum, politics in Scotland has not moved on. The political debate is dominated by “unionists” and “nationalists”, and most ordinary Scots are stuck in the middle. The threat of a second independence referendum hangs over Scotland and, despite Brexit, the economic benefits of independence are still unclear to most Scots.\nI now think it’s perhaps time to do what other countries do and focus our energy on fixing health and education. Indeed, Scotland already has the power to ensure we have the best education system in the world. Let’s focus on making that a reality, not reheating stale arguments from 2014.\nLet’s be defined as a country by our willingness to invest in our children’s future, not by a national obsession with constitutional arguments.",

However, now that it is in place it is proving to difficult to remove. It is clear that the majority of Edinburgh’s Councillors oppose it, but finding the money to return to the old “free” system is proving difficult. A recent Tory\\Green proposal to end the “Garden Tax” had to be withdrawn as they were unable to fund it.\nMEMBERS BRIEFING NOTE: GARDEN WASTE REGISTRATION\n21 June 2019\nWhat’s happening?\n- Since the new garden waste service started last October\n67,500 properties have signed up for the service\n73,200 permits have been registered\nOver 9,000 tonnes of garden waste have already been turned into compost. - Permits for the current garden waste service year expire on 6 October. To receive collections after this date residents will need to renew their permits, or sign up to the service, by 2pm on 7 August.\n- Registration opens on Wednesday 26 June at 9am (in locality offices and phonelines) and 10am for online registration.\n- Registration will be open until 2pm on Wednesday 7 August.\nPermits will be sent out 6 – 8 weeks after this date. - We’re writing to existing customers and properties which use the kerbside recycling and waste service to ask them to renew their permits or sign up to the service. This is being supported by a communications plan to help raise awareness.\n- Residents can sign up to receive fortnightly garden waste collections for £25 per brown bin.\n- The next service year will run from 7 October 2019 – 4 October 2020.\n- We’ll empty brown bins once every two weeks, except over the festive period when there will be no collections between 16 December 2019 and 14 January 2020.\n- Residents who renew their permit or sign up during this registration window will be sent a permit in late September that will be valid from 7 October 2019 – 4 October 2020.\n- There will only be one more opportunity to sign up to the new service year (in January 2020) but the payment will remain at £25 and permits will be valid until 4 October. Residents who sign up during the January registration window will be sent their permit 6 – 8 weeks after the window closes.\nHow to register\n- The quickest and easiest way to register and pay is on our website. A one-off payment of £25 (per brown bin) will be taken by debit or credit card. (New customers will need to set up a my.gov account first, which they can do from our website).\n- If they don’t have access to the internet they can use the self-service kiosks at one of our five local offices (they’ll need to have registered for an online mygov.scot account first or have access to email on a mobile).\nNorth East Office, 101 Niddrie Mains Road, Edinburgh, EH16 4DS\nNorth West Office, 8 West Pilton Gardens, Edinburgh, EH4 4DP\nSouth East Office, 40 Captain’s Road, Edinburgh, EH17 8QF\nSouth West Office, 10 Westside Plaza, Edinburgh, EH14 2ST\nCustomer Hub, 249 High Street, Edinburgh, EH1 1YJ - Local libraries also offer free internet access.\n- Alternatively, residents can pay by debit/credit card or cash at our Customer Hub (High Street) or South West (West Side Plaza) locality offices only.\n- Payment can be made over the phone by calling 0131 608 1100 (press option 1, then option 9, then option 1), however, we expect phone lines to be busy and there may be long waiting times. Phone lines are open Monday – Thursday, 8.30am – 5pm and Friday 8.30am – 3.40pm.\n- We don’t accept cheques. If any cheques are sent to you please send them on to waste services who will return them (Waste and Cleansing Services, Level 3, Waverley Court, Edinburgh, EH8 8BG).\nDoes everyone need to pay?\n- Residents who receive Council Tax Reduction (formerly called Council Tax Benefit) don’t need to pay for the service but they do need to register to receive it. Other exemptions, such as single occupancy discount or garden aid, don’t qualify for free garden waste collections.\n- A small number of properties in the Colinton area have their garden waste collected by the Tiphereth charity and they also need to register and pay to continue receiving the service.\no Tiphereth customers receive weekly collections of their bagged garden waste.\nHow does the service work?\n- We’ll empty brown bins once every two weeks, except over the festive period when there will be no collections between 16 December 2019 and 14 January 2020.\no The festive break in service allows us to divert resources to other recycling and waste streams during the busy festive period. - Residents need to renew their permits every year before they expire to continue receiving the service.\n- The new service year runs from 7 October 2019 – 4 October 2020 and registration for this closes at 2pm on 7 August 2019. There will only be one more opportunity to sign up for the new service year (in January 2020) but the payment will remain at £25 for a permit which will be valid until 4 October 2020.\n- Permits are not prorated for residents who sign up in January.\nOnce a resident has signed up we will send them a new collection calendar and permit sticker 6 – 8 weeks after registration closes. - We’ll only empty brown bins with valid permit stickers.\n- There is no limit to how many garden waste bins a property can have but there will be a charge of £25 per bin.\n- Residents can share a bin with their neighbours, but they’ll need to agree on one resident acting as the lead for booking and paying for the service. If there are any service issues with the shared bin (eg a missed collection), this must be reported against the address that registered for the permit.\n- If a resident moves to a new house they can transfer their permit to their new address. They’ll need to give us six weeks’ notice to update our system and take their brown bin and permit sticker to their new address.\n- Terms and conditions will be available on our website\nWhy we’re charging for garden waste collections\n- Our costs are increasing and more people are using our services, whilst our income is reducing. The £25 per year charge was agreed by the Council at a meeting in February 2018 and it’s estimated it will save £1.4 million each year and allow us to provide a more frequent service.\n- As garden waste collection is not a statutory service and with reducing budgets and increasing costs, we can no longer afford to provide the service for free.\n- Over 40% of councils in the UK charge for a garden waste collection and some have stopped the service altogether.\n- The £25 charge is lower than many other councils and works out at around 50p per week.\n- Any changes to garden waste collections being a paid for service would be made at full Council as part of budget consultations.\nFurther information, including the terms and conditions are available on our website.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_02_13_my-comment-on-the-eis-briefing-on-cuts-to-edinburghs-nurseries/content_720.html": "Below is an EIS briefing on the City of Edinburgh Council’s proposal to remove teachers from nurseries. Over the past few days I have been speaking to Teachers, Parents, Council Officers, Nursery Staff, members of my party and the EIS about this issue. I have drawn the conclusion that there is not sufficient evidence to progress with this cut.\nAs someone who grew up in one of the UK’s most deprived areas and now works in education, I understand fully the role teachers can play in cutting the educational attainment gap between the richest and poorest in Scotland. I also know that closing this gap should not start in primary or secondary school – it must begin as early as possible. I was therefore concerned to see that the information used to justify this cut is dated and does not take into account social deprivation.\nAdditionally, I feel that removing teachers from nurseries now will create a leadership vacuum which will put undue pressure on the remaining SVQ3 staff. I therefore will be arguing that we reject this funding cut at least until sufficient SVQ3 staff have upgraded to the BA in Childhood Practice. I accept, however, that retaining qualified teachers is the best outcome. Indeed, the Scottish Government have been clear:\n“…the qualifications of pre-school staff – and particularly having teachers with early years skills, staff with a degree such as Childhood Practice and a mix of skills in the workforce – are key factors in determining the quality of provision.”\nThe proposal to cut teachers from nurseries will “save” £340,000, but the negative impact may be much bigger. That’s why I will argue that funding be found to block this cut. If that money can’t be found, I will suggest that every household in Edinburgh pays an extra £1.40 in Council Tax per year to help secure the future of our capital’s children.\nFrankly, it is unbelievable that SNP cuts are forcing decisions like this on Edinburgh.\nInformation regarding the importance of retaining Teachers and Head Teachers in nursery classes and nursery schools\nBackground\nThe first nursery in Scotland opened in Edinburgh in 1903. This historic legacy of nursery education, and in particular, sector leading nursery schools led by nursery head teachers, continues to this day.\nEdinburgh has invested heavily in the quality of its workforce, ensuring that there are full time teachers (who are degree qualified and GTCS-registered) in school nursery classes and in the standalone nursery schools.\nSeveral of the nursery head teachers work in partnership with The University of Edinburgh to deliver the Froebel in Childhood Practice courses and offer practice visits in their settings. The Scottish Government’s workforce review (Siraj, 2015) states\n‘The City of Edinburgh Council is one example of the best early learning focuses within Scotland. This is based on the professional development they provide for early years staff, much of which follows the Froebel model. This model is child centred with a play-based pedagogy, and is underpinned by a knowledge and understanding of child development which supports assessment, evaluation and planning.’\nConsiderations\nThe Growing Up in Scotland (GUS) report states, ‘the Effective Provision of Pre-school Education (EPPE) project (Melhuish et al, 2008), has shown that children in high quality provision prior to starting school achieved higher literacy and numeracy levels than those in low quality settings or who did not experience pre-school.’\nThe EPPE project explored factors that influence quality. Findings include:\n- Good quality can be found across all types of early years settings; however quality was higher overall in settings integrating care and education and in nursery schools.\n- Settings that have staff with higher qualifications have higher quality scores and their children make more progress.\n- Quality indicators include warm interactive relationships with children, having a trained teacher as manager and a good proportion of trained teachers on the staff.\nStaff Qualifications\nThe Scottish Government also acknowledges the importance that degree educated staff in nurseries make and have invested heavily in their Additional Graduate Programme for settings in areas of high deprivation in order to focus on closing the poverty related attainment gap.\nThe GUS report states ‘Research by Education Scotland (2012) found that settings which had access to higher qualified staff, particularly teachers with a background in early years methodology or staff with specific early childhood qualifications – such as the BA in Childhood Practice – were more likely to offer higher quality learning experiences.’\nThe budget proposal suggests replacing nursery teachers with early years practitioners. There is a significant difference in the level of qualifications between these roles.\n| Role | Qualification | SCQF Level | Number of Credits |\n| Early Years Practitioner | SVQ3/HNC | 7 | 96 |\n| Teacher | Honours Degree | 10 | 480 |\n| & often additional Postgraduate Diploma | 10 & 11 | 60 & 60 |\nCare Inspectorate Gradings\nAlthough available data is mixed and there is evidence that a few local authorities who have reduced access to teachers are performing well, there is also evidence that removing nursery teachers has had a negative impact on Care Inspectorate (CI) gradings. CI data in the GUS report, on which the officer recommendation to remove nursery teachers was based, was from 2010. The data here is current, as published on the CI website.\n| Local Authority | Teachers in class | Care & Support | Environment | Staffing | Management & Leadership |\n| Scotland | 71% | 64% | 72% | 58% | |\n| Edinburgh | Yes | 81% (+10%) | 73% (+9%) | 81% (+10%) | 74% (+16%) |\n| West Lothian | Yes until Aug 18 | 75% (+4%) | 70% (+4%) | 77% (+5%) | 67% (+9%) |\n| West Dunbartonshire | No | 32% (-39%) | 32% (-32%) | 47% (-25%) | 37% (-21%) |\n| Moray | No | 55% (-16%) | 68% (+4%) | 50% (-22%) | 45% (-13%) |\n| Borders | No | 58% (-13%) | 49% (-15%) | 64% (-8%) | 44% (-14%) |\n| Highland | No | 70% (-1%) | 41% (-23%) | 59% (-13%) | 47% (-11%) |\nThe 4 Local Authorities in this table without teachers in nursery are all are performing well under the national average, and significantly under City of Edinburgh.\nWest Dunbartonshire removed teachers from nurseries several years ago, however, they are now recognising this as a mistake (as is evidenced by their CI gradings which are up to 39% lower than the national average). They have also found that the impact has been a real disconnect between nursery and primary, which has manifested as disruption caused by P1 pupils in many of their schools.\nDundee is currently increasing its complement of nursery teachers, with the explicit aim of closing the poverty-related attainment gap. They have determined that the educational benefits of having nursery teachers working directly in classrooms with pupils, liaising with colleagues in primary schools, and leading teams of professionals, are likely to be a significant driver of improved outcomes at all stages in education – not to mention being a cost-effective way of using their Attainment Challenge funding.\nIt should be further noted that the very mixed provision in different local authorities makes direct comparisons difficult. It is instructive to look at the figures for the different types of provision within Edinburgh.\n| Local Authority | Teachers in class | Care & Support | Environment | Staffing | Management & Leadership |\n| Scotland | 71% | 64% | 72% | 58% | |\n| Edinburgh | Yes | 81% | 73% | 81% | 74% |\n| Edinburgh\nPartnership |\nNo | 56% | 57% | 59% | 49% |\n| Edinburgh Partnership | Yes | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |\nThis shows very clear correlations between the presence of nursery teachers in classrooms and quality in terms of care and support. Given all these are within Edinburgh, there are likely to be far fewer confounding factors than with data that goes across different local authorities.\nA final point – the CI gradings relate to Care and Support within nurseries. They do not report on educational outcomes and, in particular, do not look at how well children manage the transition into P1. Clearly, the specialist knowledge of nursery teachers, with their overview of Curriculum for Excellence and their ability to liaise closely with primary teachers, is central to ensuring that children can make a good start in school, with the lifelong benefits this brings. Edinburgh’s own policies and frameworks, in the Edinburgh Learns documents, highlight the centrality of good transitions, informed by close partnership working and a detailed knowledge of individual children’s circumstances and their learning. This cannot be replicated by teachers who act as “consultants” across many nurseries. It requires teachers working closely with the children, their families, other professionals, and the relevant primary schools. This problem is likely to be particularly acute when supporting children with additional needs. If we are serious about inclusion, and about Getting It Right for Every Child, then specific, individualised transition plans, that have a clear focus on learning and teaching, are essential, and these are something that require the specialist input of teachers.\nStandalone Nursery Schools with Head Teachers\nThe Care Inspectorate highlighted City of Edinburgh’s nursery schools in its recent publication My World Outdoors (2016)\n‘Many of the original child gardens continue to this day, still run by Froebel-trained headteachers. These nurseries consistently achieve high grades from the Care Inspectorate and were recently highlighted as examples of best practice by Professor Siraj’s recent Independent Review’ (My World Outdoors, 2016)\nThe standalone nursery schools, Balgreen, Cameron House, Greengables, Hope Cottage, Liberton, St Leonards, Stanwell and Tynecastle, led by nursery head teachers, drive quality across the authority, with 72% of Care Inspectorate gradings at Grade 6. It must be remembered that Grade 6 indicates “outstanding or sector leading”.\nCurrent City of Edinburgh Care Inspectorate Gradings\n| Setting | Grade 6 | Grade 5 | Grade 4 | Grade 3 |\n| Nursery Schools | 72% | 28% | ||\n| Primary School Nursery Classes | 8.5% | 68% | 21% | 2.5% |\nThis is significantly higher than in other local authorities\n| Local Authority | % Grade 6 |\n| Edinburgh | 14.7% |\n| West Lothian (had teachers until last year) | 5.3% |\n| Moray | 3.4% |\n| West Dunbartonshire | 1.3% |\n| Highland | 0.8% |\n| Borders | 0.55% |\nThis level of quality, where Edinburgh recognised as leading some of the best practice in Scotland, is more than likely to be lost if the nursery schools are subsumed into the local primary.\nContribution of Nursery Head Teachers\nCity of Edinburgh\n- Teaching on the Edinburgh Early Learning and Childcare Academy for Modern Apprentice and Trainee Early Years Practitioners. Currently 90 students and 60 more to start in August 19.\n- Delivering CPD – Teachers New to Nursery, SEAL, Aspiring Leaders, Developing Quality Environments, Block Play, Self-Regulation and more\n- Working groups – Head Teacher’s Executive, Additional Support for Learning, developing planning and tracking guidance and formats.\n- Practice visits for staff\n- Board member of the South East Regional Improvement Collaborative\nUniversity of Edinburgh in partnership with City of Edinburgh\n- Teaching on the Froebel in Childhood Practice certificate – 7 courses across Scotland – currently 300 students\n- Practice visits – sharing excellent practice with practitioners from across Scotland.\nWider impact\n- Leading practitioner research projects\n- Contributing chapters to Early Childhood education books and journals\n- Recognition of impact in national documentation, i.e. Care Inspectorate’s Our Creative Journey, 2017 and My World Outdoors, 2016; the Scottish Government’s workforce review.\n- Jane Whinnett (HT at Balgreen and Hope Cottage) has recently received an MBE for her services to Early Childhood Education.\n- Organising conferences – 10th conference took place in 2018 and had 550 delegates at the Assembly Rooms.\n- Speaking at national and international conferences and seminars\nImpact of Proposals\n- At a time of early years expansion, it will be impossible to replace 80 nursery teachers by August.\n- Losing 80 staff may undermine the ability of City of Edinburgh to deliver their expansion plans by 2020.\n- Quality is already under threat due to the expansion and removing the most highly qualified staff from nursery classes will have a significant impact on attainment and closing the gap.\n- Due to the pace of change, all early years’ staff are under significant stress. The impact of these proposals is already having a negative impact on morale and levels of sickness absence.\n- The plans to re-deploy nursery teachers to primary classrooms is of concern. Nursery teachers have chosen to specialise in Early Years pedagogy. Teaching in a primary classroom is completely different to teaching in nursery. Some have not taught in primary classes for over 20 years. There is likely to be a significant requirement for re-training, particularly for staff whose classroom teaching experience pre-dates Curriculum for Excellence. This will have a negative impact on children’s outcomes.\n- Although there is not a straightforward correlation as models and quality of support varies amongst local authorities, Care Inspectorate gradings are likely to be negatively affected by taking teachers out of nursery classes and replacing them with staff qualified to a lower level. As we know from the EPPE project, level of qualification has a positive impact on the quality of learning and on outcomes for children.\n- Removing nursery head teachers, will have an even greater impact on high quality practice and will likely result in City of Edinburgh losing its sector leading status.\n- It has been proposed that there will be locality-based teams of teacher and head teacher peripatetic support, however, there is no suggestion of future proofing this model. Without the opportunity to develop skills working in a nursery classroom, it will not be long before there is a significant lack of expertise. Teachers do not like working in peripatetic teams, for example Midlothian regularly lose their Early Years peripatetic teachers to nursery classes in other Local Authorities and have found it hard to recruit. Several East Lothian nursery teachers are now working in Edinburgh rather than in the peripatetic team.\n- There will be no progression pathway for teachers in Early Years, therefore no real incentive to specialise in this area.",

He died in May 2018, only six months after he was diagnosed with the rare brain cancer, glioblastoma. Sadly, his story is not unusual.\nRare cancers do not attract research on the same level as more common cancers, despite their impact being profoundly felt by many families throughout the UK.\nAccording to a Cancer52 patient survey in 2024, 82% of those with a rare and less common cancer were not offered a clinical trial.1\nWe must do more to incentivise and create an environment where more research into rare cancers is fostered. Both government and private companies are essential to this, and we must have a dedicated focus to tackle this challenge head on.\nAs part of pulling the draft Bill together, I have engaged with charities that represent many rare cancers. I have also spent time engaging with the APPG for Brain Tumours, Dame Siobhain McDonagh and the Glioblastoma campaign she leads, and survivors of rare cancers.\nThis is to ensure that those impacted and most intimately involved in this area have been able to direct the Bill towards a finished product that will have the greatest impact for the community’s they represent.\nThe Bill sets out to 1) provide a structure for accountability and delivery, 2) trigger a review of drug regulations for rare and less common diseases, 3) make clinical trial databases more useful for researchers.\nI hope you will join me in supporting the Bill and if you have any questions, then please reach out to me, my office or one of the many charities who represent the rare cancer community who will be happy to help.\nThe Bill Aims\nThe aim of the Bill is to incentivise research and investment into the treatment of rare cancers.\nIt will achieve this by:\n- Placing a duty on the Government to further support research and innovation for rare cancers.\n- Placing a duty on the Government to review the Orphan Drug Regulations, with respect to rare cancer patients.\n- Ensuring that patients can be easily contacted about relevant research and clinical trials.\nRare Cancers Bill Background\nA Bill to make provision to incentivise research and investment into the treatment of rare types of cancer; and for connected purposes.\nKey statistics\n- 47% of cancers diagnosed in the UK are rare and less common cancers and 55% of deaths from cancer are rare and less common.\n- 180,000 people will be diagnosed with a rare and less common cancer and more than 92,000 people will die from a rare or less common cancer.\n- Despite overall cancer survival rates rising by nearly 10 per cent between 2005 and 2020, rare cancers account for many of the lowest rates of survival, with some having a 1-year survival rate of less than 50 per cent.\n- Five of the six less survivable cancers are considered rare, and between 2002 and 2014 the less survivable cancers received a fraction, only16.6%, of research funding of the more survivable cancers.\nLegislative proposals\nLegislate to appoint named person responsible for the delivery of rare cancer research.\nTo ensure there is adequate oversight of research delivery for rare cancers, by appointing a named person in each nation to provide leadership and advice for the delivery of rare cancer research.\nThis would provide a structure for greater accountability and provide a more strategic approach for the delivery of rare cancer research across organisations.\nLegislating to ensure patient data from national cancer registries across the UK is shared with the ‘Be Part of Research’ Registry.\nTo make it easier for patients with rare cancers to be contacted about relevant research and clinical trials, by ensuring that data from each of the national cancer registries in each nation is provided, in an opt-out process, to ‘Be Part of Research’ (BPoR).\nMandating that the ‘Be Part of Research’ registry must establish a tailored service for rare cancers.\nTo ensure patients can be easily contacted about research, including clinical trials, by creating a bespoke contact registry service for patients with rare cancers and the public as well as improving access to the patient population for researchers.\nReview of Orphan Drug Regulations.\nTo place a duty on the Government to assess whether these regulations are continuing to effectively incentivise the development of drugs for rare conditions (‘orphan drugs’) with severe patient impact and high unmet clinical need.\nOrphan drugs are commonly approved to treat other diseases, but there is little financial incentive for companies to trial their drugs for the treatment of rare diseases. Other countries are providing incentives for companies to do this and a review would assess how the UK’s system could be improved.\nNext steps\nThe second reading for the Rare Cancers Bill will be on Friday 14th March at 9:30am.

Whilst the Council’s decision to fund the completion of the tramline made the news, less has been said in the media about another key decision made that day.\nMy colleague, Councillor Mandy Watt, brought forward a motion asking the Council to use all its powers to end the use of “B&B” accommodation to house homeless individuals and families (often escaping domestic abuse). Let me be clear, many of these properties are not fit for human habitation – there have been reports of bugs in beds and blood on walls.\nIndeed, although Scotland’s Councils breached unsuitable temporary accommodation (UTA) orders 750 times in just 12 months, 70% of these cases were in Edinburgh.\nEdinburgh has around 4,000 people presenting as homeless per year, and the Council has a duty to place them in “temporary” accommodation until a home can be found. As a last resort, the council will fall back on B&Bs.\nIn February it was revealed that the Council has spent £28.1m to meet an increased demand for B&B accommodation since 2016. In 2018 alone, the Council spent £11.7m on temporary accommodation for homeless people – including £6.4m to one provider. This is money that should be being used to build homes.\nI don’t know what the solution is, but it’s clear that we have to tackle the causes of homelessness. This ranges from welfare reform to domestic abuse and relationship breakdowns.\nA particular issue in Edinburgh is the tourist economy. Whilst it has many positives, and I am proud that our city attracts people from around the world, it is now estimated that there are 12,000 AirBnB registrations in our Capital, and there have been many reports of people being made homeless to create them. I therefore hope that Cllr Watt’s motion will put added pressure on the Scottish Government to give Edinburgh the powers it needs to better regulate AirBnB type lets.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_06_20_south-west-schools-whats-next_comment-page-1/content_742.html": "The news that the proposed merger of Currie Community High School and Wester Hailes Education Centre has been binned is fantastic. This decision only impacts on a tiny part of my Ward, but it is hugely important for the children that live there (now and in the future).\nAbandoning the ill-considered merger and investing in the schools at their current sites is right because it means everything that is special about them can be protected, but we can invest in making them even better.\nThe focus now must, however, be on reimagining WHEC to ensure every child in its catchment can reach their full potential. Rebuilding WHEC alone won’t do that, we have to invest in nursery and primary education feeder routes, and establish links with the college and university on its doorstep.\nThis partnership is important as the attainment gap can’t be solved in high school alone – that was the folly at the heart of the argument for the doomed merger. Early years and primary education is where the real work needs to be done. We should be using high school to amplify those gains, and I feel working with local colleges and universities is key to that. Indeed, I’ve already had informal chats with an Edinburgh university about how they can work with WHEC.\nAlthough protecting CCHS and WHEC was always the right decision, reaching that point has taken longer than needed and caused more upset than necessary. The hard part, however, is finding the money to regenerate these schools and others in Edinburgh like Liberton High. The Scottish Government have delayed releasing funds again and again – the latest is that an “announcement” may be made at the end of the year, but there is still no guarantee of funding.\nI have therefore written to every Councillor in Edinburgh asking them to have their party’s MSPs stand up for Edinburgh and make the case for investing in our schools – not least Gordon MacDonald MSP who represents the Currie / Wester Hailes area. I have also asked that all the Edinburgh Council Group leaders write as one to John Swinney demanding that funding be made available.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_10_07_edinburgh-child-poverty-school-uniforms-my-first-council-motion/content_146.html": "I joined the Labour Party just under three years ago. When I first joined there were many aspects of the party’s culture that I had to learn and respect. One thing I noted quickly was that speakers at events liked to start their speeches with tales of their own humble upbringing and ended by saying how pulling and sharing resources can make a difference. This blog is no different.\nI grew up in a single parent household in one of the most deprived areas of the UK – a council estate in Kirkcaldy during the 1980’s miner’s strike. My route out of that was to work hard at school and go on to complete a degree and eventually a PhD.\nI was lucky as my family understood the difference education could make to my life chances. This was not because they were well educated themselves, but because they had ability but were not given the same opportunity in the 1940s and 1950’s.\nDays off school were not permitted unless a death certificate could be provided, and I was one of only two people from a huge housing scheme (Smeaton) to “stay on” at school for 5th and 6th year. Above all else, a school uniform had to be worn.\nThe school uniform was not an easy thing for my father to provide me and my two brothers with. He had to rely on 2 aunts and my Gran to help ensure I had one – particularly big ticket items like shoes and a jacket, which often came via the Littlewoods Catalogue. I don’t remember having my clothes bought by a committee being a particularly enjoyable experience, but the ends justified the means.\nI had largely forgotten about this experience until the school year started again in August 2017. At that point, the BBC ran a story on the support available to low income families to help them equip their children for school. It outlined how the “School Uniform Grant” varies from £40 (North Ayrshire) to £110 (West Lothian) in Scotland, and how the Poverty Truth Commission estimates the actual cost to be £129.50 “even when shopping at supermarkets and bargain stores”. The story The Poverty Truth Commission told about life in Scotland today was exactly what I had experienced 30 years ago:\n“Very often, school clothing grants simply aren’t enough to cover even the most basic uniform – leaving families stressed out, anxious and wondering just where the money is going to come from. Some even end up in debt or struggling to afford other basic essentials like food and heating.”\nIt made me feel ashamed to know this was still happening in Scotland. Worse than that, I was ashamed because the City of Edinburgh Council offers one of the lowest grants. The grant in Scotland’s Capital is only £43 and £50 for primary and secondary school children respectively. Pretty much as soon as I read the BBC report, I donated £129.50 to the Edinburgh School Uniform Bank.\nWhy does this matter? It is now an accepted fact that child poverty is rising in the UK. However, we also must accept that Edinburgh Council, The Scottish Government and the UK Government have a duty to use their powers to reverse this trend. In my view a key part of that is ensuring children are equipped to attend school as, I believe, education is key to breaking the kind of poverty which is handed down from generation to generation. With all that in mind, I am delighted to say I have the following motion to review Edinburgh’s School Uniform Grant coming before the “Education, Children and Families Committee” on Tuesday (10th of October):\nMotion by Councillor Arthur – Child Poverty – School Uniform Grant\n“Committee: Recognises that child poverty is rising in Edinburgh and that the City of Edinburgh Council, the Scottish Government and the UK Government have a duty to use their powers to reverse this trend.\nRecognises that a significant burden on low income families is providing their children with a school uniform.\nRecognises the significant work of the Edinburgh School Uniform Bank, Edinburgh Police Fund for Children, and others to help equip children from low income families for school.\nRecognises the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland estimate that the cost of a school uniform is £129.50, but the School Uniform Grant provided by City of Edinburgh Council is only £43 and £50 for primary and secondary school children respectively.\nRecognises that the Scottish Government recommends the School Uniform Grant level be set at £70, but many Local Authorities exceed this.\nAsks that within two cycles (four months) Council Officers report on the feasibility of increasing the School Uniform Grant to ensure that from the 2018/19 academic year children from low income households are better equipped for school.”\nThe motion has support within the Labour and SNP Groups of Councillors, not least from Councillor Alison Dickie, so I am hopeful that it will be approved and we can take a small step towards ensuring Edinburgh’s children can reach their full potential.\nLast week at an event in East Lothian on “The Cost of the School Day” project I listened with great pride to all the work City of Edinburgh Council is doing to ensure finance is not a barrier to education, but I was also ashamed to hear how that lack of a clean uniform that fits can be a barrier to kids reaching their full potential (via an inspiring presentation by Pattie Santelices, Strategic Development Officer for Health & Wellbeing). Next to me a West Lothian Councillor whispered that her council had the highest School Uniform Grant in Scotland. I smiled and said I wanted Edinburgh to be the first to meet The Poverty Truth Commission’s target of £129.50.\nWithin these financially constrained times, it may not be easy to find the £129.50 for every child that needs it. That’s why we also have to continue to work with third sector partners, just like Manchester did, to ensure every child in Edinburgh is fully equipped to reach their full potential at school.\n2 Vidoes on the subject:",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2024_05_02_jenners-and-waverley-bridge-update/content_49.html": "Below is a briefing I received from Council Officers on traffic management arrangements designed to accommodate the redevelopment of the Jenners site.\nBriefing\nAs you will be aware, work on the redevelopment of the Jenners building is now underway. To safely facilitate this work, a change to traffic management arrangements in the area is proposed. This includes changes to traffic priorities, pedestrian access and bus stop arrangements. A temporary traffic regulation order (TTRO) will be advertised shortly, with temporary arrangements expected to be in place for approximately 2 years.\nThe TTRO will come into effect on 24th June 2024. Below is a copy of the South St. David Street traffic management layout plan for your information. This layout requires us to move the Airlink buses from South St. David Street for the duration of the works. In order to provide an alternative bus stop for this service the TTRO will introduce a bus gate on Waverley Bridge, reopening the bridge for to the airport bus services provided by Lothian and McGill’s buses. Bus operators are aware of this change, and they are in the process of applying to the Traffic Commissioner for permission to amend their services for this period. Bus operators understand that the reopening of Waverley Bridge is a short-term measure, and that the expectation is that they will return to their current stops once the work at Jenners is complete. No other traffic will be permitted to access Princes Street from Waverley Bridge.\nThe Placemaking, Events and Public Safety teams have been consulted about this change to ensure that we can safely facilitate pedestrians, cyclists and maintain the functionality of the area for the summer and winter festival periods. The new design will incorporate footway widenings at the north and south pedestrian accesses to Princes Street Gardens, bus access points and the flexibility to install hostile vehicle mitigation apparatus when required. The design for the new layout is still being progressed but once ready, will be circulated.\nProvisions contained within the TTRO include:\n- No Waiting Loading Unloading\nSouth St David Street from its junction with St Andrew Square to its junction with Princes Street on both sides.\nRose Street (between South St David Street and Hanover Street) from the east side of its westerly junction with Rose Street North Lane to its junction with South St David Street (approx. 110m) on both sides.\nRose Street South Lane (between South St David Street and Hanover Street) from its eastmost junction with Rose Street southbound for approximately 25 metres. - Road Closure\nRose Street South Lane (between South St David Street and Hanover Street) from its eastmost junction with Rose Street southbound for approximately 25 metres. Diversion via West entrance to Rose Street South Lane. - Buses, Cycle and Taxi Only\nBuses, Cycles and Taxis only permitted to travel in the southbound direction of South St David Street from its junction with Rose Street to its junction with Princes Street - Bus Only\nBuses permitted to exit Waverley Bridge onto Princes Street in a northbound direction.

Left Turn From Waverley Bridge into Princes Street Permitted to Buses Only.\nLeft turn manoeuvre prohibited from Meuse Lane into South St David Street for all traffic except Buses Cycles and Taxis.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_12_02_the-picardy-place-predicament-place-movement-or-both_comment-page-1/content_574.html": "Context\nEdinburgh is a growing city. By 2050 it will have grown by 25% and it is important that this growth is undertaken in a way that maintains, or ideally improves, the quality of life we currently enjoy. Indeed, Edinburgh must be a liveable city. That means governance, healthcare provision, culture and environment, education and infrastructure must all contribute to a good quality of life.\nI’m tempted to say that the growth must also be “sustainable”, but it is hard (for me) to see how that rate of growth can be. Nonetheless, we must take steps in that direction if the city we love is to continue to be one of the best in the world. We must be mindful that the strategic decisions we take today, will inform how our capital evolves.\nAdditionally, we’ve seen how the Scottish Government thinks the motor car is a key part of this vision. The investment in the M8, M9 and M90 corridors are focused on creating a regional economic powerhouse based around the car. An expansion of air travel is also on their agenda. Nonetheless, we’ve also seen rail improvements – not least EGIP and link to the Borders.\nWithin that context, we must think about how people get to Edinburgh and also how people move within the city. Indeed, we already know that half of the people living in Edinburgh are held up by congestion every day and that congestion costs Lothian Buses alone £2m per year.\nTo address these challenges we need to add capacity to the key arterial corridors (e.g. A702) and the city centre road network without adding to congestion. To do that, there is a recognition that we need to make public and active transport much more attractive. Our great bus service must get better. Active transport must be attractive, safe and enjoyable. This is not just about moving people from A to B, it’s about taking a holistic view and ensuring Edinburgh is a liveable City.\nIn the short-term, we can expect to see the implementation of a plan “to improve the public realm in the city centre with the aim of improving conditions for, and prioritising access for pedestrians, and public transport users” (SPOKES are excited about this.). Although this is focused on central Edinburgh, it has potential to set the whole city on a positive trajectory.\nRunning in parallel to this we have the proposed tramline “extension” to Newhaven. Like it or lump it, it has potential to add significant capacity to the public transport system in northern Edinburgh, and connect people there with growth areas in western Edinburgh.\nThere will of course be uncertainty, compromises and setbacks. Personally, I am concerned that the St James Quarter will come with 1,000 extra parking spaces (triple the existing provision). Linked to this, we have the proposals for “Picardy Place” – the space at the junction of Leith Street, York Place & Leith Walk.\nPicardy Place\nPicardy Place is important as it is the gateway to Edinburgh’s World Heritage Site. The space must showcase Edinburgh whilst also allowing the safe movement of people to and from the city centre. It has been an eyesore for many years, but now we have a chance to completely redesign it to meet Edinburgh’s future needs.\nThe problem we face is that the basic design at the heart of what is being proposed is now more than 10 years old and, on first inspection, looks like the kind of layout one would expect in a sprawling American city where car is king. Yes, pedestrian and cycle safety measures have been retrofitted to improve it. For many, however, this is like putting lipstick on a pig – it is still a pig.\nThe design is based on a gyratory layout – it involves three lanes of traffic revolving around a large triangular “roundabout” big enough to have a building on. Indeed, the central space was originally big enough for a luxury hotel. Since then, however, the space has reduced significantly in size to, amongst other things, allow the inclusion of safer footpaths, cycle lanes and to protect some public space outside St Mary’s Catholic Cathedral.\nDespite these improvements, however, there is a feeling that the design of the junction is too focussed on the movement of cars rather than people (there is a difference). Indeed, Lesley Hinds (Edinburgh’s transport chief until May 2017) said she “told officers months ago this proposal was unacceptable“:\nLesley Hinds is not the only person to raise concerns about what is being proposed for Picardy Place. In September SUSTRANS Scotland, a charity which promotes safe walking and cycling routes, walked out on discussions with City of Edinburgh Council regarding the design saying: “The concept of Hierarchy of Street Users is not at the centre of project thinking and does not follow Scottish Government policy for Designing Streets.” On the Gyratory specifically, they said: “The multi-lane gyratory traffic system appears unsuitable for an area at the gateway to Edinburgh’s World Heritage area.”\nThe Broughton Spurtle, a community newspaper that likes to stir things up (AKA Spurtling), reported strong opposition from both the Leith Central Walk and New Town and Broughton Community Councils. Indeed, the Broughton Spurtle also promoted an alternative design produced by Zone Architects.\nThis, and adverse comments from the public, triggered improvements to the design and a further round of public consultations, but the gyratory layout was retained. Of these designs, SUSTRANS said: “we remain unsupportive of the gyratory concept because we feel it does not adequately balance the pressure of traffic, with the opportunity to create a successful, quality public space and transport interchange.”\nSPOKES, a campaign group which promotes cycling, described aspects of the revised proposals as “completely inappropriate” and concluded the plan added “very significantly to potential pedestrian/cyclist conflict” and that they were “unhappy with the basic gyratory concept“.\nLiving Streets Edinburgh, a charity which exists to promote walking and better quality public spaces, have also raised concerns. Before the latest round of consultations got underway, they claimed the design did “not comply with Scottish Government or the Council’s own policies” and that there will “be a loss of important areas of public realm / cultural / green space“.\nTo promote these points, supporters of Living Streets Edinburgh have been contacting City of Edinburgh Councillors. Over a two week period, I received well over 150 e-mails. To put that in context, I normally receive new casework e-mails from one or two constituents per day.\nMuch of the public realm arguments focus on the threat to the space outside St Mary’s Catholic Cathedral, home of The Manuscript of Monte Cassino (an open palm, a section of limb and a human foot) which were created by Eduardo Paolozzi for that spot – apparently the centre of his universe. Indeed this space, has changed considerably as the design has evolved. The latest design places Eduardo Paolozzi’s works outside the Cathedral, but access problems remain:\nA second public realm focus is the centre of the “roundabout”, and what quality of public realm space it can provide. Dr Peter Mathews, an academic and expert in urban policy and regeneration, described this space as “the finest urban design from the 1960s” and the centre’s of gyratory systems as being “deeply unpleasant places“. He concluded by saying: “The current proposals, if implemented, will just be an embarrassment for the city and demonstrate a lack of leadership and bravery on changing transport modes and tackling climate change”. Ouch!\nOf course, one could argue that these critical voices only represent one side of the argument. The problem is that nobody is representing the opposite with anything like an equal amount of energy. I have not spoken to anyone who backs that gyratory concept who does not also have concerns about it. They recognise it’s a compromise.\nSo why compromise so much when Scotland’s Capital deserves better? That question takes us back to the £850m St James Quarter development and its corpulent car park. A ~£60m Growth Accelerator Model (GAM) funding agreement was brokered for the public works associated with the St James Quarter development between the developer City of Edinburgh Council, the Scottish Government and the government’s Scottish Futures Trust (a shady organisation involved in the SNP’s version of PFI). Councillor Claire Miller described the Picardy Place road design written into the GAM deal as “disappointing” and claimed it “locks the city centre into very high volumes of private vehicle use”.\nPapers presented to City of Edinburgh Council’s Transport and Environment Committee make clear that although the total value of the GAM contract is around £60m, £55m of that is from the Scottish Government, only £15m is allocated to Picardy Place. The paper does, however, also contain this threat: “Any fundamental review of the current design could put at risk these agreements, the delivery programme, and Scottish Government funding, with resulting further risk to the delivery of any revised layout and to the extension of the tram.“.\nWhat is interesting about this threat is that I understand that no discussions had taken place with the SNP Government on the issue – it is simply speculation. As someone who is positive about Edinburgh, I like to think that the Scottish Government would be willing to put more money in the pot if a better design could be found. Indeed, it may well be that any such design would be cheaper!\nConclusion\nAt best, the current Picardy Place proposals are unpopular. At worst, they are unsafe and will be a backward step for Edinburgh. With the city centre review underway, the decision is being made at the wrong time and may actually undermine the review. Cutting across this is the GAM agreement. It hangs over the decision like a dark cloud.\nMy feeling is that we should do all we can to engage the GAM partners in a positive conversation about what’s possible. One that seeks to integrate Picardy Place and the St James Quarter into the wider discussion about ensuring Edinburgh remains one of Europe’s greatest capitals. The discussion needs to focus on more than the movement of cars and the width of footpaths. We need to think about place making, wellbeing and the economy. We need to think holistically about ensuring Edinburgh is a liveable city.\nAs far as I know, none of the political parties in Edinburgh have reached a position on the current Picardy Place proposals, but I think it is fair to say that the Greens oppose them just as much as the Tories support them. Within the Labour Group, I shall be arguing that the current proposals can’t be supported. That does not mean that my mind is closed, or that I won’t listen to the local community (and those representing them). It does, however, mean that I think Edinburgh deserves better.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_09_20_update-road-safety-on-oxgangs-rd-north/content_542.html": "I get regular “feedback” about vehicle movements and parking on Oxgangs Road North. It is important that this is addressed due to there being entrances to four schools over a 340m stretch of road. The Council have responded to these concerns in the first instance by reviewing the movement of vehicles they control along the road. A briefing on this is below.\nI have taken a wider look at the transport issues surrounding the Oxgangs Road North area with a view to analysing the services who receive children and adults utilising “assisted transport”.\nThe following services make use of a combination of Council provision, externally contracted and taxi provision:\n- Milestone – Waverly Care\n- Oxgangs Primary – (Additional Support for Learning)\n- Firhill High School – (Additional Support for Learning)\n- Braidburn School – (Additional Support Needs)\nThere is also additional Council, external and taxi provision picking up people who attend adult social care and ASN Schools in other parts of the city at (impacting on Oxgangs Road North):\n5. Colinton Mains Terrace\n6. Colinton Mains Road\n7. Firhill Crescent\nAs a response to the high demand for transport in the area I have:\n8. Opened depot provision at Murrayburn in order to facilitate more responsive route-planning and hopefully provide greater opportunities for shared transport, thereby reducing use of some taxi provision and external contracts as children and adults have reduced travel time and distance to services in the Oxgangs Road North Area.\n9. Arranged to meet with Head Teachers in the surrounding area along with the Quality Improvement Officer ASN schools in order to examine measures to increase shared transport options and further reduce single occupancy vehicles attending Braidburn School. This will require the creation of a “Breakfast Club” to allow some children to be dropped off 20-30 mins early. This will require planning and engagement with parents and although it is not a quick solution I believe it could prove to set a standard and become popular as potentially we can deliver consistent transport solutions valued by children with autism and their families, for example. (I have had some recent success with this model at Kaimes Schools).\n10. I will be discussing the implementation of “marshalling” at Braidburn ASN School to ensure we manage access to the area safely. I want to tie this to item 9. So that we can manage quality, safety and seek out further opportunities to increase shared transport options as a more responsive approach.\nItem 8. Has been implemented and has affected 15 routes into the Oxgangs Road North area, increased vehicle sharing, reduced travel time for children and adults and improved the experience for vulnerable adults and children.\nItem 9 &10 Is planned for meeting by the end of October.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_02_26_scottish-tourist-guides-association-briefing-on-edinburghs-public-toilets/content_668.html": "Below is a briefing from the Scottish Tourist Guides Association on the important part public toilets play in Edinburgh’s tourist economy. After the threat Colinton’s public toilets faced this year, I feel the we should use the Tourist Tax income to help protect (and improve) them.\nFOR THE ATTENTION OF ALL MEMBERS OF THE CITY OF EDINBURGH COUNCIL\nI am writing on behalf of the Edinburgh and SE Scotland Branch of the Scottish Tourist Guides Association (STGA). As Blue Badge guides, we work with many hundreds of tourists, guiding them around Edinburgh and Scotland. We enjoy showing off Edinburgh to local and foreign visitors. However our work is being seriously affected by the lack of suitable toilet facilities for our clients. As the Capital of Scotland, Edinburgh is sometimes the only place visitors experience in depth, and hence this issue affects all professional guides. We believe City of Edinburgh Council must take a lead in this matter in order to avoid negative feedback from all tourists in Scotland.\nWe understand current provision is not under threat, but that a Planning and maintenance Meeting on 28th February may decide to reduce hours, staffing or maintenance. We believe even in times of reduced budgets this would be very detrimental to what the Scottish Government has identified as a growth sector contributing around £6 billion pounds to our GDP.\nThe Council has provided a useful map for the facilities which do exist, and this includes disabled provision, and a Community Toilet Scheme, which we understand is unlikely to continue due to budget restrictions. Our issue is with groups of up to 50 clients who come by coach, after a long journey, are often elderly and cannot walk far. With up to 6 cruise ships coming in to the Edinburgh area in one day (and this may even increase as plans to bring ships into East Lothian progress) there are insufficient places where coaches can drop off and pick up with a large number of toilets nearby. We have researched this, largely because Holyrood Palace no longer allow photo and toilet stops unless visitors are entering the Palace. (Both the National Museum of Scotland and the Botanic Gardens do have suitable provision, but neither is ideal.) We are also ensuring clients that bring groups of visitors allow for extra time in their programmes.\nA House of Commons Green Paper in 2008 recommended that local authorities take a strategic approach to toilet provision, and we believe this would help identify gaps in provision which could be addressed. The strategy could also take into account issues like night access for the homeless, provision by other Lothian Councils and the current or future Community Access Scheme. It might identify this as a national issue, rather an Edinburgh one only. Finally, If the Tourist Tax comes into effect, it should provide justification for spend on toilets.\nIn the short term at least, we request that consideration of the problem at a strategic level be given at the upcoming meeting, and that you and your fellow Councillors understand and input to an issue that will increasingly affect the public.\nThe Edinburgh Branch of the STGA would be happy to be involved in whatever way we can to ensure our clients are provided for, and continue to praise our City.\nWe look forward to your consideration and response.\nYours faithfully,\nJune Allison Edgar, B.Sc., M.B.A.\nBlue Badge Guide to Scotland",

In addition to the funding received via Sustrans, Transport Scotland recently provided a further £50k for the work.\nIt is important to note that in June 2023 all political parties agreed that the Spaces for People schemes show be progressed via the ETRO process, with the exception of three schemes where Labour, Lib-Dems and Tories asked for more work to be done to take on board the views of local residents:\n- Braid Road and the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route.\n- Comiston Road.\n- Silverknowes Road North and Silverknowes Road South.\nAn update on these three projects was tabled in November 2023, and the results of a local consultation on the Braid Road and the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route will be considered in March 2024.\nWith regard to all other schemes, the City Centre Area ETRO was advertised on Friday 9 February and the Order will come into effect on 19 February. Following this, there will be a 6-month period during which anyone can raise comments or objections relating to the restrictions and prohibitions included in the ETRO. The Order will be made available to view on the Traffic Orders page of the Council website at the start of the 6-month period.\nAny feedback received already, during the previous 6-month period that ran between November 2022 and May 2023, has been retained and will be considered as part of the final assessment of whether or not to retain or modify the measures. There is therefore no need for people to submit feedback again, if they have already done so through the previous consultation, although they can if they wish.\nThe currently anticipated programme for advertising the other replacement Travelling Safely ETROs is as follows:\n- East Area – 8 March 2024\n- West Area – 5 April 2024\n- North Area – 3 May 2024\n- South Area – 17 May 2024",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_05_02_my-account-oxgangs-ps-parent-council-qa-meeting-about-maintenance-of-the-school/content_490.html": "This evening I attended a Q&A meeting in Oxgangs Primary School which had the aim of giving parents a chance to ask questions about the design, operation and maintenance of the school.\nThe school has been in the news since a wall on the east end of the building collapsed in 2016. I wasn’t a Councillor back then, but I did spot the wall had collapsed on my walk to work in January 2016 – indeed, the BBC often use the image I took early that morning when I reported it. Later that year I was one of a group of people that went around every door in Colinton-Mains with a handful of Councillors to ask people if they needed help dealing with the temporary closure of the school.\nThese memories are important as much of the Q&A meeting focussed on that time rather than the more recent failures. This focus was because that was the point at which parents lost trust in how the School building is being managed. This is understandable as the school opened too quickly after the wall initially collapsed and had to close again when it became clear that failure was a small part of a much bigger problem.\nIndeed, it is clear from parents this evening that the worry and frustration about how the building is being managed stems back to 2016. They simply feel let down by the Council and ESP, the PFI company that runs the school building. The fact that the Council has now caught up with parents and also lost trust in ESP’s ability to provide a safe teaching environment may be welcome, but many parents feel it is long overdue.\nAndrew Kerr, the Council’s Chief Executive, was clear this evening that the latest problems at the school had meant the contract with ESP was now being securitised and payments to them (over £1.5m per month for 17 schools) were being withheld. On ESP’s failure to attend the Q&A meeting, he was clear that it was “wholly reprehensible for them not to face the community they had let down”. ESP did, however, provide this statement.\nRon Fishie (Director) and John Paterson (Operations Director) from AMEY, the company who maintains the school for ESP, gave a clear apology to parents and said the standard of service they had provided had been acceptable. AMEY recognised that they had lost the trust of the school community, but were determined to rebuild it.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, it is now clear to me that inspections undertaken in 2016 did not go far enough and ESP can’t be trusted to run the building without independent scrutiny. Within that context, the following changes to how the building is managed look likely to be agreed:\n- At their own cost, ESP will introduce an enhanced monitoring regime undertaken by an independent party.\n- AMEY will publish details of all work and inspections undertaken in the school.\n- The Council will publish details of how the work and inspections undertaken by AMEY is being scrutinised.\nAlthough these changes are simple, the tone in which they were agreed was important. ESP and the Council have a lot of work to do if they want to regain the trust of parents, but it feels like the meeting tonight marked a change to a more constructive relationship. Time will tell!\nThe Council and ESP have a lot to do when it comes to regaining the trust of parents with children at Oxgangs Primary School, but it feels like the meeting was a step in the right direction. In the coming months and years, I will be working with parents to ensure they are not let down again.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_09_23_edinburghs-city-plan-2030-the-impact-on-colinton-oxgangs-fairmilehead/content_266.html": "I was elected four years ago on a pledge to work with the community to protect our greenbelt, parks and greenspaces from developers seeking to make a quick profit, and I am happy to report that so far I have succeeded in my Ward, and I’m proud of how the people I represent have taken a stand. The future is now looks even brighter.\nThe Council has now published its 1,400 page draft City Plan 2030 document (download link at the bottom of this blog). This document maps out how the city will develop over the next decade or so. A key driver is ensuring enough land is set aside for 36,911 new homes which are estimated to be needed, and that Edinburgh has sufficient schools, GPs, transport infrastructure etc to cope with them.\nI can’t pretend to have read all 555,582 words yet, but I think the report does look broadly positive for my Ward:\n- After years of campaigning by communities in my Ward, City Plan 2030 offers none of the Greenbelt here for development. The same is the case for all of south Edinburgh.\n- The biggest development area in the whole of Southwest Edinburgh is Redford Barracks. I’m pleased to see that community feedback has been taken onboard in shaping the outline proposals for this site (more detail below), and there will be opportunities for local people to have more say.\n- It has taken a lot of arguing, but the Council now accepts that it can meet its housing supply targets without allocating any further greenspace for development. HOWEVER, Greenbelt allocated in the previous plan will not be removed – especially in Northwest Edinburgh.\n- The strategy of protecting the Greenbelt by using the tram extension to open up brownfield sites in north Edinburgh is now delivering results.\nLooking at the wider city, these are the three key points I noted.\n- Where sites are developed, the Council will take an “infrastructure first” approach – directing new development to where there is existing infrastructure. Where required to support new development, City Plan 2030 requires new and expanded community infrastructure including schools, healthcare, sustainable transport, energy, and waste to support these new communities.\n- For new developments, the 20% “affordable” target has been scrapped – Edinburgh will demand 35%. I’m disappointed that this will not apply to Student Accommodation.\n- All new buildings will use low and zero-carbon generating technologies to be net zero and to address climate adaptation, and the aim will be to move towards 20-minute walkable neighbourhoods. The noted intention is to ensure that new housing development is directed to where residents can access a range of key services within walking distance when this is practicable and reasonable. Developers will be expected to demonstrate their proposal’s walkability to key services as part of their submission.\nListed below are some of the key impacts for people in my Ward.\nRedford Barracks\nThe Council is assuming that the UK Government will proceed with its plans to close Redford Barracks. Its CityPlan2030 document maps out how the city will develop over the next 20 years, and it suggests the Redford Barrack could be redeveloped as a:\n“housing-led mixed–use development which draws the surrounding communities together, through the provision of new connections, open spaces and other community infrastructure” and this will draw “the surrounding communities together through the provision of new connections, open spaces and other community infrastructure”.\nIt is expected that there will be appropriate frontages to Colinton Road, Oxgangs Road North and the rear. The existing parade grounds should be kept free from development, and any new development around them must provide active frontages onto these spaces. The security fence will be removed.\nIt is estimated that the site could accommodate as many as 800 new homes. The redevelopment will respect the history and layout of the site, and it is hoped the War Memorial can be retained (if not, it will be moved). Indeed, it is noted that the site’s military history must be interpreted within the new development.\nThe report notes that there is flood risk on the site which needs to be better understood.\nAll homes on the site will be adequately served with play facilities, and the recreation area to the southeast will be retained and will form a new community park.\nI’m glad that the Council agreed that this scale of development will necessitate improvements to the bus provision serving Colinton (the focus is the 400), and that GP services will also require expansion. The potential for active travel routes between the redevelopment site with schools, Water of Leith etc.\nThe site will also have a “Mobility Hub” this is an accessible place which brings together different transport modes alongside associated facilities, services and information to encourage more sustainable travel. These can include a range of shared mobility services, click and collect, electric vehicle charging, etc.\nThe developer will also fund investment in Firrhill HS and Colinton PS. It is estimated that Colinton PS will require 6 classrooms and a dining/assembly hall extension. For Firrhill HS, a site of around 2.3ha is required for expansion. It is also recognised that additional pre-school provision will be needed.\nThe public will also have a say on individual applications over the next decade, and I will ensure the voices of local people are heard.\nWhen I was elected in 2017 I was sure we’d have seen more clarity on the future of the barracks by now, but today I am less than certain that we will see substantial progress before 2030!\nFairmilehead Area\nThere is no mention in the report other than confirming the Swanston and Winton conservation areas. Buckstone Shops are noted as being a “Local Centre”. St Peter’s, Buckstone and Pentland Primary Schools are noted as needing no additional capacity up to 2030.\nOxgangs Area\nOxgangs is noted as benefitting from the potential redevelopment of Redford Barracks. Oxgangs Broadway is designated as a Local Centre. St Mark’s and Oxgangs Primary Schools are noted as needing no additional capacity up to 2030, but Firrhill High School is flagged as needing room for expansion due to the Redford Barracks redevelopment. Braidburn School is not mentioned in the report.\nColinton Area\nColinton Village is noted as being a Local Centre and the conservation area designation is noted. The potential to establish South Gyle-Pentlands-Swanston-Portobello cycle route is highlited (this looks like an extension to the planned Portobello-Pentlands active travel route). Colinton Primary School is explained as needing room for expansion due to the Redford Barracks redevelopment, and Bonaly Primary School is noted has having no capacity issues.\nBoroughmuir HS, St Thomas of Aquin’s RC HS & St Augustine’s RC HS.\nThere is already significant pressure on the capacity of Boroughmuir HS, and development withing the catchment will result in an estimated further 46 pupils. An extension to increase the capacity of Boroughmuir High School to 1,560 pupils is currently under construction – the demand by 2030 is estimated as 1,705. Beyond this, the school cannot be extended further on its existing site (they built it in the wrong place!). The report notes – “To accommodate all pupils forecast from population growth and pupil generation from new development it will be necessary to engage with the school community to consider the options available, including catchment change.”. I write about this issue here – the blog is now a little dated, but the issues at play have not changed.\nFor St Thomas of Aquin’s RC High School, the report suggests suggests that it will have only limited capacity to provide places for RC pupils generated by new housing developments. Accordingly, contributions of £5,313,509 are sought for the 101 pupils estimated to be generated by new developments.\nFor St Augustine’s RC High School, contributions of £18,465,759 are sought for the 351 pupils estimated to be generated by new developments.",

By this point in the month we are looking forward to Christmas and the hope that a New Year brings. However, December 2018 also marked a turning point for many of the most vulnerable people in Scotland’s capital.\nIn their draft budget the Scottish Government took the decision to cut Edinburgh’s budget at least 5 times more than was expected. Bizarrely, Edinburgh’s SNP Council Leader claimed “it looks like the Government has managed to protect council funding”. One has to wonder how big the cut has to be before he will speak out against his Holyrood masters.\nTwo days later Edinburgh’s “Integrated Joint Board” met to agree which communities would fall victim of their latest round of cuts. The meeting began with the SNP member absenting himself due to a conflict of interest, and Edinburgh’s SNP Council Leader failing to find an alternative.\nWith no SNP Councillor willing to defend their own party’s cuts, there then followed almost two hours of heartfelt pleading from community health groups supporting some of the most vulnerable people in Edinburgh. This included a scathing attack on the Scottish Government by Cllr Cammy Day who spoke on behalf of the Pilton Community Health Project.\nCouncillor Day was clearly distraught when talking about the loss of a unique service supporting female victims of domestic and sexual abuse – “Women Supporting Women”. I hope he’s wrong, but you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to predict what will happen if “essential life-saving services” fall victim of SNP cuts.\nQuite bizarrely at the same time as these moving testimonies were being made, outside the City Cambers the SNP’s Ben Macpherson MSP was protesting against the cuts he’d voted for without a whimper of concern in Holyrood. Some say the designer scarf he was wearing covered a brass neck.\nSo whilst we all look forward to Christmas, let’s hope 2019 is a year where the Scottish Government recognises that a cut on local government is simply an attack on vulnerable people.",

It’s easy to joke about people peeing in public, but it is disgusting and rightly an offence.\nFor those that don’t know, Parkrun is a completely free 5km (3.2 miles) run held in parks across the UK every Saturday, and often also Christmas Day and New Year’s Day. These are inclusive events which welcome elite runners alongside couch potatoes, children and people with disabilities. Recent weeks saw everything at Parkrun from an octogenarian completing her 250th run to the total distance now covered by all runners exceeding 149,597,870 kilometres.\nEdinburgh is blessed with two Parkruns (Portobello and Cramond), plus a third nearby at Vogrie Country Park. On a typical Saturday morning well over 1,000 people will complete these courses. That’s 1,000 children and adults taking part in a community organised event where all that’s needed to take part is a pair of trainers.\nI have now completed 152 runs, 141 of them at Cramond where I also try to volunteer once per month. Parkrun has helped me hugely – after I had my cardiac pacemaker fitted in December 2015 it was a key part of how I recovered my health and confidence. Others use it to lose weight, spend time with friends or simply build up their fitness.\nThe people taking part in Portobello Parkrun are no different. Each of the 5 times I have completed that Parkrun with my son I have been amazed by the range of people taking part. Alongside grannies there are elite runners. Alongside people running with their dogs there are mums running with the babies in buggies. This diversity is what makes Parkrun so special.\nThe pride I have in being a Parkrunner is why I am so angry with those that undermine what it stands for with their behaviour. Before every single Parkrun we are reminded that we must respect other park users and the local community. Portobello Parkrun specifically tells runners to “use the toilet before you leave home in the morning” and makes them aware that public toilets are nearby.\nI don’t speak for Parkrun, but I’m sure I speak for all Parkrunners when I say that people that disrespect Parkrun, park users or the local community are simply not welcome at Parkrun.",

This detailed how that in the 5 years since 2013-14 funding for day-to-day council spending from the SNP Government has decreased by 7.1% but the UK Government only cut the Scottish Government’s revenue budget by 1.8%. On average across Scotland, the SNP have cut Council spending by £148 per person, but in Edinburgh the cut has been even greater – £226 per person.\nI urged people in Edinburgh to oppose these politically motivated cuts to funding for local services.\nFraser Grant responded by suggesting none of this was correct (Letters, 08/10/18), but oddly failed to provide any alternative analysis. Indeed, where education is concerned he thinks we have never had it so good – claiming that the Scottish Government had handed £120m to head teachers.\nPerhaps Mr Grant has missed recent editions of the Evening News and the fantastic work it is doing to highlight the crisis our capital’s schools face. In recent weeks we’ve heard that crumbling schools in deprived areas can’t be replaced (06/10/18), teachers are using their own money to buy pencils (01/10/18), and that Edinburgh’s SNP led Council plans to cut classroom assistants and increase class sizes (20/09/18).\nMr Grant’s obfuscation, does not hide the fact that the SNP council leader and his Education Spokesperson have been silent on these cuts. I won’t be because they are a disgrace.\nRather than acting as the SNP’s apologist, Mr Grant should join progressive people in Edinburgh and demand that our capital is treated fairly.\nI applaud veteran SNP Councillor Norrie Work, on Friday he used social media to demand of the SNP Government: “Can Queensferry get some attention please? That’s a popular tourist site as well and needs some investment”. Green Councillor Mary Campbell has also spoken out about her party’s habit of enabling SNP cuts, she took to social media to talk about the “impossibility of creating a balanced budget with the cuts facing councils if the Scottish Government continue on the current Local Government funding model” which her has party supported.\nIt’s time Edinburgh’s hardcore nationalists joined the progressives that are standing up for our capital.",

We could probably estimate the cost of this to our stressed Ambulance Service, NHS and Social Care system, but the human cost is incalculable.\nThe seriousness of this situation is why all 61 Councillors (2 Councillors from one party were absent) present at Full Council last week backed a call to review the system currently used to keep our footpaths, roads and cycle-paths free of ice and snow. The clear message is that the status quo is not good enough for Scotland’s capital city and that residents are right to feel angry.\nThe solutions brought forward by the review are likely to include a mix of using existing resources better, investing in new technology and making a wider pool of Council staff available to keep the streets safe.\nCutting across this, I hope to see far greater priority given to higher lying areas (e.g. Fairmilehead, Colinton, Oxgangs, Bonaly & Balerno) and also communities which have high proportions of older residents.\nIndeed, it breaks my heart to hear stories of older people “trapped” at home waiting for snow to melt. They helped make our city what it is today, so deserve greater respect from the rest of us.\nI shall also be arguing that communities be given the resources they need to be more resilient. I’d like to encourage more people and businesses to return to the tradition of clearing the path outside their house, and perhaps even that of an elderly neighbour. Of course, to do that we’ll have to make sure grit bins are serviceable and kept full. Ensuring we have the resources to do that alone would be a great starting point.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_04_07_oxgangs-primary-shows-why-its-time-to-end-pfi-in-scotland/content_540.html": "Oxgangs Primary is a school where the children, parents and staff all work together to make it one of Edinburgh’s best. It simply does not deserve the bad publicity that the ongoing problems bring. In recent weeks I’ve worked along with Cllr Rust and Cllr Corbett to ensure the voice of the school community is heard and that its interests are protected.\nThe parents and staff simply want the children to flourish in a school with buildings and grounds that are free of health and safety hazards, and promotes learning. They didn’t ask for it to be a PFI school operated by ESP.\nAlthough the building has been confirmed as safe, there is a massive gap between what parents expect and what ESP is delivering – many will be delighted that the Council is now taking a tougher stance with ESP.\nIt angers me that ESP is profiting from the stress and uncertainty they are forcing on the school community. It is frankly unbelievable that ESP has still not compensated the Council for the problems arising from the collapse of the wall in 2016.\nDespite confirming that the school had been repaired after more recent problems with an internal ceiling tile and external roof flashing, ESP appears to have failed to notice or deal with adjacent problems. For example, ESP checked the school to ensure no ceiling hangers were missing (the probable cause of the tile falling), but failed to spot hangers that were not secured properly or that had snapped.\nIt is difficult not to draw the conclusion that ESP is focussed on maximising return to shareholders rather than providing a safe school for children to flourish in. Indeed, ESP is listed by Companies House as a company involved in the “Construction of commercial buildings” and its 2017 accounts showed it had £8,095,169 “cash at bank or in hand”. ESP’s motives appear to be at complete odds with the school community.\nWhat these latest problems with ESP show is that it’s time to end the use of PFI type contracts. The problems at the Royal Infirmary and Oxgangs Primary, together with the 6 year delay at the new Sick Kids Hospital, all show that the PFI model is not good value for money. The Scottish Government need to consign it to the dustbin and give Edinburgh the funding it needs to bring Oxgangs Primary back in to public ownership where it belongs.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_10_31_dont-forget-who-cut-edinburghs-budget/content_254.html": "There can hardly be any surprise that there are differences in opinion between the coalition parties in Edinburgh’s City Chambers. Labour Councillors entered politics because they wanted a fairer society where everyone has a chance to reach their full potential. The SNP has no real underlying ideology and simply wants constitutional change at any cost.\nThis does not mean, however, that we can’t work together to run Council services in Edinburgh. Within that context, I don’t recognise the description that the administration is “dysfunctional”.\nRight now we are dealing with the cuts the SNP and Greens in Holyrood inflicted on Edinburgh. These are not cuts that Labour wants or desires, but we have managed to put together a package of proposals that we think the Edinburgh public should be consulted on. Without Labour’s input, the impact may well have been worse.\nWhilst individual Councillors inside and outside the coalition may choose to oppose individual cuts, the reality is that savings have to be made. Personally, I hope the music school will not close as I fear music tuition for gifted children will become the preserve of the wealthy if it does*. I expect many Councillors agree with me on this, but if it is saved an alternative cut will need to be found.\nWithin that context, I must suggest the public ask hard questions of any Tory, SNP or Green Councillors who oppose these cuts. The Tories in Westminster have been squeezing public spending, whilst this year the Greens and the SNP in Holyrood decided not to use Scotland’s revenue raising powers to protect services. The result of these actions are the cuts we are faced with today.\nPerhaps Councillors from those parties should be lobbying their elite for better funding rather than grandstanding about the cuts on Twitter?\n*With the City of Edinburgh Music School under threat of closure, this open day is a chance to show your support for the service:",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2025_03_30_your-concerns-about-any-changes-to-welfare/content_8.html": "This blog relates to the recent statement from the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions on reforms to the disability benefits system. I know many residents in Edinburgh South West will share my concerns about any poorly considered changes to welfare provision. This is why I visited Downing Street ahead of the announcement, hoping to shape the proposals.\nSome of what is being said in relation to the reforms is scaremongering, causing unnecessary distress to friends, family and neighbours. The reality is that the reforms announced by the government will not result in any immediate changes to anyone’s benefits, and that spending on welfare will still continue to increase, by 45% up to 2030.\nWhen the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) made its last set of forecasts in October it estimated that benefits for working age adults would rise from £48.5 billion in 2023-24 to £75.7bn in 2029-30. By supporting those that are able back in to work the proposed reforms aims to limit this increase to £70.7 billion.\nThe Labour Government will not, however, proceed with the previous Government’s changes to the Work Capability Assessment. As a result, 370,000 people will now be eligible for the new Universal Credit (UC) health element at £50 per week, gaining £2,600 per year. Additionally, the UC Standard Allowance will be increased above inflation until 2030.\nI believe in a welfare state that supports everyone when needed, protects those most in need, and ensures equality and dignity for all. There will always be individuals who cannot work, and I assure you that I will advocate for their rights to be respected.\nHowever, the welfare system inherited from the Conservatives is failing the very people it was designed to help and is holding our country back. Recent statistics reveal that one in every ten working-age individuals in Britain is now claiming at least one type of health or disability benefit.\nResearch published in February 2025 revealed that approximately 200,000 individuals receiving health and disability benefits believe they could work immediately with the right job and support. Additionally, over 1 million more believe they could work if their health improved. This is part of the reason why the UK Government is investing in the NHS and encouraging, with funding, the SNP to do the same in Scotland. By 2029/30, it will also invest £1 billion annually in targeted and personalised support to help more disabled people and those with health conditions into employment.\nInstead of addressing the long-term needs of individuals, the Conservatives have sought to make short-term political capital by blaming hundreds of thousands of people for an unsustainable rise in benefits costs. The reality is that many sick and disabled individuals want to work, deserve the same opportunities as everyone else and are looking for support to return to work.\nSince this government took office last July, over 9.3 million people have been out of work and not seeking employment—more than the population of London. Additionally, 2.8 million people are classified as long-term sick, one of the highest rates among G7 countries. The number of individuals claiming health-related benefits without any requirement to work has surged by 800,000 since 2019/2020, a 45% increase.\nThe UK is an international outlier in this regard. We are the only major economy whose employment rate has not recovered from the pandemic. Furthermore, there is a growing issue where young people are leaving school and not entering further education, apprenticeships, or work. Instead, they are being abandoned by the state, left to rely on health and disability benefits.\nThe latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that 872,000 young people (12.2%) aged 16 to 24 are currently out of work, education, or training. Shockingly, this is nearly a quarter of a million more young people (228,000) than three years ago when the rate was 9.6%.\nThe UK lags behind other OECD countries in reducing the number of young people not in education, employment, or training. The Scottish Government is not helping. A total of 1,351 pupils, enough to fill an entire high school, left school last year without a single qualification. This contributes to Scotland’s higher economic inactivity rate compared to the rest of the UK.\nIt is essential that we take immediate and effective action to address this issue and support our young people to find pathways to education, employment, and training. This is a point I emphasized during my recent visit to Downing Street.\nLast week, the Government announced proposed changes in a “green paper,” a provisional document for public consultation. Full information on the green paper and the consultation can be found here: Pathways to Work: Reforming Benefits and Support to Get Britain Working Green Paper – GOV.UK.\nThe green paper outlines measures to help those who can work. The Government is investing £1 billion into employment support, one of the largest investments to increase opportunities for sick and disabled people, guaranteeing high-quality and tailored support. They are also introducing a “right to try,” providing those who want to work the confidence to do so without the risk of losing out if they fall out of work.\nI want to reiterate that the majority of the proposed changes are part of an active and open consultation and are not immediate changes to the support people receive.\nThe consultation is open until 30 June, and any member of the public can submit their views on the changes here, or by emailing consultation.pathwaystowork@dwp.gov.uk.\nI encourage all constituents with views on this matter to submit responses to the consultation. It is important for Members of Parliament to be guided by their constituents.\nTherefore, over the coming weeks, I will undertake to understand better the opinions of people here in Edinburgh South West and will work with experts in Parliament to quantify how these proposed changes could impact the constituency.\nTo that end, I will take the following actions:\n- Host meetings/roundtable with local stakeholders, including charities and service providers.\n- Produce a resident survey on the issue, collecting your views and experiences.\n- Hold a public meeting to hear residents’ views and experiences firsthand.\n- Produce a findings summary for submission to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and the national consultation.\nThe key test for me is whether people who cannot work are protected, and those who can work are supported to do so. Analysis suggests that there will be an estimated 3.8 million families in 2029/30—some current recipients and some future recipients—who will financially gain from the proposals. However, I am concerned that the same analysis also shows that 3.2 million families—some current recipients and some future recipients—will financially lose as a result of this package. This estimate, however, does not include the impact of the £1 billion per year funding by 2029/30 for measures to support those with disabilities and long-term health conditions into employment, which are expected to mitigate the poverty impact among those it supports into work (and other measures the rising minimum wage).\nAs your Member of Parliament, your wellbeing is my utmost concern. While the benefits system must be fit for the future, any change must be proportionate and compassionate. I will work hard over the coming months to ensure that proportionality and compassion are at the heart of these new reforms.\nIf you require any more information about these changes or how you can contribute to the consultation, please do not hesitate to contact my office.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_01_25_sfp-update-potential-closure-of-braid-hills-road-drive-edinburgh/content_256.html": "Following my blog yesterday, the Council has now shared more details of their plans for Braid Hills Drive. A fifth option has also been introduced – “Bi-directional cycle lanes (north side) & road remains open. Similar layout to Option 1 with core section operating as bi-directional route”. Although the scheme is being proposed in an effort to “help pedestrians and cyclists travel and exercise safely while meeting physical distancing requirements“, the precise issue it is trying to address is not clear. Full details and plans below.\nExisting Layout\nBraid Hills Drive in the South of the city is a two-way single carriageway country road connecting Liberton Brae in the East and Comiston Road in the west. It is 3.3km long and the vast majority of it is fronted by the open grassy slopes of Braid Hills. At either end there are short stretches of residential streets. On the north side, overlooking the city is a 3.2m wide footway. On the south side there is no footway. The carriageway is severely cambered making the first 1.0 to 1.5m of either edge inappropriate for cycling.\nThere are no existing dedicated cycleways on Braid Hills Drive. No public buses use Braid Hills Drive.\nSummary of Proposal\nThis scheme is part of overall emergency measures in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, that re-designates key parts of the road network to help pedestrians and cyclists travel and exercise safely while meeting physical distancing requirements. It is proposed to improve the environment for cyclists in what is, at present, a car dominated layout. Carriageway space will potentially be reduced wherever possible and segregated cycle ways implemented with options to close sections of Braid Hills Drive / Road. The intended outcome of this is to provide safer spaces for local communities to exercise whilst social distancing as well as providing cycling connections to key local destinations.\nFive design options are now suggested:\n- Braid Hills Road / Drive remain open to vehicular traffic and segregated, unidirectional cycle lanes are provided. The segregated cycle lanes would be provided from the junction of Braid Road / Braid Hills Road to the junction of Liberton Road / Liberton Brae.\n- Provision of segregated, uni-directional cycle lanes from the junction of Braid Road / Braid Hills Road to a closure point just east of the junction with Braid Hills Avenue. A closure point will also exist at the junction of Braid Farm Road and Braid Hills Road. From here Braid Hills Road / Drive would remain closed until the junction with Liberton Tower Lane. East of this closure point a segregated, bi-directional cycle lane will be provided on the southern edge of the carriageway until the junction with Alwickhill Road and east of this, segregated, uni-directional cycle lanes will be provided until the junction with Liberton Brae.\n- A closure point will be situated on Braid Hills Road just east of the junction with Braid Hills Avenue. A closure point will also exist at the junction of Braid Farm Road and Braid Hills Road. From here Braid Hills Road / Drive will remain closed until the junction with Liberton Tower Lane. East of this closure point a segregated, bi-directional cycle lane will be provided on the southern edge of the carriageway until the junction with Alwickhill Road where the scheme will terminate.\n- As above closure points will be created at Braid Hills Road east of the junction with Braid Hills Avenue. A closure point will also exist at the junction of Braid Farm Road and Braid Hills Road. From here Braid Hills Road / Drive will remain closed until the junction with Liberton Tower Lane.\n- The fifth option is to introduce a bi-directional segregated cyclelane adjacent to the north kerbline over the majority of the route. In this option no road closure is necessary, however, entry and exit arrangements at each end are still to be determined.\nSubject to approval the detailed design would be considered at the Design Review Group, subject to Stakeholder Notification.\nPlans",

The School Estate Planning Team will begin an engagement process with\nthese schools and if statutory consultations are required, draft papers will be\npresented to a future Committee for consideration. “\nOf key interest to me here is inclusion of Firrhill High School as it serves a large part of my ward.\nFirrhill has a notional capacity of 1150, but currently has 1180 pupils enrolled and will rise to 1222 next year. Potentially a review of Firrhill’s catchment could conclude transferring one of the feeder primaries to another high school catchment would solve the problem.\nThe options for a transfer, however, are limited and we know from last year that school communities don’t always embrace attempts to tinker with catchments.\nThe elephant in the room with the Firrhill roll is Redford Barracks. This facility is scheduled to close in 2022 and it is likely at least some of the site will be redeveloped as housing over the following decade (on average every 100 houses generates 23 secondary school pupils). It’s therefore right to look seriously at Firrhill’s capacity.\nData published by the Council suggests that WHEC, Forrester & Tynecastle all have spare capacity to take part of Firrhill’s catchment. Forrester must be excluded, however, as future development in its catchment will consume much of its spare capacity. Nonetheless, by 2028 WHEC and Tynecastle combined will have spare capacity of 535. Indeed, Tynecastle or WHEC alone could easily accommodate Longstone pupils to help Firrhill return to its notional limit until the Redford development comes online.\nRunning in parallel to this Boroughmuir – a new school that was full the day it opened which now has an extension planned which will also be full the day it opens. Again, Tynecastle could take the pressure off Boroughmuir after its extension opens.\nUsing Tynecastle or WHEC in this way may not be popular, but it will save the Council money and help it meet its climate change targets (construction consumes a lot of energy). However, that may be balanced by increased travel costs and road safety issues.\nThe big uncertainty remains Redford Barracks – this may prove to be the catalyst for real change. There are only two real options to deal with this as far as I can see:\n- The creation of a new school to accommodate Buckstone, Pentland & Oxgangs Primaries. This would leave the existing Firrhill building to accommodate Colinton PS, Bonaly PS, Longstone PS & Redford Barracks. This would solve the problem at both Firrhill & Boroughmuir.\n- Converting Firrhill to a “super school” to accommodate Redford Barracks in addition to the existing catchment (and perhaps even Buckstone PS).\nAgain, these options would not be universally popular and both would need significant space (and funding). If only a building was nearby with a listed parade ground which could be converted to a fantastic school…\nConclusion\nI don’t have one. Whatever happens next, it is important that school communities are consulted and we have to respect the fact that school catchments have evolved over time to become an important part of what defines our neighbourhoods.",

The change means that they may no longer investigate every low level crime where there is no CCTV or witnesses. Clearly, underfunding by the Scottish Government is the issue here – Scotland needs change.\nBriefing\nI am writing to provide you with a local update on our Proportionate Response to Crime (PRC).\nAs you may be aware a 12-week project was piloted in the north east of the country between September and November 2023. Following full evaluation Police Scotland intends to roll out its Proportionate Response to Crime investigation process across the country. This will be carried out in phases with ongoing engagement and evaluation.\nThe project will go live in Edinburgh on 27th May 2024.\nUnder the process, every crime reported to us is assessed for threat, harm, risk, vulnerability and for proportionate lines of investigation and evidence as soon as it is reported.\nThis enables an efficient assessment of the report that helps us quickly respond to those that are most urgent and to reduce police attendance where this is not required.\nIt also means callers will be better informed about the progress of their report, rather than waiting days for officers to attend only to inform them of the same outcome.\nI am aware that the introduction of the process may raise some questions and I am happy to speak to you to explain how this will be applied in Edinburgh.\nI would also like to reassure you that this doesn’t mean we are not investigating crime – the process will give local officers more time to focus on local concerns, keeping people safe from harm, protecting the vulnerable, bringing criminals to justice, solving problems, and reducing offending.\nWe are asking people to continue to report crimes to us – all information is recorded and provided to us for assessment, and it can be used to tackle crime trends and emerging issues in the area.",

It really is clear, however, that the SNP are more concerned about using Brexit as an opportunity to agitate for IndyRef2 than contributing constructively to the debate.\nAnyone who has any doubts about this only need read Nationalist MP Tommy Sheppard’s opinion article in the Evening News (01/03/18). It appears he’s learned nothing from the defeat the SNP suffered in the 2017 snap election for using Brexit “project fear” to gain support for independence.\nMr Sheppard may well be right when he says “Brexit will, in time, be seen as possibly the greatest act of collective self-harm a country ever inflicted on itself”, but he needs to explain why he thinks independence will not be a greater folly.\nThe problem is that just as “euro-phobic” British Nationalists like Liam Fox and Nigel Farage want Brexit at any cost, some Scottish Nationalists want to leave the UK at any cost.\nThree and a half years after the “once in a lifetime” 2014 referendum on Scottish Independence, Tommy Sheppard and his chums still won’t answer the simplest questions on currency. Likewise, they won’t explain how Scotland would deal with its deficit or gain EU membership.\nLet’s be clear, they won’t answer these questions despite knowing the answers. Anyone who doubts the SNP is hiding the truth should ask themselves why not one single independent economic expert has concluded Scotland would be better off outside the UK.\nSo let’s unite to ensure we get a Brexit deal that protects livelihoods, but please don’t pretend that Scotland leaving the UK will be anything more than jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_08_07_comsiton-farmhouse-sale-3rd-time-lucky/content_268.html": "Next week the Council will try for a third time to sell Comsiton Farmhouse (83 Pentland View, Edinburgh EH10 6PT). This saga began well before I was elected, but I hope this time it will happen and the future of this local landmark will be secured.\nA number of bids were received, with “Burgh Developments” coming out on top with a bid of £1,350,000. They propose to retain the main farmhouse building and convert it into 3 flats. In addition, 6 mews style properties will be developed in the grounds to the rear (see plan). All this would be subject to planning permission.\nThe 5th ranked bid was for £1,001,001 and this came from – Cohousing in Southern Scotland (CHOISS). This group, which has some local support, proposed that the Farmhouse will be developed into “communal accommodation consisting of living/dining areas, kitchen and visitors’ bedrooms”. To the rear a main accommodation block would be developed in a range of accommodation and sizes with around ten dwellings envisaged.\nThe Council say – “The offer submitted by CHOISS is subject to a number of conditions, including potential deductions for adverse ground conditions, including if a culvert needs relocated (£150,000) and the condition of the farmhouse. In addition, the offer is subject to funding. The offer is therefore subject to a degree of risk whereby the headline price could be reduced further as the conditions are purified. These risks are greater when compared to Bid 1, which does not propose deductions for abnormal costs nor is it subject to funding.”\nI am open to the CHOISS bid, *BUT* I would have to be assured that the total benefits it provides exceed that of Burgh Developments and that they have a firm timeline for progressing the development. So far this is not clear, so I feel the Committee should support a sale to Burgh Developments. I think this is the quickest are surest way of bringing the site back into use.\nCHOISS’s offer does, however, have value and I am hopeful they can learn from this and find an alternative property to progress their plans.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_09_16_how-roads-maintenance-is-prioritised-in-edinburgh_comment-page-1/content_161.html": "I receive a lot of enquiries from constituents asking about how roads maintenance is prioritised and what methods are used. The text below is a briefing from Council Officers on the matter.\nRoads Asset Management\nThe Roads Asset Management Plan (RAMP) is an integral part of the new investment strategy for carriageways and footways. It will be used to balance the long-term capital renewal needs for our network, with the short term need for revenue repair road works, in order to keep the city’s roads well maintained.\nThe RAMP will drive the improvement programme for all aspects of management of the carriageway and footway network including:\n- Developing knowledge of new materials and maintenance techniques;• Suitability for use on Edinburgh’s network;\n- Benchmarking against other local authorities to identify improvements to current practices;\n- Targeting investment to ensure best value and improved lifecycles; and,\n- Critically reviewing the performance of current and future investment.\nCarriageway and Footway Investment Strategy\nThe condition of Edinburgh’s roads is assessed annually as part of the Scottish Roads Maintenance Condition Survey (SRMCS), an independent survey of road conditions in all 32 Scottish local authorities. The survey provides each local authority with a Road Condition Index (RCI) which identifies the percentage of roads that should be considered for investment. Edinburgh’s most recent RCI is 34.6%, based on the SRMCS from 2015/16, placing Edinburgh 16th out of the 32 Scottish local authorities.\nIn 2005/06 capital investment in roads increased from just over £3m per annum to over £16m, increasing to £20m in 2008/09 and to 24.5m in 2013/14. Although the increase in the capital budget saw a significant initial improvement in the condition of Edinburgh’s roads, performance has remained fairly static for the last 6 years, despite sustained levels of investment.\nThe RCI consists of three categories of deterioration: Red, Amber 1 and Amber 2, with roads in the red category being in the worst condition. Up to 2015/16, the majority of carriageways prioritised for investment fell within the red category. Treating the Red category roads only resulted in a small number of carriageway resurfacing or strengthening schemes being carried out each year, due to the cost of these treatments.\nAs part of the development of the Roads Asset Management Plan (RAMP), analysis was carried out on the impact on Edinburgh’s RCI if the Council had continued with the existing approach to roads capital investment. The chart below shows the effect of the previous investment strategy on the percentage of Edinburgh roads falling into the red and amber categories of deterioration (i.e. in need of maintenance investment), over a 20-year period, assuming that capital investment remained at 2015/16 levels. By year 20, the percentage of roads requiring maintenance would increase from just under 35% to nearly 60% while the percentage that fell into the red category rises from 5% to over 10%.\nDespite the relatively high levels of capital investment, there would have been insufficient resource to treat all the roads in the red category. Furthermore, because investment was Localities ‘Surface Enhancement’ works) there was almost no investment going into treating roads in the amber categories, which over time will continue to deteriorate and eventually slip into the red condition category.\nConsequently, modelling work was carried out using the Roads Assent Management Plan, in order to create an investment strategy that would improve the condition of Edinburgh’s carriageway and footway network.\nAs part of this modelling work for the RAMP, alternative scenarios for capital investment were developed. These scenarios were predicated on a more preventative approach aimed at roads that are in the amber condition categories. Investment interventions on these roads require less expensive treatments (e.g. surface dressing, slurry sealing) which improve the condition of the carriageway or footway, extend the design life before resurfacing, strengthening or reconstruction is required. Due to the lower cost of the treatments required on amber condition roads, more can be treated each year. Roads in the red category will continue to be treated each financial year but fewer than in previous years. Once deterioration has reduced throughout the network, more investment can then be diverted back to red category roads. The chart below illustrates the impact of this preventative approach over 20 years, assuming levels of capital investment remain at current levels.\nTreatment Types\nAs part of the work carried out on the investment strategy, surfacing treatments were re-introduced in Edinburgh, treating roads in the amber categories, and local footways in 2016/17. These treatments are currently used throughout Scotland.\nSurface Dressing\nSurface dressing is a process that provides added protection to the carriageway surface, sealing it from the ingress of water while also enhancing its skid resistance. It is a preventative treatment and can extend the useful life of a road by around 10-15 years.The process entails spraying the road with bitumen and covering it with stone chippings. The dressing is then rolled, which together with the actions of slow moving traffic, embeds the stone chips into the surface.\nMicro Asphalt\nMicro Asphalt (also referred to as ‘micro surfacing’, ‘micro’ or ‘thin surfacing’) is a surface treatment for roads; one which is laid over the top of the existing surface to seal and protect it. It consists of a water- based mix of stones and bitumen which is spread over the existing surface by a special machine. It is a preventative treatment and can extend the useful life of a road by around 10-15 years.It can be used when surface dressing is not suitable. It reduces road noise and can rapidly transform a road with extensive patching and utilities reinstatements into one with minimum surface irregularities.\nFootway Slurry Sealing\nSlurry sealing is used to repair imperfections and to seal footway surfaces from the ingress of water to the underlying foundations. It is a preventative treatment which is to be used to extend the useful life of a footway, thereby delaying more significant and costly treatments. It is a semi self-levelling system and is spread by hand using squeegees on top of the existing footway surface. It is expected to provide an even and consistent surface free from trip hazards. It is a preventative treatment and can extend the useful life of a footway by around 7-10 years.Slurry sealing is generally laid to a nominal depth of 6mm but it can also be laid up to 10mm thick where undulations in the existing surface are more pronounced. The process is substantially faster than traditional footway surfacing methods, thus reducing the disruptive impact on residents and businesses.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2024_08_28_west-approach-road-closure/content_9.html": "Below is an update from the City of Edinburgh Council on works planned on the West Approach Road.\nI would like to inform you of important upcoming works on the West Approach Road, which is a continuation of the closures through May and July. It will necessitate a series of phased closures throughout September. These closures are essential to facilitate critical repairs, maintenance remedials and strengthening works on the bridges along the route. This work is vital to ensure the long-term safety and durability of the infrastructure.\nThe closures will take place as follows:\n1. Eastbound Closure:\nFrom Monday, 2nd September 2024 to Friday, 13th September 2024. During this period, the eastbound lane of the West Approach Road will be closed to traffic. Westbound lane will remain open.\n2. Westbound Closure:\nFrom Saturday, 14th September 2024 to Saturday, 21st September 2024. Following the completion of eastbound repairs, the westbound lane will be closed while eastbound lane remains operational.\n3. Full Closure:\nFrom Monday, 23rd September 2024 to Saturday, 28th September 2024. To complete the final stage of these essential works, the entire West Approach Road will be closed to all traffic. Additionally, we will have nightshift lane closures during this period on Dalry Road below as we carry out essential strengthening of Dalry Road Bridge.\n4. Off Dundee Street Bridge Closure.\nFrom Monday, 2nd September 2024 to Monday, 30th September 2024.Within this period, we will be carrying out essential work to the bridge.\nDuring previous phases of works, additional necessary strengthening was discovered, and some of the original scope had to be postponed. These latest closures are to continue this work, which consists of further steelwork strengthening, new waterproofing, grit blasting and painting, graffiti removal, rebuilding displaced masonry and new expansion joints.\nWe will also explore the possibility of resurfacing the carriageway along the West Approach Road, subject to the contractor’s ability to coordinate this with the ongoing infrastructure works. Whilst we are keen to take advantage of this opportunity and appreciate its importance, this may not be feasible within the current project timelines.\nThese are expected to be the final closures for now, however we are awaiting an additional weekend possession of the railway at Russell Road – likely next year – and this will likely include a corresponding restriction on the West Approach Road for that weekend.\nWe as a team are committed to minimising disruption as much as possible, and we appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this time. Diversion routes and TTRN information are provided (below) above for each closure phase to assist road users in planning their journeys.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_07_24_briefing-public-safety-improvements-at-junction-of-liberton-brae-kirk-brae-liberton-road-mayfield-road-and-blackford-glen-road_comment-page-1/content_554.html": "Below is a really useful update from Council Officers on public safety improvements at the junction of Liberton Brae, Kirk Brae, Liberton Road, Mayfield Road and Blackford Glen Road.\nBackground and Context\nThis junction is located on the busy A701 corridor and during the am and pm peak periods (particularly am) it is extremely busy with vehicular traffic, to the extent the junction is operating over-capacity, resulting in peak period vehicular delays. Due to the location of the junction and the make-up of the surrounding area, the pedestrian activity is minimal (see below for results of recent pedestrian surveys).\nBelow are some background facts on the existing junction: –\n- The junction was fully refurbished circa 2000. As part of this refurbishment, “walk with traffic” pedestrian phases were provided across Liberton Brae and Liberton Road. Prior to this refurbishment, no pedestrian facilities were available. The pedestrian phase across Liberton Brae shows a green man when Kirk Brae traffic is showing a green to vehicles as there is a banned left turn in place on Kirk Brae allowing this to happen. Similarly, the Liberton Road pedestrian phase appears when Mayfield Rd traffic is running as there is a banned left turn for Mayfield Rd traffic\n- During this refurbishment, a ramp was constructed at the top of Mayfield Road (as the footway doesn’t continue around the corner) allowing pedestrians access to the Liberton Road crossing.\n- As this junction is around 20 years old, it is unlikely to be refurbished for another 10 years or so. There are many traffic signal junctions throughout the City, with significantly older infrastructure and some have no pedestrian facilities whatsoever.\n- During the above-mentioned refurbishment, investigations were carried-out to determine if staggered crossings could be installed at the top of Mayfield Rd and bottom of Kirk Brae. However, due to the need to relocate existing services (fibre optic) at the foot of Kirk Brae the costs proved prohibitive at that time.\n- Due to this junction being on a strategic route and after extensive modelling, there is no scope to install an “all stop” pedestrian stage. Nonetheless, installing islands on Mayfield Rd and Kirk Brae, to allow a staggered crossing movement, would be feasible. Blackford Glen Road would have to remain un-signalled (no pedestrian phase) as there is no way to incorporate a pedestrian phase at this crossing point without stopping all traffic. The large footway area at the bottom of Kirk Brae could be reduced in size to gain the extra width required to install a staggered island and Mayfield Rd may be wide enough already as there is currently only one large lane marked, although vehicles sometimes queue in two lanes. The gradients at the top of Mayfield Rd could prove difficult to deal with and would require further investigation to determine what engineering measures would be required.\n- Cycle early starts were introduced around 18 – 24 months ago. Their installation necessitated an overall reduction in vehicle green time of around 12 seconds. This generated larger queues in the AM peak and led to several complaints. This is an example of how over-saturated this junction is (in terms of peak traffic flows) and testament as to why an all-stop pedestrian stage (necessitating roughly 25 seconds of loss time to vehicles) would not work.\n- Estimated cost to refurbish this junction, with staggered pedestrian crossings across Kirk Brae and Mayfield Rd, is c. £450k.\nExisting Junction – Facilities for Pedestrians and Cyclists\nThe junction has five approaches:\n- A701 Liberton Brae – three traffic lanes – single stage signalised pedestrian crossing phase incorporated into junction signals – main arterial traffic route.\n- Blackford Glen road – two traffic lanes – no pedestrian crossing facilities – lightly trafficked, no through road.\n- – marked as two traffic lanes but often functions as three– no signalised pedestrian crossing facilities but refuge island in place at crossing point.\n- A701 Liberton Road – three traffic lanes – single stage signalised pedestrian crossing phase incorporated into junction signals – main arterial traffic route.\n- Kirk Brae – two traffic lanes – no pedestrian crossing facilities.\nGoogle Streetview images of the junction are below.\nThere are Advanced Stop Lines for cyclists in place at all junction approaches. However, the junction is not ideal for cyclists, due to its large overall size, unusual layout and some fairly steep uphill slopes i.e. when heading southeast on the Mayfield Road entry and Kirk Brae exit and south on the Liberton Brae exit. These slopes mean cyclists are travelling more slowly, increasing the risk of conflict with vehicles.\nThe Active Travel team has previously investigated the possibility of improving the junction layout to assist cyclists but concluded that this would only be possible if the junction were to be fundamentally reconfigured, at significant cost. Given other competing calls for investment in Active Travel improvements, it was considered that this could not currently be prioritised. Early release signals phases for cyclists were, however, introduced at the junction around 18 months ago.\nExisting Junction – Traffic Signals Operation\nThe traffic signals operate the following stage sequence: –\n- Stage 1 Liberton Brae and Liberton Rd (green for vehicles)\n- Stage 2 Mayfield Rd (green for vehicles) Green man across Liberton Road\n- Stage 3 Kirk Brae (green for vehicles) Green man across Liberton Brae\n- Stage 4 Blackford Glen Rd (green for vehicles)\nStages one, two and three are preceded by a three seconds cycle early start signal, there is no cycle early start for Blackford Glen Rd.\nThere are currently no controlled pedestrian crossings across Mayfield Road, Kirkbrae or Blackford Glen Road.\nThe traffic signals mode of operation is fixed time during the weekday AM peak between 07:00 and 09:30, running a cycle time of 120 seconds.\nAt all other times apart from the weekday AM peak, the junction runs vehicle actuated (VA) mode, responding to the traffic demands as required.\nRoad Safety – Collisions\nThe Road Safety team has undertaken a Collision Retrieval covering a distance of 75m in each direction from the notional centre point of the junction. This captured the whole of the junction itself and the approach to each of the junction STOP lines.\nThe Council uses a three-year period for investigating collision data as part of its established Accident Investigation and Prevention (AIP) protocol. If there are three or more similar collisions within that period, the location will be given consideration for an appropriate intervention. However, for the purpose of this investigation, a five-year search period has been used.\nIt is important to recognise that the Council only holds details of personal injury collisions supplied by Police Scotland, which is responsible for the collection of all personal injury road traffic collision data within its force area. No data is available on collisions that do not involve personal injury (often described as ‘damage only’) or incidents described as “near misses”; as these types of incident do not have to be reported to the Police (or to anyone else) there is no way of collecting comprehensive data. In addition, what constitutes a near miss is open to interpretation and any data would therefore be subjective.\nUsing the latest vetted data set, which is currently to the end of December 2019, there were three personal injury collisions recorded in the five-year period investigated. The locations of these collisions are shown in Image 7, with each collision represented by a green mark.\nSummary details of these collisions are as follows:\n- The three collisions resulted in four slight casualties.\n- None of the collisions involved Vulnerable Road Users (pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists) or anyone crossing the road.\n- Each collision occurred at a different part of the junction.\n- Collision 1 – a car collided with an unattended parked car in Mayfield Road.\n- Collision 2- a car stopped unexpectedly while travelling east – west through the junction, when the driver mistakenly reacted to a red light which did not apply to their direction of travel, resulting in following vehicles collided with each other and then it.\n- Collision 3 – a driver approaching a red light in Kirk Brae failed to react and stop in time and collided with the rear of a vehicle already waiting in the queue, pushing it into the rear of another vehicle, which was then pushed into the rear of a fourth vehicle.\nThere is no pattern to these collisions that would initiate a road safety intervention as part of the Council’s AIP process.\nRoad Safety – Speeds\nThe speed limit on Liberton Brae, Mayfield Road, Liberton Road and Kirk Brae is 30mph. There are no current plans for permanent reductions in the speed limit on any of these roads. Blackford Glen Road has a long established 20mph speed limit in place.\nThe Road Safety team undertakes bi-annual batches of traffic surveys at locations where speeding concerns have been raised. Traffic data allows us to direct our resources to the locations where there is significant speed limit non-compliance. Recent traffic surveys have been undertaken at the following locations:\n- Liberton Brae, between Alnwickhill Road and Orchardhead Road, from 26 March to 1 April 2019. A free flow average speed of 28.5mph was recorded.\n- Kirk Brae, between Orchardhead Road and Claverhouse Drive, from 29 March to 4 April 2019. A free flow average speed of 29.7mph was recorded.\nBoth of these traffic survey results are within normal tolerance for a posted 30mph speed limit.\nRoad Safety – Pedestrian Crossing Improvements Programme\nThe Road Safety team manages the Council’s ongoing programme of pedestrian crossing improvements. This delivers stand-alone crossing improvements, such as signalised puffin crossings and unsignalized zebra crossings, refuge islands and pavement build-outs. A formal assessment and prioritisation system is used to evaluate locations and the crossing type most suitable for each location. This system was approved by the Council’s Transport, Infrastructure and Environment Committee on 28 July 2009. The programme does not deliver new signalised junctions or upgrades to existing junctions.\nThe base data which is used to assess if a location is suitable for a crossing is known as the PV2 value. This is a nationally recognised value that indicates the number of passing vehicles and crossing pedestrians. Pedestrian and vehicle counts are taken over the peak hours of a week day, from 7am to 10am and 3pm to 6pm, and avoiding school holidays or any other factors which might cause an abnormal result.\nThis base PV2 value is then adjusted to take account of local factors such as the age of those crossing, the composition and speed of passing traffic, the road width, the number of pedestrian accidents and the presence of nearby trip attractors such as schools, doctors’ surgeries, shops etc.\nA location with an adjusted PV2 value of 1 or higher (2 or higher on a dual carriageway) would be considered for a puffin crossing, locations with a value of 0.3 or higher would be considered for a suite of measures that includes a zebra crossing, refuge island or pavement build-outs. If a very low PV2 value is achieved, no additional crossing facilities may be recommended.\nWithin the last three years, pedestrian crossing assessments have been undertaken at the following locations:\n- Mayfield Road, approximately 100m north of the Liberton Brae junction, on 20 March 2018. An adjusted PV2 value of 0.216 was measured.\n- Liberton Brae, at the junction with Orchardhead Road and Tower Mains, on 20 March 2018. An adjusted PV2 value of 0.448 was measured.\n- Kirk Brae, at Double Hedges Road, on 29 May 2019. An adjusted PV2 value of 0.026 was measured.\nThe locations surveyed on Mayfield Road and Kirk Brae did not therefore meet the required criteria for a pedestrian crossing facility. It is, however, proposed to provide a non-signalised crossing improvement, such as a zebra crossing, refuge island or pavement build-outs on Liberton Brae, at Orchardhead Road and Tower Mains. Further investigations will be undertaken to determine which would be the most appropriate option at this location. It is currently anticipated that this pedestrian crossing improvement will be delivered within the 2022/23 financial year.\nThere is currently budget and staff resource capacity to progress between 10 and 15 crossing improvements concurrently, at an annual cost of around £200-250k. The total budget available for the various road safety initiatives delivered throughout the city, including the crossing improvements programme, varies from year to year but is generally around £600-700k.\nAn update to the programme will be reported to the Policy and Sustainability Committee on 6 August and the updated programme will contain proposed improvements at 75 locations, representing a full work programme through to financial year 2024/25.\nProvision of New Pedestrian Crossing Facilities\nEstablished Council policy is to install signalised pedestrian crossing facilities at new signalised junctions, on all legs where there is a demand for pedestrians to cross. In the past there has been a programme of work, with an identified budget, to retrofit pedestrian facilities at existing signalised junctions where they were missing. However, this programme and budget were discontinued some years ago and this type of improvement is now only generally undertaken when junctions are being upgraded, either as part of a wider project or as part of the Traffic Signals team’s ongoing programme of traffic signals refurbishment work.\nSpaces for People Programme\nAs part of the Spaces for People (SfP) programme, it is proposed to introduce temporary enhanced bus lane and cycle segregation provision along the A701 Liberton Road/Craigmillar Park/Mayfield Gardens corridor, commencing just north of this junction.\nThe junction is one of the top 20 locations identified by feedback submitted via Commonplace as a barrier to walking. The SfP team still in the process of analysing the issues raised at each of these locations and considering whether there is a feasible and affordable intervention can be undertaken. It is hoped to have this shortlisting work completed and to produce a list of publicly generated schemes within two weeks There is, however, no current plan to take a temporary pedestrian enhancement forward at this junction as part of the SfP programme.\nGoogle Streetview Images",

My political group is adamant that if the farm has a future the Council should do what it can to support it and that the Ward Councillors (with their excellent connections to the local Community) should lead on it. Councillor Donald Wilson from my group was clear that he is far from giving up hope on the future of the farm.\nThe organisation has been in receipt of a grant from Communities and Families (2016-19 Grant programme, extended to March 2020) with an annual value of £109,214 paid in quarterly instalments (the last payment will be due in early January 2020).\nThe organisation rents the land from the Council and the costs of the lease were agreed at Finance and Resources Committee on 23rd March 2017. The land is not for sale.\nThe Farm first made Council Officers aware of their situation in a telephone call on 31st October and on 1st November an Insolvency Practitioner was appointed. Council officers have had an initial conversation with the practitioner (4th November) and below are the key points from that conversation.\n- The board at Gorgie City Farm made the decision to seek an insolvency practitioner because the cash in the bank was not sufficient to meet their ongoing costs.\n- The role of the practitioner will be to ensure the proper winding up of the company.\n- The costs of continuing to employ staff to keep the Farm trading/open was too great and so the Farm is now closed to the public, however there is cover to ensure the livestock are cared for.\n- The Insolvency practitioner is confident that all the animals will be re-homed. There have been numerous offers to take the animals.\n- The assets of the company are being secured to ensure the farm is in as strong a position as possible to move forward if it can.\n- There have been some offers of interest in running the farm/using the property from a number of parties, however it is too early for the practitioner to assess the full merits of these approaches and it is intended that this would be done in partnership with the Council as the landowner.\n- A further role of the practitioner is to ascertain how the company got into this position.\n- The Council Leader, Deputy Leader and officers are meeting the Insolvency Practitioner this week. Thereafter, the Council will convene a meeting later this week to discuss the way forward.",

I received this response when I asked the SfP Project Manager for a firm timeline:\nFollowing the Committee decision and amendment we have the following actions to progress:\n- Review proposed design options for south bound reopening of Braid Road and consideration of measures in the Cluny and Midmar area to mitigate the reintroduction of traffic. (Ongoing)\n- Continue dialogue with Lothian Buses regarding journey times on Comiston Road (last report 18/2/21 noting no current delays).\n- Arrange Stakeholders workshop to discuss and agree a design layout and appropriate local traffic mitigation options.\n- Seek final approval from our Corporate Incident Management team.\n- Rescind existing TTRO and draft up revised Temporary Traffic Regulation Notice (and subsequent Order).\n- Revise road layout(s) and reopen Braid Road.\nIn terms of a timeline we are reviewing our design options next week and expect to arrange the stakeholder workshop in the next couple of weeks. We should be able, resource permitting, to reopen Braid Road (in a southbound direction) before the end of March 2021.\nPrimary School Spaces for People Schemes – Bonaly, Buckstone and Pentland Primary Schools\nPeople living around these schools have received letters earlier this week saying these schemes will go ahead. I complained about this as the consultation reports had not yet been circulated. The reports are below.\nNote – The Pentland PS report says they did no receive any comments from me. In fact, I made this comment:\nI have only had a modest level of feedback on these plans from local people and the school community. The common theme from the responses is the lack of consideration given to the Oxgangs Bank entrance which is widely seen as the busiest point on the School. Can the SfP team work with residents and parents on this?\nIn terms of accessibility, many disabled people depend on cars (both to drive and as a passenger) and taxis. Road changes shouldn’t prevent disabled people from being able to stop near the school. Changes to usual travel patterns can add to anxiety for all of us, but to some disabled people in particular. The scheme should therefore be seen in this context – continual changes should therefore be avoided where possible, and should be effectively communicated to the public (including disabled people).",

Additionally, I have asked again if a copy of the Road Safety Audit be made available to Councillors.\n06.08.20 Update 1 – The Council have not yet provided the Road Safety Audit but they have forwarded the “Designers Risk Assessment for this project”. Please let me know if you want any risks added:\n06.08.20 Update 2 – The Council have agreed to my request that Community Councils attend the meeting, but have refused to let local residents contribute: “It was agreed at an early stage that the SfP programme would not be subject to the normal consultation processes and instead would focus on expedited engagement with Stakeholders – including ward Cllrs and other key groups such as Community Councils. Residents are not invited to attend the meeting.”\n06.08.20 Update 3 – The Council have confirmed there is little scope to change the plans: “…the intention of the meeting is to answer questions on the project. The project designs have been amended in several locations following the notifications process, mostly to increase the amount of available on street parking and also to reduce the speed limit from 40mph to 30mph.”\nBriefing\nPlease accept this invitation to a Microsoft Teams meeting to discuss the Comiston Road Spaces for People project.\nAs you are aware this project was approved by the Council’s CIMT for delivery on the 17th of July. Following approval for delivery we have been working on appointing a contractor for Phase 1 of this scheme which will involve lining and ‘Orange Cylinders’ in advance of full delivery later in Autumn.\nThis project is due to commence on site on Thursday 13 August and will be the second to be delivered from the ‘Travelling Safely’ section of Spaces for People, following Ferry Road which commenced on site on Monday 3August.\nWe are aware of various queries and concerns which have been raised by local councillors and residents regarding this project. The aim of this meeting will be to answer questions on the project proposals, and outline the anticipated project programme moving forward.\nFor ease I have attached the post CIMT Notification Letter for this project, which includes the approval form. You can also find the designs for Phase 1, and Phase 2 at the links below.\nWe hope that you are able to join us and that you find this meeting interesting and useful.\nPhase 1 – Commencing Thursday 13th Aug\nPhase 2 – Commencing later in Autumn\nThanks a lot, we look forward to speaking with you soon.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_09_18_motion-by-councillor-neil-ross-quiet-route-from-greenbank-to-the-meadows/content_393.html": "There is a bit of confusion regarding the motion to “Reopen Braid Road” at Full-Council on Thursday (17th September). Firstly, there was no such motion. Councillor Neil Ross (Lib Dem) tabled a motion on the “Quiet Route from Greenbank to the Meadows”. This asked for a consultation to be undertaken on a proposed quiet route for cyclists, and for consideration to be given to prioritising “future road re-surfacing of Braidburn Terrace, the Braid Avenue/Cluny Gardens crossroads” as well as “sections of Canaan Lane and Cluny Drive”. It also suggested that the Council should consider introducing “traffic calming measures along the length of Hermitage Drive and Midmar Drive”.\nTo be clear, nobody has ever contacted me suggesting these changes were needed. The people that do contact me tend to want roads in my Ward prioritised for investment, rather than those elsewhere.\nThe Lib-Dem motion also asked for the reopening Braid Road to be consulted upon. The Tories amended that section to call for a temporary reopening of the road whilst a three month(!) consultation got underway. I want a permanent decision reached on Braid Road ASAP. I don’t see the point in prolonging the uncertainty for months and then waiting on a report.\nBehind the scenes, I was lobbying for the October 1st Transport Committee to be used to:1. Provide an update on the future of Braid Road, including the option to reopen it; and,2. That local people get a greater say on the future of Braid Road.\nI was given written assurances that if I raised these points in the debate, I would be given a “constructive response” from the Transport Convener. Sadly that did not happen.\nI therefore did not support the Council Admistration’s position (essentially a report in November with no guarantee reopening Braid Road would even be an option), but could not support the Tory suggestion of a “temporary reopening” and taking money (perhaps over £1m) from elsewhere in the city to resurface roads and introduce traffic calming measures that nobody has made the case to me for.\nThe issue here is not really Braid Road, it’s the failure of the Council to listen to people. A complicating factor is the polarised debate, with too many Councillors unwilling to admit there is any problem with their approach. We received an update on the scheme yesterday (a draft report for the Oct Transport Committee) – Tories raised no concerns about Braid Rd. Lib-Dems did not show up. I am sure to would have been different if the meeting was webcast!\nUnlike most of the seven Cllrs representing Fairmilehead / Comiston / Morningside, I actually live in my Ward (in Buckstone to be specific) so I understand the local situation. I have been working with Ian Murray MP & Daniel Johnson MSP on this, and I feel I have done more than any local Councillor to stand up for local people every single day (not just in Council meetings). This is evidenced on my blog and my Facebook pages which have been reaching thousands of people on this issue. The motion text is below\nThe video of the debate can be seen here and my contribution is here.\nThe Motion\nCouncil:\nNotes the proposal for a Quiet Route from Greenbank to the Meadows involving six road closures in Morningside.\nNotes the proposal has been made without notifying any residents living on or near the proposed route or permitting residents the opportunity to express their views on the proposals, either positive or negative, by way of public consultation.\nNotes the proposal claims to tackle rat-running traffic but does not address speeding traffic on Hermitage Drive or Midmar Drive.\nNotes the proposal includes two options for Braid Road, either to remain closed or to re-open for southbound traffic only.\nNotes that the Council is proposing to implement the scheme by means of a Temporary Traffic Regulation Order despite the fact that there is no evidence that local residents and users of the route have any difficulties meeting the social distancing rules on this route.\nNotes that the Council’s Commonplace online ideas tool collected twice as much support for protected cycle lanes on Whitehouse Loan than for closing that road to motor vehicles.\nNotes the condition of the road surface on the proposed route, apart from Whitehouse Loan, is generally poor, especially on Canaan Lane, Cluny Drive, Braidburn Terrace and at the Braid Avenue/Cluny Gardens crossroads.\nBelieves that the level of danger of the transmission of Covid-19 infection between cyclists and other road users on the proposed route is so low that it does not justify using the Council’s emergency powers to implement this scheme.\nBelieves that local residents should be allowed to express their views on traffic management and road use proposals in their communities and that their views should be taken into account before a decision is made on whether to implement such proposals.\nTherefore proposes that the implementation of the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route using a temporary traffic regulation order should be paused and\ninstructs officers to hold an informal public consultation in the next three months with residents living on or near the proposed route and the school communities of James Gillespie’s High School and Primary School and NHS Lothian to identify levels of local support for:\nThe Tories changed the above paragraph to: Instructs officers to hold an informal public consultation in the next three months with residents living on or near the proposed route, relevant school communities in Wards 8 & Ward 10 including James Gillespie’s High School and Primary School and NHS Lothian to identify levels of local support for:\n- the existing proposals for a Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route; and\n- an alternative proposal for the same route, not involving road closures, to:\n- to gather any other practical suggestions from local residents with regard to this route that can be managed within existing budgets; and\n- prioritise future road re-surfacing of Braidburn Terrace, the Braid Avenue/Cluny Gardens crossroads and the relevant sections of Canaan Lane and Cluny Drive that are part of the route; and\n- introduce traffic calming measures along the length of Hermitage Drive and Midmar Drive;and\n- re-open Braid Road and use the time available before re-opening to re-surface the sections that are in poor condition and to install appropriate traffic calming measures, such as raising the road surface at road intersections and installing a pedestrian and cycle crossing near the entrance to the Hermitage and a chicane at the corner below the hotel.\n- The Tories changed the above to: Permanent re-opening of Braid Road including resurfacing, installation of appropriate traffic calming measures such as virtual speed humps, raising the road surface at road intersections, installing a pedestrian and cycle crossing near the entrance to the Hermitage and a chicane at the corner below the hotel, with Braid Road to be temporarily re-opened in both directions pending commencement and evaluation of the consultation in order to alleviate immediate concerns around traffic displacement and pollution.\n- to gather any other practical suggestions from local residents with regard to this route that can be managed within existing budgets; and\n- to draw up a report to the Transport and Environment Committee to present the results of the informal public consultation for consideration and further action.”\nCouncil Administration Amendment\nDeletes all (of the Lib-Dem Motion and replaces it with):\nNotes that a proposal for a Quiet Route between Greenbank Crossroads and the Meadows, designed to establish a network of safe quiet streets using modal filters and to provide a safe cycleway from Fairmilehead to the city centre, will come forward to the Transport and Environment Committee on Nov 12th.\nNotes that some of this proposal builds on suggestions from local community group ‘Blackford Safer Streets’.\nNotes that stakeholder engagement has not yet begun ahead of the report on November 12th.\nRecognises that there is considerable concern circulating in communities about the consultation process for Spaces for People projects already agreed to by this Council.\nNotes that the agreed process includes a feedback mechanism for each project on issues raised by stakeholders, including community councils and elected ward members, as well as the stated intention to amend schemes post-implementation if appropriate (‘try and modify’ method).\nRequests a meeting among all relevant ward councillors and transport spokespersons, convened by the Transport Convener, before Oct 3 to allow questions to be raised and for a comprehensive briefing on these proposals to be provided, including clarification on community consultation.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_09_28_update-on-the-death-at-fairmilehead-crossroads_comment-page-1/content_758.html": "A report in the Evening News today suggests the tragic death at Fairmilehead crossroads on Thursday may be linked to an incident of so called “road rage”. I am sure everyone’s thoughts are with the family of the man that died.\nI’d like to thank the emergency services for dealing with the incident. Spacial thanks must also go to those that attempted CPR to give the man the best possible chance of recovering.\nI spoke to the reporter behind the article and I know he was surprised by some of the driving he witnessed in the area and the strength of feeling locally on the issue. Some of the comments I received in the 2-3 days after the incident:\n…traffic congestion has increased alarmingly over the year from The Charwood Restaurant to the lights at Fairmilehead Crossroads…\n… Because West to South (Biggar Road) cars are accelerating towards the junction, on a downward slope and turning towards the oncoming traffic it is surprising we don’t have more serious accidents…\n… Nearly every single day there are multiple near misses (and some not missed!) with horns blaring and brakes screeching and heated shouting matches…\n…My kids take their life in their hands every day crossing Biggar Road near the bypass, when they get off the number 4 bus. Cars coming off the bypass accelerate crazily up that stretch…\n…My son is 11 and should be independently walking to school, but the road is too busy/unsafe…\n…There’s no proper filters on these lights. I have to turn right every morning and the amount of angry people, despite you have your indicator on speed in front of the cars in the other lane. Cars blocking other cars in the morning and the speed of cars in this area is appalling…\n…I have personally witnessed appalling driving in this area and also across the city…\n…I really feel for the family of the man who died. It is very surprising that there are not more accidents at this junction…\n…It’s very sad to hear that there was a death – and though it may not have been due to the traffic, it is only a matter of time. I have been going on about the speed limit on that road for years… …The First Minister has declared a climate emergency – we should be making all travel easier for pedestrians, cyclists and public transport and not motorists…\n…there is a right filter at the crossroads for traffic citybound but the other two lanes are also on green. This means that anyone waiting to turn right coming from the city has to gauge when the lights have turned to red for the citybound vehicles. Any driver who is a visitor turning right from the city can be tempted to swing out when they see their set of lights turn to red, right across the oncoming traffic…\n…I agree entirely with you that the speed limit should be reduced to 30, and be in force at Hillend…\n…One issue that concerns me (and I am not a local resident) is the mismatch between some of the time scales (eg new lights) and the seriousness of the residents’ comments…\n…I agree lower speed limits would help with safety and also support more sustainable active travel options. The main issue is however the sheer volume of traffic. Stand at that junction in the morning and or early evening and witness the ridiculous number of single occupancy cars…\n…One issue that concerns me (and I am not a local resident) is the mismatch between some of the time scales (eg new lights) and the seriousness of the residents’ comments…\n…Going north, folk are often coming from the bypass – so their brains are still going at speed – and having two (going into three) lanes does nothing to encourage them to slow down. Then people are elbowing past each other to get through the junction: more often than not, people are cutting up the left lane to go straight on and get ahead of those in the middle lane. The driving is often very aggressive coming up to that junction. Even in the car I feel unsafe there…\n…I have long avoided this junction because there is no right turn filter going into Oxgangs Road and because you are blinded by headlights as the traffic comes up from the by pass to the cross roads…\n…I would also like to add a comment about the traffic situation. The bus stop at the foot of Biggar Road requires us to cross the road to get to our home at Swanston Drive. At certain periods of the day particularly this is now simply dangerous. The cars coming off the bypass often accelerate up towards the lights at Fairmilehead whilst the cars approaching the bypass speed down the Biggar Road. Lots of dodging of cars…\n…The lines on the roundabout closest to Craigdon should be more clear about car positioning, especially south to north. At Fairmilehead the lack of a filter from driving south to turning West is ludicrously dangerous…\n…just to say I am 100% with you on reducing the speed, particularly given the schoolkids but also adults too cross to commute daily. There is a lot of pedestrians crossing daily. I think 30 is sensible…\n…The area around the Buckstone shops is an accident waiting to happen with car drivers doing crazy things including crossing 4 lanes to get into the parking facing the wrong way and double parking.For cyclists, achieving a right turn from Comiston road into any side street especially uphill…\n…You are so right about the crossroads at Fairmilehead and particularly the cars approaching the crossroads to go into Bigger rd are time after time accelerating through the red light…\n…I grew up in Winton and now live just down the road and I really care about the area. I have an elderly mum with dementia in Winton who crosses Biggar Rd daily and it worries me hugely. A pedestrian crossing there is much needed…\n…I don’t think the problem is limited to those crossroads. I still worry about my 13yo crossing to the bus stop at Buckstone in the mornings (especially in the dark), and my 10yo doesn’t get anywhere near that road without an adult even though she has really good road sense. She would love to be able to go across to the newsagent with her friends! And it would be great if she could get used to crossing that road before high school…\n…The roundabout at the top of the slip road off the bypass would benefit from a mid white line being painted on it. Too often vehicles switch lanes while using the roundabout causing cutting in, this could certainly lead to frustration…\n…May I also voice a plea to have the speed limit reduced to 30 mph- traffic from the bypass can come tearing down the road – if there are 2 lanes completely free of traffic I am afraid that residents particularly schoolchildren crossing the road will be even more in danger of being knocked over than they are now…\n…It’s a terrible road and I’m surprised something hasn’t happened before now…\n…At busy times there are few cars traveling through those lights at 40. So don’t see a speed limit change impacting that junction too much. A good turning filter could allow three lanes to move. It’s just a bust junction though…\nI agree that there is a lot that could be done to make this stretch of road safer for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians. This is what’s happening right now:\nThe speed limit is under review (this will also look at “rat-running”). Despite opposition from other Councillors, I have argued that the Council should consult on reducing the limit to 30mph.\nFurther parking restrictions are about to be implemented.\nThe lights will be replaced over the next year or two to make the junction safer.\nA week or two ago I asked the Council if a case could be made for a pedestrian crossing after concerns were raised by a Winton resident.\nSo whilst this death may not have been caused directly by the road conditions, I am determined that the crossroads and the A702 is made safer for everyone. This is a wide road with wide footpaths, so there should be room for cars, bikes and pedestrians all to move safely.\nOne response to “Update on the death at Fairmilehead Crossroads”\nAnnette Mackenzie\nThey need a filter for turning right onto Oxgangs Road when heading South as you have to cross heavy traffic traveling North. This would avoid people rat running to avoid this junction. I rat run myself at peak times for safety reasons rather than use this junction. We also need to lower the speed on Buckstone and Pentland Terrace to 30 as turning right across two lanes of either North or South bound busy traffic is becoming almost impossible.\nWe need to spend money making roads safer for all car users, cyclists and pedestrians before we spend money narrowing streets like George Street, Forrest Road and the old town. Our council need to prioritise there budget for safety of road users before spending money on roads that they choose to look aesthetically nice but that are not always necessary at the moment. Safety must come first.",

No doubt many of these properties will be sitting empty as a result of deaths, and families will be waiting for estates to be settled. Others will be empty as they are undergoing renovations.\nThe vast majority of these empty homes cause no problems. Others are empty for longer periods and do result in problems – overgrown gardens, vandalism and the ever present risk of a fire.\nOne of these problem empty properties is just 280m from my home in Buckstone and has been empty for around 20 years despite being valued at well over £300,000. Since I was elected in 2017 I have been working with local residents, the Police and Council Officers to have it brought back into productive use.\nAlthough the background is complex, it was clear to me last year that there was a lack of communication internally within the Council, and also with external agencies. There was also a reluctance to act due to a separate ongoing action by a bank to repossess the property.\nWhat I hope is a breakthrough came when a Council Officer met with the residents of a neighbouring property so they could explain how the empty home is destroying their quality of life. We heard of how delivery drivers use the back garden as a toilet, how the property flooded when pipes burst in a bad winter and how there had been multiple break-ins.\nThe Council has no repossession powers that the bank does not have. The Council does, however, have compulsory purchase powers. After hearing the personal testimony of residents, the Council agreed to test the use of these powers on empty homes.\nIf all goes to plan, on the 30th of August Edinburgh’s Housing and Economy Committee will agree to test the use of these powers and turn neighbourhood eyesores across Edinburgh in to homes.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2016_12_12_why-ill-be-demonstrating-against-snp-cuts-this-week/content_188.html": "The SNP will set Scotland’s budget this week and councils across Scotland are expecting cuts.\nFor too long the SNP have used local authority finances as an ATM to fund their populist policies and as a dumping ground for austerity.\nSince 2007, council tax has remained frozen. Whilst this policy has been popular, it has also been hugely regressive. It has benefited the richest most, but has been funded by cutting the services the poorest need.\nIn Westminster the SNP MPs moan loudly from the sidelines about “Tory Austerity”, but their counterparts in Holyrood simply pass the cuts on to our local authorities. Their words are progressive, but their actions are regressive.\nThe impact is clear. In Edinburgh, Scotland’s capital, we have roads with more craters than the moon. Education across Scotland is falling in relative and absolute terms. Care visits for the elderly are limited to 15 short minutes. In short, public services are at a tipping point and now we hear a further £700m of cuts are in the pipeline.\nRather than simply asking the Tories to raise revenue for Scotland, I can’t understand why the SNP is unwilling to use the revenue raising powers they have at their disposal.\nMore than ever, we need a bold, progressive and innovative government. For example, the SNP could allow Edinburgh to introduce a modest hotel tax. This would not cost anyone living here a penny, but it would provide millions to improve the city for everyone. Instead, the SNP say their budget will be only “marginally different” to what the Tories offer. No thanks!\nIf you are free, please join me at the demonstration against SNP council cuts – outside Holyrood on the 15th of December at 11am (assemble at 10:30am).",

Their call for Scotland’s political elite to develop a “clear plan” for our NHS is a damning indictment of almost 10 years of SNP government.\nThe BMA’s analysis comes just after Audit Scotland found that our NHS failed to meet 7 out of 8 of its key targets and performance in many areas is actually getting worse.\nIndeed, the NHS is under so much pressure that Shona Robison MSP, the SNP’s Health Secretary, advised Scots in her Boxing Day press release about how to “self-manage their condition”. This comes weeks after the BMA said just 7% of GPs felt they had adequate time to see patients during consultations and 91% said their workload had “negatively impacted on the quality of care given to patients”.\nThe SNP’s Health Secretary’s empty talk of “building blocks for transformational change”, are a jargon heavy slap in the face for the staff working around the clock in our underfunded and understaffed NHS.\nIn the UK we are lucky to have the NHS, but here in Scotland we should be grateful that its staffed by professionals dedicated enough to make sure it delivers even when, as the BMA says, its “struggling to cope”.",

I understand that the Transport Convener had a briefing following the “Design Risk Assessment Review” and based on this the project was permitted to proceed without a Road Safety Audit being undertaken. I am disappointed that this briefing has not been shared with Councillors which represent the area, and that we were not involved in the decision making process. The request for a meeting with residents has also went unanswered.\nUpdate 1 [12-08-2020] – I asked about the target date for completing the works which will trigger the next Braid Road review: “It is difficult to give an exact date at the moment. W e intend to take the Greenbank Crossroads to Meadows scheme to Notification next week. Assuming it is approved for delivery the following week we would then work with a contractor to develop a programme for delivery. Once we have a better idea of timelines I will be happy to circulate an update.”\nUpdate 2 [14-08-2020] – “This is just a quick email to let you know that our start date on Comiston Road has been pushed back slightly to Thursday 20th of August. The reason for this is that Markon – the lining contractor – have experienced some unexpected difficulties on certain parts of the Ferry Road Spaces for People scheme where they are currently working.”\nUpdate 3 [17-08-2020] – I have still not seen the updated plans for the project, but I understand the total cost is £115,000. Lothian Buses are saying they will only have 250mm clearance on the route – Perhaps if the Council had undertaken the Road Safety Audit as I requested this would have been spotted.\nUpdate 4 [20-08-2020] – (1) The project is now delayed until WB 24-08-2020 due to “snagging issues on Ferry Road”. (2) A further review of the Braid Road closure has been agreed. Thankfully, this will do what we have all wanted for some time and will consider the interaction with the Comiston Road scheme. (3) I now have the updated plans and they are linked below – the key change appears to be the loss of parking outside Scottish Water’s offices to accommodate a bus lane.\nUpdate following Ward Cllr Liaison Meeting\nComiston Road\nA design risk review has been undertaken endeavouring to consider all points of concern that have been raised regarding the project designs, and the Designers Risk Assessment has been updated accordingly.\nThe designs have been updated slightly in some places to respond to this, namely:\n- The bus stop adjacent to Braid Hills Road in Phase 2 has been slightly relocated further from the junction to improve visibility splays\n- Parking bays have been widened to 2.5m\n- The cycle crossing of Comiston Springs Avenue has been updated to provide clear priority for cycles over turning vehicles\nIn addition, in response to suggestions from Lothian Buses we are now proposing to introduce a Bus Lane southbound on the approach to the Frogston/ Oxgangs Road crossroads.\nI will circulate updated Phase 1 and 2 designs shortly.\nConstruction of Phase 1 of Comiston Road will now commence on Monday 17 August. The delay is due to minor delays experienced by the contractor on completing the Ferry Road Spaces for People scheme where they are currently working.\nBraid Road\nA review of the Braid Road closure has taken place. It has been decided that Braid Road will remain closed at least until after the implementation of both the Comiston Road cycleway, and the continuing route between Greenbank Crossroads and the Meadows. At such a time as both of these projects have been implemented and bedded in a further review of Braid Road will take place giving full consideration to the traffic situation at that time.",

The first notes that the number of students leaving Scotland’s schools without any maths qualification has nearly doubled under the SNP. The second reports that youth unemployment has risen by 2.4%.\nThe SNP calls the rise in unemployment a “small increase”, but the reality is that the Scottish Government can’t continue to preside over a declining education system without it having an impact on the ability of Scotland to attract investment.\nIt’s now an accepted fact that SNP cuts to school budgets and their bungled implementation of the Curriculum for Excellence have resulted in a decline in education standards in absolute and relative terms.\nThe SNP’s response to this appears to be to publish strategy after strategy, as if these can enable teachers to do more with less time and money.\nLet’s hope that Labour, the Lib-Dems and the Greens refuse to back the SNP minority government’s budget until it contains a genuine commitment to invest in our schools, colleges and universities.\nHolyrood now has the powers to make education in Scotland great again. Let’s use those powers to ensure young Scots are equipped to be the next generation of engineers, innovators and leaders that Scotland needs to compete internationally.",

I will be here to listen to you no matter what your age, sex, disability, gender, race or birthplace. What’s more, if you are being attacked due to these characteristics, I will work with the community to defend you. We are all equal in my constituency.\nIndeed, just like other Labour Governments did, my hope is that over the term of this parliament we will make the country a fairer one to live in and do business. This will happen despite the mess we inherited.\nAn early step we have taken is to give an estimated 200,000 Scots a pay rise with changes we are making to the Living Wage. We have asked that setting the Living Wage takes into account the cost of living crisis, and that we end the nonsense of paying people less simply because of their age.

The message remains the same – leave your bins out for collection.\nWe have now come to the end of the holiday period and as I stated earlier this week, our plan was to remain at `one day behind schedule`, and we have managed to maintain that on the main landfill and DMR (dry mixed recycling) collections, unfortunately we are behind with food waste and glass collections, but our aim is to be clean for Tuesday also in these areas.\nI do have a concern with our communal glass collections and have spoken with our external contractor to ensure the communal glass hot spots are taken care of over the weekend, so hopefully we will see a difference here, on checking today, we have major volumes to collect here and our contractor was, and always has been aware of this at this time of year.\nChristmas trees are starting to appear in larger numbers and we have several teams out this weekend and in the coming days from both waste and cleansing to assist with this clearance.\nFinally, I understand everyone’s frustration with our collections and I am sure you can all understand our frustrations as well, we are however, using every possible resource we can lay our hands on to return to schedule in the second week of the year.",

When I heard from the Evening News that a petition had been launched to demand change, I actually welcomed the news. However, on reading the article and the petition, I feel unconformable about the way the Council Leader (Adam McVey, SNP Councillor for Leith) is being targeted.\nTo be clear, I share the frustration about the creeping privatisation of public space in Edinburgh, particularly how people are locked out of public parks and the lack of respect for our heritage. As a city, we are blessed with a fantastic built, natural and cultural heritage and I want to share it with people from all over the world. However, right now I don’t feel we are making the most of it. It feels like too many people in this city see profit in everything, and value in nothing.\nFor me, the tipping point came in the summer of 2018 when we had a black hording blocking views of the Castle. Since then we’ve seen memorial benches “discarded”, months of controversy over the Christmas Market, Church leaders ‘disappointed’ with ‘premature removal’ of Edinburgh’s famous nativity sculpture for Johnnie Walker advertising, and too many more examples of how our heritage is being sacrificed for quick commercial gain. However, these things keep happening and the Council is left reacting to events.\nCliff Hague summed it up like this:\n“East Princes Street Gardens have been essentially handed over to the London-based Underbelly for ten weeks to do with as they wish, without the inconvenience of having to get planning permission beforehand. West Princes Street Gardens is screened off in August for the Summer Sessions concerts. Unbelievably ugly security barriers have been erected on the Royal Mile.”\n“Edinburgh is now effectively run by the tourist industry”\nOn a personal note, my lovely wife’s grandfather was a Polish servicemen who came to Leith after Poland fell to the Nazis, and went on to fight alongside UK and Norwegian forces in Norway. Because of this, I am always hugely proud to see Edinburgh’s memorials marking Scotland’s links to Polish and Norwegian troops stationed here in WWII. Amongst these is the Christmas Tree placed annually on The Mound which is gifted to the city by Hordaland (Norway) to mark the “assistance provided by the Scots to Norway in WWII”. I was disappointed to see that this year the tree was hacked down right after Christmas and the memorial to Wojtek the bear and Polish WW2 veterans was fenced off on the same day (images below). What must people from outside Edinburgh make of this?\nI accept that the Council Leader has often been left reacting to these events. Rather than force his resignation, however, I think we should instead focus on what we actually want to change. Councillor Donald Wilson has already committed to leading a full review, and I hope the public and all 63 of Edinburgh’s Councillors will get behind that.\nIn response to the petition the Council Leader said: “many issues being raised are part of wider debate about how we manage size and scale of festivals and tourism”. I actually feel it is more fundamental than how we manage the status quo. There are really three key questions:\n- What scale is right? The Edinburgh Tourism Strategy” boasts it’s being developed by an “industry-led group facilitated by Scottish Enterprise” called ETAG (with no community representation). This group wants to grow the current tourist economy from 4.1 million visitors per year by one third to 5.5 million by 2030. Can this level of growth be accommodated sustainably?\n- Is quality of what we’re offering positioning Edinburgh optimally? Right now visitors arriving via Waverly Station are greeted by the smell of fried onions and German sausages emanating from the Christmas Market. I love German beer and food, but surely Edinburgh should be promoting its fantastic built, natural and cultural heritage better? How can Edinburgh’s small business improve on this and benefit more?\n- Who benefits? Today the Evening News carried an article from the tourism lobby (the ones that oppose the tourist tax) who are clearly concerned that the public is waking up to what’s going on. It’s claimed that the industry supports 33,000 jobs in Edinburgh. I welcome every one of those jobs (particularly my daughter’s), but I do wonder how many come with fair pay, good conditions and fixed hours?\nWhilst calling for the Council Leader to resign may help vent some frustration, it’s making a difference to the lives of residents than matters. For me the starting point is to understand what Edinburgh wants to gain from its visitor economy, and then we have to deliver that.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2024_01_02_sec2024/content_111.html": "Why we are standing for re-election to the SEC\nThis short blog sets out why we want members to support us in our bid for re-election to our party’s Scottish Executive Committee (SEC) to represent the South Scotland and Lothian Regions. The ballot opens on Friday 12 January and closes on Friday 9 February, and you are being asked to elect two members to the SEC (one of which must be female).\nThere can be no doubt that the next 3 years will be a huge challenge for our party. If all goes to plan, 2024 will see Keir Starmer elected as our Prime Minister and that will pave the way for Anas Sarwar having a real chance of becoming Scotland’s First Minster in 2026. To make gains we must remain united and focus on taking our positive message to the electorate. We both feel that factionalism is a barrier to our party regaining trust in Scotland, so our approach on the SEC over the past two years has always been focussed on unity.\nWe have both campaigned for the party and have played key parts in getting Ian Murray MP, Daniel Johnson MSP and several new Councillors elected. This has taught us that we must listen to voters and offer them a positive alternative to both the SNP and Tories. Voters want to understand what our priorities are, and we need to present them concisely.\nAlthough confidence in our UK and Scottish Leadership is growing, there is more to do if we are to consolidate this support.\nWe are both fully committed to improving accountability and transparency within our party. Within that context, we make these four key pledges to you:\n- Where possible, we will consult members on key issues before the SEC meets.\n- If invited, we will attend your CLP meeting to listen to members.\n- We will each provide a written report to members after each SEC meeting.\n- We will expect the General Secretary to investigate any leaks to the media from the SEC.\nWe will ensure our party remains focussed on the challenges of today, not the divisions of yesterday.\nA message from Sheila Gilmore\nI have experience at nearly all levels of the Party: Branch Secretary, CLP Chair, Election Agent, Councillor (1991-2007), and MP for Edinburgh East (2010 and 2015).\nGood policy is important, but we need to turn that into action through electoral success. I am Campaign Co-ordinator for my constituency , was Campaign Manager for Daniel Johnson in May 2021/when we increased the majority and vote share. We carried this into the 2022 council elections where we won an extra council seat and pushed our other candidates to first place in very closely fought contests, where 5 viable parties wee competing for 4 places. While every constituency is different, and one size doesn’t fit all, we need to learn from where we win, including in local councils.\nThe past two years have transformed our prospects. Under the leadership of Anas and Jackie we have now got to a position where Labour is seen as able to win . We need a steady leadership to ‘seal the deal’ with the voters and make sure current disillusion with the SNP translates to votes for Labour. Good organisation is crucial to this.\nMoving forward we also have to start planning for the 2026 Scottish Parliament elections, and that includes ensuring we encourage, grow and support a diverse range of candidates for this and for local councils. Our record is not as good as it could be, and I am keen to ensure that the SEC gives full support to the Scottish Women’s committee and to groups supporting other under represented groups .\nI campaigned for devolution, and still feel there is much more we could achieve through it. We need to start preparing practical policies for 2026, when hopefully we will be able to implement them. The Party needs to be clear on our opposition to independence and maintaining a strong positive narrative on why we believe the people of Scotland benefit from remaining part of the UK.\nI support our current leadership team, but aim to be a ‘critical friend’ when it is needed. Leaders need constructive challenge. They need to hear what members are thinking and experiencing through active and well connected CLP representatives.\nMy enthusiasm and commitment to the Labour Party remains undimmed through all the ups and downs I have lived through. It is those qualities I bring to the Scottish Executive.\nA message from Dr Scott Arthur\nWe are now on our third Scottish Leader and third General Secretary since I joined the SEC, but I’ve never seen it more united, and I am committed to it staying that way – unity is strength. I’m keen to stay on the SEC to give members a say, but also to support Keit and help Anas and Jackie take our party forward. I support them fully, but I take very seriously my job to give members a voice.\nAdditionally, I believe in transparency within our party at all levels. This is why I, unlike many SEC members, issue a reports to party members after SEC meetings and have attended several CLPs.\nAs a proud Labour Councillor, I never miss an opportunity to remind the SEC that winning in Local Government is the first step to us winning in Holyrood. That is why I stood in 2017 for election as a Labour Councillor – my Ward forms part of a strong Labour foundation in the Lothians where Labour Councillors work effectively with Ian Murray MP and our MSPs (Sarah Boyack, Foysol Choudhury, Daniel Johnson & Martin Whitfield) to take our party forward. If all does well, we will build from this base and take more seats from the SNP at the coming General Election. Indeed, I shall be standing against Joanna Cherry KC in Edinburgh South West,\nThe 2024 General Election will be a pivotal moment for our party, and the people in our communities that need Labour in power. If re-elected to the SEC, I’ll ensure our party puts everything it has into working with the Trade Unions to win as many seats as possible, and the support those MP after the election. From there, we can start the campaign for Holyrood in 2026.",

One reported cut which has particular resonance in my ward is a proposal to close almost all of Edinburgh’s Public Toilets, including those in Colinton.\nThe Council Leader (Cllr Adam McVey, Leith Ward) claims that public toilets are generally in need of substantial investment and are the focus of crime.\nHe has clearly never had to “spend a penny” in Colinton. The village enjoys a relatively new building which is fully accessible and well used (not least by bus drivers). Council Officers have confirmed to me that there are no problems with them, and the Police have told me they can find no record of crime or anti-social behaviour linked to them.\nIt is an accepted fact that older people, people with disabilities, people with carers, women and children all have their lives limited by the current lack of public toilets in Edinburgh. Given that there is no shortage of these groups in Colinton, it is hard to understand the basis of the closure.\nRather than closing public toilets, we should be improving them across the city. I’d much rather Edinburgh was a place that was known for having clean and fully accessible public toilets where natures needs can be met and babies can be changed, rather than a place where men (mostly) were too often seen urinating in public.\nThese cuts are driven by political decisions made by the Scottish Government. They have chosen to disproportionately target local government, and ensure Edinburgh has Scotland’s lowest per capita funding settlement. That is their prerogative, but when the point is reached where the most vulnerable in society fall victim to their cuts it is surely time for a rethink.\nThat’s why I am delighted that Colinton Community Council has decided to run a campaign to save the village’s public toilets and I look forward to giving it my full support.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_12_18_homelessness-in-edinburgh-the-tories-must-share-the-blame_comment-page-1/content_511.html": "Councillor Whyte is absolutely correct to raise the issue of homelessness in his opinion column (18/12/17). In every single report I have given to Community Council meetings in my Ward I have been clear that, together with dealing with the problems we face in social care, homelessness is the number one challenge we face in our Capital.\nIn my own Ward, I have been supporting a young mother who became homeless due to relationship breakdown. She now lives with her sister – 3 adults and 3 children share a two bedroom flat in Oxgangs. The stress of this is impacting on her mental health and her ability to hold on to her job and look after her child. Despite being classed as homeless, she can expect to wait two years for a home – hundreds of people are ahead of her on the waiting list.\nWhilst relationship breakdown accounts for 18% of homelessness in Scotland, Councillor Whyte is wrong to suggest welfare reforms implemented by his Tory chums in the UK Government are not also a driver. The acute shortage of affordable housing is being intensified by Tory welfare policy. As CRISIS puts it: “welfare reform has been making both private landlords and housing associations more risk averse with regard to letting to households in receipt of benefits.”\nIn Scotland, where recorded homelessness is far higher than in England, even if the SNP Government hits their targets and so manages to reverse the decline in new social housing they have presided over, CRISIS say that will only “slow-down” the rise in homelessness.\nThis context is why homelessness in Edinburgh is such a priority and triggered the Council setting up a cross-party “Task Force” (yes, I know) to deal with it. If Councillor Whyte is to serve on it alongside Cllr Cammy Day (Labour), Cllr Robert Aldridge (Lib Dem), Cllr Susan Rae (Green), and a SNP representative, however, he will first have to acknowledge his party’s contribution to the problem.\nPerhaps then he can undo another harmful Tory policy, and suggest we start buying back council housing as it comes on the market.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_02_26_understanding-the-desire-to-reduce-the-speed-limit-on-40mph-roads-in-my-ward-to-30mph/content_401.html": "Above and below are the responses to a web survey I set up last year to understand the desire to reduce the speed limit on 40mph roads in my Ward to 30mph. I don’t claim my survey is “scientific” or conclusive, but it does show that locally there is a desire for safer roads.\nFor Change\n- I don’t see the need for 40mph speed limit within residential areas. Would love the limit to be reduced on biggar road so I can more easily take the bus to school (Pentland) with my children.\n- Cars come off the bypass and still go to fast down this road especially with all the new housing 30 would be plenty please also included the slow down sign and also the cost of policing (speed checks) on a regular bases without this people will remain going to fast\n- This is essential!\n- Volume of traffic, day car parking, extra houses and junctions and shops, mean this road is becoming more and more dangerous. A 30 limit would help take some of the heat out the traffic\n- The road is too fast. It’s in a fairly built-up area with lots of parked cars. There’s no need for it to be so fast there -30mph would be more appropriate. I’m really worried about my son and his friends crossing the road when they start at Boroughmuir next year.\n- The area around the shops at Buckstone is particularly dangerous as the bend in the road means that people do not have good sight lines when crossing, particularly outside the shops where people double park.\n- There is no need to travel above 30mph in Edinburgh\n- There have been two fatalities near our house within the last 5 years and many near misses that we have seen, it is against the spirit of road safety to drop the limit to 20 on tiny streets with no traffic and leave thousands of people to cross 40mph roads with loads of traffic, whilst going about their daily business to catch buses etc.\n- We live on Pentland View, and regularly struggle to pull out of our road safely given the speed of oncoming traffic and difficulty seeing past parked cars outside the Buckstone shops. I also feel vulnerable (especially with my two young children) crossing the main road here due to the speed of the traffic.\n- The section of road from Fairmilehead to the top of braidburn is residential and as traffic volume has risen so have the incidents of careless driving putting both residents and motorist in greatear danger there is no need for a residential street to be 40 mph\n- Extremely dangerous roads – especially the charwood grill junction.\n- As a resident of Winton who has to cross Biggar Road on a daily basis with my children to get the bus, I believe reducing the speed on that road is absolutely necessary to make the passage safer\n- I fully agree. These roads pass through residential areas, and it would be much safer for everyone if the speed limit was reduced.\n- I’m a car driver, but I also regularly cycle on the 702 to Fairmilehead, as do many others. It’s a busy bus route, and many school kids getting off the buses and crossing, and a lot of older folks living in the area. 40mph limit here is not appropriate, and it’s common to see cars travelling a lot faster than 40mph.\n- Recent accidents demonstrate the need to bring the limit down on these roads. It’s also a great opportunity to put some meaningful provision for cyclists.\n- These Highly residential areas should limited to 30mph\n- These are far to fast for residential areas of Edinburgh with very close proximity to local schools. All of these roads are used daily by children and families to get to school, 40mph is unsafe and leaves me very nervous to cross . I have lived in the area for under 5 years and in that time I have been aware of at least 5 quite serious road traffic incidents on Buckstone Road alone, most including pedestrians. This urgently requires review.\n- Yes please. As a cyclist And bus user/walker who lives just off this road we need this badly for safety. Crossings are too infrequent for bus users carrying shopping etc and hard as a cyclist to safely navigate pinch points ( islands) and exit right over 3 lanes of traffic.\n- I lived on Biggar Road for 21 years, witnessing the speed of cars, still driven at bypass levels or drivers heading south from crossroads accelerating with the down hill & 2 lanes. It is a lethal & frightening road to cross, pedestrians avoid the area, local people use their cars to move around, especially when transporting their children. Reducing speeds would reduce car use, road safety, traffic density & improve local residents quality of life, health & air quality.\n- Should have been 30 limit years ago (F’head lights to Braid H Hotel). Especially at B’stone shops.\n- I cycle past the Buckstone shops almost daily and it’s an accident waiting to happen. Vehicles are double parked outside the shops making it even more unsafe for cyclists and other roads users not to mention all the school kids crossing to wait for buses into town. And the cycle lane is a joke, avoid at all costs unless you wanted floored by a opening car door.\n- I assume the City of Edinburgh accepts that we have a climate emergency? It really is time that pedestrians, cyclists and local bus services are given priority over motorists. The pedestrian crossing helps but as a cyclist you take your life in your hands trying to turn right out of the waterboard estate. Although the speed limit is 40mph many cars/vans/lorries are travelling faster. Please, in the interests of safety, reduce the speed limit to 30mph.\n- The road from Greenbank to the bypass has no business being 40mph. On-street parking is already a problem and is a significant hazard to cyclists. Parking should be forbidden from Riselaw Place southwards as far as the bypass. Or, create a bus lane. Speed reduction is needed in tandem with removal of hazards.\n- Please also consider safe pedestrian crossings near Craigdon Mountain Sports, ie of the Biggar Road and of the of the bypass slip roads. There’s a great walking path eastwards from Swanson village and onto the Mortonhall estate but it involves risking life and limb crossing the slip roads and then the A702.\n- Please – put the safety of vulnerable road users first. Thank you\n- Traffic volumes and on-street parking (with respect to the the A70) are probably the most significant, but sure: whatever it takes to start a process of making these roads safer.\n- Crossing this road is a danger cars do not just do 40mph they drive 45mph. There are houses on both sides of the roads and in such a residential area I have no idea why the speed limit is 40.\n- I would also like to see some traffic calming in Swanston Avenue as it is commonly used as a rat run when traffic builds up around the fairmilehead crossroads – driver speed to make up for their perceived lost time ?\n- Streets need to made safer for residents.\n- My main concern is Biggar Road as cars speed up this road after exiting the City Bypass. It’s almost impossible to get out of Swanston Avenue safely! But all the roads mentioned above require the speed to be reduced to 30 mph.\n- I still think there is a requirement for a Park and Ride at Lothianburn as the volume of traffic is increasing. You just need to look at the volume of cars parked on Comiston Road and side streets to confirm people are driving into that area then taking the bus into town.\n- This reduction in speed should have been implemented YEARS ago. All secondary school children living in Buckstone have had to cross that road to get to the bus stops, putting their lives in danger every day. Since our boys were at high school when we worried every day for their safety, the situation has been improved somewhat by the introduction of two crossing points but we all know that if a bus is coming the children will run. As long as the limit is forty many drivers feel safe to drive at fifty. I used to walk from my house to work at South Morningside primary and I found that quite a number of drivers actually didn’t always notice the crossings anyway! There is also a problem with the twenty mph on Braid Road,where almost no drivers actually stick to the limit. There is a big 20 written on the road but JUST as they come off Comiston Road but it is a very sharp turn and drivers are too busy at that exact point to notice the 20. I think it might help a lot if we could have another big 20 painted on the road maybe twenty metres down Braid Road once drivers have negociated the corner.\n- Thank you – we so need speed to reduce as volume and speed of cars is increasing. As residents of Pentland view we need a reduced limit all way to green bank to prevent cars from accelerating away from the shops going downhill to green bank. Coming out of PV already is unsafe when driving due to obscured view of traffic from double parked cars, commercial bins etc. Reducing speed would allow my daughter to safely cross the road from taking bus from town without taking her life in her hands. Parking also needs to be enforced in the area and near bus stops so that pedestrians can see when getting off bus and to allow safe crossings of road. I feel particularly for young and old people with current speed limits ( and our area has a very high proportion of families and elderly people).\n- The Buckstone shops area is an accident waiting to happen and someones child is going to be killed. It is the junction to Pentland primary, a busy nursery at Cranley, playgroup and after school club at St Fillan’s and access across the road for both commuters and high school kids. It needs to be considered urgently for reduction in speed\n- The current speed limit of 40mph is dangerously high given the numbers of pedestrians crossing, vehicles changing lanes or turning into and out of side roads, and bikes using the road. It gives the wrong signals to cars joining the road from the bypass, that they are still on a ‘fast road’ and that they should drive accordingly and expect others to do so; in practice this means less patience, tolerance and accommodation of other vehicles making manoeuvres, and greater danger for all road users.\n- A 30mph limit would be more appropriate to the usage of the road, more consistent with the surrounding 20mph roads, and would significantly reduce the risk of accidents.\n- There is no NEED for a 40 mph limit as at present. It doesn’t serve any purpose and drivers need to be calmed down immediately they come off or cross the by-pass and be aware they are in a residential area and in the City of Edinburgh. I’ve driven for over 40 years and the Fairmilehead cross roads and approaches make me very nervous as everyone seems intent on doing 50mph ‘attitudinally’. Hell for leather is the phrase that comes to mind. If the limit was reduced it would be well served by the illuminated signs that record speed and state the need to slow down to 30.\n- Every high school aged child in the Buckstone and new Waterfield estate on the previous waterboard ground have to cross the road on Buckstone Terrace on their journey to Boroughmuir or other schools. It is insane given the number of RTA’s in the past that this road remains a 40 (meaning many do above this). The addition of the crossing may have helped a bit but in my opinion should have been lights for the junction rather than just a crossing and would have positioned the crossing point nearer to where Waterfield kids cross. Many kids continue to cross at the islands. The crossroads at Fairmilehead should also be reviewed. Turning right from Buckstone Terrace to Hunters Tryst which is a near blind junction, especially if cars queuing to turn right from the bypass, and is the only approach without a dedicated filter. Lane marking should also be reviewed to make left lane turn left and straight on, and right hand lane turn right only. Same coming from the bypass – 3 lanes should be left only, straight ahead and right only.\n- commuting by bike on this stretch would be a lot nicer\n- Parking outside shops at Buckstone Terrace, sometimes vehicles double parked, make it hard to see on-coming traffic travelling south when turning right from Pentland View. Parking restrictions on junction both in Buckstone terrace and Pentland View aren’t enforced. Have lived in Pentland View for 13 years and have never seen parking attendants here.\n- These are busy cyclist commuter routes with a dangerous pinch points at Buckstone shops.\n- The safety of vulnerable road users is more important than someone getting to the back of the next traffic queue a minute quicker than they otherwise would.\n- And A702 Biggar Road (Damhead to City Bypass)\n- I believe that the Council can not justify a 40mph limit in any residential area where housing is directly on to the road.\n- As a resident of Lanark Rd the speed of the traffic continues to increase as drivers are freed from the restrictions on the surrounding roads. This can only be addressed by reducing the speed on Lanark Road itself. It is a residential street with family homes on both sides and in my time here I have witnessed accidents involving people (thankfully no serious injuries) and many animal fatalities. The bottleneck on Lanark Road heading into town is created by increased housing in Currie and Balerno and reducing the speed after Gillespie crossroads towards Kingknowe to 30 would have little or no effect on journey time and make a significant difference to the safety of Lanark Road.\n- Speed limits change from 20mph to 40mph at Buckstone shops.\n- Large numbers of children need to cross this road to get to school. I’m sure you’re aware of the chances of survival if struck by a car at 40mph, compared to 30 or 20. People driving through see the 40 limit so don’t realise it’s a highly built up area, so very often treat the road as a continuation of the bypass and go even faster. I think it’s unprecedented in the city for a 40mph road to traverse such a densley populated area.\n- Regular speeding on Buckstone Terrace. 30mph would make a big difference when reversing out into traffic with small children in car.\n- We have had our vehicles hit twice in the past year, I feel reducing the speed limit to 30moh would make our road much safer for pedestrians and cyclists.\n- The current speed limits are excessively abused and need to be reduced for safety reasons.\n- cars travel too fast on this section\n- Lanark Road traffic has become much faster recently and unless you use it , you are probably not aware of the danger , particularly to children and the elderly.\n- Essential with so bent youngsters and a nursery in the vicinity\n- These areas are all very residential and i use Lanark Road in particular for nursery pick up. Drivers go way to fast and am always concerned for the little ones coming out onto such a busy road,40 speed limit is too fast for such a built up area.",

I learnt a few lessons, not least from this video which they shared.\nIt is pretty clear that they feel they (and people with visual impairments) have been excluded to some extent from the consultation process. In particular, they highlighted that the Common Place tool is visually driven, and no alternative was provided for people with sight loss- this is shameful stuff.\nWe also shared concerns about the balance between support for cycling and walking, with things like floating bus stops putting vulnerable pedestrians at a real disadvantage. Their key requests include:\n- Mobility and accessibility needs of disabled people are fully considered in the planning and delivery of such measures.\n- It is essential to consider the impacts of any temporary measures on disabled people, including people who have difficulty walking, wheelchair users, people with cognitive impairments, dementia, autism, etc. and people with sensory impairments. This is a legal requirement under the provisions of the 2010 Equality Act.\n- Many disabled people have found the pandemic extremely stressful. Changes to usual travel patterns, to public transport services, parking arrangements, etc. can add to anxiety. Spaces for People initiatives should therefore be seen in this context – continual changes should therefore be avoided where possible, and should be effectively communicated to the public including disabled people.\n- Many disabled people depend on cars (both to drive and as a passenger) and taxis. Road changes shouldn’t prevent disabled people from being able to stop near their destination. This is not only about ‘disabled parking bays’ but also considering if measures may reduce vehicle access to kerbs and the flexibility for blue badge holdersto park on single or double yellow lines.\n- Safe space for pedestrians should be separate from cyclists as far as possible. Any shared-use paths or areas must be designed so that cyclists understand the need to give way to pedestrians and maintain a reasonable distance.\nTheir guidance to Councils is here:",

However, it has now watered that down and is now saying refurbishments will count for a significant proportion of the total. Will Councillor Campbell stand up to her SNP masters and demand they honour their manifesto commitment? Probably not!\nCouncillor Kate Campbell is also correct to say that public services are suffering due to 7 years of “Tory Austerity”. What she does not mention is the SNP’s complete failure to use its revenue raising powers to help protect the most vulnerable in Scotland. Furthermore, the plight of many vulnerable people in Edinburgh is being exacerbated by the SNP’s failure to deliver their pledge of scrapping the “hated” Council Tax. Will Councillor Campbell stand up to her SNP masters and demand they do more? Probably not!\nCouncillor Kate Campbell is absolutely correct that the creation of Rent Pressure Zones will help many in Edinburgh. Shelter Scotland, Crisis, the Greens and Scottish Labour deserve great credit for lobbying the SNP to give Local Authorities this power. However, the SNP voted against a Labour amendment in Holyrood which sought to ensure rented properties are “warm, secure and safe”. Indeed, SNP MPs in Westminster abstained on a Labour amendment which sought to ensure rented accommodation is “fit for human habitation” – a decision which has come under increased scrutiny since the Grenfell Tower disaster. Will Kate Campbell stand up to her SNP masters and condemn these actions? Probably not!\nIn conclusion, if Edinburgh’s SNP led administration is serious about dealing with our Capital’s housing crisis it has a duty to ensure the Scottish Government uses all the substantial powers at its disposal to do so. Will Councillor Campbell put Edinburgh first and make that argument?\nFaithfully",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_01_11_is-brian-souter-the-reason-the-snp-havent-regulated-buses/content_478.html": "The Chicago Tribune recently published a truly humbling account of Edinburgh and its people penned by a tourist. What caught my eye is the description of Lothian Buses:\nEdinburgh has a cheap (about a buck-fifty a ride in town) and efficient bus system with frequent service to everywhere a visitor might want to visit. The drivers and fellow passengers alike are extremely friendly and more than willing to explain the system and point you to the correct stop, as well as discuss their recent doctor’s appointments, the town council’s foolishness and, of course, the weather.\nWe should never forget that Edinburgh has one of the UK’s best bus services. What makes it so special is that it is owned by the Council and operates to benefit Edinburgh, not maximise profits.\nThose that doubt the benefits of Lothian Buses only have to look west to see how lucky we are. In Glasgow there is no municipal bus company, services are operated by First Bus and Stagecoach. Whereas in Edinburgh we can travel the length of our Capital for £1.60, a relatively short journey in central Glasgow can cost £2 even when the tickets are bought in advance. Making matters worse for Glaswegians, this week it was announced that fares will increase by 15% for adults and an eyewatering 40% for children. What’s more, unaccompanied children will have to pay the adult fare. Adding insult to injury, the view out of the window is nowhere near as good as we get in Edinburgh.\nGlasgow City Council is powerless to intervene as for 11 years the SNP have refused to regulate bus companies or give other Councils the power to establish the equivalent of Lothian Buses. They have let private bus companies run riot.\nThat has now changed. At last, after pressure from Labour and Unite, the SNP have said they “aim” to bring forward legislation in the coming years. Don’t hold your breath though, similar commitments were made in the past.\nOf course cynics will say the SNP have not acted to date because the party has received millions from Sir Brian Souter. As well as been known for spending a million pounds opposing gender equality legislation in Scotland and being caught in a £11m tax avoidance dodge, this super rich SNP backer is Chairman of the Stagecoach Group. Anyone who doubts the influence Souter has over the SNP should ask why they had him knighted and why Nicola Sturgeon refused to ask to that reward be removed when he was caught avoiding paying tax.\nSo let’s be grateful for Lothian Buses, but not expect anything similar to be started up elsewhere in Scotland anytime soon.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_11_22_eis-school-briefing-the-pressures-are-not-just-unrelenting-but-building_comment-page-1/content_372.html": "Below is an email from the EIS Local Association Secretary, Alison Murphy. It details some of the pressures school staff are feeling right now after an impossible year or two.\nEIS Email\nOver the last few weeks, I have become increasingly concerned about what I am hearing from EIS members, and others working to support education in Edinburgh. The pressures are not just unrelenting, but building – and the more worrying thing is that, whilst some are due to the ongoing realities of dealing with the pandemic, too many others could be avoided. I would hope that you also have been talking to teachers, and particularly headteachers, in your ward, and that this is giving you an idea of the scale of the crisis, and a desire to work with schools to ensure the core work of education can be maintained. However, I am afraid to say that many school leaders tell me that they feel there is little insight from politicians, parents or the public about the day to day reality in schools, and that this is leading to totally unrealistic demands being placed on them, and to them feeling isolated and unsupported. The following are just some of the things with which schools are having to contend.\nI assume councillors are informed of the numbers of staff and pupils who are testing positive in schools? I hope you are giving thought to what that means.\n- Dozens of staff members becoming infected is leading to increased anxiety amongst colleagues who worry about the same happening to them.\n- More pressure on schools to provide absence cover. Demand far outstrips the availability of supply teachers. There are few schools where SLT are not providing in-class cover (thereby further reducing the time available to undertake their strategic leadership roles) and even where teachers are not having to go over their statutory maximum contact time, they are having to put in time to prepare work for classes other than their own.\n- In addition to staff who are absent because they are testing positive, huge numbers of staff are having to self-isolate whilst awaiting results of tests. Even if those tests end up being negative, the time out of school is having a huge impact.\n- On top of this, we have all the usual illnesses that develop over the winter months. Further, many staff who kept going during the initial stages of the pandemic are now succumbing to the stress, musculoskeletal and other problems that they fended off last year.\n- The large number of pupil absences (positive cases are in the 1000s) leads to yet more work – staff will often be trying to prepare work for pupils who are self-isolating and, even if those requirements are not excessive (which they often are – some parents seem to think it reasonable for teachers to provide a full suite of online learning for their child, even though that teacher is still having to teach all the rest of the children who are still in class), staff will be very conscious of the need to support those children when they return. This concern is further exacerbated when the pupils are ones sitting national qualifications this year (I will not, here, elucidate all the issues related to National Qualifications and SQA, but would be happy to have further discussions with any councillor who wants to be better informed about this).\nCEC has prioritised keeping schools open, and pupils in class. This is something that most would agree with – no one wants a return to blended learning, still less full-blown school closures. However, I wonder if you are fully aware of the reality of what this means?\n- I have already said that HTs and others are having to do increasing amounts of class cover. This is in addition to other things they are taking on to help with covid mitigations (many schools, in an effort to reduce infections, are maintaining staggered breaks and lunches etc – all of which require supervision, and it is often only SLT who are available to do this). Yet, despite all the extra hours they are having to put in to keep their school open, they are not seeing a comparable diminution in other demands being placed on them. School recovery plans, data requests, parental requests, HMIE planning, audit and quality improvement work – all these and more are continuing, and are resulting in SLT doing enormous, and utterly unsustainable, numbers of extra hours. I have never spoken to as many HTs who are considering early retirement, or resigning, or who are on the verge of signing off sick, as I have done this term. I ask you to seriously contemplate the impact on Edinburgh’s children if even a fraction of them do end up leaving.\n- Not only are school leadership teams spending more time in class, many of the central team (QIOs, SEOs etc) are going into schools to help alleviate the most acute pressures. Fairly obviously, this means that the amount of support they can give school leadership teams is reduced – yet those leadership teams are fielding huge demands around the attainment agenda, pupil wellbeing, results etc. Without sufficient access to support, how can they manage these demands?\n- As I hope you know, CEC decided that, in an effort to keep special schools open, Educational Psychologists (EPs) and members of the Additional Support for Learning Service (ASLS) would be deployed into those special schools on a rota basis. Again, I emphasise that we all understand the reasoning behind this decision – the pupils in our special schools are very vulnerable and we all want them to be properly supported. However, I again ask if you have properly understood the reality of what this decision means:\n- Pupils in some special schools are seeing different staff on a daily basis. Many of these children need stability and continuity, and they are not getting this.\n- The staff who are being asked to go into the schools have, in many cases, absolutely no expertise or training in this area. Many of the EPs have never been teachers and are not GTCS-registered. Thus, in most cases, the best that they can do is act as a support to the class team – they cannot lead learning, let alone give the specialist teaching support these pupils need. Not only are pupils getting less expert support than they need, the staff in the special schools are having to do extra work to try to support these colleagues.\n- In addition to thinking about the workload implications for the special school staff, perhaps it might be worth considering what it feels like to be a PSA, effectively being asked to lead an EP or ASLS teacher in how to carry out tasks that would normally be done by another PSA? Yet we all know that the PSAs are paid a fraction of the salary of their teaching and EP colleagues, and that, despite the unions raising this for years, little to nothing has been done to ensure more security of employment, career progression and appropriate salary structures for our PSAs.\n- Pupils who are not receiving appropriate support are far more likely to exhibit dysregulated behaviours. In many cases, this manifests as violent outbursts. With large numbers of staff in special schools who do not know the pupils, and are not trained in how to work with them, the risks of such behaviours escalating are greatly increased. I hope I do not need to spell out the possible consequences of this?\n- This “repurposing” is having a very big impact on the EPs and ASLS themselves. Many do not feel confident to undertake the work they are being asked to do. They worry about their ability to function in the special schools, the consequences should they not be able to properly support the pupils with whom they are working, and about their own health, safety and wellbeing. They also worry about the impact on the pupils they cannot support, and on the mainstream schools who are not receiving the usual level of input. And, naturally, they worry that they will be expected to pick up tasks and just, somehow, manage to deliver a normal service, despite spending time working in other settings.\n- The pupils and staff in the mainstream schools are also feeling the impact of this decision. By definition, EPs and ASLS teachers work with pupils who are vulnerable, yet the capacity of the services to support these children is being reduced – and it was already struggling to meet demand. Schools are endeavouring to make up for this lack, but they have neither the resources nor the expertise. Some pupils will, because of the lack of support to meet their individual needs, withdraw, or struggle on in silence. Others will lash out. Whatever the case, the pupils, their families, and the schools will be left trying to cope.\nSchools are receiving constant criticism over the impact of mitigations. Often, these criticisms seem to be coming from the same people who complained most vociferously about schools being closed – and who will be most vocal if current mitigations don’t work, and pupils do have to be sent home. Yet, to many in schools, it feels like those are the only voices being heard by the media and politicians. Please consider the following:\n- Face coverings – I haven’t spoken to anyone who wants to wear a mask. And for teachers, who rely so heavily on clear communication, they are even more draining. Yet, when schools are in the midst of a full-blown staffing crisis, and when there is much peer-reviewed evidence to show that face coverings can reduce transmission, surely it behoves us all to encourage compliance with this mitigation?\n- Trips and visits – again, none of us want to stop these. They can be one of the most enjoyable aspects of education, as well as being of huge benefit to pupils. I take on board the argument many make that parents can choose to take their own children to the theatre, museums etc, so that to deny schools the ability to do this disadvantages those pupils who do not have families that can do this – and, in normal times I would be making that same case. But we are not in normal times. Suppose a school sanctions a trip that involves 4 teachers (this would be a reasonable number for a fairly small trip) and, as is not improbable, all 4 of those teachers are named as contacts as a result of that trip and have to self-isolate. As things stand, if those 4 absences are added to the other absences most schools are enduring, the likely consequence will be classes being sent home. What would be the public reaction then? What criticisms would school and CEC management be facing?\n- A similar argument applies when considering the risks around having parents come into schools. If we are serious about saying that the most important thing is keeping schools open, then surely something that risks a large number of staff and pupils simultaneously being declared contacts has to be avoided?\n- The sudden change in arrangements around school staff being given flu jags (from in-school provision to staff having to make their own arrangements) whilst probably unavoidable (and certainly outwith CEC’s control) added to many staff feeling that the talk about prioritising education is entirely rhetorical. The fall off in pupil vaccination rates is adding to these concerns.\nThe above are just some of the issues with which schools are contending. I haven’t even touched on problems with ICT, nor the increasing levels of distressed and dysregulated behaviours being exhibited by pupils in mainstream classes, nor the work schools continue to do to support families in poverty, nor the way many parents do not seem to recognise that schools are under huge amounts of pressure, and are making utterly unreasonable demands of staff, nor the massive pressures on school budgets, nor…\nGiven all the above, I would ask several things of you.\n- Please be aware of these pressures. Where you can do so without adding further to their workload, reach out to school staff, and particularly school leaders, to find out what things are like on the ground, and to ask what you can do to help.\n- Bear all this in mind when talking to parents, the press etc. Of course parents want the best for their children, and of course you want education in Edinburgh to be the best – so do we, and so does everyone working in Edinburgh’s schools. Surely it is clear that unless the educational workforce feels valued and supported, then it cannot deliver the best outcomes? If what we feel is undermined, undervalued, overworked and overstretched, then the system will be less and less resilient and crises will be magnified. As councillors, you are leaders in the city, and also have a duty of care to employees – what you say and do matters. The tone of your statements make a huge difference – please use your voice to show your value for the work being done in schools and please be realistic when talking to parents about what schools can deliver under current circumstances.\n- The same realism is needed when you are undertaking your work of support and challenge around the work of schools, officers, council reports etc. We are very much in a recovery phase – indeed, many would say that calling it recovery is too early, and we are still in the midst of the pandemic, with some pressures being worse now than they were last year. Expecting schools to be able to deliver all the improvements that were highlighted as needed before covid hit is impossible. We need a phased approach that is responsive to current burdens. Further, we need to make efforts to dramatically reduce the burden on staff, and particularly, HTs, and CEC must do all in its power to make sure that its decisions\n- This will be particularly true when you are making decisions around budgets. Speak to HTs in your wards about the many costs they are having to bear – supply, ICT etc, and the funds they have to meet those costs, and use that information when thinking about further cuts to schools. Remember, too, the cuts that have been made to all the supports to schools, and the fact that they are having to compensate for the loss of those services.\n- Whilst much around teacher pay, terms and conditions are outwith CEC’s control, the same is not true for PSAs. Many teachers have said that having stability in PSA staffing; PSAs who have time to undertake appropriate training; and PSAs who are properly paid and valued, so that they stay in role, doing hugely valuable work supporting pupils, would make a massive difference. CEC has long spoken about addressing recruitment, pay and career structures for PSAs and other support staff (Business Managers and other administrative support staff are similarly overburdened). Seeing serious commitments around this, including the proper funding, would go a long way towards starting to relieve pressures in schools, and Edinburgh EIS would welcome this being made a priority.\n- I assume you are aware that Education Scotland has announced that school inspections are restarting? There are many reasons why many of us feel this is an appalling decision (I recommend you read this article, for a very thoughtful take on the situation by a HT https://www.tes.com/news/why-school-inspections-dont-make-sense-right-now). On Friday, in response to motions brought by the Edinburgh Local Association, the EIS has agreed to a national campaign in opposition to this decision. Given the staffing pressures in Edinburgh schools, we would welcome a strong commitment from CEC to back such a campaign, and to do all in its power to prevent inspection activity in Edinburgh schools. The idea that, at the same time as EPs, ASLS and others are rolling their sleeves up and going into schools to simply keep the doors open, someone else is going to stand in the back of a classroom with a clipboard is insanity. If Education Scotland has the capacity to scrutinise, surely it also has the capacity to send staff in to work directly with children and help in core pandemic mitigations? Again, I would be more than happy to talk to any councillor about the impact the announcement of the resumption of inspections has had on staff morale and wellbeing.\nMy apologies for such a lengthy email, but I hope you can appreciate why I felt it is necessary to email you all individually. The unions have been raising many of these concerns in JCG and other forums for some time now, but I wanted to be sure all councillors understand that it is not back to normal in schools and that, to the contrary, many schools and many staff are close to breaking. I would welcome the opportunity to talk further about all this to all councillors, either individually or on a party basis.\nIn the early stages of the pandemic there was much talk of valuing key workers, and of showing kindness. Right now your staff are not feeling valued, nor experiencing much kindness from others, and anything that can be done to shift that narrative would be welcomed.",

I shall place updates on my Facebook page when I get them.\nBackground\nCouncillors approved a citywide 20mph speed limit network for Edinburgh at the Transport and Environment Committee on 13 January 2015 following extensive consultation and research showing a high level of public support for its introduction. The roll out of the Scheme is planned in 4 phases between June 2016 and March 2018.\nThe City of Edinburgh Council is introducing (with the exception of strategic routes) a citywide 20mph speed limit, the first city in Scotland to do so. The project aims to:\n- reduce the risk and severity of accidents by reducing speed, increasing the safety and well being of all road users. This is in line with the Council’s Vision Zero philosophy, working towards the provision of a modern road network where all are safe from the risk of death or seriously injury\n- create more favourable conditions for pedestrians and cyclists in the city. The extensive network of 20mph streets will help embed the QuietRoutes and the Cycle Friendly City Programme in a context that is safe and comfortable for cyclists\n- create streets that are attractive, social and people friendly\n- implement Policy Safe4 set out in Edinburgh’s Local Transport Strategy 2014-2019\nPrior to commencement of the project, over 50% of Edinburgh’s residential streets were already in 20mph zones. The project extends the 20mph speed limit to the city centre, main shopping streets and residential areas while retaining a strategic network of roads at 30mph and 40mph. A map of the 20mph network and implementation timetable is available at www.edinburgh.gov.uk/20mph.\nProgress to Date\nThree Construction Phases are complete and live. Phase One (City Centre and Rural West Edinburgh) became effective on 31 July 2016, Phase Two (North, East and South Central Edinburgh) followed on 28 February 2017 and Phase Three (North West and West) on 16 August 2017.\nPhase Four\nPhase four of the network covers South Edinburgh, much of which is already within 20mph zones. Areas where new 20mph signage will be installed include Woodhall, Colinton, Oxgangs, Swanston, Fairmilehead and Greenbank. Phase four completes the programme.\nSignage\nInstallation of signs and lines is due to start week beginning 22 January 2018. Work is scheduled to take around 6 weeks, with minimal disruption expected. The new speed limit for this phase is planned to become effective on 5 March 2018.\nThe introduction of the new 20mph limit relies on signage alone, although existing speed humps or other traffic calming will remain unchanged. 20mph signs will mark the entrance and exit of a 20mph area where the speed limit changes. These signs will be supplemented by smaller repeater signs or road markings with speed limit roundels.\nFurther information regarding the legislation and signage design guidance for 20mph speed limits is included as an appendix to this briefing note.\nEnforcement\nPolice Scotland supports lower speeds across the city and is working with the Council to achieve this. The Police will continue to prioritise enforcement of the limit in streets with significant numbers of casualties and areas near schools.\nAs well as police enforcement such as warnings and issuing of speeding tickets, we are working to change driver behaviour through a citywide programme of awareness raising and education. Police Scotland have carried out a number of road safety education and enforcement exercises at local primary schools involving the 20mph ‘Reducer’ mascot and are helping to raise awareness and encourage compliance of 20mph through social media and other community events.\nSince April 2017 we have been trialling the installation of temporary vehicle activated speed signs for short periods at locations across the city to encourage compliance and reinforce the 20mph message.\nMonitoring\nThe Council is monitoring the outcomes of the 20mph programme and is carrying out a variety of ‘before and after’ surveys. Monitoring to assess traffic speeds, road casualties and public perceptions are all included in this programme which will continue throughout all phases. Monitoring results will be reported to Committee one year after completion of the network to allow evaluation of the full programme. Committee will then be able to consider whether any further action is necessary.\nThe University of Edinburgh and the Scottish Collaboration for Public Health Research and Policy has secured funding for and commenced an independent evaluation of the public health impact of 20mph speed limits in Edinburgh and Belfast. The study which is funded by the National Institute for Health Research involves partnership with other UK universities, NHS Scotland and the charity Sustrans. It is the largest study of its kind in the UK and will run until 2020.\nCommunication and Engagement\nA detailed communication and engagement strategy supports scheme implementation. Partners including Police Scotland, Sustrans, NHS Lothian, Living Streets and Spokes are working with the Council to deliver the strategy. Each phase is accompanied by a local awareness campaign to familiarise different road users with the new scheme, promote road safety, active travel, better places and compliance with the new legal speed limits. The awareness campaign for phase four includes posters, leaflets, social media, lamp post wraps, bus shelter advertising and an advert in the South Edinburgh Directory.\nIn addition to local publicity, we are planning the following engagement initiatives to mark the final phase going live.\n- 20mph video competition for primary pupils around the theme of ‘life is better at 20mph’. The three winning videos will be used on the Council’s Facebook, Twitter and YouTube channels as part of the 20mph education and awareness programme\n- Glow in the dark bike ride around the city centre in the run up to the final phase going live\n- Light Projection of 20mph image on iconic building in Edinburgh\n- 20mph toolkit to encourage compliance and support communities to promote 20mph in their own neighbourhoods.\nInformation is disseminated via the Council’s website, and social media. A Facebook page with photos, video clips and posts has been set up to act as the focal online ‘community’ for the project. The page links through to the programme website where more details can be obtained.",

I am mindful that military personnel based in my Ward served in Afghanistan, and some gave their lives (there is a memorial inside Dreghorn Barracks). These service men and women may well have worked with the refugees previously employed by the British Services detailed below. Helping these families is the very least we can do.\nBriefing\nMembers will be aware of the recent deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan and press reports of the various ways in which the UK Government is responding to its humanitarian implications.\nOfficers are in regular contact with both the UK and Scottish Governments to develop plans for how best the Council and our partners can offer support and housing to as many Afghan refugees as possible.\nTwo options are currently being progressed:\n- Permanent resettlement for a cohort of Afghans (and their families) previously employed by the British Services in Afghanistan is being explored. They would be housed in surplus MOD property.

I visited the school on Monday morning to observe the pupils and traffic, and I could see that the queuing system at the main entrance was orderly and efficient, and that staff were working hard to create a welcoming atmosphere by playing Christmas music and wearing festive clothing.\nAlthough the stated focus of this scheme is the response to Covid-19, road safety issues around the school are well known. Although the Covid trigger for the scheme is not noted, I understand the issue is the risk of cars hitting one of the many children queuing to enter the school. This is a particular concern at the Buckstone Loan East / Buckstone Circle junction. I counted 10-20 parents driving cars (often quite large SUV type) around this junction. Can the Spaces for People Team confirm what the trigger is for the use of Covid powers is in this instance, and explain why this scheme was not progressed sooner given that it is labelled “urgent” and “emergency”?\nThe comments I have received from residents/parents can really be separated into two types – uncertainty about what’s proposed inside the cordon, and concerns about what the impact may be outside it\nI chatted face-to-face with 10-15 residents living inside the cordon on Sunday. I could see that the Council could have benefited from engaging with these people before drawing up the plans. There was uncertainty about the following:\n- Are the plans for peak time only, or 24/7?\n- Can Blue badge holders visit at any time?\n- Can deliveries be made at any time?\n- What arrangements are in place for visitors/taxis/carers/tradespeople? Will these people and residents be issued permits?\n- Can school staff still use the car park? I understand teachers do normally have a plan in place to use their own cars to transport children in the case of an emergency.\n- How will the “residents only” access on Buckstone Circle be enforced?\n- Will any parking spaces be lost?\n- Will the closure barrier be well designed – will it compromise planters or cones?\nAdditionally, any impact on gritting and waste collection will have to be carefully considered. These large vehicles will find it difficult to turn in the restricted area. This and points 1-8 above need to be clarified, and based on this the residents should be given a further chance to comment.\nThe concerns outside the cordon largely reflect the pre-existing road safety issues around the school. Normally, there are three areas of concern: (1) the area within the proposed cordon, (2) the hill access to the school on Buckstone Lea and, (3) the raised table crossing adjacent to the junction of Buckstone Loan East / Buckstone Gate. Residents are justifiably concerned that this plan will exacerbate the latter two problem areas and also worsen problems on Buckstone Close. Has this been anticipated?\nIf the plans are to proceed, I feel the following should happen to reduce this impact on the surrounding area:\n- Parking should be prevented at the Buckstone Loan East / Buckstone Gate junction (in line with the Highway Code).\n- The raised table crossing adjacent to the junction of Buckstone Loan East / Buckstone Gate should have its markings refreshed.\n- The following giveway markings should be refreshed: Buckstone Loan East / Buckstone Gate, Buckstone Loan East / Buckstone Lea, Buckstone Loan East / Buckstone Close, Buckstone Loan East / Buckstone Circle, High Buckstone / Buckstone Circle, Buckstone Loan / Buckstone Circle and Buckstone Gate / Buckstone Road. The Council should ensure dropped kerbs are in place at these junctions where appropriate.\n- Homes on Buckstone Loan East, Buckstone Circle, Buckstone Close, Buckstone Lea and Buckstone Gate should be provided with access protection markings for their driveways, or have any existing markings refreshed.\n- Steps should be taken to discourage parents from using cars to drop-off/pick-up children on Buckstone Lea.\n- Steps should be taken to remind Buckstone residents of the hazard parked cars and overgrown hedges (etc) pose to pedestrians and those with buggies/wheelchairs/guide dogs. This is particularly important on the arterial routes through Buckstone and the streets surrounding the school. Likewise, a reminder should be issued regarding speeding on the estate.\nIn terms of accessibility, many disabled people depend on cars (both to drive and as a passenger) and taxis. Road changes shouldn’t prevent disabled people from being able to stop near the school. Changes to usual travel patterns can add to anxiety for all of us, but to some disabled people in particular. The scheme should therefore be seen in this context – continual changes should therefore be avoided where possible, and should be effectively communicated to the public (including disabled people).",

The bikes will enable our hard working cops to go off-road to enter and patrol our public parks, paths and waste ground.\nThe only question I have about this is: Why is the Council funding the purchase of equipment that Police Scotland needs to fight crime? After all, since Police Scotland was formed in 2013 it has been directly funded by the Scottish Government. Nonetheless, in the current financial year the Council will take well over £2.5m out of money it should be spending on schools, social care and potholes to help fund Police Scotland.\nIndeed, Edinburgh is paying this money despite having its budget cut by around 10% in recent years. We currently pay over ten times per head of population more than any other local authority. Despite that we have one of the highest crime rates in Scotland, and one of the lowest number of police per head of population. Unbelievably, Edinburgh pays more and gets less on policing than the rest of Scotland.\nPolice Scotland have been clear, however, that if Scotland’s Capital does not pay this “protection money” policing in Edinburgh will be cut. In March Police Scotland made this threat: “Where funding is removed by a local authority then resources are removed from that division, as has already occurred elsewhere”.\nAudit Scotland have been clear, however, that Police Scotland’s use of resources “did not demonstrate value for money in the use of public funds”. Indeed, it was accused of spending public cash “like Monopoly money” when it was revealed they had handed out £18 million to an army of consultants. It was also reported that Deputy Chief Constable Rose Fitzpatrick was paid £67,000 as part of a “relocation package” – apparently she asked for it to be paid as a cash transfer. No wonder they want £2.5m from the Council!\nI think Edinburgh’s cops should have all the tools they need to keep us safe, but the time has come to take a hard look at how Police Scotland is allocating resources to Scotland’s capital city. The SNP Government must fund them appropriately and they must spend the money wisely. Taking money out of schools, social care and transport can’t be the answer.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_03_14_briefing-electric-vehicle-charging-in-edinburgh_comment-page-1/content_675.html": "Below is a briefing on City of Edinburgh Council’s provision of charging for electric vehicles. The expansion in 2020 will focus on tenemental areas where there is little scope for people to install their own charging point. I have raised concerns about this and the need for charging hubs for heavy users such as taxis.\nI have had two people contact me recently who had bought an elecric vehicle without really thinking about where they would charge it. Please consider this if you are thinking of buying one.\nBriefing\nI can advise that currently, the Council have 43 chargers available to the public, within Council operated facilities, and are about to install another 35 across the city which should be delivered by late spring 2020. The current chargers are based as follows: West Pilton Gardens (2), Captains Road (5), Drumbrae Library (2), Straiton park and Ride (5), Kirkliston library (1), Craigentinny Community Centre (2), Bankhead Depot (4) Russell Road (2), Ingliston Park & Ride (7). Hermiston Park and Ride (3), Westerhailes Healthy Living Centre (2) Murrayburn Cab Depot (3), South Queensferry (5).\nThe additional 35 chargers will be located at Clocktower, Craigmillar, Saughton Park and Kingshaugh. Again, it should be noted that all these chargers will be located within Council operated facilities and will be installed separately to the on-street implementation plan.\nI can also advise that Charge Place Scotland (CPS) is the current contractor appointed by Transport Scotland to provide a back office function for EVs nationally. This includes monitoring usage of chargers, dealing with faults, promoting free and/or available charging spaces and providing information monthly via CPS software to the Council. The CPS website provides a helpful link to the EV charging points within Edinburgh and across Scotland and can be found at: https://chargeplacescotland.org/ . The website advises users which bays are currently available or in use.\nFor on-street bays – a detailed Project Plan has been developed along with identifying specific locations for the installation of 66 on-street charging points (including 32 fast chargers, nine rapid chargers and 25 slow chargers) across the city to strengthen the existing network. The Transport and Environment Committee report from 5 March 2019 entitled ‘Electric Vehicle Business Case: Implementation Plan’ provides further details. The Project Delivery Plan, included within Appendix 2 of the report, provides details on the commencement dates of the various stages of the plan.\nUnfortunately, due to staff restructuring there has been some slippage in the proposed Project Plan. However, conversations are ongoing with Transport Scotland and the energy network operator to ensure that the charging points will be delivered.\nThe Council is also working with some pioneering research and development firms to introduce vehicle to grid charging and wireless charging which will see an additional 22 chargers installed over the coming year which will free up publicly accessible charge points further.",

Of course, the reality is somewhat different – Scots are being ground between two competing elites obsessed with their brand of nationalism.\nAlthough their politics are dissimilar, both the SNP and Tory brexiteers are fighting for different forms of independence at any cost using turbo-charged nationalist rhetoric. Like Trump, both are intent on blaming others for the problems they face. Both assume the moral high ground. Both will destroy public services and hold back a generation to reach their hollow ideological goal.\nIf Nicola Sturgeon wants Scotland to choose between the UK and the EU, she needs to start being honest. We’d be leaving the UK, our biggest trading partner by a mile, to be left outside the EU for an indefinite period of time. Yes, we could apply to join the EU but what would the conditions of membership be? The Euro? Schengen?\nIt’s time Nicola Sturgeon started putting Scotland first and back those from all parties working to maintain Scotland’s position in the UK and protect access to the EU markets.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_11_07_update-lanark-road-braid-road-spaces-for-people-schemes-2_comment-page-1/content_388.html": "The Evening News is today reporting that it has been briefed by the Council that the Transport Committee will next week “rubber stamp” the Lanark Road Spaces for People scheme and the continued closure of Braid Road. This is despite the final plans and the details of the recent consultation not yet having been made public.\nLanark Road\nOvernight the “Spaces for People Update – November 2020” report appeared on the Council’s website. For the Lanark Road scheme, the Council is now publicly stating what I reported on the 28th of October – the aim is “to provide a safe, protected cycling route as an alternative to the canal\ntowpath and Water of Leith shared use path...”.\nFinalised plans are not presented. Indeed, the scheme is described simply using 13 bullet points. It is claimed that the scheme will “form part of a longer route intended to provide an alternative to the Water of Leith and Union Canal towpath to enable physical distancing and reduce congestion and conflict on these busy routes…”, but no details of this are provided. The recent consultation gets no mention.\nBraid Report\nThe Braid Road closure also gets a mention in the Council’s report. This has been closed for some time due to the large numbers of people trying to access The Hermitage in early lockdown raising concerns about social distancing. Whilst difficulties maintaining social distancing at site are now much less of a concern, the Council has refused to back down and reopen the road even on a trial basis.\nThe Council is again saying the closure is needed to enable the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route. Although the Quiet Route plans now appear far less ambitious than I previously reported, the Council want to “maintain the existing Braid Road closure and introduce specific measures near the St Peter’s and James Gillespie’s schools to provide a coherent quiet connection from the Greenbank area through to the existing Meadows active travel network”.\n“At present the closure of Braid Road has effectively removed through traffic from the Cluny area. If Braid Road was re-opened in any direction this would re-introduce traffic to this area, primarily on Midmar Avenue and Hermitage Drive which would cause a conflict between general traffic, and users of the quiet route on Hermitage Drive. This could significantly undermine the attractiveness of the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Corridor.”\nCITY OF EDINBURGH COUNCIL\nThe report accepts that the Braid Road closure means traffic on Comiston Road is 11% higher than pre-Covid levels. Whilst this may mean less traffic is passing James Gillespie’s, far more is passing South Morningside Primary School – is more noise and pollution there acceptable? Additionally, added congestion on Comiston Road means buses are delayed and passengers are exposed to Covid transmission risks for longer.\nAgain, no finalised plans have been make public for the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route and there is now mention of the consultation responses.\n09-11-2020 Update – I now have a plan for this scheme – it is at the bottom of this post.\nLegal Advice\nThere are benefits to the Lanark Road scheme and the continued closure of Braid Road. Both, however, come with consequences for local residents and businesses. In my view, the Council has a duty to present evidence based arguments which show the benefits outweigh the consequences.\nIndeed the use of the Covid TTRO processes removes the rights local people and businesses have to be consulted on these changes. However, using the Covid TTRO process must be a proportionate response to the pandemic. The Council has already been rocked by claims that these powers are not being used properly.\nThe legal position is only mentioned once in the report, and this is only in relation to the Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route – “All of the measures proposed have been considered in respect of the legal powers associated with TTRO powers. An assessment of the measures and the associated legislation has concluded that these proposals have been developed to provide access to appropriate areas which enables safe active travel for all ages during the transition through and beyond COVID-19.”\nThat’s it. The “assessment” is not shared and no argument is made to explain why the scheme is proportionate or how it warrants the use of TTRO powers specifically. There is no similar statement for the Lanark Road scheme.\nWe all want safer streets, less pollution and better support for walking and cycling, but this can only happen when the Council works with communities. Time and time again with Spaces for People in Edinburgh we have seen that even the best transport engineers will come unstuck if they don’t draw on local lived experience when drawing up their designs. If the Council wants to go beyond the Covid TTRO remit or can’t show that the benefits of these schemes outweigh the consequences, this is the approach it must adopt.",

In this role he would have a duty to put Edinburgh before Nicola Sturgeon.\nI’m therefore disappointed to see him buckle so readily when his party’s elite suggest they will remove funding from the City Region Deal for the £162 tram extension down Leith Walk and on to Newhaven (report, 30/05/17). Instead he argues that the project should be funded by city debt and potential fare increases. This flies in the face of the SNP manifesto commitment to ensure the extension is delivered “without placing undue pressure on the city’s finances”.\nWhilst the SNP’s claim to be “Stronger for Scotland” may now be rather questionable, Mr McVey is certainly not stronger for Edinburgh.\nLike many people, I had my doubts about the original tram project and want any bungling in the past exposed. However, I’m in no doubt that the tram extension will help boost some of Edinburgh’s most deprived areas and assist in the revitalisation of Leith Walk. It will also make large parts of northern Edinburgh more attractive to developers and, therefore, take some pressure off our green belt.\nTo make this reality, however, Councillor McVey needs to remember the commitment his party made to the City Region Deal in the past and stand up for Edinburgh!\nAbove all else, Edinburgh needs a leader that puts Edinburgh first.

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_06_12_what-next-for-spaces-for-people-in-colinton-oxgangs-fairmilehead/content_376.html": "Introduction\nFollowing the recent consultation, the Council has now published its proposals for the Spaces for People Schemes. The report was published at 6:30pm yesterday – hours after it was given to the press.\nThe key messages appear to be:\n- Removal of “shopping street” measures for pedestrians;\n- Cycle routes to remain; and\n- School schemes face uncertainty.\nNo scheme will be made permanent yet, but will instead be converted from a TTRO (Temporary) to a ETRO (Experimental) – this will mean that changes can be made on an ongoing basis and that the public will be consulted more fully.\nDetails are below for the schemes which touch on my Ward.\nSchools\nAcross the city, these were perhaps the post popular SfP schemes. The Council is proposing to “retain those schemes that have the support of school communities when public health guidance changes”. By the end of 2021 “it is proposed to re-prioritise the School Travel Plan review and work with schools which have had part time vehicle prohibitions under SfP, with a view to developing measures tailored to the individual schools and which have support from the school concerned and the parents”.\nThe new path installed at St Mark’s RC Primary School will be made permanent. Good!\nLanark Road\nThe Council acknowledges that there was “significant net support for removal” of this scheme. It is proposed that this scheme will be retained, however, as the measures have “reduced the effective road width and facilitated the introduction of a 30mph speed limit”. Parking along the route will be reviewed with a view to increasing capacity.\nComiston Road\nAs with Lanark Road, the Council acknowledges that there was “significant net support for removal” of this scheme. It is proposed that this scheme will be retained, however, as the measures have “reduced the effective road width and facilitated the introduction of a 30mph speed limit”. This is ironic as reducing the limit was not part of the initial proposal, but was requested by me after comments from local residents.\nParking along the Route will be reviewed with a view to increasing capacity.\nIt is also proposed to “consider extending the existing bus lane southwards”. This is to address the recently reported northbound queuing on the approach to the Greenbank junction. This should also mean that vehicles waiting to turn right can be more easily passed.\nBraid Road\nThe Council notes “the Braid Road closure attracted the highest level of net support for removal in both the public consultation and market research, though there was also a significant level of support for retention” – it attracted the highest net level of demand for removal.\nThe Council notes, however, that since the consultation started Braid Road reopened southbound – “the road has subsequently been reopened to motorised traffic southbound, with new protected cycle lanes provided. This reopening should reduce southbound congestion on Morningside Road, which had increased in association with the closure.”\nThere is still, however, a lack of coherence between the Braid Road and Comiston Road schemes. We are also being told that the Braid Road restrictions are needed as it “facilitates the Meadows to Greenbank cycling Quiet Connection”, but at the consultation stage for this scheme we were told this wasn’t the case!\nNo change is proposed, but a commitment is given to “monitor traffic levels and journey times on Comiston Road to inform future mitigation measures/decisions”.\nConclusion\nWhether people love the SfP scheme or hate it, there can be no doubt that it has not been handled well. It’s very clear that some were only too happy to exclude the public from the debate. Whilst some schemes may well be popular, there is not much in this report that shows that Council is willing to engage constructively with the public in Edinburgh on the issue. Rather than winning hearts and minds, they are bulldozing opinion related to Braid Road, Comiston Road & Lanark Road.\nFor me, the big issue is the Comiston Road / Braid Road scheme and the failure to deal with them as in integrated corridor. These roads run closely together (200m apart at the most) but we are faced with a botched cycle schemes on each route. I’d rather the council did Braid Road well for cyclists, and provided better support for buses on Comiston Road.\nThe Comiston Road SfP scheme in particular is an issue for me. Before SfP the most dangerous spot was around Buckstone Shops. This has not changed. All the SfP bollards installed there have now been removed as they have been “struck by passing traffic on multiple occasions”. I asked if this meant “bollards are being removed where cyclists need them most?”, and SfP did not reply.\nI remain hopeful, however, that the ETRO process will mandate the Council to listen to residents and give them a greater say on the future of these schemes. Before that happens, however, the Council needs to show some humility and admit avoidable mistakes have been made.",

Walking around our Capital’s streets, however, I also feel a little ashamed about what international visitors see. Our roads are potholed. Too often, our footpaths are grubby and the bins are overflowing.\nThis is not a criticism of the City of Edinburgh Council’s hardworking staff. Budgets have been cut year on year by the SNP Government.\nIndeed, most recently the SNP forced the Great Edinburgh International Cross-Country event to be cancelled. As one of the few world-class sporting events staged annually in Scotland, it attracted visitors and coverage from around the world.\nIf the SNP Government had given Edinburgh the ability to raise revenues in the same way cities around the world are able to, this event could easily have been funded alongside improvements to our city.\nIt is utter hypocrisy that our SNP Government is obsessed independence, but give none to our Capital. All we get is cuts.\nLike Rome, New York, Vienna, Amsterdam and Paris, Edinburgh attracts tourist from around the world in droves. In 2014 3,795,000 tourists visited Edinburgh and stayed an average of 3.5 days – that’s 13 million overnight stays.\nUnlike these cities, however, Edinburgh has no hotel tax. If you stay a night in a New York hotel, the city gains $15. Likewise, in Paris a night in its very best hotel sees that city gain a more modest €1.20.\nEdinburgh’s Labour Councillors, together with Monica Lennon MSP, are arguing for our Capital to be given the right to set a hotel tax and use the income to make the city a better place for tourists and residents alike.\nA night in an Edinburgh hotel costs from £10 to an eye-watering £1000, with most rooms falling within the £90 to £175 band. Taxing overnight stays in larger establishments at a modest 1% would not impact on the ability of Edinburgh to attract tourists, but would raise £10m-£20m for the city.\nA modest tax on this industry would help reverse the cuts to services and help ensure Edinburgh continues to attract people from around the world to visit, study or work.",

Cardownie would have a point if I were actually part of the Scottish Government, but I am not. Whilst he and his nationalist chums in Edinburgh are shy about holding the Scottish Government to account, I see it as my duty to stand up for Edinburgh on issues ranging from the crisis at the new Sick Kids Hospital to the under-funding of policing in our capital.\nThirdly, I am attacked by Cardownie for daring to raise concerns about Council Leader Adam McVey’s comments on a range of issues. It’s true that I have misgivings about his approach to dealing with the apparently out of control tourist economy and his failure to ensure Edinburgh is fairly funded. On these points, however, I am simply echoing the concerns of many Edinburgh residents.

The independent investigation triggered by the Council sought to understand how it had dealt with any allegations made against Sean Bell, and whether or not they related to his position as a Social Worker.\nOn Wednesday I spoke to the independent legal team leading the investigation, and read the full 145 page unredacted report (reportedly based on 15,000 pages of evidence). I read this report in the knowledge that Sean Bell has died, so can’t respond to the charges made against him.\nNonetheless, the full report (and the summary is linked below) makes clear that Sean Bell had been accused of bullying, abusive behaviour and misuse of public funds in the workplace, and was not considered by his colleagues to have a positive attitude towards women.\nWhile the Inquiry Team heard from two female CEC employees who spoke positively about SB’s manner, most of the women interviewed by the Inquiry Team were disparaging about him. He was described as a ‘bully’ and, in respect of his general conduct around women in the workplace, he was labelled as a ‘sleaze’ and a ‘dirty creep.’… ….Words such as ‘lecherous’ and ‘predatory’ were used by witnesses when asked to describe SB’s behaviour around women in the workplace.\nOfficial Inquiry Report\nIn addition to this he has been accused of assault, domestic abuse, sexual assault and rape. The alleged events took place over a number of years outside the workplace, but did involve Council staff.\nSurvivors of these alleged attacks made repeated credible formal and informal complaints against Sean Bell over a number of years, often with the direct support of friends and colleagues. It’s suggested that Sean Bell used his status within the Council to systematically undermine and discredit those women making allegations against him.\nHe put a lot of energy into his public and professional persona while the reality was very different. The emotional and psychological abuse continued for many years after. It’s been difficult to watch him reach such a senior position in the Social Work Department and hard to believe that none of his colleagues ever saw glimpses of who he really was.\nSurvivor (quote from media report)\nLet me be clear, even where events take place outside the Council people should still take seriously criminal allegations made against staff. The investigation found occasions where Sean Bell’s line manger should have taken a more formal approach, or perhaps even referred the matter to the Police. Keep in mind that all of these people are well versed in how abusers are able to hide their tracks, and evade being held to account. They also know that abusers should not be working with vulnerable people.\nIt appears that, despite the fact that Sean Bell was trusted to support vulnerable people, an “old boys’ network” within the Council (which he was a member of) sought to deal with the matter informally.\nOne witness told the Inquiry Team that complaining about SB’s conduct was futile as he was protected by ‘the old boys’ network.’\nOfficial Inquiry Report\nMy mum also went to them and asked if they knew what he’d done to me. The response was just that Sean was sorry.\nSurvivor (quote from media report)\nAfter many years of being side-lined and discredited, one of the survivors of Sean Bell’s alleged abuse made a credible allegation again. This time she was listened to and supported, and the Police were called. The case against Sean Bell was so strong that criminal charges were brought forward after just a few days.\nWhen I read the full report I found it unbelievable because it appeared to be a textbook example of abuse – A man charged with protecting vulnerable people using his power and influence to harm the lives of others, and take away their dignity, credibility and self-respect. He appears to have been protected by is own arrogance, and people who appear to have put personal loyalty before helping vulnerable people.\nI’m angry that his death means that Sean Bell won’t face charges in court, but I am glad that the survivors of his alleged abuse will not have to face him again. My anger is balanced, however, by my respect for the brave women who where unwilling to stay quiet, and for the social worker who acted quickly to get the police involved.\nThe report is linked below and will be debated in Full Council next week. It contains quite sickening allegations which may upset some, particularly those with of experience violent or sex based abuse. Please remember that Rape Crisis and Edinburgh Women’s Aid are there to help.\nUpdate – 29-10-21\nYesterday in Full Council we debated the investigation into Sean Bell, a Council Social Worker accused of verbal abuse, violent abuse, sexual abuse, and rape. We had a chance to question Susanne Tanner QC FCIArb who led the investigation and Andrew Kerr (the Council’s Chief Executive). My questions focussed on the “old boys’ network” in the Council, and why the Council’s policies are so deficient. The mood was dark, and a further report on the culture in the Council is due in December. We also learned that only 34 of Edinburgh’s 63 Councillors attended the many sessions to read the full report, and one of those that did attend acted unprofessionally and shouted at the legal team – ironic given that Bell was accused of verbal abuse.

The speed limit will be reduced to 30mph (Good news!).\nIf you look at the linked file a great many comments were made, but the response does not always contain the detail I had hoped for. I am also disappointed that the Council has refused to view this plan alongside the Braid Road closure and demonstrate some “joined up thinking” in doing so.\nMe: Will Braid Road remain closed? Has the interaction with Braid Road been fully considered?\nCouncil: Braid Road will be considered separately on its own merits.\nBriefing\nThank you for your comments regarding the proposed emergency road measures on Comiston Road. Comments have been reviewed and a summary of comments is included in the attached assessment feedback form to the Council Incident Management Team (CIMT). Following consideration by the CIMT on 17 July 2020 the proposals have been approved for implementation.\nOfficers will be monitoring all the temporary measures and will make adjustments as necessary to mitigate any impacts.\nInitially, these measures will be implemented using road markings and temporary traffic management materials (such as those used on Old Dalkeith Road, and Crewe Road South) only, in order to implement the changes as soon as possible. We are in the process of appointing contractors and expect this work to commence during early August – though timelines may be subject to change. At this time there will be no changes to bus stops and the layout on street may differ from the approved designs at some locations.\nThereafter the Council will deliver the changes outlined in the designs in full. This delay is due to the limited availability of some of the required materials, including the ‘Greenwich Wand Orcas’ which will separate cycles from traffic, and the materials which will be used for several of the Bus Stops. We expect that these more robust measures will be implemented during Autumn/ Winter, though this may also be subject to change.\nFurther information about how the Council is implementing temporary road measures to support safe walking, wheeling and cycling is available at www.edinburgh.gov.uk/spacesforpeople\nRegards\nSpaces for People Team\nFiles",

I understand that the Transport Convener had a briefing following the “Design Risk Assessment Review” and based on this the project was permitted to proceed without a Road Safety Audit being undertaken. I am disappointed that this briefing has not been shared with Councillors which represent the area, and that we were not involved in the decision making process. The request for a meeting with residents has also went unanswered.\nUpdate 1 [12-08-2020] – I asked about the target date for completing the works which will trigger the next Braid Road review: “It is difficult to give an exact date at the moment. W e intend to take the Greenbank Crossroads to Meadows scheme to Notification next week. Assuming it is approved for delivery the following week we would then work with a contractor to develop a programme for delivery. Once we have a better idea of timelines I will be happy to circulate an update.”\nUpdate 2 [14-08-2020] – “This is just a quick email to let you know that our start date on Comiston Road has been pushed back slightly to Thursday 20th of August. The reason for this is that Markon – the lining contractor – have experienced some unexpected difficulties on certain parts of the Ferry Road Spaces for People scheme where they are currently working.”\nUpdate 3 [17-08-2020] – I have still not seen the updated plans for the project, but I understand the total cost is £115,000. Lothian Buses are saying they will only have 250mm clearance on the route – Perhaps if the Council had undertaken the Road Safety Audit as I requested this would have been spotted.\nUpdate 4 [20-08-2020] – (1) The project is now delayed until WB 24-08-2020 due to “snagging issues on Ferry Road”. (2) A further review of the Braid Road closure has been agreed. Thankfully, this will do what we have all wanted for some time and will consider the interaction with the Comiston Road scheme. (3) I now have the updated plans and they are linked below – the key change appears to be the loss of parking outside Scottish Water’s offices to accommodate a bus lane.\nUpdate following Ward Cllr Liaison Meeting\nComiston Road\nA design risk review has been undertaken endeavouring to consider all points of concern that have been raised regarding the project designs, and the Designers Risk Assessment has been updated accordingly.\nThe designs have been updated slightly in some places to respond to this, namely:\n- The bus stop adjacent to Braid Hills Road in Phase 2 has been slightly relocated further from the junction to improve visibility splays\n- Parking bays have been widened to 2.5m\n- The cycle crossing of Comiston Springs Avenue has been updated to provide clear priority for cycles over turning vehicles\nIn addition, in response to suggestions from Lothian Buses we are now proposing to introduce a Bus Lane southbound on the approach to the Frogston/ Oxgangs Road crossroads.\nI will circulate updated Phase 1 and 2 designs shortly.\nConstruction of Phase 1 of Comiston Road will now commence on Monday 17 August. The delay is due to minor delays experienced by the contractor on completing the Ferry Road Spaces for People scheme where they are currently working.\nBraid Road\nA review of the Braid Road closure has taken place. It has been decided that Braid Road will remain closed at least until after the implementation of both the Comiston Road cycleway, and the continuing route between Greenbank Crossroads and the Meadows. At such a time as both of these projects have been implemented and bedded in a further review of Braid Road will take place giving full consideration to the traffic situation at that time.",

Indeed, in November 2021 Mr Holder wrote in the Evening news that “Edinburgh must expand”!\nAs if the implication of that is not clear, John McLellan ends his article with the line “There is nothing wrong with defending the greenbelt, but the council must be honest about the implications.”\nI am proud to have reached the end of my 5 year term as your Councillor without any greenbelt land in my Ward being lost to development. No “Polo Fields” have been lost on my watch.\nIt has taken a lot of arguing, but the Council now accepts that it can meet its housing supply targets without allocating any further greenbelt for development. This will be agreed by the incoming Councillors after the election. If re-elected I’ll ensure our greenbelt is protected.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_05_20_edinburgh-needs-the-powers-and-funding-to-deal-with-its-housing-crisis/content_662.html": "We often hear that Edinburgh is facing a housing crisis, but it is worth thinking about what that means. In the past year alone 3,103 people were assessed as homeless in our Capital and we typically have 3,500 people in temporary accommodation on any one night. Over 600 of these people are in what is euphemistically called “B&B Accommodation” – too much of which is not fit for human habitation.\nWith 19,750 council houses on its books, the Council is Scotland’s sixth largest landlord. The problem is, however, that around 21,000 people are on the waiting list for these houses and 70% of all social housing lets in Edinburgh go to homeless households. Funding cuts make it harder for the Council to build more homes. Indeed, we spend more on homelessness than we do on building council houses. Worse than that, much of the “affordable” housing we build is simply unaffordable to those that need it.\nThis level of demand means the cost of privately rented accommodation in Edinburgh has rocketed by 40% in seven years – there would be riots if mortgages increased at that rate. The sector is booming, with some landlords canvasing to buy properties that were formerly council houses. Indeed, 7 Edinburgh Councillors are private landlords – including the current and immediate past convener of the Housing and Economy Committee.\nMaking matters worse, an estimated 5,000 homes are empty in Edinburgh. Whilst there are often good reasons for this, others are simply a wasted resource. A minority are abandoned and are accruing massive Council Tax debts which the Council could work harder to collect.\nIn parallel to this, the city has witnessed rapid expansion in Airbnb type lets, with 9,638 homes used in this way. This sector of the economy is largely unregulated due to the Scottish Government’s unwillingness to bring forward legislation to ensure owners act responsibly and provide safe accommodation.\nWhilst Edinburgh is facing a crisis, those caught up in it are facing a catastrophe. Recently the rented home of one of my constituents was rendered uninhabitable by a fire. She had no insurance and lost all her belongings. The private landlord terminated her lease and told her she’d have to wait until the end of the month to have her deposit returned. Despite the same landlord having an almost identical home one street away, my constituent was made homeless and was facing the prospect of moving into “B&B Accommodation” with her toddler.\nMy school dictionary tells me a crisis is “a time when a difficult or important decision must be made”. It’s time Edinburgh had the funding and the powers it needs to make and implement decisions on housing and the courage to see them through. Real change is needed.",

Of the 7 Councillors along the route, the following took part: Cllrs Doggart, Rust & Watt. Cllr Main joined the discussions just as they concluded, and Cllrs Cook & Ross could not make it. The Transport Convener, Cllr Lesley MacInnes, also could not make it.\nThe tone adopted by the Council Officers was conciliatory and they recognized that there was some unease about what is planned. They stated that the consultation generated 36 supportive comments, but were less clear on how many were against (a claim “100 plus” went unchallenged).\nGeneral points:\n- Once this route is complete, they hope to connect Greenbank Church to the Meadows using “quiet streets”.\n- They have no cycle / pedestrian data for Comiston Road.\n- They have tried to limit the loss of parking spaces.\n- It was stated that placing a cycle path between the footpath and parking spaces is “uncommon” in Edinburgh.\n- Lothian Buses were not consulted, but a meeting was held yesterday and they were reported as being “content”. Some details on the size of bus stops is being clarified – this is for busy stops and for wheelchair users.\n- Phase 1 will see the cycle lanes stop 15m before bus stops.\n- The waste team have been consulted (bin collections) as well as the road gritting team.\n- It was clear that the Council does not plan to undertake a “Road Safety Audit” until after Phase one of the works are compete(!).\n- Once complete, the scheme will be reviewed on a three week cycle.\n- It was asserted that the measures may become permanent in some form.\nThe issues I focused were the lack of detailed risk assessments, plans for Braid Road & the failure to address safety concerns of residents living along the route.\nI was clear that the Council needs to undertake a Road Safety Audit and meet with residents along the route before the plans are finalized. There was no vote, but I think most (if not all) Councillors agreed with this (as did the Fairmilehead Community Council Rep). This request will be discussed with the Director of Place on Monday.\nBraid Road was due to be considered today but the meeting was cancelled due to ill-health. However, we were told “all options are on the table”.\nUseful links:\nComiston Road Consultation\nComiston Road Consultation Report\nComiston Road Phase 1 & 2",

Ironically the Council was about to commission a full review of Polling Stations (including a public consultation), but that has now been delayed due to the unexpected (but welcome) EU Election! Below is a briefing from the Council on the issue.\nYou should check your Polling Card, but as far as I know the polling stations in my Ward are as listed here.\nBriefing:\nPolling Places are determined by decision of Council. The Council has a responsibility to split each ward into Polling Districts and then allocate a Polling Place per District. Those selected are the most accessible and well located buildings in the area. The focus is on the voter trying to ensure that as many voters as possible turn out to vote by providing them with a well sited building that is easy to access and sufficiently large for the voters who are allocated there.\nBy law the Council has to review its allocation of polling places periodically. The last full review of the Polling Arrangements in Edinburgh was in 2013. The next review is scheduled for later this year. It was due to be initiated in this Spring, but the European Parliamentary Elections have delayed that. When the new review starts there will full public consultation with an opportunity to propose new venues. Staff in the elections team constantly review provision and take account of objections and complaints. Where schools are used they will have been determined to be the most appropriate venue in terms of location, capacity and access. Until then we will be using the Polling Places that the Council has previously identified. Changes would be subject to a decision of Council or an emergency decision taken by the Lord Provost and Chief Exec.\nIn the Election Team we do appreciate the disruption that can be caused to children’s education by the closure of schools to allow polling. I am also aware of the impact on parents and carers who need to arrange alternative childcare. However, the Council has identified polling places that serve the electors of a local area in an effort to support democracy and promote participation. We are also aware that changing polling places can impact negatively on turnout so that is also considered.\nYou will be aware that for scheduled election the Council has made an effort to align in service training days with polling day. However, for unscheduled events such as this, unfortunately it is necessary to close the schools that are used as polling places.\nFinally I would note that Poll Cards have now been printed and will be posted this week so we it is now too late to change the polling places that have been identified for these elections.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_12_31_the-council-needs-to-understand-what-edinburgh-wants-to-gain-from-its-visitor-economy_comment-page-1/content_722.html": "There can be no doubt that concern about the impact of Edinburgh’s visitor economy has grown considerably in recent years. When I heard from the Evening News that a petition had been launched to demand change, I actually welcomed the news. However, on reading the article and the petition, I feel unconformable about the way the Council Leader (Adam McVey, SNP Councillor for Leith) is being targeted.\nTo be clear, I share the frustration about the creeping privatisation of public space in Edinburgh, particularly how people are locked out of public parks and the lack of respect for our heritage. As a city, we are blessed with a fantastic built, natural and cultural heritage and I want to share it with people from all over the world. However, right now I don’t feel we are making the most of it. It feels like too many people in this city see profit in everything, and value in nothing.\nFor me, the tipping point came in the summer of 2018 when we had a black hording blocking views of the Castle. Since then we’ve seen memorial benches “discarded”, months of controversy over the Christmas Market, Church leaders ‘disappointed’ with ‘premature removal’ of Edinburgh’s famous nativity sculpture for Johnnie Walker advertising, and too many more examples of how our heritage is being sacrificed for quick commercial gain. However, these things keep happening and the Council is left reacting to events.\nCliff Hague summed it up like this:\n“East Princes Street Gardens have been essentially handed over to the London-based Underbelly for ten weeks to do with as they wish, without the inconvenience of having to get planning permission beforehand. West Princes Street Gardens is screened off in August for the Summer Sessions concerts. Unbelievably ugly security barriers have been erected on the Royal Mile.”\n“Edinburgh is now effectively run by the tourist industry”\nOn a personal note, my lovely wife’s grandfather was a Polish servicemen who came to Leith after Poland fell to the Nazis, and went on to fight alongside UK and Norwegian forces in Norway. Because of this, I am always hugely proud to see Edinburgh’s memorials marking Scotland’s links to Polish and Norwegian troops stationed here in WWII. Amongst these is the Christmas Tree placed annually on The Mound which is gifted to the city by Hordaland (Norway) to mark the “assistance provided by the Scots to Norway in WWII”. I was disappointed to see that this year the tree was hacked down right after Christmas and the memorial to Wojtek the bear and Polish WW2 veterans was fenced off on the same day (images below). What must people from outside Edinburgh make of this?\nI accept that the Council Leader has often been left reacting to these events. Rather than force his resignation, however, I think we should instead focus on what we actually want to change. Councillor Donald Wilson has already committed to leading a full review, and I hope the public and all 63 of Edinburgh’s Councillors will get behind that.\nIn response to the petition the Council Leader said: “many issues being raised are part of wider debate about how we manage size and scale of festivals and tourism”. I actually feel it is more fundamental than how we manage the status quo. There are really three key questions:\n- What scale is right? The Edinburgh Tourism Strategy” boasts it’s being developed by an “industry-led group facilitated by Scottish Enterprise” called ETAG (with no community representation). This group wants to grow the current tourist economy from 4.1 million visitors per year by one third to 5.5 million by 2030. Can this level of growth be accommodated sustainably?\n- Is quality of what we’re offering positioning Edinburgh optimally? Right now visitors arriving via Waverly Station are greeted by the smell of fried onions and German sausages emanating from the Christmas Market. I love German beer and food, but surely Edinburgh should be promoting its fantastic built, natural and cultural heritage better? How can Edinburgh’s small business improve on this and benefit more?\n- Who benefits? Today the Evening News carried an article from the tourism lobby (the ones that oppose the tourist tax) who are clearly concerned that the public is waking up to what’s going on. It’s claimed that the industry supports 33,000 jobs in Edinburgh. I welcome every one of those jobs (particularly my daughter’s), but I do wonder how many come with fair pay, good conditions and fixed hours?\nWhilst calling for the Council Leader to resign may help vent some frustration, it’s making a difference to the lives of residents than matters. For me the starting point is to understand what Edinburgh wants to gain from its visitor economy, and then we have to deliver that.",

This is essentially for people who missed the registration period last year. Registration opens tomorrow.\nBRIEFING NOTE: GARDEN WASTE REGISTRATION – MID YEAR 2021\nWhat’s happening?\n- The next registration window for the garden waste service opens on Tuesday 02 February at 10am and will close at 2pm on Tuesday 16 February.\n- Residents can sign up to receive fortnightly garden waste collections for £25 per brown bin.\n- Residents who sign up in February will be sent their permit(s) between 15-26 March and the service will run from 30 March until 07 November 2021 (date of first and last collection will vary depending on calendar for their address however they will be within this date range).\n- Residents will need to renew their permit again in the summer to continue receiving collections after 07 November.\n- Information on the start and end dates of the garden waste service and when residents will receive their permit sticker(s) with a garden waste calendar is available at www.edinburgh.gov.uk/gardenwaste. Residents should keep an eye on this page for updates.\n- Due to current safety measures in place because of Coronavirus, residents will only be able to register online or by telephone. It won’t be possible to register in person at any of our locality offices as they’re being used as community resilience centres during the pandemic. This is a change from previous registration windows and means cash or cheque payments will not be possible.\n- A communications campaign is also planned to raise awareness of permit extensions, renewals, any changes to the way people can register and to encourage sign up.\nHow to register\n- The quickest and easiest way to register and pay is on our website at www.edinburgh.gov.uk/gardenwaste. We’ve simplified the online sign up process by making it optional to register using the MyGov account. If a resident chooses not to use their MyGov account, the process will be quicker, but it means that they won’t be able to see the history of their garden waste permit on their MyGov account.\n- Anyone without access to the internet can call us on 0131 357 2800. We may have reduced staffing due to Coronavirus and phone lines may be busy. Telephone lines are open Monday – Thursday, 10am – 4pm and Friday 10am – 3.40pm.\n- Residents can ask a family member or friend to register and pay on their behalf online if they’re unable to do it themselves.\n- A one-off payment of £25 (per brown bin) will be taken by debit or credit card.\n- It’s not possible for a resident to register in person at one of our locality offices. If they usually register and pay this way, then they will need to register online or by telephone instead.\n- We don’t accept cheques or cash payments.\n- Once a resident has signed up and payment has been received, they’ll be sent a garden waste calendar along with a permit sticker(s) between 15-26 March to put on their brown bin(s). If they don’t receive these at their registered address by 29 March, they should email waste@edinburgh.gov.uk. If the resident has not received their permit within 28 days of the service start date they should email waste@edinburgh.gov.uk – for this registration window that would mean customers must report this by 26 April.\n- The service is available to a limited number of other organisations, such as lawn sport clubs. Bowling, tennis and croquet clubs must register for the service over the phone and not online and it is their responsibility to ensure that they have a waste transfer note in place.\nDoes everyone need to pay?\n- Signing up to receive the garden waste service is optional. If a resident chooses not to sign up, then they won’t receive garden waste collections.\n- Residents who receive Council Tax Reduction (formerly called Council Tax Benefit) or are classed, or live with someone who has been classed as, severely mentally impaired, do not need to pay for the service, but they do need to register to receive it. Other council tax discounts, such as single occupancy or disabled person discount, don’t qualify for this reduction. Households that pay for garden aid are not exempt from paying for the service.\n- A small number of residents in the Colinton area have their garden waste collected by Tiphereth (Colinton Compost) and they also need to register and pay to continue receiving the service. Tiphereth customers receive weekly collections of their bagged garden waste.\nHow does the service work?\n- We’ll empty brown bins once every two weeks until this service year ends on 07 November 2021\n- Permits are not prorated for residents who sign up in February 2021. It is the same service year end for residents signing up in February 2021 even if they didn’t sign up at the start of the service year in Summer 2020.\n- Residents need to renew their permits every year before they expire to continue receiving the service.\n- We’ll only empty brown bins with valid permit stickers.\n- Permits are sent to the house the registered garden waste address; permits cannot be sent to another property.\n- There is no limit to how many garden waste bins a property can have but there will be a charge of £25 per bin.\n- Residents can share a bin with their neighbours, but they’ll need to agree on one resident acting as the lead for booking and paying for the service against their property. If there are any service issues with the shared bin (e.g. a missed collection), then this must be reported against the property with the permit.\n- If a resident moves to a new house they can transfer their permit to their new address. They’ll need to give us six weeks’ notice to update our system and will need to take their brown bin and permit sticker to their new address.\n- Terms and conditions are available on our website www.edinburgh.gov.uk/gardenwasteterms\nBudget proposal to increase the charge\n- A budget proposal around garden waste has been put forward for consideration as part of the Council’s budget setting process.\n- This proposal is to ensure we achieve full cost recovery for the garden waste subscription and collection service (note this does not include the disposal costs due to legislation on what can be charges)\n- Should this proposal be agreed it will take effect in the summer registration, for the 2021/22 collection year. This will not affect registrations made in this mid-year window and the charge will continue at £25\n- The reasons for the increase are to ensure we are fully recovering our costs, and investment in administration support and system development to allow the mid-year sign up window to be greatly expanded addressing the high levels of complaints from residents and Councillors on the restriction of the current window timescales and the inability to join if these are missed\nKey Points\n- Service provision may need to be reviewed depending on the future impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic.\n- Residents cannot register in person at one of our locality offices. If they usually register and pay this way, then they’ll be required to register online or by telephone instead.\n- Cheques or cash payment will not be accepted.\n- The deadline for residents to register for garden waste is 2pm on Tuesday 16 February. Registrations after this time will not be processed.\n- Residents who register in this window will be joining the service mid-year and the permit will expire 7 November 2021, the cost isn’t pro-rated.\nFurther information\nIf a resident needs further information, or has a question to ask, direct them to waste@edinburgh.gov.uk who will assist or log their enquiry.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_10_28_update-lanark-and-longstone-inglis-green-road-spaces-for-people-proposals/content_244.html": "This evening I attended a meeting of Councillors representing people along the proposed Lanark Road / Ingles Green Spaces for People Scheme. The meeting was chaired by the Transport Convener, but disappointingly the updated plans and consultation responses were not shared. Nor were we told how many people had responded to the consultation, but it was reported that the majority did object. It was also noted that a local petition which had raised concerns about the scheme had attracted “around 1000” signatures (1,344 actually).\nIt was explained that the aim of the scheme was to reduce congestion on the Canal Towpath and the Water of Leith Walkway. This appears to be based on anecdotes about usage in April, and an assertion that cycle traffic is still higher than normal. “Key Pinch Points” were noted as being Slateford Aqueduct and Harrision Park (no Water of Leith locations were mentioned). I asked if the plans were proportionate, and if the risks justified the use of Covid Powers. Although no evidence was tabled, it was argued that because the towpath was already busy pre-Covid then the plans are justified. Although I accept the towpath is/was busy (I broke my arm in a low-speed collision last year), I think a stronger argument needs to be made to justify the use of Covid Powers. Lessons have to be learned from the East Craigs debacle.\nKey points.\n1. The revised plans will be published along with the consultation responses before the mid-November Transport Committee. Transport Convener said she would not permit any further consultation on the plans.\n2. The floating bus stops will not be part of the “Phase 1” installation. As I reported on my Facebook page, the Council are working with Sustrans on developing a new “factsheet” on these, and as part of this they will carry out a workshop with relevant affected groups who have raised concerns. Once this is complete they will review Lanark Road and consider the installation of floating bus stops along the corridor. If this does take place it will be subject to a Road Safety Audit before installation. To be honest, I doubt a “new factsheet” will change my mind or that of anyone else.\n3. The Transport Convener expressed disappointment that the wider Spaces for People initiative has not been allowed to “flourish” due to public concerns being raised and regretted that the Lanark Road scheme (along with others) had become a “flashpoint”.\n4. Changes to the plans have been made to accommodate Cranley Nursery, Lanark Road Nursery and Dovecot Park. Although I requested these changes (along with many residents), it appears the Council has yet to contact Cranley Nursery and several other businesses along the route. The Golf Club has also not been contacted.\n5. The Council accept they have not given a great deal of consideration to the nurseries, but they hope that the scheme will encourage people to cycle to both Cranley Nursery and Lanark Road Nursery.\n6. A temporary pedestrian crossing at Dovecot Park is not possible.\n7. It was reported that the proposed Lanark Road / Ingles Green Scheme was a “top priority” within the wider Spaces for People initiative. Nonetheless, if work gets underway as planned in mid January 2021 it will go live more than 10 months after lockdown started.\nPresent at the meeting\nCllr Lesley Macinnes (Transport Convener)\nCouncil staff (x3)\nCllr Scott Arthur\nCllr Ricky Henderson\nCllr Gavin Corbett\nCllr Neil Gardiner\nCllr Andrew Johnston\nCllr David Key\nCllr Jason Rust\nPresent but did not speak\nCllr Karen Doran\nCllr Sue Webber\nDid not / Could not attend\nCllr Ashley Graczyk\nCllr Cathy Fullerton\nCllr Denis Dixon\nCllr Donald Willson\nCllr Graeme Bruce\nCllr Phil Doggart",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_08_20_nationalism-nicola-sturgeon-fails-the-duck-test/content_137.html": "Nicola Sturgeon has quickly went from somebody who proudly welcomed her “Fellow Nationalists” to the SNP annual conference to somebody who now appears ashamed to be labelled a “Nationalist”.\nThe wider public, however, will not be fooled by her rhetoric as it fails the duck test: “If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.”\nLike Nationalists around the world, Nicola Sturgeon likes to blame others for the problems we face. Trump blames Mexicans (and others!). Farage blames the EU. Sturgeon blames the rest of the UK. All three use the basic Nationalist trick of blaming others as an alternative to tackling the hard choices we face as a nation if we want to improve education, healthcare and welfare.\nLike Nationalists around the world, Nicola Sturgeon repeatedly accuses anyone who dares to question her record in government as “talking Scotland down”. Again, this is boilerplate nationalism.\nLike nationalist the world over, the hardcore in the SNP ranks engage in conspiracy theories and label legitimate news sources like the BBC as “fake news” – Trump would be proud! Ask them where they get their news and they will quickly tell you “Facebook” or “Russia Today” (the propaganda arm of the Russian state). The SNP elite sit quietly as bitterness is stoked by stories of secret oil fields and the streets of London being paved with Scottish gold.\nThe hardcore of nationalists in Scotland are now torn. Should they back their leader, or continue to be proud nationalists? I have noticed that some have started using the term “patriot”, to describe SNP members – the irony is, of course, lost on them!\nI almost feel sorry for them. Nicola Sturgeon did not have to put them in this position. What’s wrong with being a proud nationalist? Just take a look at what nationalism has achieved in Scotland and across the world.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_02_13_agreed-charwood-will-be-a-polling-station/content_126.html": "I received indication last month from the Council that they intent not to use Buckstone Primary School as a Polling Station, but will switch to Charwood. This is because (1) parents had previously complained about the school being used and (2) there has already been enough disruption to learning over the past 2 years.\nI welcome the change as it will reduce the impact on the kids at Buckstone PS (it is also slightly closer to my house in Buckstone, and parking will be better at Charwood for those that have to drive), but I accept it will be the second change in 5 years or so.\nI collected feedback on the issue via my Facebook page, and raised a few questions with the Council about operational issues as a result. This was the response:\nI have been on site at Charwood to view/discuss the space available, including access arrangements and their plans on the day. It is the restaurant’s intent to remain open for normal business. We would be using only their events space to the rear, which on the day of my visit was prepared for a funeral tea, something they would not be able to offer on the day of poll or the afternoon before due to the polling set up. The impact of their loss of business for this space over these days is already reflected in the fee they seek. Were we to ask them to close entirely, the venue would not be financially viable to us. Their events space does have its own designated access to the south east side of the building, located by five parking bays, which in the main would keep voters and diners well apart.\nWhile ideal for the majority of voters, this entrance is not suitable as a disabled access point. As is the case with other polling places, disabled access would be at another entrance, in this case via their entrance on the south west face of the building. This would involve disabled voters passing though the restaurant’s reception area while the restaurant is open which is not ideal, but manageable by poll staff on the day, including a roaming information officer whose role it is to direct and assist access to and from the stations within. Attached is a photograph taken within the event space proposed. The doorway on the left in the teal coloured wall recess is the access through to the restaurant reception area which in the main would not be opened until such time as disabled access were to be required.\nBased on the feedback I received from local residents, and the above response from the Council I was happy to support the change – it has now been agreed. I’m really grateful to Charwood for helping with this.\nIf you have concerns about using Charwood as a polling station, it is still possible to register for a postal vote here.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_01_13_labour-leadership-nominations-and-what-it-means-for-party-unity/content_709.html": "The Labour party have now published the final MP Leadership nominations. Unsurprisingly, change candidate Keir Starmer walked it. The real news is that Clive Lewis dropped out and change candidate Lisa Nandy came a strong third. Emily Thornberry managed to get the level of support (at least 22 votes) needed to reach the next stage.\nThe next stage is for Starmer, Nandy, Phillips and Long-Bailey to receive nominations from at least (a) 5% of CLPs or (b) 3 affiliates (at least 2 of which shall be trade union affiliates) comprising 5% of fully paid up affiliated membership as of the 31st December 2019. Assuming they manage this, all 4 will be put to a vote of members, registered supporters and affiliates. A key challenge for the three change candidates (Starmer, Nandy & Phillips) at that stage will be to ensure their support use their 2nd and 3rd preference votes for other change candidates.\nThe Deputy Leadership contest is also wide open with 5 candidates reaching the next stage: Rosena Allin Khan (23 votes), Richard Burgon (22)\nDawn Butler (29), Ian Murray (34) & Angela Rayner (88).\nWhat is interesting is how the Deputy Leadership vote split. The chart below shows that most candidates gained votes from MPs supporting a wide range of Leaderships candidates. The exception to this is Richard Buregon – he failed to get support from many MPs outside Long-Bailey’s camp – the people that voted for both were: Andy McDonald, Apsana Begum, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, Beth Winter, Claudia Webbe, Dan Carden, Diane Abbott, Grahame Morris, Ian Byrne, Ian Lavery, Ian Mearns, Imran Hussain, John McDonnell, Jon Trickett, Kate Osborne, Mary Foy, Rachel Hopkins, Zarah Sultana. If a Deputy Leader is unable to reach out, this must surely raise concerns about unity within the parliamentary group?\nThe situation for the leadership candidates is a little better (see below), but Long-Bailey does rely heavily on support from those backing Burgeon along with a small group of Rayner’s backers.\nOur next Leader has a huge challenge. Voters won’t trust us if we are not a united party and parliamentary group. This does not rule out Long-Bailey and Burgeon, but they need to show they have the ability to reach all of the party and the parliamentary group.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2024_11_24_ready-to-serve-edinburgh-south-west/content_4.html": "November marked a significant milestone for my constituency hub (139 Dundee St, Edinburgh EH11 1BP) as we became fully operational. This culminated with a training week in Parliament (see pic above) where, as a team, we refined our approach to serving local residents and businesses.\nEstablishing our office and assembling a dedicated team has been a time-consuming process, but I am delighted that we are now able to serve our community to the fullest extent.\nWhile I’ve chosen to be prudent with our staff budget, the current team of five is already making a substantial impact locally. They are diligently addressing the overwhelming volume of emails and letters I receive daily.\nOur team is well-equipped to handle a wide range of casework, from potholes to pension credit applications. Lucie, our experienced caseworker, is the primary point of contact for most incoming requests for help. Salim specializes in Home Office casework, including passport issues, residents stuck overseas, and immigration matters.\nRecognizing that some individuals and communities may be hesitant to seek help, Hannah is dedicated to proactively identifying those in need. She has already made significant strides in supporting Currie and Craiglockhart Primary School parents with additional support needs provision and organizing a meeting for over 30 heat network users facing increased energy costs.\nSolomon plays a crucial role in ensuring that my actions in Parliament align with the needs of our constituency, and is key to progressing my Priavte Members’ Bill on rare cancers. He identifies casework issues that may require policy changes. He also drafts responses to emails from residents on policy matters in order to explain my position on issues ranging from the climate emergency to the election of Donald Trump.\nFinally, Noel manages our office operations and coordinates seamless communication within the team.\nWhen I ran for election, I said all I wanted was a chance to serve people and businesses in Edinburgh South West. My office is designed to fulfil that promise in full. I have deliberately not recruited any staff in Westminster, so my entire staff is committed to serving you right here in the constituency, so please don’t hesitate to ask us for help when you need it.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_09_28_update-on-the-death-at-fairmilehead-crossroads/content_685.html": "A report in the Evening News today suggests the tragic death at Fairmilehead crossroads on Thursday may be linked to an incident of so called “road rage”. I am sure everyone’s thoughts are with the family of the man that died.\nI’d like to thank the emergency services for dealing with the incident. Spacial thanks must also go to those that attempted CPR to give the man the best possible chance of recovering.\nI spoke to the reporter behind the article and I know he was surprised by some of the driving he witnessed in the area and the strength of feeling locally on the issue. Some of the comments I received in the 2-3 days after the incident:\n…traffic congestion has increased alarmingly over the year from The Charwood Restaurant to the lights at Fairmilehead Crossroads…\n… Because West to South (Biggar Road) cars are accelerating towards the junction, on a downward slope and turning towards the oncoming traffic it is surprising we don’t have more serious accidents…\n… Nearly every single day there are multiple near misses (and some not missed!) with horns blaring and brakes screeching and heated shouting matches…\n…My kids take their life in their hands every day crossing Biggar Road near the bypass, when they get off the number 4 bus. Cars coming off the bypass accelerate crazily up that stretch…\n…My son is 11 and should be independently walking to school, but the road is too busy/unsafe…\n…There’s no proper filters on these lights. I have to turn right every morning and the amount of angry people, despite you have your indicator on speed in front of the cars in the other lane. Cars blocking other cars in the morning and the speed of cars in this area is appalling…\n…I have personally witnessed appalling driving in this area and also across the city…\n…I really feel for the family of the man who died. It is very surprising that there are not more accidents at this junction…\n…It’s very sad to hear that there was a death – and though it may not have been due to the traffic, it is only a matter of time. I have been going on about the speed limit on that road for years… …The First Minister has declared a climate emergency – we should be making all travel easier for pedestrians, cyclists and public transport and not motorists…\n…there is a right filter at the crossroads for traffic citybound but the other two lanes are also on green. This means that anyone waiting to turn right coming from the city has to gauge when the lights have turned to red for the citybound vehicles. Any driver who is a visitor turning right from the city can be tempted to swing out when they see their set of lights turn to red, right across the oncoming traffic…\n…I agree entirely with you that the speed limit should be reduced to 30, and be in force at Hillend…\n…One issue that concerns me (and I am not a local resident) is the mismatch between some of the time scales (eg new lights) and the seriousness of the residents’ comments…\n…I agree lower speed limits would help with safety and also support more sustainable active travel options. The main issue is however the sheer volume of traffic. Stand at that junction in the morning and or early evening and witness the ridiculous number of single occupancy cars…\n…One issue that concerns me (and I am not a local resident) is the mismatch between some of the time scales (eg new lights) and the seriousness of the residents’ comments…\n…Going north, folk are often coming from the bypass – so their brains are still going at speed – and having two (going into three) lanes does nothing to encourage them to slow down. Then people are elbowing past each other to get through the junction: more often than not, people are cutting up the left lane to go straight on and get ahead of those in the middle lane. The driving is often very aggressive coming up to that junction. Even in the car I feel unsafe there…\n…I have long avoided this junction because there is no right turn filter going into Oxgangs Road and because you are blinded by headlights as the traffic comes up from the by pass to the cross roads…\n…I would also like to add a comment about the traffic situation. The bus stop at the foot of Biggar Road requires us to cross the road to get to our home at Swanston Drive. At certain periods of the day particularly this is now simply dangerous. The cars coming off the bypass often accelerate up towards the lights at Fairmilehead whilst the cars approaching the bypass speed down the Biggar Road. Lots of dodging of cars…\n…The lines on the roundabout closest to Craigdon should be more clear about car positioning, especially south to north. At Fairmilehead the lack of a filter from driving south to turning West is ludicrously dangerous…\n…just to say I am 100% with you on reducing the speed, particularly given the schoolkids but also adults too cross to commute daily. There is a lot of pedestrians crossing daily. I think 30 is sensible…\n…The area around the Buckstone shops is an accident waiting to happen with car drivers doing crazy things including crossing 4 lanes to get into the parking facing the wrong way and double parking.For cyclists, achieving a right turn from Comiston road into any side street especially uphill…\n…You are so right about the crossroads at Fairmilehead and particularly the cars approaching the crossroads to go into Bigger rd are time after time accelerating through the red light…\n…I grew up in Winton and now live just down the road and I really care about the area. I have an elderly mum with dementia in Winton who crosses Biggar Rd daily and it worries me hugely. A pedestrian crossing there is much needed…\n…I don’t think the problem is limited to those crossroads. I still worry about my 13yo crossing to the bus stop at Buckstone in the mornings (especially in the dark), and my 10yo doesn’t get anywhere near that road without an adult even though she has really good road sense. She would love to be able to go across to the newsagent with her friends! And it would be great if she could get used to crossing that road before high school…\n…The roundabout at the top of the slip road off the bypass would benefit from a mid white line being painted on it. Too often vehicles switch lanes while using the roundabout causing cutting in, this could certainly lead to frustration…\n…May I also voice a plea to have the speed limit reduced to 30 mph- traffic from the bypass can come tearing down the road – if there are 2 lanes completely free of traffic I am afraid that residents particularly schoolchildren crossing the road will be even more in danger of being knocked over than they are now…\n…It’s a terrible road and I’m surprised something hasn’t happened before now…\n…At busy times there are few cars traveling through those lights at 40. So don’t see a speed limit change impacting that junction too much. A good turning filter could allow three lanes to move. It’s just a bust junction though…\nI agree that there is a lot that could be done to make this stretch of road safer for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians. This is what’s happening right now:\nThe speed limit is under review (this will also look at “rat-running”). Despite opposition from other Councillors, I have argued that the Council should consult on reducing the limit to 30mph.\nFurther parking restrictions are about to be implemented.\nThe lights will be replaced over the next year or two to make the junction safer.\nA week or two ago I asked the Council if a case could be made for a pedestrian crossing after concerns were raised by a Winton resident.\nSo whilst this death may not have been caused directly by the road conditions, I am determined that the crossroads and the A702 is made safer for everyone. This is a wide road with wide footpaths, so there should be room for cars, bikes and pedestrians all to move safely.\nOne response to “Update on the death at Fairmilehead Crossroads”\nAnnette Mackenzie\nThey need a filter for turning right onto Oxgangs Road when heading South as you have to cross heavy traffic traveling North. This would avoid people rat running to avoid this junction. I rat run myself at peak times for safety reasons rather than use this junction. We also need to lower the speed on Buckstone and Pentland Terrace to 30 as turning right across two lanes of either North or South bound busy traffic is becoming almost impossible.\nWe need to spend money making roads safer for all car users, cyclists and pedestrians before we spend money narrowing streets like George Street, Forrest Road and the old town. Our council need to prioritise there budget for safety of road users before spending money on roads that they choose to look aesthetically nice but that are not always necessary at the moment. Safety must come first.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_09_14_briefing-garden-waste-charging-implementation-plan/content_512.html": "I have made no secret of the fact that I opposed the “Garden Tax”, but I accept that it’s introduction is hard to stop given the extent of the cuts the Scottish Government has forced on our capital. I welcome the fact that we now have a firm implementation plan, but regret the muddle that was associated with the registration process and the stress it caused many residents. In particular, I hope the Council will learn lessons from how many vulnerable and older people in our capital were simply unable to use the online registration process that was initially forced on them. The avalanche of bad publicity that came with that was hugely damaging to the Council, but surely explains why public engagement with the charge is higher than expected.\nThe unpredicted problems with the registration process and the resultant delays must have added considerably to the cost of setting up the service. I wholeheartedly hope that there are no further unseen costs or delays when the service goes live – not least any caused by the fly-tipping of garden waste to avoid the charge.\nBelow is the latest briefing from the Councillor behind this charge – The SNP’s Lesley MacInnes.\nGarden waste update\nRegistration for the new paid for garden waste service closed in July. Since then waste services has been working to analyse the data and create new routes for the service.\n- Residents requested a total of 61,221 permits for 56,300 properties\n- The Council has exceeded its business case target and generated just under £1.4 million.\n- 86% of residents registered for the service online.\n- The current on-line missed bin form is being adapted to allow only residents who have registered for the service to report a missed garden waste bin.\n- A project review session has taken place since July and improvements have been built in to the next registration window.\nNext steps\n- The new service starts from Monday 8 October.\n- Permits and calendars will be posted to residents the week beginning 24 September.\n- Residents who have not signed up but use any of our kerbside or box collection services will also be sent a letter with information about the next registration window and a new calendar as they may have a change to their bin collection days.\n- Tiphereth customers who have signed up will continue to have weekly garden waste collections. Tiphereth will provide these residents with a year’s supply of tags to attach to their garden waste bags.\n- The last free collection of garden waste will be on Friday 5 October. Residents who have not signed up for the service should check their current calendars for their last collection before this date. For some residents their last garden waste collection may be as early as 17 September.\n- The next registration window opens at 9am, 1 October and closes at 12pm, 16 October.\n- Residents who have not signed up are encouraged to compost their waste or take it to one of our recycling centres.\n- They can also book a special uplift for their garden waste for £35 for up to 28 bags of waste.\nChanges to collection days for all forms of household collections\nAs part of the 2018/19 budget proposals it was agreed at Council that existing kerbside collection shift patterns would move to a four-day week rota. This change will start from 8 October and benefits include the following:\n- the Council can make £500,000 in savings\n- kerbside collections will take place between 6am and 5pm, Tuesdays – Fridays\n- some residents will have a change to their bin collection days\n- we won’t be accessing residential estates during the evening\n- crews won’t be going into the gardens of Assisted Collection properties after dark\n- communal bins will continue to be serviced seven days a week.\nInterim collections\nKerbside bin collections have been re-routed as part of the move to four-day week collections and some residents will have a one-off interim collection of their bins. We will write to these residents with a new collection calendar and let them know when the collection is taking place and what they need to do:\n- interim collections will take place between:\n- 6am on Saturday 6 October and 10pm on Sunday 7 October\n- 6am on Saturday 13 October and 10pm on Sunday 14 October\n- residents should put their bins out by 6am on the Saturday and leave them out until they are emptied. This is a one-off situation, as we make the adjustment to the new schedules.\n- residents should use their new collection calendars from 8 October.\nRegistration window\n- The next registration window for garden waste opens at 9am, 1 October – 12pm 16 October.\n- The fortnightly garden waste service costs £25 and provides a permit which will be valid until 6 October 2019.\n- The quickest and easiest way to sign up is on our website.\n- Residents without access to the internet at home can use the self-serve kiosks at our locality offices, internet at libraries or register by phone. For online registration, residents will need to register for a MyGov account first if they do not already have one.\n- Customers who can’t register online can pay in cash or card at Locality offices. They can also call on 0131 608 1100 (option 1, then option 9). Additional staff are being brought in to support this service.\n- Residents who receive Council Tax Reduction (formerly called Council Tax Benefit) do not need to pay for the service, however they still need to register to receive it. Other exemptions such as single occupancy discount do not qualify for free garden waste collections.\n- The registration period will be supported by an awareness campaign.\n- Customers who missed the first window have been able to ‘register an interest’ and will be sent email reminders when the new window opens. Frequently asked questions will be reviewed and updated on our website as required. Information for residents is available on our website.\n- Once residents have registered it will take 6 – 8 weeks for us to add them to our collection routes and send a garden waste permit before we can start emptying their bin. This includes a 14-day cooling off period which we need to legally factor in.\n- Another registration window will be available for residents to sign up from 4 – 19 February 2019.\nCollection of unwanted bins\n- Residents who have not registered and no longer want their brown bin can take it to one of our recycling centres.\n- An online form will also be available at the end of October for residents to arrange for their brown bin to be uplifted. Residents without internet access will be able to call us on 0131 608 1100 (option 1, then option 9) to request the removal of their bin. The online form will also be available at the self-serve kiosks in our locality offices.\n- The window for residents to tell us they no longer want their bin will last until the end of November.\n- We will take a planned approach to collecting the bins during December.\nSummary of key dates\n| Date | Activity |\n| 13 September | Elected Member briefing. |\n| Week commencing 17 September | Briefing to internal colleagues including training for additional contact centre staff. |\n| Week commencing 24 September | Residents receive permits and calendars for garden waste and/or new recycling and residual waste collections. |\n| 1 October | Garden waste registration opens (ends 16th October). |\n| 5 October | Current garden waste service stops. Residents who have not signed up should check their current calendars for their last collection before this date. |\n| 8 October | New garden waste and recycling/residual waste service starts. |\n| 16 October | Registration window closes at 12pm. |\n| 25 October | Form for requesting uplift of unwanted brown bins goes live. |",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_12_02_the-picardy-place-predicament-place-movement-or-both/content_389.html": "Context\nEdinburgh is a growing city. By 2050 it will have grown by 25% and it is important that this growth is undertaken in a way that maintains, or ideally improves, the quality of life we currently enjoy. Indeed, Edinburgh must be a liveable city. That means governance, healthcare provision, culture and environment, education and infrastructure must all contribute to a good quality of life.\nI’m tempted to say that the growth must also be “sustainable”, but it is hard (for me) to see how that rate of growth can be. Nonetheless, we must take steps in that direction if the city we love is to continue to be one of the best in the world. We must be mindful that the strategic decisions we take today, will inform how our capital evolves.\nAdditionally, we’ve seen how the Scottish Government thinks the motor car is a key part of this vision. The investment in the M8, M9 and M90 corridors are focused on creating a regional economic powerhouse based around the car. An expansion of air travel is also on their agenda. Nonetheless, we’ve also seen rail improvements – not least EGIP and link to the Borders.\nWithin that context, we must think about how people get to Edinburgh and also how people move within the city. Indeed, we already know that half of the people living in Edinburgh are held up by congestion every day and that congestion costs Lothian Buses alone £2m per year.\nTo address these challenges we need to add capacity to the key arterial corridors (e.g. A702) and the city centre road network without adding to congestion. To do that, there is a recognition that we need to make public and active transport much more attractive. Our great bus service must get better. Active transport must be attractive, safe and enjoyable. This is not just about moving people from A to B, it’s about taking a holistic view and ensuring Edinburgh is a liveable City.\nIn the short-term, we can expect to see the implementation of a plan “to improve the public realm in the city centre with the aim of improving conditions for, and prioritising access for pedestrians, and public transport users” (SPOKES are excited about this.). Although this is focused on central Edinburgh, it has potential to set the whole city on a positive trajectory.\nRunning in parallel to this we have the proposed tramline “extension” to Newhaven. Like it or lump it, it has potential to add significant capacity to the public transport system in northern Edinburgh, and connect people there with growth areas in western Edinburgh.\nThere will of course be uncertainty, compromises and setbacks. Personally, I am concerned that the St James Quarter will come with 1,000 extra parking spaces (triple the existing provision). Linked to this, we have the proposals for “Picardy Place” – the space at the junction of Leith Street, York Place & Leith Walk.\nPicardy Place\nPicardy Place is important as it is the gateway to Edinburgh’s World Heritage Site. The space must showcase Edinburgh whilst also allowing the safe movement of people to and from the city centre. It has been an eyesore for many years, but now we have a chance to completely redesign it to meet Edinburgh’s future needs.\nThe problem we face is that the basic design at the heart of what is being proposed is now more than 10 years old and, on first inspection, looks like the kind of layout one would expect in a sprawling American city where car is king. Yes, pedestrian and cycle safety measures have been retrofitted to improve it. For many, however, this is like putting lipstick on a pig – it is still a pig.\nThe design is based on a gyratory layout – it involves three lanes of traffic revolving around a large triangular “roundabout” big enough to have a building on. Indeed, the central space was originally big enough for a luxury hotel. Since then, however, the space has reduced significantly in size to, amongst other things, allow the inclusion of safer footpaths, cycle lanes and to protect some public space outside St Mary’s Catholic Cathedral.\nDespite these improvements, however, there is a feeling that the design of the junction is too focussed on the movement of cars rather than people (there is a difference). Indeed, Lesley Hinds (Edinburgh’s transport chief until May 2017) said she “told officers months ago this proposal was unacceptable“:\nLesley Hinds is not the only person to raise concerns about what is being proposed for Picardy Place. In September SUSTRANS Scotland, a charity which promotes safe walking and cycling routes, walked out on discussions with City of Edinburgh Council regarding the design saying: “The concept of Hierarchy of Street Users is not at the centre of project thinking and does not follow Scottish Government policy for Designing Streets.” On the Gyratory specifically, they said: “The multi-lane gyratory traffic system appears unsuitable for an area at the gateway to Edinburgh’s World Heritage area.”\nThe Broughton Spurtle, a community newspaper that likes to stir things up (AKA Spurtling), reported strong opposition from both the Leith Central Walk and New Town and Broughton Community Councils. Indeed, the Broughton Spurtle also promoted an alternative design produced by Zone Architects.\nThis, and adverse comments from the public, triggered improvements to the design and a further round of public consultations, but the gyratory layout was retained. Of these designs, SUSTRANS said: “we remain unsupportive of the gyratory concept because we feel it does not adequately balance the pressure of traffic, with the opportunity to create a successful, quality public space and transport interchange.”\nSPOKES, a campaign group which promotes cycling, described aspects of the revised proposals as “completely inappropriate” and concluded the plan added “very significantly to potential pedestrian/cyclist conflict” and that they were “unhappy with the basic gyratory concept“.\nLiving Streets Edinburgh, a charity which exists to promote walking and better quality public spaces, have also raised concerns. Before the latest round of consultations got underway, they claimed the design did “not comply with Scottish Government or the Council’s own policies” and that there will “be a loss of important areas of public realm / cultural / green space“.\nTo promote these points, supporters of Living Streets Edinburgh have been contacting City of Edinburgh Councillors. Over a two week period, I received well over 150 e-mails. To put that in context, I normally receive new casework e-mails from one or two constituents per day.\nMuch of the public realm arguments focus on the threat to the space outside St Mary’s Catholic Cathedral, home of The Manuscript of Monte Cassino (an open palm, a section of limb and a human foot) which were created by Eduardo Paolozzi for that spot – apparently the centre of his universe. Indeed this space, has changed considerably as the design has evolved. The latest design places Eduardo Paolozzi’s works outside the Cathedral, but access problems remain:\nA second public realm focus is the centre of the “roundabout”, and what quality of public realm space it can provide. Dr Peter Mathews, an academic and expert in urban policy and regeneration, described this space as “the finest urban design from the 1960s” and the centre’s of gyratory systems as being “deeply unpleasant places“. He concluded by saying: “The current proposals, if implemented, will just be an embarrassment for the city and demonstrate a lack of leadership and bravery on changing transport modes and tackling climate change”. Ouch!\nOf course, one could argue that these critical voices only represent one side of the argument. The problem is that nobody is representing the opposite with anything like an equal amount of energy. I have not spoken to anyone who backs that gyratory concept who does not also have concerns about it. They recognise it’s a compromise.\nSo why compromise so much when Scotland’s Capital deserves better? That question takes us back to the £850m St James Quarter development and its corpulent car park. A ~£60m Growth Accelerator Model (GAM) funding agreement was brokered for the public works associated with the St James Quarter development between the developer City of Edinburgh Council, the Scottish Government and the government’s Scottish Futures Trust (a shady organisation involved in the SNP’s version of PFI). Councillor Claire Miller described the Picardy Place road design written into the GAM deal as “disappointing” and claimed it “locks the city centre into very high volumes of private vehicle use”.\nPapers presented to City of Edinburgh Council’s Transport and Environment Committee make clear that although the total value of the GAM contract is around £60m, £55m of that is from the Scottish Government, only £15m is allocated to Picardy Place. The paper does, however, also contain this threat: “Any fundamental review of the current design could put at risk these agreements, the delivery programme, and Scottish Government funding, with resulting further risk to the delivery of any revised layout and to the extension of the tram.“.\nWhat is interesting about this threat is that I understand that no discussions had taken place with the SNP Government on the issue – it is simply speculation. As someone who is positive about Edinburgh, I like to think that the Scottish Government would be willing to put more money in the pot if a better design could be found. Indeed, it may well be that any such design would be cheaper!\nConclusion\nAt best, the current Picardy Place proposals are unpopular. At worst, they are unsafe and will be a backward step for Edinburgh. With the city centre review underway, the decision is being made at the wrong time and may actually undermine the review. Cutting across this is the GAM agreement. It hangs over the decision like a dark cloud.\nMy feeling is that we should do all we can to engage the GAM partners in a positive conversation about what’s possible. One that seeks to integrate Picardy Place and the St James Quarter into the wider discussion about ensuring Edinburgh remains one of Europe’s greatest capitals. The discussion needs to focus on more than the movement of cars and the width of footpaths. We need to think about place making, wellbeing and the economy. We need to think holistically about ensuring Edinburgh is a liveable city.\nAs far as I know, none of the political parties in Edinburgh have reached a position on the current Picardy Place proposals, but I think it is fair to say that the Greens oppose them just as much as the Tories support them. Within the Labour Group, I shall be arguing that the current proposals can’t be supported. That does not mean that my mind is closed, or that I won’t listen to the local community (and those representing them). It does, however, mean that I think Edinburgh deserves better.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_02_01_briefing-note-edinburgh-school-crossing-patrol-review/content_355.html": "Below is a briefing on the planned review of Edinburgh’s School Crossing Patrol service.\nProgress since the Transport & Environment Committee on 5 October 2017\nAgreement was given to consult with service providers and service users, to seek their views about existing School Crossing Patrol sites, as well as potential alternatives or additional new sites. This is not a budget saving exercise, but to ensure we are providing crossing guides where and when they are most needed.\nApproach\nWe plan to begin consulting in February. We will engage in three stages:\n- School Crossing Patrol (SCP) Guides and the School Crossing Patrol team\n- stakeholders and groups including Headteachers, PTAs, Councillors\n- parents, carers, school pupils, general public.\nWe will invite the SCP Guides to meetings at which they can meet the team working on the review, ask any questions they may have and contribute their views on the service to help shape the review. This will be followed at a later date by an opportunity to complete a questionnaire. Any subsequent consultation will be sought via the Consultation Hub with printed surveys available for people without online access.\nAlthough no direct offer of ‘meetings’ will be made, the Road Safety and Active Travel team will consider specific requests for a meeting during the consultation.\nWe have spoken to People Support, Communications, Schools, Lifelong Learning and Planning and Building Standards to ensure these business areas are aware of this ongoing work and to secure their support where necessary.\nTimeline\nWeek beginning 22 January\nLetters will be sent to SCP Guides and the SCP team, informing them of the review and inviting them to one of two meetings, at which the School Crossing Transport Officer and personnel from the Road Safety and Active Travel team will explain the review process and its timeline. Those attending will be paid for their time at the meeting.\nHeadteachers, Councillors and Trade Unions will be updated on the review as SCP Guides may refer to them for support.\nWeek beginning 19 February to 6 April\nConsultation with Headteachers, PTAs, pupils, Junior Road Safety Officers, Councillors and Neighbourhood Partnerships via the Consultation Hub (printed versions will also be available).\nWeek beginning 12 March to 6 April\nConsultation with parents/carers and the public via Consultation Hub (printed versions will also be available).\nContact will also be made with Road Safety – Great Britain (RS-GB) and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) to consult with them as professional bodies in Road Safety.\nResults of consultation\nWe have already counted pedestrian and traffic numbers and undertaken a qualitative assessment of the road environment at every school crossing patrol site. The consultation feedback will be used alongside this to develop a draft SCP Policy for presentation to the Transport and Environment Committee in late 2018. Any potential budgetary or resource implications cannot be determined until a draft SCP Policy has been developed for approval.\nBackground and context\nThe School Crossing Patrol (SCP) service is not a statutory function. A national standard for an SCP service is set out in the Road Safety GB (RS-GB) School Crossing Patrol Service – Guidelines: revised November 2015.\nWhile those guidelines are used in Edinburgh to assess requests for new SCP sites, the Council does not have a policy for providing a SCP service. Although no existing sites have ever been formally dis-established, operational decisions have been taken to suspend some sites where there is little or no demand.\nAn initial report, ‘Review of School Crossing Patrol Service’ was agreed by the Transport and Environment Committee on 15 March 2016. After this, all sites were assessed.\nIn September 2016, there were 243 established SCP sites, of which 38 were considered to be non-operational. The number of SCP Guides employed varies due to fluctuating levels of staff turnover. At the time of the assessments in September 2016 there were 157 SCP Guides. All 243 sites were analysed, assessing demand from children to cross the road, traffic levels and the local road environment at each to gather the required data. The current budget is sufficient to employ 173 Guides.\nThe development of an SCP Policy will enable the Council to ensure the service:\n- aligns with its strategic transport objectives\n- ensures limited resources are deployed effectively\n- reflects an assessed level of risk and considers the safety of all road users\n- has an appropriate level of budgetary provision.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_01_18_saved-colintons-public-toilets/content_726.html": "Today the City of Edinburgh Council published for consultation a list of “savings” it is considering after the Scottish Government proposed a substantial cut to its core funding. These proposals have been long awaited in Colinton after the Evening News published a “secret” plan to close the public toilets in the village.\nBehind the scenes and in public, I have made sure the views of local residents, Colinton Community Council and Colinton Amenity Association were heard on the issue. I am happy to report that I have been at least partly successful.\nThe plan is now as follows:\n- To achieve a saving in 2019/20, it is proposed to reorganise staffing arrangements. This would move away from the 16 full time employees that maintain public toilets citywide and create a larger number of part-time contracts to deliver the service locally (the same model is used in schools).\n- To develop an enhanced Community Toilet Scheme for the city.\n- To investigate the options to improve public convenience provision as the current service is not consistent across the city. This will include reviewing all of the current facilities, understanding the issues/challenges with each facility (building fabric, maintenance, antisocial behaviour, and speaking to the people working at the facilities).\n- In addition, alternative locations and options for providing public conveniences will be investigated. Following this, a feasibility assessment will be carried out on each facility alongside the options available to improve accessibility and quality.\n- I have asked that groups representing vulnerable people and those with certain health conditions are consulted.\n- The proposal to enhance the Community Toilet Scheme and the outcome of these investigations will be reported to Elected Members in autumn 2019, alongside recommendations for next steps.\nAs Colinton’s public toilets are well used (not least by bus drivers), in a good state of repair (confirmed to me by the Council), have no crimes associated with them (confirmed to me by Police Scotland) and fully accessible, I fully expect their future will be secured in the review.\nNonetheless, I would strongly suggest Ward 8 residents take part in the consultation and write to Gordon MacDoland MSP asking him not to back cuts to Edinburgh’s budget.",

This will realise a saving of £50,000.\n- We will send out information on Social Media and Radio to confirm no changes to the collection schedule.\n- We will however write to all 7500 of our assisted collection customers to provide a hard copy of next year’s collection calendar and to confirm that collections will continue as usual.\nChristmas Tree Recycling\n- Residents don’t need a garden waste permit to have their tree recycled.\n- Trees can be taken to any of our three recycling centres (residents must book an appointment on our website to visit a recycling centre).\n- We’ll also be collecting trees on designated dates for each street. Residents should look up their street on our festive dates web page later in December to find out which day we’re collecting in their street and what they need to do.\n- Trees should be put out for collection by 6am on the designated collection date for that street. All decorations and bases should be removed and if it is 6ft tall or higher, please cut it in half first.

He then declined to say much more on the subject.\nIndeed, when pushed on the issue by the Evening News’s Euan McGory all he would say about the cuts he has planned for education was “you’re asking me to confirm each budget line but I don’t think that’s helpful at this stage”.\nThe cat was, however, let out the bag at the Finance and Resources Committee the next day. The SNP Finance Convener, Alasdair Rankin, point blank refused to rule out any of the education cuts reported by the Evening News and was even unwilling to say any were “ill-informed”. Worse than that, he said he would not be “entirely ruling them” out and the Council “inevitably faces hard choices”.\nCouncillors Rankin and McVey know that as education takes up around 40% of the Council’s budget, it can’t avoid the cuts unless they are amplified elsewhere.\nAs stark as the funding crisis is, we should not accept that the cuts are inevitable.\nWe know that in the 5 years since 2013-14 funding for day-to-day council spending from the SNP Government has decreased by 7.1% but the UK Government only cut the Scottish Government’s revenue budget by 1.8%.\nIt’s time that the Scottish Government’s attacks on council funding ended – that’s the only way to protect education in Edinburgh. Rather than making vague assertions on social media, our capital’s Councillors should all be standing up for Edinburgh.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_09_25_putting-walking-first-in-edinburgh/content_157.html": "It feels like summer is drawing to a close, and it has been quite a memorable one where weather is concerned. We’ve had both floods and heatwaves in Edinburgh. We’ve also seen huge weather variations across the world, and many people are now drawing the conclusion that climate change predictions are becoming reality. I think these people are right, and I hope COP26 in Glasgow forces the UK and Scottish Governments to move beyond talking about “ambitious” targets, and start taking action.\nIn the coming decade we will see much changing in Edinburgh in response to the climate emergency. I think we all should now demand that new developments come with better public transport links, and new homes come with things like ground source heat pumps and solar panels as standard. I’m interested to see if technology can be used to better integrate these things at a community level so that if an individual has excess solar power, they can “sell” it to their neighbour.\nAt a city-region scale, I hope we will also see local authorities working together to provide a fully integrated and publicly owned public transport system. This is key as whilst we cannot drive our way out of the climate crisis, people must have a viable alternative if they are to give up their car.\nThe challenges are no smaller in our communities. Over half of car journeys are under 5 miles, and we know that many people would be happy to walk, cycle or take the bus if it was viable. There is a lot of talk about improving buses, trams and cycling in Edinburgh, but we don’t talk enough about the most sustainable mode of transport – walking!\nWe know that women, older and poorer people are the least likely to own a car or bike, but too often the footpaths they use are too narrow, potholed, cluttered and have cars parked on them. We need to ensure walking is at the top of our transport hierarchy if we are serious about equality, the climate emergency, the obesity crisis and social isolation. What’s stopping this from happening?",

Maybe it’s time for them to have a wee chat about how the SNP Government is funding Edinburgh?\nRather than picking a corner in this spat between Gordon MacDonald MSP and his party’s Councillors, however, I’d advise people to simply take part in consultation on the future of Currie High School and WHEC, and also ask Gordon MacDonald MSP to stop cutting Edinburgh’s budget.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_09_05_the-official-lanark-road-spaces-for-people-survey-starts-tomorrow/content_212.html": "I understand a survey will go out to local people tomorrow asking their views about the future of the Lanark Road Spaces for People scheme.\nEarlier this year, the Council asked residents and businesses what they thought about keeping the Spaces for People measures for a longer experimental period (or permanently) as they feel they help it achieve some of their longer-term ambitions for the “people-focussed travel network” included in the City Mobility Plan. This consultation rejected the Lanark Road scheme largely based on safety grounds, and the current mini-review aims to see if these can be addressed.\nThe survey going out tomorrow will seek the resident’s views on:\n- measures to achieve cycle speed reductions; and,\n- changes to the parking spaces which sit outside protected cycle lanes.\nThe Council have developed proposals which they feel focus primarily on those locations where conflict is most likely – that is where cyclists might be travelling at speed on the inside of parked vehicles. They’ve discussed these options with Community Councillors (I was not invited to this) and they say the comments have helped them inform the proposals.\nI have not been given prior sight of the survey(!), but I was successful in having the area it covers enlarged and I was also given a commitment that local businesses would be included.\nBelow are notes from the meeting with Community Councillors – the discussion was based on the slides I shared here. The discussion sounds constructive, but it appears very little hard data informed proceedings (a concern given the recent RED Internal Audit finding SfP received).\nMeeting Notes\nSfP presented the previously circulated document, outlining the options which had been developed to mitigate cycle speed, and conflict between people accessing parked cars, and people on bikes.\nProposals include the introduction of road markings on the cycleway to encourage people cycling to slow down on approach to parking areas, as well as specific options for revisions at two parking areas: Spylaw Park (by Cranley Nursery), and; Kingsknowe Park (by Dovecot Park).\nSpylaw Park (street)\nThe Council is aware of concerns regarding conflict between parents accessing Cranley Nursery and passing cyclists at this location. Due to its location this section of cycleway is also likely to be less heavily used, and less beneficial to users than the remainder of the corridor.\nThere are two proposed options at this location.\n- Remove the Parking\n- Remove the cycleway\n(NB: SfP clarified during the presentation that there is a third option at this location – to leave it as it currently with both parking and cycleway, and that this will be made clear in any community engagement)\nA Community Councillor stated that cycle counts were being carried out but the Post-Implementation results were not yet available, and that they would not go into granular enough detail to assess this specific location. Though this level of granularity may be available from Strava data, and this can be considered in advance of final decisions being made. However, the assumption that it sees less use than the rest of the route is reasonable.\nA Community Councillor suggested that this area should remain as it is now, with improvements made if possible, and that it would be a retrograde step to remove the infrastructure now it is in place. AG further suggested that the cycleway should instead be extended further west to more effective connect the communities to the West of the bypass.\nOfficers noted that no support was voiced for removing the cycleway at this location, and that this would be considered in developing the public engagement, which would include the option to retain the current layout.\nKingsknowe Park\nThe Council is aware of conflict at this location between people accessing the parked cars and passing cyclists, including reports of near misses and collisions. There are two options at this location:\n- Remove the parking\n- Relocate the parking to the opposite side of the road\n- (Relocating the parking results in a net increase in the number of spaces)\n(NB: SfP explained that due to the occurrence of at least one collision at this location it was not considered a viable option to make no changes here – as such leaving the layout as it is was probably not a viable third option)\nA Community Councillor stated that relocating the parking to the uphill side of the road seemed a sensible move, but asked about receiving deliveries etc for the flats where the parking is currently located.\nSfP explained that loading/unloading, as well as pick-up / drop-off was still permitted on Double Yellow Lines. As such there will still be space for deliveries and other such uses to be carried out from the kerbside. As a brief activity this is permitted to take place from the cycleway where space allows.\nTwo Community Councillors agreed that relocating the parking to the uphill side of the street was a sensible option. Though one noted that electric bicycles can still travel at reasonable speeds uphill – though this was probably acceptable as the assisted speeds are still below what can be achieved when travelling downhill.\nA Community Councillor queried whether the bollards could be removed from the downhill parking bay to provide more manoeuvring space for people cycling.\nSfP explained that this would likely result in vehicles parking closer to the kerb, which would both remove the benefit, and increase the likelihood of ‘dooring’ accidents. Though SfP noted that the bollards have been omitted from the parking areas adjacent to the two nurseries, and adherence does seem to have been good. Nonetheless, the problem is resolved by relocating the parking.\nOfficers noted that there seemed to be a generally favourable view of relocating the parking bay at this location to the uphill side.\nOther Parking Locations\nAt all remaining parking areas the risk of conflict between people cycling and people accessing parked cars is mitigated by the topography. Nonetheless, it is proposed to introduce further markings to encourage people cycling to keep to an appropriate speed while passing parking areas.\nAttendees agreed that this would be a positive change.\nGeneral Discussion\nA Community Councillor suggested introducing timed parking bays at the parking areas with high demand for customers. Officers highlighted that this is not possible using a TTRO, however it would be possible using an ETRO should the schemes be retained for a longer period.\nA Community Councillor queried why we are not paining SLOW on the main carriageway given drivers are being recorded at speeds of 68mph even with the new road design changes. Surely the balance of risk has lost it’s sense of proportionality if we are only concerned about writing SLOW on the cycle lanes? I do support writing it on the cycle lanes before the floating parking bays but why not for drivers also? ‘Traveling Safely’ must surely apply to all road users\nA Community Councillor suggested that the ‘floating’ parking bays should be ‘bookended’ better, eg: with planters, to ensure that they are conspicuous even when lightly used. It was also noted that these bays provide a valuable purpose in traffic calming by requiring passing vehicles to reduce their speed.\nA Community Councillor highlighted that the cycle crossing point at the junction of Lanark Road and Kingsknowe Drive has poor visibility and should be altered to ensure safety.\nA Community Councillor noted that some parking for the golf course has been displaced and that parking around the junctions of Kingsknowe Gardens and Kingsknowe Avenue, with Kingsknowe Road South. AG suggested installing Double Yellow Lines at these junctions to ease parking concerns.\nA Community Councillor expressed support for points made by others, including retaining the parking and cycleway adjacent to Cranley Nursery and relocating the parking at Dovecot Park, and introducing SLOW markings on the cycleway. When asked for his thoughts on extending the cycleway further west the Community Councillor stated that should this be considered it should be alongside further engagement.\nA Community Councillor suggested reducing the speed limit on Lanark Road further to 20mph. Further suggested installing Crossways (Zebra Crossings without Belisha Beacons) at regular intervals in Lanark Road and at Side Roads, and highlighted the need to improve the environment for cycling on Lanark Road between Inglis Green Road and Hutchison Avenue, especially in light of the new developments taking place in the area.\nOfficer’s Response\nOfficers stated that these points would be considered in advance of engagement with residents, and where appropriate the designs, and options, would be updated. In particular, consideration will be given to improving opportunities for crossing the road throughout the scheme, and consideration will be given to the inclusion of a temporary-traffic light controlled crossing. Though officers highlighted that budgetary constraints may create difficulties as such installations are costly due to the ongoing hire costs involved.\nTwo attendees sent further comments.\nA Community Councillor had to leave early but submitted the following questions before leaving, and asked that they be answered:\n- Q: What can be done about enforcement whether that’s speeds (cyclist and cars) or parking illegally?\n- Answer: Enforcement of traffic speeds is carried out by the Police. Police Scotland have carried out enforcement recently following numerous concerns about speeding and are issuing penalties. Speed limits only apply to motorised vehicles as such it is not possible to ‘enforce’ cycle speeds, though it is unlikely that any more than a small minority of cyclists are travelling at speeds in excess of 30mph on this route. The Council is monitoring cycle speeds and will be able to consider whether further mitigations are required in the future.\n- Q: Will anything be done to improve/reduce conflict on the Water of Leith. The largest number of complaints I receive are around inconsiderate cyclists on the water of leith. if we are improving safety for cyclists on Lanark Road, is there a way or justificaiton on directing them away from WoL? Especially what we’ve been referring to as the ‘Strava’ ones?\n- Answer: It is not proposed to actively discourage users from using the Water of Leith, however Lanark Road provides a far more direct route and it is hoped that this will encourage greater use from those people who value speed while cycling.\nA Community Councillor was unable to contribute during the meeting due to technical troubles. However, they sent comments after the meeting, which included:\n- Requirement for pedestrian crossing improvements long overdue\n- Relocation of parking at Dovecot Park supported\n- Cycle crossing at Kingsknowe Drive dangerous due to visibility\n- People are much safer cycling on the new route, though some still choose to stay on road\n- Difficult for motorists joining Lanark Road from side roads due to visibility being obscured by parked cars\n- Don’t agree with banning people cycling on Water of Leith\n- Agreement with 30mph limit, but 20mph not required\n- Speed cameras should be re-instated, query why the only face east\n- Several changes at once, means it’s hard to identify results of each\n- Lack of clarity on what metrics will be used to assess the impact of the scheme",

We could probably estimate the cost of this to our stressed Ambulance Service, NHS and Social Care system, but the human cost is incalculable.\nThe seriousness of this situation is why all 61 Councillors (2 Councillors from one party were absent) present at Full Council last week backed a call to review the system currently used to keep our footpaths, roads and cycle-paths free of ice and snow. The clear message is that the status quo is not good enough for Scotland’s capital city and that residents are right to feel angry.\nThe solutions brought forward by the review are likely to include a mix of using existing resources better, investing in new technology and making a wider pool of Council staff available to keep the streets safe.\nCutting across this, I hope to see far greater priority given to higher lying areas (e.g. Fairmilehead, Colinton, Oxgangs, Bonaly & Balerno) and also communities which have high proportions of older residents.\nIndeed, it breaks my heart to hear stories of older people “trapped” at home waiting for snow to melt. They helped make our city what it is today, so deserve greater respect from the rest of us.\nI shall also be arguing that communities be given the resources they need to be more resilient. I’d like to encourage more people and businesses to return to the tradition of clearing the path outside their house, and perhaps even that of an elderly neighbour. Of course, to do that we’ll have to make sure grit bins are serviceable and kept full. Ensuring we have the resources to do that alone would be a great starting point.",

Their ideological squeeze on public spending combined with their assault on the welfare system makes it harder for Edinburgh to be all it can be.\nThat, however, is only part of the story. We know that in the five years since 2013-14, funding for day-to-day council funding from the Scottish Government has decreased by 7.1% but the UK Government only cut the Scottish Government’s revenue budget by 1.8%. On average across Scotland, the SNP have cut Council spending by £148 per person but in Edinburgh the cut has been even bigger – £226 per person.\nIt is within that context that services in Edinburgh are being cut, charges are rising, projects are delayed, services are failing and that people in our Capital will soon be forced to pay to have their garden waste collected. This should anger us all.\nEdinburgh’s Labour Councillors have responded by spearheading the debate on introducing a modest “hotel tax” to help fund services for visitors and tourists alike. This has massive public support, but the SNP and the Tories continue to oppose giving Edinburgh this power – they are hand-in-glove on holding us back.\nThis is not the only area where the SNP Government is holding back Edinburgh. On everything from Airbnb to Uber, they simply will not give out Capital the powers to act.\nThe SNP spent their conference in Aberdeen last week spouting the tired old line about being “Stronger for Scotland”, I just wish their Edinburgh branch office would stand up for our Capital. The first step in doing that must surely be to be honest about who is cutting our budget.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_07_28_what-does-the-city-of-edinburgh-councils-do-with-your-waste-plastics/content_445.html": "I was asked by a constituent what the Council does with the plastics it collects. Specifically they wanted to know if it was being recycled, landfilled or burned. This was triggered by the “War on Plastic” BBC TV Programme. Below is the answer…\nThe Council has in place various collection systems which directly collect materials for recycling or which otherwise divert materials for recycling, but is not always directly involved in selling to the end use markets.\nThe main one which householders will use is the contract which covers dry mixed recycling (paper, card, cans and plastics) from household kerbside collections, recycling points in flats and public recycling points, but other sources of recyclable materials include litter bins (which are not collected specifically for recycling but are sorted to allow some recycling to take place), and the bulk recycling skips at Household Waste Recycling Centres.\nAlthough these services are different in detail, for each of our mixed recycling services (green recycling bin, packaging banks and litter collections) essentially in each case a contractor is receiving the mixed streams of materials. These then go through a sorting process and the different materials are sorted into individual streams. It is the contractor’s responsibility to place the materials on the recycling markets. Because the markets themselves change constantly, the waste management companies will deal with a number of different companies across their different waste streams and these may change on an ongoing basis. However it should be noted that the export of clean, properly sorted materials (as opposed to what was shown on the programme) is a legitimate activity. Although some outlets for these are in the Far East, equally materials are exported from the UK to Europe and Scandinavia. So many of the goods we use are themselves imported so they have to be exported to be recycled.\nWe publish information in relation to this on our website at here.\nThe waste management company may not always necessarily be selling to the end user but to an intermediary who in turn sells onto a reprocessor who may be cleaning and shredding materials, and then ultimately to someone who buys the now raw materials to make something with. This is a function of how the waste management industry is structured. However The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) is responsible for regulating all aspects of the waste industry so they will be aware of the end destinations of recycled materials for the whole of Scotland (in England and Wales this is managed by The Environment Agency). They publish this on a system called Waste Data Flow which tracks all waste in the UK and where it is going, although some of the information will be redacted for commercial reasons.\nEach waste management company we deal with issues a monthly statement to us which provides the total of each material recycled (paper, card, plastics, metals, rejects or residual wastes, etc) but it will not always be broken down any further. This is complicated further because when the markets are performing particularly well there will be more incentive to carry out sorting into more streams (e.g. to separate milk bottles from coloured bottles, which may otherwise be reprocessed together).\nTo use the example of the mixed recycling contract, which is managed by Biffa it is their responsibility to sort and sell as much as possible for recycling and indeed it is in their interest to do so as that material has a market value to them.\nWe of course realise that there will be materials in each load which either should not be there (e.g. toys, clothes, etc) or is too contaminated (e.g. because it was not cleaned). There are also some materials such as black microwave trays which are recyclable but the markets are weak. Those would be recycled where possible but if there is no market they do have the option not to pull them out. However materials which are not recycled in the mixed recycling stream are reprocessed as refuse derived fuel, which means they are shredded and dried and used as a cleaner replacement for coal in a power station operated by Scottish and Southern Energy, so there is still an environmental benefit. We do not collect plastic films (e.g. plastic bags) such as those featured in the programme.\nThere are some exceptions to this – for example glass, food, wood, and garden waste are all collected as single streams and go to a specific end user. The outlets for some of those are listed on our website at , but these are all recycled in Lothian or, in the case of glass, Lanarkshire.\nRecycling rates in this country are based on what is sent for recycling after it has been sorted, not what is collected at the start- this is in contrast to other countries where the materials which are sent for refuse derived fuel would often be counted as recycled as well. Our performance is reported monthly to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and published annually in a user friendly format here.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_07_02_maybe-what-was-right-for-nottingham-in-2011-is-not-right-for-edinburgh-today_comment-page-1/content_344.html": "This week the SNP, Greens and Lib-Dems forced City of Edinburgh Council to bring forward a Workplace Parking Levy (WPL) plan.\nThe SNP/Greens plan on setting the minimum car park size at 50 for inclusion in the WPL – this would exclude a significant number of businesses from the plan, particularly in the city centre where air quality is an issue, and where congestion impacts significantly on the wellbeing of residents and public transport transit times.\nExisting Council modelling of WPL had focused on a minimum car park size of 11 and suggested income would be £9m pa, but SNP Councillors suggest that excluding a significant number of spaces from WPL by raising the minimum size to 50 will generate £10m. This simply is not credible.\nThe proposal takes no account of the concerns of residents living in communities adjacent to business areas such, as Edinburgh Park and Fairmilehead, where WPL may generate anti-social displacement parking. Why would staff pay £500 per year to park at the Scottish Water (say) site in Fairmilehead, when you can park in adjacent streets for free?\nThe SNP/Greens have also not addressed the concerns of Trade Unions regarding the impact that their indiscriminate WPL would have on low paid workers working anti-social hours with no access to public transport.\nNottingham introduced the UK’s only WPL in 2011, but traffic volume has grown faster (10%) there over the past decade or so since then than in Edinburgh (7%). It is clear that the WPL has generated cash in Nottingham, but it’s impact on congestion is less clear. Indeed, the focus of the proposal SNP/Green appears to be taxing (and thereby gentrifying) unwanted behaviours (rather than ending them) to help mitigate SNP/Green Government cuts – this is incompatible with Edinburgh’s commitment (and moral duty) to tackle the climate emergency.\nMaybe what was right for Nottingham in 2011, is not right for Edinburgh today. As Transport Convener I prefer to look to cities like Paris, where the politicians are working with residents to reduce traffic volume by investing in public and active transport. They don’t simply tax unwanted traffic, they provide a sustainable alternative – this plan will result in 70,000 parking spaces being unneeded. I offered the SNP/Greens Paris as a destination, but they chose Nottingham.\nI am a democrat, so I must respect the fact the the majority of Councillors backed the SNP/Green plan. Nonetheless, before the end of 2022 I hope to present Labour’s vision for the biggest expansion in public transport our capital has seen this century – inc tram, bus lanes and park & ride schemes. We will listen to residents on this issue, and work with them and surrounding local authorities to transform and decarbonise the transportation system in our capital. We will take Edinburgh forward.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_07_30_briefing-the-potential-block-on-voting-rights-for-religious-representatives-on-schooling-issues-in-edinburgh/content_467.html": "The Evening News on Monday reported that Archbishop Leo Cushley had raised concerns about a move by the Greens and Lib Dems Parties to “block voting rights (on the Education Committee) for religious representatives on schooling issues“. He saw the move as a threat to Catholic education in Edinburgh. His intervention quickly became national news. Although Greens in Glasgow have distanced themselves from the move, the Greens in Edinburgh are not backing down despite there being doubt that the move is even legal.\nTo be clear, I am absolutely committed to the continuance of Catholic education in Edinburgh and want the Catholic Church of Scotland to have a say in how it is delivered. As an Elder of the Church of Scotland, I also feel all faiths should be more vocal on issues of concern to society, and help give a voice to those that don’t have one. I feel having voting rights serves both those aims.\nLast year I spoke informally to Rabbi David Rose about his involvement in the committee, and he was clear to me that he felt his involvement was worthwhile, but he seldom used his right to vote (Note – I don’t know his view on voting rights). I think he has now stood down and the position has moved to another faith, but I expect they will have the same experience. Faith leaders like Rabbi Rose are well connected to their communities and wider society, so there is no doubt they have a valuable contribution to make. However, speaking at Council Committee is very different from having voting rights.\nI understand why people are concerned about this issue, but I think it’s right that all faith groups have a say on how schools operate – particularly the faith element. Any change to voting rights should be part of a wider discussion about faith education in schools and how stakeholders can have a say in it. Arbitrarily removing voting rights is not the answer.\nBelow is a briefing on the issue from Council Officers.\nYou may be receiving lobby letters regarding the voting rights of religious reps on the Education, Children and Families Committee. Ian would like to respond on behalf of the Labour Group and asks that you please send any letters through to him for a reply. Some background information you may find useful;\nEC&F has three religious representatives (Catholic Church, Church of Scotland and Interfaith) and one parent representative. The parent representative is currently a non-voting member whilst the religious representatives have voting rights. This stems from the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 which states if an Education authority forms a Committee, it must include religious representatives. The act however says nothing on the voting rights of the religious members, this is at the discretion of the local authority. Previously, the Committee had a parent rep as a voting member and 2 teacher reps however as teachers are employees of the Council this was felt to be inappropriate and the positions removed.\nTraditionally religious reps abstain from voting although there is nothing to prevent them doing so. Perth and Kinross Council have recently removed the voting rights of their religious reps following a decision in which the reps voted which resulted in a school closure. This has sparked interest in other local authorities and although there has been no legal challenge to the decision from Perth and Kinross, there are concerns there would be more attention focused on Edinburgh as the capital. This has gained particular attention from the Catholic Church with the Archbishop Leo Cushley writing to priests describing this as the first step in removing faith education from schools in Scotland.\nA report in response to the Green motion will go to Council in August, the recommendations outline the legal position and ask elected members to decide whether to remove the voting rights. If these were to be removed, the religious reps would remain on the Committee as non-voting members.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_11_27_community-speedwatch-scheme-in-south-west-edinburgh/content_765.html": "Below is a briefing from the police in South West Edinburgh on the “Community Speedwatch Scheme” which allows trained private citizens monitor speeding in their neighbourhood. The scheme is already working in Fife. I’d rather the police were doing this work, but I accept residents may want to play a role in making their community safer.\nI am contacting you to provide an update in relation to the Community Speedwatch Scheme. As most of you will be aware, this was initially mentioned some time ago by CI Alan Carson when he was the South West Chief Inspector. Community Speedwatch is a voluntary scheme, involving approved members of local communities to monitor vehicle speeds at identified sites. This scheme is not about enforcement or intended to replace any police activity, this scheme is another layer of road safety that members of the community can be involved in.\nIn the South West we have been continuing to work on introducing the scheme. It has taken longer than expected due to insurance and financial complexities but I am pleased to report that we have now addressed these and are at the stage where we can introduce the pilot.\nThe pilot will be the first time that Community Speed Watch has operated in Edinburgh Division and we are offering the South West local Community Councils an opportunity to apply to take part. From applications we will initially select 2 locations to launch the scheme in Spring 2020 and if successful, roll out availability to all South West Community Councils in later in 2020.\nThe scheme will work by trained volunteers working in a team of three, using a detection device to monitor the speeds of vehicles travelling through their local area. The registration number of speeding vehicles is recorded. Warning letters are then sent out by the Police to the registered keepers stating that their vehicle has been reported as speeding. Locations for monitoring speed are selected from sites suggested by the community, based on where there is most local concern about speeding traffic, or the impact of speed. Sites will be risk assessed for suitability by Police, and we will provide the use of a speed detection device, high visibility jackets, signage and equipment for the collection of data. Any ongoing issues will be picked up by the police and enforcement activity undertaken.\nWe are this week contacting every Community Council in the South West providing details of the scheme to allow them to discuss with their members. The Police Community teams will provide a full overview in due course during their attendance at Community Council meetings allowing members to decide if they wish to participate.\nA training package will be provided by the Police to all volunteers. The training provided will cover an overview of the scheme and how it works, the operation of the speed detection device, how to record the data collected by volunteers, general data protection principles, personal safety and conflict management, in addition to health and safety awareness.",

I learnt a few lessons, not least from this video which they shared.\nIt is pretty clear that they feel they (and people with visual impairments) have been excluded to some extent from the consultation process. In particular, they highlighted that the Common Place tool is visually driven, and no alternative was provided for people with sight loss- this is shameful stuff.\nWe also shared concerns about the balance between support for cycling and walking, with things like floating bus stops putting vulnerable pedestrians at a real disadvantage. Their key requests include:\n- Mobility and accessibility needs of disabled people are fully considered in the planning and delivery of such measures.\n- It is essential to consider the impacts of any temporary measures on disabled people, including people who have difficulty walking, wheelchair users, people with cognitive impairments, dementia, autism, etc. and people with sensory impairments. This is a legal requirement under the provisions of the 2010 Equality Act.\n- Many disabled people have found the pandemic extremely stressful. Changes to usual travel patterns, to public transport services, parking arrangements, etc. can add to anxiety. Spaces for People initiatives should therefore be seen in this context – continual changes should therefore be avoided where possible, and should be effectively communicated to the public including disabled people.\n- Many disabled people depend on cars (both to drive and as a passenger) and taxis. Road changes shouldn’t prevent disabled people from being able to stop near their destination. This is not only about ‘disabled parking bays’ but also considering if measures may reduce vehicle access to kerbs and the flexibility for blue badge holdersto park on single or double yellow lines.\n- Safe space for pedestrians should be separate from cyclists as far as possible. Any shared-use paths or areas must be designed so that cyclists understand the need to give way to pedestrians and maintain a reasonable distance.\nTheir guidance to Councils is here:",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_09_03_consultation-taming-airbnb-in-edinburgh/content_77.html": "Below is a briefing from the Council on a consultation which is now underway in Edinburgh. After 10 years of inaction (and actually supporting Airbnb), the Scottish Government have given the Council the powers to reduce the impact of Airbnb. Essentially, these changes will mean that in many instances the Airbnb host will have to apply for a “change of use” in order to operate if the let is not their principle home. You can take part in the consultation here.\n| Briefing We’re seeking views on a proposal for Edinburgh to be short term let (STL) control area. A public consultation approved by the Planning Committee on 11 August, will run from today (3 September 2021) for nine weeks, until the 5 November 2021. If, following the public consultation, the Council gives the go ahead and the proposal is approved by the Scottish Government, the new powers would mean all residential properties, which are not an owner’s principle home, being let as STLs in their totality throughout the local authority area would require approval of a ‘change of use’ to a STL from Planning. Our ‘Choices’ consultation responses for our next local development plan, ‘City Plan 2030’, also showed overwhelming support for us to look at control areas in the Capital. Around a third of STLs in Scotland are in Edinburgh. At the moment, in addition to planning applications made for STLs, to establish whether or not planning permission is required for properties where this is disputed, the Council’s enforcement team looks at each case individually, which is a very lengthy and time consuming process. The introduction of powers to make a control area, follows the Council calling for new legislation to tighten up the control of STLs to help manage high concentrations of secondary letting where it affects the availability of residential housing or the character of a neighbourhood. Also, it will help to restrict or prevent STLs in places or types of buildings where they are not appropriate as well as making sure homes are used to best effect in their areas. Generally renting out a room/s in your house or letting your property whilst on holiday would also still be allowed if Edinburgh became a STL control zone. The Scottish Government is currently consulting on legislation to introduce a new licensing regime next year, which the Council also called for, to address the issues of safety, anti-social behaviour and noise. These issues have all had a detrimental effect on communities as the number of STLs has greatly increased across the city in recent years. The proposal is that all Scottish councils will have to adopt a STL licensing system by October 2022. In terms of the Government’s proposed new licensing regime, if Edinburgh becomes a control area it will be a mandatory condition of any licensing application to have made a planning application or to have planning permission already when providing accommodation that requires it. Further information Q. What is a short term let? A. Details can be found in Annex B of the Scottish Government’s Planning Circular on Short-Term Let Control Areas. Q. How many STLs are Edinburgh? A. There are a significant number of short-term lets in Edinburgh, with the Airbnb platform providing a useful indicator of the scale of this in the city. In the period 2016-2019 there was a substantial rise in the number of both entire properties and rooms registered with Airbnb. Relative to other areas in Scotland the number of Airbnb listings is high making the impact on the city disproportionate. In 2019, 31% of all Airbnb listings in Scotland were in the city of Edinburgh. The next greatest proportion was 19% in Highland followed by 7%. |",

Key to my job as a Councillor is a duty to protect these spaces and ensure they are well used.\nIn recent months I played a small part in getting Fairmilehead Park its Green Flag Award, I helped Oxgangs Trinity FC be allocated Colinton Mains Park as their “home ground” and most recently I’ve been working with Pentland Community Centre to find the £100k needed to upgrade the neighbouring playpark.\nOne park, however, has taken up more of my energy in recent times than any other: Campbell Park. This is situated just off Woodhall Road and comprises a large sports field, a pavilion and a playpark for younger children. The area was orginally donated to the community by a local farmer and has been much loved since it was dedicated as a recreation area in 1936.\nThe challenge the community now faces is that Currie Star Football Club and Edinburgh Cricket Club, both fantastic organisations in their own right, hope to use new Scottish Government legislation to take over the long-term management of the site. They plan to invest tens of thousands of pounds improving the playing surface to make it one of the best natural sports surfaces in the city.\nThis, however, comes with a catch. Once the surface is improved it will be used more intensively by the clubs. I think all Colinton people welcome young people taking part in physical exercise, but the community around the park have voiced legitimate concerns about the impact of over a hundred people arriving at once on an already often unacceptable parking situation and ongoing problems with litter control.\nThe clubs concerned have been running a consultation on their proposals over the summer which they would agree has been botched. A frank discussion took place regarding the proposal at the September Colinton Community Council meeting (where other community groups were well represented) where is was agreed the clubs would start afresh with their consultation.\nA full and proper consultation is important as I have been clear that the proposal can’t proceed unless the community’s questions are answered and they offer their support for the plans put forward by the clubs.",

She’s listened, reflected and ultimately ignored the message Scotland sent the SNP on the 8th of June. She’s right. We’re wrong.\nIn an election dominated by the spectre of a second divisive independence referendum, he SNP suffered a real leathering. Rather than stick her unwanted indyref2 in the bin along with her plans to scrap the council tax, she has simply paused the countdown for six months in the hope that will give her time to find an argument that stacks up. It won’t.\nShe is still pinning all her hopes on Brexit being bad for Scotland. She hopes that will drive us Scots to her independence cliff edge.\nForget the fact that she still has no credible alternative to Brexit or that she has no financial case for independence, she still wants her own “Project Fear” to do the work.\nForget the positive 2014 messages about fighting inequality, he SNP’s record has caught up with them so all they now offer is fear.\nIn her speech Nicola Sturgeon conceded that “there are people who don’t want another referendum…”. Another way of describing these people is to use the term “majority”. Indeed, in my own Ward 75% of voters backed pro-UK candidates in May – each recognised the damage independence would do to Edinburgh.\nFrom the financial sector to our universities, jobs rely on strong links to the UK far more than the EU. It’s time for Nicola Sturgeon to reflect on that fact!",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_12_13_labours-manifesto-became-irrelevant-as-voters-had-lost-trust-in-jeremy-corbyn/content_550.html": "Ian Murray MP was correct when he said in his acceptance speech that Labour had let down the country. The Tories had their best result since the 80’s and Labour had its worst result since the 30’s. People across the UK from Peterhead to Plymouth have been slipping into poverty under the Tories since 2010, and that may accelerate if Brexit is now implemented by Boris Johnson and his Eton chum Jacob Rees-Mogg.\nAs an MP Ian Murray lost friends last night (and their staff lost their jobs), and many voters right across the UK lost hope. I knocked on hundreds of doors for Labour in Edinburgh South and found that Jeremy Corbyn was a bigger issue for voters than Indyref & Brexit combined. Yes, some voters were supportive of Jeremy Corbyn but the vast majority simply did not trust him. It is now clear from media reports that this was not an uncommon experience.\nYes, voters don’t trust Boris either, but it is clear they put a Tory Brexit before a radical Labour Manifesto. With just one result to be called, Labour is on 32.2% nationally and the Tories won 43.6% on a nationalist ticket.\nIn Scotland the situation is more complex. Tactical voting for the SNP took the nationalist vote here to 45% of the vote, with Labour on 18.6% (an 8.5% drop on what Kezia Dugdale achieved in 2017) and the Tories on 25.1%. Whilst much of the local SNP campaigns avoided talking about independence, Nicola Sturgeon is claiming that pro-UK parties only winning 54% of Scottish votes is a mandate for a further referendum. She has said that next week her Nationalist Government will publish a “detailed democratic case” for letting her decide on whether there should be a second independence referendum.\nDon’t expect that “detailed” case from Nicola Sturgeon to answer fundamental questions on the deficit, currency or even EU membership. Instead she’ll argue that Scotland should walk away from those slipping in to poverty south of the border, without really providing answers on what Scotland’s financial position would be.\nSo people north and south of the border face a bleak future one way or another despite Labour offering some fantastic policies in our manifesto. The problem is that the lack of trust in Jeremy Corbyn meant our manifesto did not connect with voters. This loss of trust, of course, started with how the party dealt with the Brexit result – the party equivocated when leadership was required. A different leader may well have been able to bridge the remain and leave positions, but neither camp were willing to trust Jeremy Corbyn due to his record on the EU. The EU election was possibly our last chance to regain trust, but we wasted that opportunity.\nA second issue which undermined trust in Jeremy Corbyn is the issue of anti-Jewish racism. Although seldom raised on the doorstep, those that brought it up always had heartfelt concerns.\nSoon Labour will face the challenge of fighting the 2021 Holyrood elections. These elections approach us at a time when the public in Scotland is openly questioning the state of key public services like education and health. Before we can respond to that challenge, however, we need to rebuild trust in our party, and its leadership.\nDespite the best efforts of the SNP, Brexit will continue to dominate UK politics in the coming weeks. That’s why I welcome the fact that Jeremy Corbyn has said he will soon stand down and I hope we can enter the next sitting of parliament with an acting leader that has been clear and unequivocal on the issue.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_03_24_council-briefing-covid-19-additional-accommodation-needs/content_560.html": "The briefing below outlines how the City of Edinburgh Council is planning to manage any extra demand for temporary accommodation arising from the Covid-19 crisis.\nBriefing\nThis briefing note confirms the creation of a team to which will actively co-ordinate the provision of additional temporary accommodation and support for a range of requirements brought about by the Covid -19 pandemic. The Additional Accommodation Needs Team (AANT) was agreed through the Council’s Incident Management Team on 22 March 2020.\nAction\nThe Council and Health and Social Care partners, through a variety of routes have been offered a range of accommodation from social housing and the private sector in addition to the potential use of university accommodation. To actively manage this, we will:\n- Send out a Council message to thanks those who have come forward so far;\n- Advise we will be in touch before the end of the week, if not earlier to gather additional information regarding numbers, costs and support requirements. For example. we have had an offer so far from one provider of a 500 bedded hotel;\n- We will include in the message a contact e mail for any additional offers to come into -and a response will be provided within 3 working days of receipt.\n- We are drawing up a checklist of the information we will need to gather form these providers.\n- We will provide a progress report on, types of accommodation, and approximate numbers to Andrew Kerr and the Cabinet by Friday 27th and then on a weekly basis thereafter. Future progress reports will identify both the level of demand and the properties that we are progressing.\nBackground\nCurrently there are in the region of 3500 households in various forms of temporary accommodation in the city. Around 1300 of these spaces are shared accommodation, some with self-contained rooms, some\nsharing facilities.\nOn average there are around 80 – 120 people rough sleeping each evening, although street-based outreach services have indicated that this has reduced over the last 2 weeks.\nIn addition, up to 70 people use the Bethany Christian Trust Care Shelters each evening, this includes people with no recourse to public finds. This accommodation is accessed on a night by night basis. The shelters continue to operate at the moment and there are no confirmed cases of Covid -19 from people accessing the shelters. Public Health (Duncan McCormick) have been extremely helpful in assessing the arrangements and working practices in place within the Shelter and have visited recently. Public Health will play an active part in this team, providing the necessary advice and direction to ensure safe provision of temporary accommodation in light of Covid 19.\nIn relation to Bed and Breakfast accommodation we are being guided by advice from public health in relation to individual circumstances and we have also identified some self-contained accommodation for families currently in Bed and Breakfast to move in to and these moves are taking place.\nCurrent Circumstances\nTo date there have been a low number of requests from health partners to accommodate people who require to self-isolate. However, this is likely to increase and given the projected demand for hospital beds, it is likely a significant number of people who are in hospital, but who don’t need to be, will require alternative accommodation to free ups beds. This could potentially run into the hundreds.\nWe may also receive increased demands for accommodation in general. In addition, we are aware that the Scottish Government is currently considering the release of prisoners who are nearing completion of their sentences, in order to free up space within Prisons and reduce spread within the prisons.\nOn Friday, 17 homeless people who were in temporary accommodation were self-isolating, within the properties. These people have been provided with food packages and some have required additional care and support. Whilst these arrangements were made on an ad hoc basis initially, we have developed this team to take a more coordinated approach to the following elements:\n- Identification of needs for self-isolation and additional temporary accommodation\n- Collation of the offers of assistance from both the private sector and the social housing offers\n- Matching need to offers that are viable, and\n- Identifying and sourcing support packages in the form of both supplies and care support. This will need to include support for those with drug or alcohol addiction problems.\nTo ensure we are able to access the accommodation we need, manage costs and demand there needs to be a clear line of responsibility. Through the temporary accommodation service manager and our housing team, who have offered a project manager, we have the ability to do this in a coordinated way across the team.\nThis approach gives clear and specific roles to colleagues and partners, to ensure that we are as efficient as possible and that the right people, with expertise in their field can provide input in a joined-up way.\nThe following people have been identified:\n- Lead Officer\n- Sourcing and provision of accommodation to meet existing and future demand – An Officer and a project manager, will be required to co-ordinate offers, negotiate prices, ensure that supply meets demand at the correct time and manage the operational process around the allocation of properties.\n- Alcohol and Drugs support – An Officer, will identify the people who require additional support in relation to drug and/or alcohol addiction including assessment of need and the package of care required.\n- Care packages (including food) – An Officer, will identify and arrange the care packages including food, required for those taking up accommodation and will be the link to the Health and Social Care Partnership,\n- Public Heath Advice – An Officer, will provide advice and guidance around the appropriate public health approach that is required for people accessing accommodation and for all homeless people currently in or accessing temporary accommodation.\n- Procurement – Maggie Deane, will provide professional guidance and support around the purchase of accommodation to meet the Council’s needs including but not limited to waiver requirements, contract standing orders and authority levels.\n- Legal Services – An Officer, will provide professional guidance and support around all legal aspects related to this project, including ensuring occupancy agreements meet our legal requirements.\nThese specific roles will allow this group to focus on their area of expertise and minimise the risk of duplication and/or inconsistent messaging.\nFurther to this, it limits the numbers of people involved in decision making, whilst allowing the leads to seek views from their area of work before reporting back to AANT.\nGiven the likely acceleration in Covid -19 cases and therefore the requirement for accommodation, care and support to be to be provided quickly and at significant levels, it is proposed that the team will meet on Tuesday 24 March 2020 via Skype to agree a meeting schedule, likely to be at least twice a week to ensure all information is as up to date as possible.",

This is particularly true of the plan to charge Edinburgh residents for the collection of garden waste.\nI argued strongly against this policy, but ultimately lost the argument. However, I feel that if people knew then about the policy what we know now then the implementation of this regressive charge could have been stopped.\nA key argument against the “garden tax” is the uncertainty around what will happen to garden waste from those that choose not to pay the charge. We now know that 67,000 households are predicted to choose to opt out. Although the Council does not expect any problems to arise from this, I don’t know anyone that doubts that there will be more fly-tipping, a return of garden bonfires and the misuse of the other waste streams. Before anyone shrugs their shoulders at this, I know from work I have undertaken in Belfast that fly-tipped garden waste makes a significant contribution to culvert blockages, and so increases flood risk.\nWe also know that those that don’t pay the charge will have to return their brown bins to the Council. The cost of this, where the 67,000 bins will be stored and what will happen to them is not clear.\nA further issue is affordability to low income households. Due to arguments I and others made, the Council has agreed to exempt those who qualify for the Council Tax Reduction Scheme. However, individuals will have to apply for this exemption cap in hand rather than it being automatically allocated. Indeed, this is expected to take the cost of administering the scheme to over £100,000.\nI am therefore in no doubt that the implementation of this charge will come with significant problems and that many will find introducing this charge along with a rise in Council Tax is unacceptable.\nHowever, we have to remember that the charge was proposed because the Scottish Government cut our Capital’s budget. That is perhaps the bigger problem. Yes, the Council can always be more efficient but the underlying issue is a Government that has other priorities.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_06_09_west-edinburgh-bus-priority-briefing_comment-page-1/content_275.html": "Below is a briefing from Council Officers which sets out the rational for removing the temporary bus lane on the A8.\nIntroduction\nThis briefing note provides context and background information on the temporary westbound bus lane installed on the A8 as part of the interventions for recovery during the pandemic.\nThere are three key projects in West Edinburgh that are relevant to A8. These are;\n- West Edinburgh Transport Improvement Programme (WETIP); This is a £36m Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal (ESESCRD) project focused on the delivering an ambitious package of sustainable transport measures along the A8 corridor. These include active travel and public transport measures.\n- Bus Partnership Fund (BPF); This is an ESESCRD project to deliver an ambitious package of Bus Priority measures along key routes across the South-East Scotland region, including the A8. The BPF is split into the following two elements: 1) implementation of Quick Wins measures 2) Development of business cases for longer term Bus Priority interventions.\n- Bus Priority Rapid Deployment Fund (BPRDF); This is a Scottish Government fund in response to the pandemic, where local authorities were asked to identify areas where temporary bus priority measures could be implemented swiftly to improve bus journey times and make services more reliable to provide much needed support to operators during the pandemic.\nBackground\nThe Council with partners (including West Lothian Council & Transport Scotland), have been developing a series of bus priority improvements along the A8/A89 corridor since 2008, where several strategic transport studies have been undertaken, these include: WETA 2010, A8/A89 Public Transport Corridor Improvements Study and WETA Refresh in 2016 (which was developed in collaboration with the Airport and Transport Scotland).\nThe signing of the City Region Deal in 2018 was a major milestone and consequently provided £36m to the West Edinburgh Transport Improvement Programme – WETIP. This project focuses on the delivery of an ambitious package of sustainable transport measures (active travel and public transport) along the A8/A89 corridor between Maybury and Broxburn.\nWETIP is currently in the Outline Business Case Stage (OBC), with the aim to complete by Q1 of 2023. This will confirm the package of the permanent bus lanes along the A8 corridor.\nFollowing production of the WETIP OBC, the Final Business Case, Permissions & Consents and Procurement activities will be delivered, with construction starting Q1 2025. Post construction activities include: Commissioning, Monitoring, Evaluation and Benefits Realisation. Also being considered are opportunities to accelerate the delivery of certain measures (eg any BPF Quick Wins that can be delivered before 2025, such as the bus lane on the A89).\nThe WETIP project team have worked closely with neighbouring projects and plans, including: live planning applications, the Maybury junction improvement scheme, integration with the ongoing the West Edinburgh Masterplanning exercises and the development of the draft Edinburgh City Plan 2030; all this work has ensured that WETIP plays it part in enhancing connectivity, reducing severance and linking West Edinburgh into the fabric of the wider city.\nThrough the BPRDF, local authorities were asked to identify areas where temporary bus priority measures could be implemented to improve bus journey times and make services more reliable during various tiers of pandemic restriction.\nA key aim of the fund was to swiftly target parts of the road network and implement bus priority measures to provide much needed support to operators.\nThe Council, by drawing on previous transport studies and working collaboratively with stakeholders, including bus operators, identified several locations on key routes across the city, including the A8, where interventions would be appropriate and beneficial to bus operations.\nAs a result of these measures, bus operators have reported journey time savings. Passengers spend less time in the confined space onboard buses and, therefore, reduce their length of potential Covid-19 exposure with other passengers. The journey time and associated reliability improvements have also made public transport an attractive alternative to private car and aided patronage recovery.\nThe diagram below highlights the locations of bus lanes installed through the BPRDF.\nThe BPRDF has provided an opportunity to test bus priority measures, collect live data and deliver early benefits to bus operators (during the pandemic). This exercise also informed the successful bid into the Bus Partnership Fund, resulting in a further c£3m of funds being awarded to the City Region Deal.\nOf the £3m funding awarded from the BPF, £1.4m is currently being used to explore whether any of the BPRDF measures installed for pandemic purposes could be permanently retained; where they are appropriate and can continue to provide benefits to public transport in the evolving environment of permanent travel patterns and behaviour changes.\nThe figure above highlights that there are 12 locations where bus lanes have been implemented through the BPRDF. Of these, nine are being further evaluated through the BPF Quick Wins programme to explore their possible retention.\nThe three other locations that are not being taken forward for retention in their current form through the BPF and are instead being absorbed into more relevant programmes (eg the A8 westbound bus lane from Eastfield Road to Newbridge will be deliver through the larger WETIP which targets more ambitious benefits for Public Transport). Note; data collected from the BPRDF measures has helped advance thinking on WETIP and other programmes on how the permanent measures will operate.\nThe WETIP westbound bus priority proposals will be a much more significant construction project compared to the temporary bus lane implemented with BPRDF funding. It includes the delivery of a permanent bus lane, with potential to use carriageway verge if required by network considerations.\nAs highlighted in the figure, nine other BPRDF locations (which include; the eastbound, sections of bus lanes on the A89 approach to Newbridge & A8 Gogar Underpass) which continued to be monitored and are performing well and still benefit bus, are being further reviewed to explore their possible retention through the BPF.\nThe Council has been monitoring the performance of the BPRDF bus measures and impacts on the traffic network and has worked closely with key stakeholders, including the Airport, and will continue to do so.\nRecently we have witnessed a return to more traditional peak period commuting travel patterns. This has resulted in much increased congestion heading westbound along the A8, particularly during the evening peak travel period. The effect of this congestion creates wider spread network traffic issues and also hinders bus journeys along the A8, i.e. the queuing traffic prevents the bus from accessing the bus lane.\nWith the Royal Highland Show (RHS) approaching, traffic volumes on the A8 will continue to increase. Therefore, as predicted through the modelling work carried out by transport consultants, this bus lane has reached the point where it has become counter-productive.\nNow that traffic levels are increasingly returning to more traditional patterns, and in advance of the RHS, the process of organising the removal of the bus lane has commenced.\nAs it was always the intention to remove the bus lane, the signage to support the removal of the lane has already been manufactured.\nFor traffic management reasons the works are expected to be carried out this Sunday (12 June).\nNext Steps\n- Removal of the bus lane is planned for Sunday 12 June.\n- Continue to work with Bus Operators on the retention of measures where appropriate through the BPF.\n- In parallel, continue to work with all other key stakeholders, such as the airport, on the development of the WETIP measures, which will include the exploration of the accelerated delivery of bus priority interventions where possible.\n- Brief the relevant elected members of the project delivery plans for both WETIP and BPF and provide the latest progress updates.\n- Both WETIP and BPF projects will include the development of a full Communications Plan to ensure that all key stakeholders, businesses, and residents are kept informed. A draft of this will be presented to the relevant elected members.",

He actually mocked everyone who has ever protested outside Holyrood in order to have their voice heard.\nHe said – “I can assure any one of the activists or Labour Councillors who think that standing outside the Scottish Parliament with a sandwich board is better than being in the room meeting the minister, in my experience that is not the case. It is better to be eyeballing the person…”.\nThe argument he makes is that cosy undocumented chat’s with his party’s elite in Holyrood are better than standing in solidarity with those that rely on Council services.\nThe problem is that reality suggests this approach is failing. The Council is currently consulting on cutting it’s spending by £106m and the Council Leader has refused to rule out cuts to schools. Indeed, these cuts come on top of the silent slaughter of Council services in recent years which COSLA say is 10 times greater than Tory austerity.\nThe night before John Smith died he closed his speech saying – “We will do our best to reward your faith in us, but please give us the opportunity to serve our country. That is all we ask.” Every single Labour Councillor takes that duty of public service seriously. If needed, we will stand outside Holyrood opposing these cuts with a “sandwich board” alongside the public and Council staff.\nWe know, however, that if the cuts do come the SNP Council leader will be quick to support them just as he did last year.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_12_22_briefing-free-concessionary-tram-travel-in-edinburgh/content_484.html": "Below is a briefing from Council Officers following reports that free concessionary tram travel may end in Edinburgh. The aim of the proposal appears to have been to transfer responsibility for paying for free travel to Transport for Edinburgh (the parent company of Lothian Buses and Edinburgh Trams) – the paper was told: “It is proposed the council cease funding this. It would then be up to Lothian Buses, Edinburgh Trams / Transport for Edinburgh or potentially the Scottish Government to fund concessionary fares”. This immediately raises questions about Transport for Edinburgh’s willingness to fund free travel, and where the money would be found. The reality is that the Council should be challenging the Scottish Government to cover the costs.\nBriefing\nThank you very much for your comments on concessionary travel tram fares. There has been a lot of recent focus on this, partly as a result of some inaccurate reporting.\nThe council recognises that public transport services are integral to people accessing all areas of the city, inclusivity and accessibility are important principles that overarch council policies. Each year, as part of our detailed budget discussions, the administration receives proposals and ideas from officers, which are then carefully considered before any decision is made as part of preparing a balanced budget.\nCouncil officers regularly bring forward proposals for Elected Member consideration. A recent proposal from officers, which was inappropriately forwarded onto the media, has resulted in media comment that we are actively considering cutting the concessionary trams fares, currently paid for by the Council. This financial responsibility for tram concessionary fares is in contrast to the bus concessionary fares which are paid for by the Scottish Government on a national basis. And other local authorities do not offer this on other forms of public transport e.g. there are no concessionary fares paid by Glasgow City Council for the comparable Glasgow underground or the suburban rail network around Glasgow.\nIf this proposal from council officers was implemented it would simply represent a change in which organisation would pay for the scheme overall, not a withdrawal of the concessionary fares for Edinburgh residents (who are the only beneficiaries).\nDuring the budget preparation period, there are lots of officer recommendations put forward but I can assure you that nothing has been decided on yet. Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation around in this period and it can lead to upset and concern among residents who may be affected.\nI hope I have reassured you that, in contrast with some conversation around this topic, there are no plans to prevent people from travelling on the trams under this scheme.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_08_12_edinburghs-tourism-strategy-is-a-chance-for-it-to-show-its-serious-about-the-climate-emergency_comment-page-1/content_558.html": "The Council currently has a consultant working on its “Tourism Strategy”. This is important politically as there is a growing feeling that this is an area where commercial interests have too much say, and the city is currently struggling to cope with the number of visitors. There is also a growing awareness that while much money is being made, too many people working in the sector are faced with poor pay and conditions in what are euphemistically called “entry level” jobs by the Council.\nIndeed, the Council has named the strategy “Edinburgh 2020, The Edinburgh Tourism Strategy” and boasts it’s being developed by an “industry-led group facilitated by Scottish Enterprise” called ETAG (with no community representation). This group wants to grow the current tourist economy from 4.1 million visitors per year by one third to 5.5 million by 2030.\nStage 1 of this £60,000 industry led strategy development identified six “issues”: Accommodation supply; Value per visitor, and productivity; Visitor experience and pedestrian experience; Visitor-resident relationship; Tourism leadership, governance and delivery; and, Tourism demand.\nSomewhat bizarrely, sustainability and climate change is not an “issue”, nor are the considered on any reports presented to Councillors on the development of the strategy. For the record, the reports went to the following committees: Culture and Communities Committee and Housing and Economy Committee. In addition, a draft Policy Statement on Tourism was recently considered by the Corporate Policy and Strategy Committee.\nI find this really concerning as tourism in general is a sector closely connected to the environment and climate, and is considered to be a vulnerable and highly climate-sensitive economic sector. The impacts can be both direct and indirect, with some scenarios showing climate shocks elsewhere may drive people to the UK and other temperate climates.\nWe also know tourism is a key contributor to Greenhouse Gas emissions. A recent study suggested that up to 8% of all emissions may be due to tourism. To be clear, this is not just about flights but how hotels are managed and food is consumed.\nIf we are serious about the Climate Emergency we are facing, we can’t consider growing the tourism sector in Edinburgh without a clear, unequivocal and genuine commitment to review its carbon footprint. There is a real opportunity here for Edinburgh to show how to grow the tourist economy without also growing the environmental impact. Let’s do it.",

We can’t pretend Labour will be back in power in Scotland soon. It’s also clear to me that Labour’s recovery shouldn’t be about right versus left, or rich versus poor. It must be about convincing everyone that social justice is in their interest. I am standing for Edinburgh’s Colinton-Fairmilehead Ward next year, so I know how important it is to win back votes from both the SNP and the Tories.\nWe also have to step back and think about how voters view the party. With that in mind, the following points are key:\n- We have to move beyond constitutional arguments by setting out our own position clearly and as one. As a party, we can’t back independence due to the damage it would do to public services. However, we need a clear and positive answer to it. It’s our job to set out the case for a form of devolution (inc empowering councils) that works for Scotland. For me, the starting point for that debate is Kezia’s speech on the need for a “New Act of Union” and a move towards federalism.\n- We need to be clear about what we stand for. At every labour meeting I have attended our common cause has been clear, however, too often we struggle to communicate this to voters in a way that resonates. The 2016 manifesto was a huge step in the right direction which I hope we are able to build on.\n- We need to stop changing our leaders. We have now had 7 leaders in Scotland since Donald Dewar died in 2000. Worse than that, we’ve had two UK leadership elections in two years. Bonkers!\n- We must accept that we won’t be back at the top of opinion polls anytime soon. There is no magic answer or “silver bullet”. Nonetheless, the moment voters see that we are credible those that left us may give us a second look!\nAbove all, however, we need to be bold, confident, progressive and positive in everything we do. We must be proud about what we stand for as those values are Scotland’s values: by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone, so as to create for each of us the means to realise our true potential and for all of us a community in which power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many not the few.",

Below is the statement issued to Community Councils.\nNotification of further engagement on Braid Road/Comiston Road Spaces for People Measures\nAs you will be aware we recently completed a consultation exercise on the potential retention of Spaces for People measures. This was followed by the publication of the report on keeping these measures, which was considered at the meeting of the city’s Transport and Environment Committee on 17 June. The decision to retain or remove measures was based on consultation results, independent market research, a review by technical officers and consideration of how well such changes fit with the Council’s long-term transport policy objectives.\nAt this meeting it was agreed that a final decision on moving forward with the schemes should be made at the 24 June meeting of the City of Edinburgh Council\nCouncil motion\nThe Council voted to approve the report, with requests from Councillors to consider further options for:\n- Reopening Braid Road in both directions\n- Improving transport connectivity on Comiston Road and reduce impacts on local residents\nYou can read the full motion here.\nInvitation to meeting on Wednesday 25 August\nCouncil officers are now developing options to address concerns that have been raised regarding these roads.

This will enable the Council to decorate the city on a similar scale to previous years (winter 2015/16) and install more lighting than was possible last year (winter 2016/17).\nA total of 15 cut Christmas trees are provided by the Council at a cost of £45,000 per annum. It is proposed these costs are significantly reduced by dressing pre-existing trees instead and, where suitable, supporting communities to plant new trees to be decorated annually. The Mound Christmas tree, which is a gift to the city from Norway, will be installed as normal and lit on Light Night on 19 November.\nThe attached proposals will be delivered with Locality Managers. The delivery and installation of trees and lighting is provided through an external, procured contract. 2017 is the final year of the current arrangement. Given the on-going wear and tear pressures on the current equipment provision the intention is to move to a lease / hire contract model from 2018 onwards.",

A clear majority of Edinburgh’s 63 Councillors are in exactly the same position. Indeed, many of those that voted for it did so only because it was combined with a package of more positive measures.\nDespite this strength of resistance, Edinburgh’s “opposition” parties have been unable to coalesce around any sort of viable alternative and force the minority SNP led administration to do a u-turn. Indeed, although many Councillors were rightly critical of the ongoing waste collection crisis our Capital is facing, I was the only one that raised any questions about what was planned when details were presented in the City Chambers several months ago.\nPerhaps if more questions had been asked, many of the problems faced could have been avoided – not least the stress the garden waste registration system has caused many older and vulnerable people in Edinburgh.\nIndeed, there have only really been two substantive developments since the Garden Tax was first proposed. Firstly, Labour managed to mitigate the impact of the original SNP proposal by arguing that the poorest households should be exempt. Secondly, the Liberal Democrats managed to have the Council consider the possibility of a refund for those that have suffered collection delays (report, 23/11/18).\nAlthough I am delighted that a refund is at least being considered as it’s a tacit admission that the performance of the service has been unacceptable, I do wonder where that money will come from and how it can be efficiently processed. After all, the chaos in Edinburgh’s waste collection system is a direct result of the cuts the SNP is forcing on our Capital – 10 times the level of Tory austerity since 2013. Given that these cuts are set to continue with the support of the SNP council leader, where will the refund cash be found? I have asked the Liberal Democrats repeatedly, but so far they have refused to answer.\nThey know that services are failing because budgets are being cut to the bone and that refunds won’t solve that fundamental problem.",

These will use libraries for short periods of time, including Colinton Library in my Ward. This is in addition to Oxgangs Library being used for Walk-In Testing.\nIntroduction\nThe Scottish Government invited all local authorities and health boards to submit funding bids to establish and run ‘mobile’ asymptomatic testing centres (ATC) as part of a targeted community testing programme.\nTheir purpose is to drive down Covid19 transmission rates by identifying people in the community who have the virus but have no (or very mild) symptoms and could be spreading it unknowingly.\nThis is a key element of the Government’s strategy for containing the virus as the country gradually opens up from lockdown and Edinburgh’s progress through the levels system is likely to require that sites are up and running.\nCouncil officers submitted a bid and agreement to fund the first six months of operation has now been received. This is likely to be renewed for the second half of the financial year at the same level.\nHow will the sites work?\nAreas of the city with stubbornly high infection rates will be targeted and detailed work is ongoing with NHS Lothian to monitor the trends in the data to plan future deployment.\nWe are looking at a variety of other data including hard-to-reach communities and groups who have been disproportionally impacted by the pandemic.\nIt is intended that two ATCs will operate in the city at one time, with each in place for around three weeks in total (one week set-up, one week open to the local community for walk-in tests and one week to take down).\nThe centres will operate from libraries, which have been chosen as being local and easily accessible venues across the city which communities are familiar with. Staff from Regulatory Services, Libraries and Culture are working jointly to bring together public health, venue management and local expertise so that the ATCs can be as welcoming and efficient as possible. ATCs will not be hosted within the same building as a Symptomatic Testing Centre. These facilities will be provided in separate locations.\nEvery possible step will be taken to minimise the period of time a library is required as an ATC. Arrangements will be made to promote the availability of alternative libraries and services which citizens could use during the period their local library is being used as a testing centre. No ATC will be hosted in a library building during the period when it is in use as a polling place during the Scottish Parliamentary elections.\nThe first ATC will officially open in Craigmillar Library from Wednesday 21 April to Sunday 2 May, with a soft launch on Monday 19 and Tuesday 20 April. The second ATC is scheduled to open to the public for testing at Wester Hailes Library in the next couple of weeks.\nDetails of the libraries currently considered to be suitable as ATCs are shown in the table at the end of this briefing.\nEach site will accommodate up to six testing booths providing up to 480 tests per day (based on an eight-hour opening period), meaning a daily total of up to 960.\nUp to 50 staff may be required and options including bringing back furloughed staff and recruiting fixed term contracts are being explored.\nCommunications will be carefully targeted to reach relevant communities, with messaging focusing on the benefits (to individuals, their families and the wider community) and offering reassurance around safety of testing and its environment. The project team has been in close dialogue with the trade unions in planning the ATCs and will continue to work with them as the community testing programme progresses, to make sure their members are fully informed.\nLibraries identified for potential ATC use: South Queensferry, Kirkliston, Currie, Drumbrae, Blackhall, Stockbridge, Wester Hailes, Colinton, Fountainbridge, Morningside, Central Library, McDonald Road, Gilmerton, Moredun, Piershill & Portobello.",

These dependencies include the cost and availability of:\n- cleaning and janitorial support and\n- the potential increased risks to school provision by opening the school estate more broadly that potentially impact on the controls put in place to reduce the spread of infection within schools.\nThis briefing note updates you on the current position of the three key issues of:\n- working with community centre management committees to facilitate using the centres for community youth work\n- re-opening of a second tranche of libraries and\n- steps being taken to allow extra-curricular activities using school facilities to re-start.\nThese must be managed within Scottish Government and Public Health Scotland guidance and considering other associated guidance issued by bodies such as COSLA.\nCurrent position\n- Community youth work in community centres\n- Libraries re-opening\n- School facilities for extra-curricular activities\nPlanned next steps\n- Community youth work in community centres\n- Libraries re-opening\n- School facilities for extra-curricular activities\nReporting to committee\nCurrent position\nCommunity youth work in community centres\nAt present, the Council is facilitating detached youth work in outdoor spaces and on a one-to-one basis in publicly accessible indoor spaces. This is to allow for critical contact with young people who are most in need.\nOur Lifelong Learning Service team would normally deliver direct a range of youth work programmes in schools and community settings. At times, we deliver this youth work in partnership with community and third-party organisations. However, most of it is provided by the voluntary/third sector. Many of these organisations have access to their own premises and, in line with Scottish Government guidance for the third sector, have re-started providing youth work in those buildings.\nThere are youth work providers that use council community centres to carry out their work. This is mainly coordinated directly with the management committee, although often facilities management (FM) and business support services (BSS) by Council staff.\nPlease note that some targeted individual support for young people from youth work providers can take place in school settings where this work forms part of a GIRFEC child plan.\nAs reported to Policy and Sustainability Committee on 6 August, we have a process in place to enable management committees to make direct arrangements with the Council to access the building for defined purposes, including:\n- early learning and childcare\n- out of school care\n- blood donation services\n- food banks and other humanitarian purposes.\nLibraries re-opening\nAs recommended in the report to the Policy and Sustainability Committee on 6 August, six of the 28 libraries have been reopened. These are:\n- Central Library\n- Fountainbridge\n- Kirkliston\n- McDonald Road\n- Newington\n- Stockbridge.\nWhile the libraries service team would be able to run additional libraries, the key pressure on the Council relates to FM resources which are deployed within the school estate. Maintaining school re-opening has required – and continues to require – an increased level of FM resource across the whole school estate as they must deliver additional cleaning and infection prevention requirements. In addition, we’ve seen an increase (as at 18 October 2020) in the sickness absence rates for FM colleagues, with a number required to self-isolate as a result of covid-19 cases rising in schools, both within the student and colleague/teaching populations.\nIt is therefore essential that additional pressures and stress are not unduly placed on the FM service through further increasing the workload without a corresponding increase in both budget and available staff to undertake this additional work. To help mitigate these pressures, we’ve continued to recruit cleaning staff throughout the pandemic (recruitment has never slowed) and, at present, we’re progressing filling 56 posts.\nSchool facilities for extra-curricular activities\nOver the course of the first term, we applied rigorous risk management processes to make sure schools re-opened safely and any concerns were well-managed. These included infection control, workforce pressures and addressing gaps in learning. We developed strong relationships with health contacts and partner authorities which have shaped the service’s risk management processes. In particular, the contact tracing aspect of managing positive cases among staff and pupils helped schools to refine and tighten arrangements such as timetabling, staggered breaks and lunches and communications to parents and carers. Despite this, cumulatively, there have been 27,532 pupil absences related to covid-19 since the start of term. In addition, in w/e 16 October 20 alone, we have 336 staff absences related to covid-19.\nKnowing that with every increased contact the risk of infection increases, our School Operation Risk Toolkit (SORT) and Framework has operated within Scottish Government and Public Health Scotland guidance and has restricted all but essential activities to a minimum. Until specific guidance is published by Education Scotland for extra-curricular activities, we use the reopening of schools guidance which clearly indicates parameters in which we work. Limiting contacts has ensured that schools have been able to remain open despite infectious cases being present. However, we now have far greater workforce pressures due to covid-19 related absence, not all of which can be addressed through the Scottish Government funding for additional teachers.\nRe-introducing additional school activities therefore requires us to continue the cautious risk management approach. The School Operations Risk Toolkit and Framework is contained as Appendix 1. It details the approaches taken to ensure careful and appropriate risk management is in place. Various guidance documents are produced which articulate to SORT. These include the extra-curricular guidance document also attached. The document provides the step-process by which school and sports leaders can check proposed activities. The ability to resume activities depends on several interrelated factors: ventilation, cleaning, the number of contacts the teacher/tutor/coach has had in the day/week, as well as the obvious benefits of the activity.\nSafely resuming all school activities is everyone’s goal. However, maintaining educational delivery remains paramount and we cannot risk that by rushing to re-open groups, no matter how much they are desired. This is particularly important while the R number continues to rise.\nWe have significant planning well underway for incrementally re-introducing extra-curricular activity across the school. The gradual return to sport and a wide range of other non-sporting activities is aligned to the safe return to school for all staff and pupils and aims to minimise interaction between pupils and adults and to retain school grouping structures where possible.\nSchools can supplement Council extra-curricular activities and SORT guidance with specific governing body or equivalent advice. However, this should not replace or undermine the guidance.\n- essential for literacy, numeracy, health and wellbeing.\n- important for the young person’s learning, development and wellbeing ie on a young person’s plan and can be justified using appropriate mitigations.\n- something that can safely re-start because the R number suggests it is safe to do so following relevant guidance.\nWe are considering further guidelines for extra-curricular activities based on the latest guidance from Scottish Government, industry bodies, national governing bodies, Education Scotland and members of the Education Recovery Group. As with all guidelines at present, we need to look at the overall scientific advice which is current and relevant.\nThe Council’s Sports Academy is a highly valued programme and, by its nature, each sport within it brings together pupils from several schools across the city. For this reason, it’s not currently suitable to restart the Sports Academy, but we’ll review this position along with other aspects of extra-curricular activities on an ongoing basis.\nPlanned next steps\nCommunity youth work in community centres\nWe’re contacting all management committees immediately to ascertain:\n- whether they wish to use their facility for the provision of youth work\n- what assistance they require from the Council in order to do so\n- that the management committee is confident that the youth work can be undertaken in line with Scottish Government guidance.\nWhen we get this information, we will identify how many require assistance from the Council. If there is an increased cost to the Council to meet these requests, then we will need committee approval to authorise an increase in budget. If management committees can undertake re-stat youth work without the need for people or financial assistance from the Council, we will be able progress those quickly.\nLibraries re-opening\nThe full-year cost increase of re-opening the first six libraries in September was approximately £200k per annum. We’re preparing plans to re-open the following libraries in line with the plan that was approved by Policy and Sustainability Committee on 6 August:\n- Drumbrae (north-west Edinburgh)\n- Craigmillar (north-east Edinburgh)\n- Wester Hailes (south-west Edinburgh), with a replacement of Currie Library if Wester Hailes cannot be safely re-opened due to the ongoing construction works at Westside Plaza.\n- Gilmerton (south-east Edinburgh).\nGiven that this next tranche of re-opening will cost a further £200k (approximately), this will require the approval of both Policy and Sustainability committee and Council. Prior to this being brought forward for committee approval (if applicable), we must consider the availability of FM teams to support existing operations, particularly in school settings, and make sure that the re-opening of the additional libraries will not present a risk to the priority of maintaining a fit for purpose cleansing regime in our schools.\nSubject to approval, we’re working to an indicative opening date of 14 December, but this may vary for each library. We will provide greater clarity on opening dates closer to the time.\nSchool facilities for extra-curricular activities\nSubject to not needing additional FM resources – and therefore no additional budget increase – we’re developing plans to allow extra-curricular sporting activities to re-start in line with Scottish Government guidance.\nWe’ve reviewed the current position on extra-curricular activities and have drawn up proposals to re-introduce them incrementally after the October schools break. We’ve created a tool (see extra-curricular activities decision-making tree attached at appendix 2) which allows us to determine whether an activity can take place from 27 October.\nWe recommend that volunteers are not permitted to deliver or support any form of extra-curricular activity to support infection control procedures and our ability to track and trace.\nWe’ll review this position on 12 November. We’ll develop guidance to allow some Council-approved external providers to deliver extra-curricular activities in specific contexts which are explained in the decision-making tree. Schools and lifelong learning colleagues are permitted to deliver extra-curricular activities in approved contexts.\nReporting to committee\nIf there is a need for additional budget and FM resource, we’ll take this to the next available Policy and Sustainability Committee, along with any resource requirements to allow for youth work in community centres to re-start and the next tranche of libraries to re-open.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_06_13_what-sort-of-council-administration-does-edinburgh-want/content_145.html": "The inconclusive nature of the General Election result has reminded me that the public are not quite so tribal as those of us who are members of political parties. People shocked by the proposed Tory/DUP deal are asking if a broader, more inclusive, group could not be formed to progress Brexit. Unlikely bedfellows like Ruth Davidson, Ian Murray and Nicola Sturgeon have all been echoing these calls to some extent.\nOf course, broad and unlikely partnerships in Scotland’s councils are not unusual. That said, Edinburgh still has no administration. Indeed at Fairmilehead Community Council last week the lack of a Council Administration in Edinburgh was a topic of some derision – I heard repeated calls for Councillors to be “locked in a room” or have their “heads banged together” until a deal is reached. Some cynics even suggested that the running of our Capital should be taken out of the hands of Councillors.\nGiven that a month has passed without a deal having been reached, I think it’s worth thinking about what people in Edinburgh would want from such an arrangement.\nPolicy\nOf course, the first problem is agreeing a policy framework. Combining two or more manifestos into something that’s greater than the sum of its parts can’t be easy. For example, is investing in cutting the attainment gap more important that further developing Gaelic Medium Education?\nEven if the result of such negotiations is a bit of a Frankenstein-Manifesto, voters would rightly expect it to comprise fully costed and well defined pledges which are deliverable and not merely a wish list of vague assertions.\nMajority Support\nI think it’s not unreasonable for the public to expect a Council Administration to comprise a majority of Councillors. Otherwise a minority administration would run the risk of being held to ransom vote-by-vote by opposition parties. Edinburgh deserves a “strong and stable” administration. The problem here, of course, is tribalism when it comes to a formal deal:\n- Labour expects anti-austerity demands to be met.\n- The SNP refuse to work with the Tories (nobody mention Holyrood 2007-11)\n- The Tories won’t work with the SNP (nobody mention Holyrood 2007-11)\n- The Lib-Dems won’t work with the SNP, but will do a deal with the Tories (that worked well 2010-15)\n- The Greens won’t work with anyone!\nQuite quickly one can see that a majority deal is not easy when the SNP emerged from the May 4 elections as the biggest party on the council with 19 seats while the Conservatives were close behind on 18, Labour has 12, the Greens eight and Lib Dems six.\nA further layer of complication here is of course committee convenorships (etc.) – these come with status and remuneration (totalling well over £600,000). Although, I’m sure, no Councillor in Edinburgh would let these cloud their judgment, it’s important the public can be sure it has not been a factor when forming an administration.\nEdinburgh’s Economy\nConstitutional wrangling dominates Scotland, but it’s important that it does not compromise the running of our capital city. Nonetheless, it’s clear that thousands of livelihoods in Edinburgh rely on continued access to both the UK and EU single markets – a point reflected in referenda results in 2014 and 2016. It’s therefore key that any Council Administration in Edinburgh recognises this publicly and lobbies to secure the Edinburgh economy.\nFunding\nWe know that Local Authority budgets have been cut year-on-year for some time. This is partly due to austerity, but also due to additional cuts made by the SNP Gov and their unwillingness to raise revenue. The SNP Gov could have used the most progressive revenue raising power they have (income tax) to better fund Edinburgh, but instead they forced the city to use the most regressive revenue raising power (the “hated” Council Tax). At a time when inflation is rising, I don’t think it’s unreasonable for Edinburgh residents to expect the Council Administration to oppose real terms cuts to its budget and make the case for fair funding from the Scottish Government to deliver efficiently run services.\nThis short list of minimum expectations for any deal show how difficult it is for two or more parties to reach an agreement which could underpin any administration. However, it’s very clear that a deal is possible if individuals are willing to compromise to help make Edinburgh a better place to live, work and bring up a family.",

We have had complaints from residents about genuine road safety issues in the area. There is also LOT of bad feeling about the way consultations were used by the previous transport committee.\nWe asked Officers to consult locally on solutions, and the outcome was considered today. There were basically three options which were all workable as far as I am concerned (but come with positives and negatives). The 5 parties on the Committee, however, managed to find 4 positions between them… so some compromise was required to reach a majority.\nThe Committee opted to listen to local residents and replace the existing modal filters (planters or other barrier) with a fully segregated cycle route through the area along Hermitage Drive and Braid Avenue (a common cycling route), with safety improvements for pedestrians and cyclists at junctions.\nWe took on board wider concerns and also agreed:\n- That Braid Avenue and Braid Road (north of Hermitage Drive) are not primary traffic routes, and this should be reflected in their layout and design.\n- Speed reduction measures should be installed on Hermitage Drive, Midmar Drive, the of Braid Road (southern extent) and Braid Ave were there are known speeding issues.\n- Consideration should be given to providing a parking space for Blue Badge holders as close as possible to the Hermitage of Braid entrance.\n- The TEC Convener should write to Police Scotland requesting that Safety Cameras Scotland to enforce the known speeding problem on the southern half of Braid Road and other speeding sites identified by the Council (e.g. Bridge Road, Swanston Road and Woodhall Road).\n- Any necessary updates to local School Travel Plans are made.\nThere was no change to quiet route north of Cluny Gardens other than installing a modal filter on Clinton Road.\nThe full consultation report is here.\nThe full Evening News report is here.",

The safety of the children and staff at Oxgangs and the remainder of the PPP1 School estate is of primary concern to the Board of ESP.\nCeiling Tile Grid System\nOn Wednesday 21 February at around 4.30pm the after-school club at Oxgangs notified AMEY about a problem with the ceiling tile grid system. This was a partial collapse of a small area (around 1.5 square metres) in a recessed area of a classroom. AMEY attended the site at 6pm on the same day and took all necessary steps to deal with the situation. The classroom was handed back at 11am the next morning.\nIt is important to note that such systems are part of the fabric, rather than the structure, of the building. They are non-load bearing and are used to conceal the wiring, pipework and structural elements above. As with other aspects of the building, they are subject to inevitable wear and tear during use of the space.\nAfter dealing with this incident, AMEY inspected the rest of the ceiling tile grid system across the whole of the PPP1 estate (including Oxgangs) and confirmed to both ESP and the Council that there were no significant safety issues.\nIn addition, the Council organised its own independent review of the ceiling tile grid system at Oxgangs. This inspection was undertaken on the weekend of 17/18 March and a report was provided to ESP and AMEY on 5 April. This report included various recommendations, the vast majority of which were cosmetic or minor. AMEY actioned all of these recommendations by 9 April.\nRoof Flashing\nAt around 9am on 15 March it was reported that a section of flashing on the roof at Oxgangs became partially dislodged during a period of high winds. At around 9.30am AMEY and its specialist sub-contractor attended the site and removed the section of flashing (which had been damaged beyond repair). At this time the specialist contractor advised that they had visually inspected the adjacent area and no other issues were evident.\nThe Council also organised an independent review of the roof on Sunday 18 April. This identified some concerns with some inadequate fixings and corroding fixings on the roof. All works were completed within 90 minutes of ESP and AMEY being notified.\nThe roofs across the whole PPP1 estate (including Oxgangs) are inspected annually by AMEY’s specialist roofing contractor. Because of what happened at Oxgangs, ESP instructed AMEY to accelerate the roof inspections across the estate. While full written and photographic reports are awaited, no safety issues requiring immediate attention have been raised with AMEY.\nMoving forward\nESP is currently looking at increasing the monitoring of AMEY’s planned preventative maintenance regime (including, but not limited to, the annual inspections referred to above). This monitoring will be undertaken by an independent party and the council will be invited to comment on the scope of this arrangement in advance. This regime will be over and above the contractual requirements and will be put in place as soon as practicable. The intended purpose is to provide reassurance to the pupils, parents and staff occupying the schools. The cost of any enhanced monitoring will not be passed to the Council.\nESP is open to meeting with the Head Teacher of Oxgangs Primary and, if appropriate, a representative of the Parent Teacher Council to provide more details in due course. ESP also remains open to discussing with the Council further potential improvements to the monitoring of the maintenance of the PPP1 estate.\nIn summary, please be assured that ESP treats the concerns raised very seriously. It remains fully committed to continually improving the way the school estate is managed and maintained, to ensure the safety of both children and staff within it, and to provide reassurance to parents.",

The key message here is that residents should use email and other online methods to report routine problems (missed bin collections etc). This will enable Council staff to focus on those most in need. My contact details are above – just email me any non-urgent issues you want addressed.\nBriefing\nCouncil resources are being reorganised to support citizens in crisis, freeing up officers to provide critical advice and support to those in the most urgent need.\nWe are doing this to ensure we can support our most vulnerable residents, minimise risk to colleagues and their families and maintain essential services and direct them to where they are needed most.\nOur advice line is available for urgent requests, with support for those most at risk and hardest hit by the coronavirus outbreak to be prioritised in all circumstances.\nWe are encouraging members of the public to delay making routine and less urgent requests for as long as possible. Where-ever possible we need people to make those requests via email, webforms or other channels to allow officers to prioritise those in most critical need.\nWe are also making changes to the way we prioritise and operate services in the locality offices.\nFrom Monday 23 March 2020, Council Resilience Centres will be established at the Council’s locality offices at Captains Road (South East), Niddrie Mains Road (North East), West Pilton Gardens (North West), Westside Plaza (South West). An additional centre will open in Leith at the Kirkgate Centre later in the week. Resilience teams will operate between 10.00 and 16.00 hours initially.\nThese centres will provide a base for a team of Council officers to work from so that they can target support and advice, manage urgent housing issues, respond to homelessness and provide support vulnerable households. We are looking at how we can best provide food vouchers through these centres. Further details of this will be released in the coming days.\nAccess to these centres will be carefully managed to limit the risk of infection and to ensure the safety of staff and residents. There will be no direct access to these centres. A controlled access protocol will be in place to assess risk and requirement on a case by case basis.\nThe teams will be supported by a small team of professional officers and customer staff and will be managed by an onsite duty team manager. Two teams will be established for each centre to allow them to rotate. Staff currently working at home will be held in reserve and will be available to further reinforce these teams.\nOur colleagues in these centres will have to deal with extraordinarily difficult situations in the most difficult circumstances. They will become tired and stressed at times. They will also be affected by requirements to self-isolate for 7 and 14 day periods if they or someone in their household develops symptoms.\nI know Councillors will want to support them as much as possible. You can best do that by encouraging residents who have routine and less urgent needs to use the Council advice line and other channels to make service requests. And please wherever possible show your support for colleagues providing essential and critical services. They are showing enormous dedication and determination. Your support is really important to them now and in the weeks and months ahead.\nOur member services team will set out arrangements next week for members who wish to make a service request on behalf of constituents. These arrangements will ensure that these requests are assessed and dealt with by the appropriate service. This will allow the Centres and other front-line response services to focus on the most critical needs of residents.\nWe will be reviewing the operation of the centres on a daily basis. It will have adapt as we learn and as the issues and circumstances our communities face change.",

This is important politically as there is a growing feeling that this is an area where commercial interests have too much say, and the city is currently struggling to cope with the number of visitors. There is also a growing awareness that while much money is being made, too many people working in the sector are faced with poor pay and conditions in what are euphemistically called “entry level” jobs by the Council.\nIndeed, the Council has named the strategy “Edinburgh 2020, The Edinburgh Tourism Strategy” and boasts it’s being developed by an “industry-led group facilitated by Scottish Enterprise” called ETAG (with no community representation). This group wants to grow the current tourist economy from 4.1 million visitors per year by one third to 5.5 million by 2030.\nStage 1 of this £60,000 industry led strategy development identified six “issues”: Accommodation supply; Value per visitor, and productivity; Visitor experience and pedestrian experience; Visitor-resident relationship; Tourism leadership, governance and delivery; and, Tourism demand.\nSomewhat bizarrely, sustainability and climate change is not an “issue”, nor are the considered on any reports presented to Councillors on the development of the strategy. For the record, the reports went to the following committees: Culture and Communities Committee and Housing and Economy Committee. In addition, a draft Policy Statement on Tourism was recently considered by the Corporate Policy and Strategy Committee.\nI find this really concerning as tourism in general is a sector closely connected to the environment and climate, and is considered to be a vulnerable and highly climate-sensitive economic sector. The impacts can be both direct and indirect, with some scenarios showing climate shocks elsewhere may drive people to the UK and other temperate climates.\nWe also know tourism is a key contributor to Greenhouse Gas emissions. A recent study suggested that up to 8% of all emissions may be due to tourism. To be clear, this is not just about flights but how hotels are managed and food is consumed.\nIf we are serious about the Climate Emergency we are facing, we can’t consider growing the tourism sector in Edinburgh without a clear, unequivocal and genuine commitment to review its carbon footprint. There is a real opportunity here for Edinburgh to show how to grow the tourist economy without also growing the environmental impact. Let’s do it.",

I expect that virtually all of us who stick to the 20mph limit whilst driving would have experienced aggressive behaviour from other drivers who think the limit simply does not apply to them.\nLikewise, people cycling on the footpath is not a common occurrence in most places. However, cars and vans parked on the pavement have become normalised in recent years. As well as damaging the footpath, this activity often forces people in wheelchairs or pushing buggies on to the road to bypass the parked vehicle.\nSo let’s not turn improving road safety into a battle between cyclists and motorists, as too often it is really a fight between selfish people and the rest of us. If you own a car or bike, be responsible and keep its wheels on the road and stick to the speed limit.\nNo comments on The false battle between cyclists and motorists in Edinburgh",

I am trying to keep an open mind, but I have concerns that the proposals may constitute overdevelopment and the design is not in keeping with the area. However, I am keen to listen to local people on this. I have met some local residents and many have contacted me directly – all share my concerns.\nI’ve also been discussing the issue with Ian Murray MP, and he highlighted to me that if approved the care home may make it easier for Winton East (the field to the south) to be developed – a site I have pledged to protect. Ian Murray MP has also written to all Winton residents to ensure they are aware of the proposals (a copy of the letter is linked below).\nAt the consultation event event the community were told that in CityPlan 2030 the Council has not allocated any land to care homes and this make sites like 5 Winton Drive the best way to provide private care beds. This is what the planners say when I asked about where care homes could be built in Edinburgh:\nOne of the key aims of City Plan 2030 is to deliver mixed use sustainable communities which cater for a range of residents. City Plan promotes a mix of uses on sites, with allocated sites being for ‘housing-led’ development rather than solely for housing.\nResidential accommodation for older people often falls either into the same category as regular housing. For example, retirement style flats can be the same use category as mainstream housing and therefore part of the housing land supply. Alternatively, some will fall under use Class 8 which is for residential institutions. However, both of these uses can be provided within sites proposed for allocation within City Plan due to the mixed-use nature of the sites.\nCityPlan 2030 proposes the allocation of over 100 sites for housing-led development – enough for 55,000 homes. Based on this, Northcare should not be short of sites where the Council would be happy to consider this sort of development.\nOther points from the exhibition:\n- The event appeared very well attended by local people, and the architects, Northecare and their lobbyist where there to answer questions.\n- The site is not currently owned by Northecare , but is held by an (undisclosed) individual.\n- Northecare said they had undertaken research which demonstrated local demand for a care home.\n- Although the address proposed for redevelopment is on Winton Drive, it appears access is planned to be via Winton Loan.\n- Once opened, the largest vehicle accessing the site will be ambulance sized.\n- Waste will be left for collection on Winton Loan (“within 10m of the kerb”).\n- The scale of the proposed building is not trivial, but the architects said it will be no higher than the surrounding area. (it’s way bigger than many surrounding buildings though)\n- It was suggested that care homes received limited visitors at any one time, and they expect 25% of staff to drive.\nThe local community have established a Facebook group to help people keep up with news on the development.",

Below is a briefing on their plan to install a 5G “radio base station” (mast) adjacent to the Chip Inn in Colinton Mains. Please get in touch if you have any concerns.\nBriefing\nThis agreement allows both organisations to pool their basic network infrastructure, while running two, independent, nationwide networks. It maximises opportunities to consolidate the number of base stations and where possible can significantly reduce the environmental impact of network development.\n5G rollout has begun and so Vodafone and Telefónica are in the process of upgrading their existing radio base stations in their single grid network wherever possible. As part of this continued network improvement program, there is a specific technical requirement to provide new 5G coverage in the entitled part of Edinburgh.\nAn existing Telefónica and Vodafone streetworks style base station has been identified in the area, however it cannot accommodate for both operators latest requirements. In order to fit into the operator’s single grid network, a new streetworks style base station is required for Vodafone’s service in close proximity of the existing streetworks style base station that will be retained and in due course upgraded for Telefónica’s service.\nThe purpose of this letter/email is to consult with you and seek your views on Cornerstone’s proposal before any planning submission is made. For your interest please find attached the Local Government Association’s guidance – A councillor’s guide to digital connectivity which discusses mobile infrastructure and 5G. Taking on board such matters, please find attached the draft plans of the proposal, in which we would appreciate any comments you may have at this stage.\nWe understand that you are not always able to provide site specific comments, however, Cornerstone and Vodafone are committed to consultation with communities on our mobile telecommunications proposals and as such would encourage you to respond.\nAlternative site options considered and rejected are as detailed in the table below. Should you have any suggestions as to any other possible sites that you think would be worth looking into, then please reply and send as much detail as known.\n1 Existing Streetworks – 44503o2 – 230, Oxgangs Road North, Colinton Mains, Edinburgh, EH13 9DY\nAlthough currently a shared structure providing 2G, 3G and 4G coverage for both operators, there is no comparable streetworks style solution that can accommodate 5G antennas for both Vodafone and Telefonica. It would require significant redevelopment and a completely new mast of substantial width and height, as well as taking up the majority of land at its base on Oxgangs Road North. Therefore it is considered that redevelopment would be inappropriate within the streetscene, compromise pedestrian movements and impact on highway safety.\n2 Co-Location – Co-Lo 44503o2 – 230, Oxgangs Road North, Colinton Mains, Edinburgh, EH13 9DY\nTo avoid network interference there needs to be vertical and horizontal separation between masts. In this instance 16 metres of horizontal separation is required between the existing streetworks style mast that will continue to be operated by Telefonica and the proposed Vodafone mast. Therefore co-location within this 16 metre radius is not technically viable and so is discounted.\n3 Rooftop – 237 Oxgangs Road North, Colinton Mains, Edinburgh, EH13 9JA\nThis building was considered, however was determined to be too low to host a sensitively designed base station. When taking into account the roof shape, overall building height, as well as its surrounding context, a rooftop proposal of significant height would be required to meet the operator’s technical requirements. It is considered that such a proposal would be overly prominent and out of keeping with the host building.\n4 Rooftop – 223 Oxgangs Road North, Colinton Mains Parish Church, EH13 9HB\nThe property is a Grade B listed building in which given its status the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997 emphasises that special regard should be had to the desirability of preserving listed buildings, their settings or any features of special architectural or historic interest. It is considered that a proposal on this listed building could compromise this heritage asset and so this option has not been pursued further.\n5 Streetworks – Oxgangs Road North, Colinton Mains, Oxgangs, Edinburgh, EH13 9DY\nA street works style base station could not be deployed in this location as the mast and equipment cabinets would restrict the entrance to the nearby shops.\n6 Streetworks – Pavement near, 227 Oxgangs Road North, Colinton Mains, Oxgangs, Edinburgh, EH13 9BW\nA street works style base station could not be deployed in this location as it would impact upon the visibility splays of those vehicles emerging from the nearby junction.\n7 Streetworks – Oxgangs Road North, Edinburgh, EH13 9NE\nThere is insufficient space available on this stretch of pavement as the siting and dimensions of a street works style base station would restrict pedestrian movements on Oxgangs Road to unacceptably low levels.\n8 Greenfield – Oxgangs Common, Oxgangs Road North, Edinburgh, EH13 9NE\nThis location is too far removed from the search area to provide the required level of coverage and capacity in which it would impact upon the neighbouring base station sites in the wider network. Therefore, this site has to be discounted as it does not meet the operator’s technical requirements.\n9 Streetworks – Oxgangs Road North, Colinton Mains, Edinburgh, EH13 9DY\nThere is insufficient space available on this stretch of pavement as the siting and dimensions of a street works style base station would restrict pedestrian movements to unacceptably low levels.\n10 Greenfield – Colinton Mains Bowling Club and surrounding field, Oxgangs Road North, Edinburgh, EH13 9DY\nThis site is found on the edge of the search area and given its geographical position would not provide meaningful coverage and capacity to the target area. Therefore, this site has to be discounted as it does not meet operator’s technical requirements. The proximity to the local school was also taken in to consideration.\n11 Streetworks – Oxgangs Place/Gardens/Drive/Grove/Avenue/Drive, Edinburgh, EH13 9BE\nThere are houses fronting both sides of this road on Oxgangs Place / Gardens / Drive / Grove / Avenue / Drive, the pavements are narrow and there are regular driveways and pathways for some of the properties. Given the purely residential setting, we consider there are no opportunities to site a street works style proposal on this road as any proposal would compromise pedestrian movements, access arrangements to properties and would also likely impact on highway safety. In addition, the scale of this proposed installation would be out of keeping with the scale of this street.\n12 Streetworks – Oxgangs Terrace/Collinton Mains Terrance/Grove/Road, Edinburgh, EH13 9BY\nThere are houses fronting both sides of this road on Oxgangs Terrace/Collinton Mains Terrance/Grove/Road, the pavements are narrow and there are regular driveways and pathways for some of the properties. Given the purely residential setting, we consider there are no opportunities to site a street works style proposal on this road as any proposal would compromise pedestrian movements, access arrangements to properties and would also likely impact on highway safety. In addition, the scale of this proposed installation would be out of keeping with the scale of this street.\n13 Streetworks – Colinton Mains Drive, Colinton Mains, Edinburgh, EH13 9BJ\nThere are houses fronting both sides of this road Colinton Mains Drive, the pavements are narrow and there are regular driveways and pathways for some of the properties. Given the purely residential setting, we consider there are no opportunities to site a street works style proposal on this road as any proposal would compromise pedestrian movements, access arrangements to properties and would also likely impact on highway safety. In addition, the scale of this proposed installation would be out of keeping with the scale of this street.\n14 Greenfield – Oxgangs Police Station, Oxgangs Road North, Colinton Mains, Edinburgh, EH13 9BW\nGiven the height and maturity of the trees found next to this site, this natural clutter would prevent the effective propagation of radio signals towards the target area and so this location had to be discounted.\nThe Local Planning Authority mast register and our records of other potential sites have already been reviewed, the policies in the Development Plan have been taken into account and the planning history has been examined.\nAll Cornerstone installations are designed to be fully compliant with the public exposure guidelines established by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). These guidelines have the support of UK Government, the European Union and they also have the formal backing of the World Health Organisation. A certificate of ICNIRP compliance will be included within the planning submission.\nAs well as consulting with yourselves as the ward councillors, we are also seeking the views of the Local Planning Authority and the local MSP, Gordon MacDonald. We would be grateful if you could please advise of any local stakeholders or groups that you feel might like to make comments over and above those that you we have already identified.\nOur usual consultation period for this type of development is 14 days, however we appreciate that at this time of year this may be difficult so, under these circumstances, we would still be happy to receive your comments out with that timeframe.\nWe look forward to receiving your comments on the preferred option identified and any alternatives options that you feel would be worth investigating.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_06_06_scottish-labours-sec-notes-6th-of-june-2020/content_351.html": "Chair’s Welcome\nWelcome to Jackie Bailey MSP, Jenny Marra MSP, Ian Murray MP & Baroness Meta Ramsay in their new SEC roles.\nGeneral Election 2019 Review\nDavid Conway & Linda Stewart presented their review which primarily focused on the experience of candidates (inc sitting MPs). A survey was also issued to CLPs, Trade Unions, affiliates and staff.\n- What went well (in order) – Locals activist support, optimism (manifesto), events, hustings, social media, fundraising, TU support & national organisation.\n- Problems (in order) – Voter targeting, lack of preparation nationally, infighting, unrealistic manifesto, poor manifesto communication (lacked clear message), Scottish narrative squeezed, poor internal communication & candidate selection.\n- Popular Themes (in order) – Austerity, WASPI, New Green Deal, nationalisation, local issues/candidate & NHS.\n- Problems in the doorstep (in order) – Jeremy Corbyn, Brexit, Independence (position not clear), manifesto (too many policies and now clear message) & broadband policy.\n- What needs to change (strategic) – We need a clear message, better research, better targeting and less infighting.\n- What needs to change (operational) – Better support for candidates, clearer strategy in Scotland, better training, select candidates earlier, organisers need better local knowledge (party needs to listen to local members more) and take clearer ownership of disciplinary issues in Scotland.\nIt was agreed that these finding should be considered alongside the Open Labour review which should be published next week. Jackie Bailey will discuss the review with the newly form election team and will report back to the SEC.\nAway day agenda item: Constitution\nThe focus of this was Richard Leonard’s paper on the constitution, and Ian Murray MPs suggested amendment. The key addition being:\n“Scottish Labour, does not support independence. We believe that the 2021 elections must be about electing a Government and a parliament that will dedicate its entire focus to rebuilding Scotland’s economy, public services and communities after the devastating impact of Covid-19. That work must be the focus of the next Scottish Government and so we will be going into that election in 2021 with a Scottish Labour party position that is not for a second referendum.”\nIan Murray MP\nRichard was clear that Labour’s position can’t be about defending the status quo, but must be about continuing democratic reform (devolution of power from Westminster & Holyrood to communities). The policy should be set by the party in Scotland. Richard made the point that the lasting impact Covid-19 will have on the economy (esp youth unemployment) and mental health in Scotland, will mean that the constitution must come second (at least) in Scotland’s political discourse. Labour must have a clear message on the constitution, but rebuilding lives and the economy in the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis must be paramount.\nThis was followed by a discussion about Richard’s paper, and Ian’s amendment (which Richard was happy to accept). There was a move to delay a decision, but the SEC agreed to back the paper with Ian Murray’s amendments.\nSelections – Scottish Parliament Constituency Selections\nIn total, 21 seats from the early selection tranche have candidates. The following are still outstanding:\n- On pause we have – Dundee City East; Eastwood (AWS); Glasgow Pollok (AWS); Kirkcaldy (AWS); Motherwell & Wishaw (AWS); Renfrewshire North & West (AWS); and, Uddingston & Bellshill.\n- Yet to begin – Almond Valley; Carrick, Cumnock & Doon Valley (AWS); Cowdenbeath; Dunfermline (AWS); Glasgow Anniesland (AWS) Glasgow Kelvin (AWS); and, Midlothian North & Musselburgh.\nWe also have 35 seats not in the early-selection tranche that need candidates: Aberdeen Donside; Aberdeen South & North Kincardine; Aberdeenshire East; Aberdeenshire West; Angus North & Mearns; Angus South; Argyll & Bute; Ayr; Banffshire & Buchan Coast; Caithness, Sutherland & Ross; Clackmannanshire & Dunblane; Falkirk West; Galloway & West Dumfries; Inverness & Nairn; Kilmarnock & Irvine Valley; Linlithgow\nMid Fife & Glenrothes; Midlothian South, Tweeddale & Lauderdale\nMoray; Na h-Eileanan an Iar; North East Fife; and, Orkney Islands. CLPs have yet to be consulted on AWS status of these seats.\nInability to hold face-to-face meetings is a real challenge to completing the selection process. The party is setting up software to run selections online. It was therefore recommended that Scottish parliamentary selections re-start from July 2020 starting with the paused first tranche seats.\nSelections – Holyrood Regional List Selections\nThese should get underway in August. Jackie Bailey will consider how BAME, LGBT+, disabled and female candidates can be better supported in the selection process. In the longer-term, it was agreed that The Gordon Aikman Leadership Programme (or similar) should be restarted to develop candidates from the widest possible diversity of backgrounds.\nSelections – By-election Selections\nA number of by-elections are in the pipeline:\n- Livingston South (West Lothian) – 1st Oct 2020\n- Ellon and District (Aberdeenshire) – 1st Oct 2020\n- Leaderdale and Melrose (Scottish Borders) – 29th Oct 2020\n- Kincorth/Nigg/Cove (Aberdeen City Council) – 5th Nov 2020\n- Aird and Loch Ness (Highland Council) – 5th Nov 2020\n- Craigentinny and Duddingston (Edinburgh City) – 12th Nov 2020\n- Thorniewood (North Lanarkshire) – 19th Nov 2020\n- Fortissat (North Lanarkshire) – 19th Nov 2020\n- Perth City North (Perth and Kinross) – 26th Nov 2020\n- Perth City South (Perth and Kinross) – 26th Nov 2020\n- Clackmannanshire East (Clackmannanshire) – TBC\n- North Isles (Orkney Islands) – TBC\nTo select candidates the party will use the same software platform that is being used for Holyrood Regional List Selections.\nSelections – SEC Elections\nDue to the Covid-19 crisis and the 2021 Holyrood election, it was agreed to defer elections to the Scottish Executive Committee for all sections until after the Scottish Parliament elections next year. This means the new SEC would be endorsed by Scottish Conference in Spring 2022 and a SEC Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, and Treasurer would be elected at its first meeting in May 2022.\nScottish Conference\nScottish Labour Conference was due to take place 23–25 October. As a result of the COVID-19 crisis a provisional hold had been extended on venue and accommodation without going to contract. Nonetheless, it was agreed to postpone the traditional “in person” meeting. The party will arrange an online alternative to provide a platform for members, affiliates and elected reps to engage with some of the policy and political discussions which conference provides.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_03_14_briefing-electric-vehicle-charging-in-edinburgh/content_455.html": "Below is a briefing on City of Edinburgh Council’s provision of charging for electric vehicles. The expansion in 2020 will focus on tenemental areas where there is little scope for people to install their own charging point. I have raised concerns about this and the need for charging hubs for heavy users such as taxis.\nI have had two people contact me recently who had bought an elecric vehicle without really thinking about where they would charge it. Please consider this if you are thinking of buying one.\nBriefing\nI can advise that currently, the Council have 43 chargers available to the public, within Council operated facilities, and are about to install another 35 across the city which should be delivered by late spring 2020. The current chargers are based as follows: West Pilton Gardens (2), Captains Road (5), Drumbrae Library (2), Straiton park and Ride (5), Kirkliston library (1), Craigentinny Community Centre (2), Bankhead Depot (4) Russell Road (2), Ingliston Park & Ride (7). Hermiston Park and Ride (3), Westerhailes Healthy Living Centre (2) Murrayburn Cab Depot (3), South Queensferry (5).\nThe additional 35 chargers will be located at Clocktower, Craigmillar, Saughton Park and Kingshaugh. Again, it should be noted that all these chargers will be located within Council operated facilities and will be installed separately to the on-street implementation plan.\nI can also advise that Charge Place Scotland (CPS) is the current contractor appointed by Transport Scotland to provide a back office function for EVs nationally. This includes monitoring usage of chargers, dealing with faults, promoting free and/or available charging spaces and providing information monthly via CPS software to the Council. The CPS website provides a helpful link to the EV charging points within Edinburgh and across Scotland and can be found at: https://chargeplacescotland.org/ . The website advises users which bays are currently available or in use.\nFor on-street bays – a detailed Project Plan has been developed along with identifying specific locations for the installation of 66 on-street charging points (including 32 fast chargers, nine rapid chargers and 25 slow chargers) across the city to strengthen the existing network. The Transport and Environment Committee report from 5 March 2019 entitled ‘Electric Vehicle Business Case: Implementation Plan’ provides further details. The Project Delivery Plan, included within Appendix 2 of the report, provides details on the commencement dates of the various stages of the plan.\nUnfortunately, due to staff restructuring there has been some slippage in the proposed Project Plan. However, conversations are ongoing with Transport Scotland and the energy network operator to ensure that the charging points will be delivered.\nThe Council is also working with some pioneering research and development firms to introduce vehicle to grid charging and wireless charging which will see an additional 22 chargers installed over the coming year which will free up publicly accessible charge points further.",

We recently learned via the Evening News about the Council Leader’s wonky justification for closing public toilets and the impact that cut will have on families, those with a disability and people facing health problems. Now we read that Lothian Buses’ “jumbo bus” will not have the space for buggies and wheelchairs that far smaller vehicles have (report 13/11/18).\nIndeed, I know that many parents in my ward are concerned that too much of Lothian Buses’ fleet already does not have a space for both a wheelchair and a buggy. This is despite the fact that Lothian Buses boast on their website that “many of our newest buses have an additional space for a buggy as well as the wheelchair space”.\nI am therefore disappointed that although their newest bus is 50% bigger than normal, it will only offer a single space for a buggy or wheelchair.\nIt feels like the UK’s best bus operator has taken a giant step backwards with how this jumbo bus has been fitted out.\nWith 79% of drivers admitting that many of their journeys could be easily taken on foot, via bike or on public transport, as a city we should be making it easier for everyone to take the bus – particularity vulnerable groups.\nAs someone who is passionate about expanding public transport use, I would urge Lothian Buses to rethink this decision and provide more support to wheelchair users, parents and grandparents.\nI’d rather Edinburgh was known as a city that went the extra mile to support families and wheelchair users, than one that closed accessible toilets and made bus use more difficult.",

However, walking around our city centre streets I also feel a little ashamed about what international visitors see.\nOur roads are potholed. Too often, our footpaths are grubby and the bins are overflowing.\nThis is not a criticism of the City of Edinburgh Council’s hardworking staff. Their budget has been cut year on year and its right that education and social care budgets are protected as much as possible.\nI do wonder, however, how long the SNP can continue with these cuts before permanent damage is done to our city. It’s not as if the SNP elite in Holyrood could not choose an alternative path.\nAfter years of moaning about a lack of revenue raising powers, the SNP now have the ability to vary income tax bands and rates. They could have chosen to tax the richest 10% more, but instead they chose to raise their tax threshold. The result of this timidity is further cuts to council services the vulnerable need most.\nIs this really “Stronger for Scotland”?",

My abiding memory of that summer was that, compared to Dundee, the large number of people on the streets meant I always felt safe when walking around the city at night.\nSince then, however, in my view the Edinburgh’s Festivals have changed. The old experience is still there I’m sure, but it’s drowned out by a bigger and much more commercial offering – this perhaps reflects changes we’ve seen elsewhere in society. One estimate puts the value of the Festivals as being £1 billion.\nAlthough some people do make valid points about the nature and character of Edinburgh’s Festivals (particularly the Edinburgh Festival Fringe), most of us remain proud that people from around the world want to come to Edinburgh to enjoy the Festivals, explore our fantastic city and gamble with our weather. Like me, however, they want visitors to see Edinburgh at its best. Whether visitors are from Newtongrange, Newcastle or New Zealand, Edinburgh residents want to be proud of what they see when they come here. Like me, they want bins emptied, potholes filled and weeds cleared from footpaths. It’s easy to dismiss these problems, but first impressions really do count.\nHarder to dismiss, however, has been the creeping privatisation of public space in our cities. The impact of this means that amenity is lost for visitors and residents alike. Three examples:\n- I am a fan of Edinburgh’s “A-Board Ban” which means footpaths can’t be used to display temporary on-street advertising structures. This frees up valuable footpath space, making it easier and safer for those with mobility problems, buggies and young children to get around. Whilst it may be right that the Edinburgh Festival Fringe is shown some flexibility on this, the exemption they have has gone much further than expected.\n- One of the great things about Edinburgh, is the unexpected fantastic views people encounter just walking around the city. However, the creeping privatisation of public space means these views are now being blocked to support commercial activity or to host advertising.\n- Outside my Ward, one of the best views in Edinburgh is looking from Princess Street, across the gardens, up to the castle. This view is part of what defines Edinburgh and on any day of the year pedestrians (both residents and visitors alike) can you found photographing it. The problem is that these same people can also view ticketed events in Princess Street Gardens so on “safety” grounds a wooden barrier was erected last year and nobody quite knew what to do (see here and here for big talk, and here for the u-turn. This year we have a “curtain style” barrier and access is denied to large sections of the footpath on the south side of Princes Street. The barrier also extends around a large portion of Princes Street Gardens and access is via a £35 ticket. Creeping privatisation essentially means that increasingly the public can’t fully access public parks.\nWhat is interesting is that those that support the ever-increasing impact on public space are unwilling to enter a debate about the loss of amenity. Instead, they suggest that those who question their agenda are somehow “anti-tourist”. Indeed, Steve Cardownie recently referred to those who are trying to make Edinburgh better for residents and visitors alike as the “wet blanket brigade and other assorted naysayers”, and followed this up with a second article written as if he were one of them – Grumpy McGrump. Written in the “what have the Romans ever done for us” style, it focuses on the many positives of the festival without really considering how it could be improved.\nBuilding on this Cardownie’s argument a fellow Nationalist his, Council Leader Adam McVey, recently took to Twitter to tell the world that the £35 Glasgow’s DF Concerts were charging for access to concerts was affordable to “young people” and “working class people”, and that £145 may be acceptable. Again, no comment was made about the loss of amenity. The reality is that McVey appears a little out-of-touch as many young working class people in my Ward are struggling to pay their rent right now, never mind paying £145 for a concert ticket.\nTo be absolutely clear I am not saying these concerts should stop, although I know that those who support the creeping privatisation of public space will try to characterise my argument in that way. I do, however, reject the argument that they can’t happen without compromising pedestrian safety on Princes Street and, as I said elsewhere, we need to protect our parks from creeping privatisation.\nThat’s why I was recently concerned to read that Glasgow’s DF Concerts thinks Princes Street Gardens could become “Scotland’s answer to the Hollywood Bowl” and urged Edinburgh to look at New York’s Central Park because it has “loads of events”, saying cities like Edinburgh need to “utilise their assets” better. The basis of this approach appears to be that West Princes Street Gardens is a commodity which should be encircled by barriers so it can be exploited. Similarly, the Scotsman is reporting that the gardens may be used to screen “major sporting events”.\nIt may well be that these changes are for the best, and the city may benefit from them. I can’t help thinking, however, that we can do better. The Scotsman article also notes that the Gardens may well be used for bite-sized Tattoo performances. Would it not be great if this was opened up to people for free?\nIn July this year the National Mall parkland in the USA was used as a place to celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing. These fantastic events (video link below) were attended by thousands of people for free. I’d much rather that Edinburgh’s public parks was used for this type of inclusive event rather exclusive events for those that can afford it.\nWhether it is obscured views or cluttered pavements, visitors must leave Edinburgh thinking we take our heritage for granted. We have to remember it’s our built and cultural heritage that makes Edinburgh special, not boarded up parks and blocked pavements.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2024_01_30_whats-next-for-trams-in-edinburgh-orchard-brae-or-roseburn/content_173.html": "In January 2024 we published plans to consult on a new tram line which will connect Granton to the City Centre and on to the Bioquarter (the Royal Infirmary). This would help cut congestion, reduce emissions and boost the city-region economy. Once opened, the line will carry around 1 million passengers per month.\nThis investment would connect Granton, a massive new net zero development, to Edinburgh College, the Western General, Haymarket, the City Centre, Edinburgh University, Cameron Toll, the Bioquarter and on to Mid/East Lothian. If the Roseburn route is used, it will also give West Lothian residents an easy connection to the Western General and the Royal Infirmary.\nOfficers have invested a great deal of time and energy analysing and modelling the potential routes and the preferred option is built on evidence-based evaluation. Indeed, it is important to note that the case for the Roseburn route is strong because, when compared to the alternatives, it comes with a\n- Lower price tag;\n- Lower carbon requirement;\n- Lesser impact on businesses and residents;\n- Shorter construction time;\n- Shorter journey times and better reliability; and,\n- Lower operating costs.\nTo make this happen, however, the Council were originally proposing to move the existing cycling provision from a section of Roseburn Path to a safer (24/7) alternative before the work even starts. Moving the cycling provision would also help create a safer pedestrian environment. I’ve had no problem with people questioning this approach, so I have agreed with other political parties (Labour, plus the Greens & SNP) that we should double-check whether or not cycling provision can be retained on the Roseburn Path. This is what we agreed:\n- The potential to install a high-quality walking and cycling route alongside the tram line on the Roseburn Path should be fully considered.\n- Market research should be undertaken to understand what a demographically representative sample of Edinburgh feels about the plans.\n- The potential to protect and enhance the local ecological network as part of either tram route considered.\n- The consultation should present objectively the pros and cons of both the Roseburn and Orchard Brae Routes. (The Lib-Dems did not support points 1-3, but Labour, Greens, SNP & Lib-Dems all agreed both routes should go to consultation on an equal basis).\nPeople opposing the Roseburn route must also be clear about the fact that the alternative is down Orchard Brae. As well as being more expensive, it may also come with these challenges:\n- Long-term disruption to the thousands of people who live locally.\n- Avoidable negative construction impacts on Queensferry Road businesses (including significant utility diversion works)\n- Difficulties installing cycling provision on Crewe Road South/ Queensferry Road / Orchard Brae.\n- Loss of protected trees.\n- No direct tram from Granton/Western General to west Edinburgh or Haymarket (a growing employment hub).\n- Impacts on bus network and displacement of traffic.\nCurrent Predicted Annual Patronage of the whole N-S Tram line is as follows:\n- Roseburn via Telford Road Route = 13.5 million trips\n- Orchard Brae / Queensferry Road Route / Dean Bridge = 13.0 million trips\nThere is less mid-corridor demand on Roseburn but the route better serves the west of the city centre (Haymarket and West End) and would give West Edinburgh a direct connection to the Western General (still not fully quantified).\nRight now, it feels like suggesting Orchard Brae as a preferred candidate before the consultation even starts would be failing to learn the lessons from impacts to businesses and local communities we have seen as part of both the CCWEL and Tram projects – residents will not forgive us for this. This is why it is important that we present both routes on an equal basis.\nWe also have to think about funding. If all goes well, the Scottish Government will fund the project. To do that we will need a strong cost-benefit ratio. Adding to costs whilst eroding the benefits will not help.\nI am continually being told that Edinburgh must be bolder and act faster in the face of the climate emergency. This tramline is a chance to show Edinburgh is serious. Waiting for climate solutions which come with no compromise is not an option.",

This makes parts of our capital fairly unpleasant, and the resultant air quality problems are a particular risk to children and those with health problems.\nThe first proposals for WPL were actually made by Harold Macmillan’s Tory Government in 1962-4. These proposals, however, noted that WPL can force parking elsewhere, does not reflect journey length, does not target peak traffic and once the charge is paid it does not influence the number of journeys.\nHarold Wilson’s 1964 Government did not take these proposals forward. In 2000, however, legislation did enable English councils to enact WPL and 12 years later Nottingham introduced the first (and only) UK scheme.\nNottingham introduced the charge not to raise income, but to solve the same congestion problem Edinburgh faces. Unlike Edinburgh (so far), however, Nottingham worked with neighbouring authorities to ensure the charge did not cause problems at the city boundary. The charge started deliberately low, then slowly increased over time – this gave employers (and employees) time to adapt. Exemptions for small businesses mean that only 40% of employers pay the charge. The income was used to fund transformative improvements to public transport.\nNottingham’s experience has been positive, so it is right that we undertake a dialogue with the public to see if it would work in Edinburgh. Any income should not be used to backfill cuts, but must be used to transform active and public transport. Lastly, if introduced in Edinburgh I will argue that Edinburgh’s Councillors and Holyrood’s MSPs are first in line to pay the charge.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_04_06_ward-8-spaces-for-people-update_comment-page-1/content_287.html": "Introduction\nIt has been a wee while since I provided an update on the Spaces for People project – basically because the whole thing appears to have stalled. In this vacuum, a bit of misinformation has been circulating. Within that context it is important to note four things:\n- No party has ever asked for all Spaces for People schemes to be removed.\n- All parties have supported the installation of at least some schemes.\n- All parties have supported at least some schemes at least some of the time.\n- Covid-19 is no longer the justification for the schemes.\nThe November 2021 Transport & Environment Committee meeting set the direction of travel for the schemes impacting on my Ward – Lanark Road (the Oct 2021 decision was confirmed), Buckstone Terrace (A702), Braid Road (not actually in my Ward) and the two primary schools (Bonaly & Buckstone).\nLanark Road\nIt was agreed to progress this scheme to an ETRO. The process provides a statutory framework and public engagement process (not a homemade consultation) to consider any future changes to the scheme.\nComiston Road\nIt was agreed to also progress this scheme to an ETRO. It was agreed at the Transport Committee that changes to Braid Road and Comiston Road are impacting on delays to public transport on Comiston road (my video evidence here). The agreed solution to this was to remove a large section of the cycle lane and replace it with a bus lane.\nBraid Road\nThis will progress to an ETRO, and be reopened to two-way traffic. This will only happen, however, after a pedestrian crossing (agreed pre-covid) is installed at The Hermitage.\nSchools\nA School Travel Plan Review is underway for all schools. This piece of work will be carried out over the next 24 months. The aim of the review is to develop a 5 year action plan with parents, children and the schools to make the routes and streets surrounding the schools safer and to encourage more active travel. Schools with temporary Spaces for People measures are being prioritised and the survey for Buckstone and Bonaly has started. Residents will be involved once the initial plan is developed.\nProgress\nClearly, November 2021 was 5 months ago so it is only right that people should wonder what is happening. On the 3rd of February I was told that the ETRO consultations would start by the end of that month, and later I was told mid-March. To date, I have seen no visible progress.\nThe latest update I have for the schools was from mid-March, at that point I was told for Buckstone that “We are currently in dialogue with the school about the future of the Spaces for People measures at Buckstone as well as road safety issues on the wider routes to school”. I understand, however, that there has been no contact with the school since November. I expect the same applies to Bonaly.\nSo what’s causing the delay? Clearly, the Transport Committee should be doing more to scrutinise these projects. The underlying issue is, however, that the workload exceeds the staff resources available.",

Yes, after lots of chuntering about the need for new powers, the SNP dithered and failed to use them.\nThe impact of this is clear to anyone living in Edinburgh. This year we’ve had an epidemic of weeds on our footpaths, systematic problems with refuse collections and most recently we’ve been struggling to repair street lights.\nIn my own Ward I was recently invited to attend a meeting of Braidburn School’s Parent Council. Braidburn School is a fantastic facility at the heart of my Ward which offers a positive learning environment for pupils aged 3 to 18 years with additional support needs.\nAt this meeting, which was quite emotional at times, I learned that the holiday activities previously offered to children attending the school had been cut by a third. The budget has been largely protected, but costs and demand are rising.\nThese children are literally among the most vulnerable in Edinburgh and the holiday activities are a lifeline for parents who are statistically more liable to suffer everything from relationship break-down to mental health problems.\nI was ashamed that Scotland’s capital was letting these children down. It is an example, however, of how the most vulnerable people in society are paying the price for the combined actions of the UK and Scottish Governments.\nI have since raised the issue with Councillors Perry and Dickie (Education Convener & Vice-Convener respectively), as well as with Council Officers. All care just as much as I do about this service, but the budget squeeze means that they must work within current resources and that means reducing the support available to children with additional support needs. This should shame us all.\nIndeed, this is a non-statutory service so if the current level of cuts continue it will come under huge pressure.\nSoon Derek Mackay MSP will be setting Edinburgh’s 2018/19 budget. Let’s hope that rather than making “marginal” changes, this time he and Nicola Sturgeon think of the children at Braidburn School and enact real change. Real change for the many.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_08_18_is-edinburgh-ready-to-tackle-climate-change-with-rain-gardens/content_459.html": "Earlier this month as part of my work outside the Council I gave an invited lecture in Beijing to engineers, planners and academics from across the developing world about managing the impact of climate change. Over the duration of the weeklong workshop I was humbled to learn more about the enormity of the risk facing places like Ecuador, Nepal, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Laos in dealing with a problem that is not their making. I returned from this trip determined to redouble Edinburgh’s efforts to tackle climate change.\nThe flooding Edinburgh experienced this year may have been localised, but the impact on individuals has was non-trivial. Although this weather is not a prediction of what our capital can expect in the future, it is a taste of what climate change may bring. I was therefore pleased to contribute to a motion which asks the Council to review its climate change preparedness and resilience. The text of the motion is as follows:\nClimate Change Impact and Management\nCouncil:\n1. Acknowledges the severe weather conditions experienced by the city and elsewhere in recent weeks and recognises that these events may be a taste of what climate change could bring.\n2. Recognises that these put significant strain on drainage systems and other infrastructure, causing some surface water flooding and damage to property.\n3. Acknowledges that there is a need for the Council to be prepared and far-sighted in its approach to building in resilience in the city, alongside its work to make Edinburgh a net zero carbon city by 2030.\n4. Acknowledges the comments of flood insurance specialist Professor David Crichton in which he indicated that many local authorities in Scotland have already been ‘good at managing risk’.\n5. Requests a report to Council which indicates clearly the work already being undertaken and needed across the Council to meet heightened demands caused by extreme weather and future considerations, within 3 cycles.\nAlthough this motion goes far beyond flooding, I am keen to push the Council to do more to manage runoff. Rainwater runoff from roads, roofs and car-parks in many parts of our Capital (esp pre WEWS Act) adds to flood risk and pollutes our watercourses, and tackling this problem at source as much as possible is the most sustainable approach. I hope to amend the above motion to include two key changes.\nFirstly, as part of Climate Change Impact & Management report I will propose that Council Officers enter discussions with Scottish Water and the Scottish Government, and report on the feasibility of offering advice and incentives to property owners who wish to manage surface water within their own curtilage rather than discharging to the surface water or combined drainage system. This could draw inspiration from:\n1. Portland’s Downspout Disconnection Programme (this disconnected over 56,000 roofs from the city’s combined sewer system)\n2. The Puget Sound’s 12,000 Raingarden Project\n3. Melbourne’s 10,000 Raingarden Project\nSecondly, as part of Climate Change Impact & Management report I will propose that Council Officers investigate and report on the feasibility of installing on-street bioretention planters to intercept polluted road runoff and support biodiversity as part of the ongoing investment programme. This could draw inspiration from:\n1. Case studies developed by TfL\n2. Water Research Foundation Guidance\n3. Portland’s Green Streets Programme\nThese are small changes which will make our capital more resilient to climate change, whilst also reducing the amount of pollutants reaching water courses and increasing biodiversity. People will ask about the cost, but the reason other cities are taking this approach is because it is cheaper.\nA cityscape like this is the alternative:",

This process is ongoing and our Active Travel team is providing input on the proposed facilities for walking and cycling. Transport Scotland’s consultants tell us that their client intends that the new junction should be an exemplar active travel scheme.\nMuch of the A7 south of the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary (ERI) is within Midlothian, however the section north of ‘The Wisp’ is within this Council’s area.\nThis Council is supportive of the suggestion that the junction upgrade should include works to improve conditions for walking and particularly cycling on the entire road corridor from appropriate points in Midlothian south of the junction, north-westwards to the ERI.\nThe above was part of the verbal comments given to Transport Scotland’s consultants recently, at our last meeting. The essence of our response was that, whilst high quality segregated provision through the junction was essential, it would be most productive for the project to deliver a good standard of walking/cycling provision from origin to destination, rather than an excellent standard through the new junction coupled to no enhancement of the remainder of the route. The latter approach would leave a number of cycling-related issues on the route between Sheriffhall and the ERI, particularly for less confident cyclists – the key group when seeking to increase mode share for travel to work.\nThis Council is focussing its active travel investment in the locations where there is potential for the greatest impact. Its significant Active Travel budget is already essentially committed for several years to come and does not cover the work discussed above on the sections of route within Edinburgh (though the Council is participating in work considering an upgrade to cycling connections to the Bioquarter from the Cameron Toll/Kings Buildings areas). However, the Council would welcome any decision from Transport Scotland to include the links discussed above as part of the Sheriffhall junction upgrade scheme. As roads authority, the Council would be happy to collaborate with development, design and delivery work.",

Waste services have been working closely with customer, ICT, CGI, Oracle and partners, communications, finance and strategy and insight to ensure a joined-up approach to the development of the registration and payment process is put in place. To date, the following key actions have been\ncompleted:\n- Garden waste policy written and approved\n- On-line registration form created and tested\n- Terms and Conditions agreed\n- Merchant codes set-up and ready to take payment online and over the phone\n- Communications plan developed which includes awareness campaign and direct\ncontact via mailing to 245k households - Liaison with other services to agree entitlement for customers receiving Council Tax\n- Reduction Scheme or Garden Aid\n- DPIA has been reviewed and responses to risk mitigations agreed and approved by\nthe Information Asset Owner - Integration Impact Assessment drafted\nRegistration process\nResidents will be able to sign up for the new service from 18 June – 22 July on our website. Residents without access to the internet at home can use the self-serve kiosks at our locality offices, internet at libraries or register by phone. For online registration, residents will need to register for a MyGov account first if they do not already have one.\nWe are expecting a high demand for registration and additional web server capacity and extra staff in the contact centre are being put in place for six weeks.\nThe registration period will be supported by a five-week awareness campaign and we will also write to residents during this time to inform them of the changes and what they need to do.\nRegistration uptake will be tracked and monitored daily. Frequently asked questions will be reviewed and updated on our website daily as required. Information for residents is available on our website.\nResidents who choose not to sign up for the new service are being encouraged to continue recycling their garden waste by taking it to one of our recycling centres for free or by composting at home. If they no longer want their brown bin they will be able fill out an online form in October and we will arrange to collect their bins. The bins will either be re-used or recycled.\nBin permits and calendars\nOnce registration closes on 22 July the waste and cleansing team will create the new garden waste collection routes. Once completed new calendars will be created and sent to customers along with their permit sticker two weeks prior to the service to put on their bin. We will only empty bins with a valid permit sticker.\nThere will be another opportunity to sign up later in the year, but payments will not be prorated.",

In 2008 the Council received about £1b for revenue expenditure. In 2017 the sum received was £938m. It is estimated that to purchase the same services as on 2008 the Council would require an additional £200m to what it received in 2017.\nUNISON City of Edinburgh Council Branch has produced a briefing note entitled: ‘Council Budget Cuts 2018/2019’ which can be seen on its website.\nIt is reported that Edinburgh will have a ‘standstill budget’ for 2018/2019. This is despite planning to levy a 3% council tax. This tax is not allowing the development of services but is lessening Scottish Government cuts. There would not be a standstill budget without the tax increase.\nIt is only a ‘standstill budget’ if you assume that the projected inflation increase is around 1.4%. It is known that many Council costs will increase at more than 2%. These costs include projected wage increases and those arising from demographic changes: that is population growth.\nWhat is the Council getting from the Scottish Government?\nIn the autumn of 2017 the Council was expecting to have to make cuts next year (2018/2019) of about £60m (this was on top of cuts of previous years). The Scottish Government (SG) then agreed to give the Council an additional £10m which reduced the savings target to £50m. Within the last week the Greens have negotiated a further £200m for Scottish local authorities. It seems that Edinburgh will receive a further £12.4m. The coalition will have to decide how this will be used to amend their budget. There is scope for lobbying on how this sum should be spent.\nThe Scottish Trades Union Congress produced a briefing on the SG budget for the whole of Scotland. This states that the SG can raise an additional £800m in tax “whilst seeing no tax increases for anyone earning below the median income, and still seeing modest and affordable impacts on those higher up the income spectrum”. The STUC condemned the SGs intention to provide tax cuts for business. This tax cut will have no positive effect on the economy or jobs.\nA very disturbing report on local authority finances has been published by Audit Scotland. The report is called “Local government in Scotland:Financial Overview 2016/17”. It was published on 28/11/17.\n“A major element of this operating environment for councils is the continuing pressure on finances. There was a real terms reduction in councils’ main source of funding from the Scottish Government for 2016/17. This year has seen a further real terms funding reduction, with that trend forecast to continue into future years.”\nHow to improve the Council’s financial position?\n- Lobby the Scottish Government to raise more money through general taxation.\n- Lobby the Scottish Government to increase the income from business rates.\n- Tourist Tax\n- Debt relief\n- Other forms of local authority income generation\n- Ending the use of PFI and transnationals such as Carillon and Capita.\n- Lobby the Scottish Parliament.\n- Up to date valuation of Edinburgh properties (last valuation 1991).\nSome Examples of the effects of the City’s financial problems?\nSocial Care: the Council has 8576 hours per week of assessed care (as at 27/12/17) (covering 981 people) which it cannot provide. The level of unmet care per week on 29/5/17 was 5534 hours. The level of unmet care has grown by 3000 hours per week in six months. The Council has about 1900 people who are waiting on assessments for Social Care. Some of been waiting for over two years and many for over a year. Edinburgh TUC intends, under the Freedom of Information Act, to ask the Council how many people with disabilities are waiting for assessed care and how many are waiting on assessments. We will also ask how many people have died during the last year and ask if the deaths are linked to the failure to get a service. There is already evidence that people have died waiting for care.\nThe Edinburgh Joint Integration Board stated (26/1/18):\n“Current levels and patterns of support to enable people to leave hospital are not sufficient to bring about the reduction required in the level of delay. There are major challenges in terms of the capacity of the care system and of affordability”.\nJobs: the so called ‘Transformation’ process continues. Labour has said that it will not support compulsory redundancies. The trade union response to this is that there are compulsory redundancies in the voluntary sector, following local authority commissioning, due to cuts in funding. In addition redundancies of directly employed Council employees are all but being made compulsory redundant now. People are leaving because the changes in job descriptions are unacceptable, because of grading changes or because of sharply increasing job loads as staff numbers go down. There are still a thousand jobs at risk. In some departments everyone over 60 has gone and there is nobody under 30 (because there no openly advertised vacancies).\nLocal authority trade unions and Not For Profit trade unions are reporting that funding cuts and job changes are resulting in high levels of stress at work which is leading to increased sickness absence. The stress is worse for people with disabilities.\nSports facilities: The proposed budget for 2018/2019 will have a serious impact on the maintenance of sports pitches and facilities. The level of maintenance will now be below what is recommended for the long term preservation of facilities.\nLibraries: Libraries are an essential community resource including a resource for people for whom it is the only access to the internet. They are in danger of closing. Keep libraries open and properly staffed is a major equality issue for the City of Edinburgh.\nNurseries: The Council and the Scottish Government have identified that Edinburgh needs an additional 30 nurseries by the year 2020 if policy commitments are to be met. The capital funding for these nurseries have not yet been allocated all though that should have been done if the nurseries are to be there when needed.There should be no consideration to the build being tied up in a PFI arrangement. This would be a bad deal for the community. The staff needed for the 30 nurseries do not exist. They will have to be trained and there are no current arrangements to train them\nAt the moment the Council has a policy to replace nursery nurses by grade 3 assistants who have not be trained to the right level.\nJanitors and industrial action: Janitors are having a ballot on industrial action. Their main concern is not about wages but is about the service level. They fear that the functional safety and security of their buildings will be put into the inexperienced hands of people who may not work for the Council. This will pose risks for pupils, teachers and other staff.\nOther issues\n- 1400 children in care in Edinburgh. The service to these children should not be cut.\n- the Council housing stock its less than the Council housing waiting list. The Council is not meeting the needs of homeless people. ‘Sofa Surfing’ is at an unacceptable level.\n- asylum children need to be properly supported.\n- the Council says it cannot set an illegal budget but at the same time can set a budget that arguably fails to meet its statutory duties. The breaches of statutory duties needs to be drawn to the attention of the public not brushed aside because of vague official definitions of a statutory duty.\nCouncillor’s and political leadership?\nCouncillors and the coalition need to do more to explain to the public the impact of austerity on services and jobs.\nThey have to say that they cannot manage the proposed budget for next year while still meeting reasonable public and workforce expectations.\nExplaining to the public can take many forms. One method could be Councillors leading on the use of public/parliamentary petitions e.g. the City Council asking all the citizens to sign a petition condemning the cuts aimed at the Scottish Government. A 38 degrees petition could be created.\nCouncillors should create a practical people’s budget for 2018/2019 indicating the resources that would be needed to avoid further cuts and to make a start on reversing austerity.\nCouncillors need to say loud and clear to the public that “enough is enough’.\nCouncillor’s and Equality/ Poverty Impact Assessments\nAs we understand it the Council has a statutory duty to consider the impact of budget decisions on equality issues. It has a duty to consider whether the budget will affect poverty in the City. It is our view that the Council has failed in its statutory duty to carry out impact assessments to the level of detail that would be informative to staff or the public. It is our view that if a proper impact assessment was done on social care finances there would be a finding that the Council systematically discriminated against people with disabilities. The Council has yet to do an informative impact assessment of waiting list for social care or social care assessments. The coalition should ensure that these assessments are done and made public.\nCouncils and Local Democracy\nIt seems that the Scottish Government has a deliberate strategy to undermine local democracy. This is illustrated by:\n- the failure to provide proper funding;\n- the failure to give additional local fund raising powers;\n- the failure to make Joint Integration Boards properly accountable;\n- the allocation (from the Scottish Government) of finance for schools directly to headteachers.\nThe Fate of English Councils\nIt is sometimes said that what happens in England to local authorities shows what will eventually happen to Scottish Local authorities in a few years time. Recent media reports are saying that many if not most English local authorities are on the verge of bankruptcy. The Scottish Government seem to be proceeding in the same way. The SG should come clean with the public and state their strategy. Is their policy all about replacing democratic local authorities with less accountable Boards and Commissions?\nDes Loughney\nEdinburgh TUC 15/2/18",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_03_13_right-now-the-snp-is-simply-failing-too-many-people-on-housing/content_417.html": "Edinburgh is facing a housing crisis. Our Capital has 1,609 households in temporary accommodation, too much of which is of a very poor standard. With only 20,000 council houses in the city, we have 21,000 people on the waiting list for one.\nIn the past few weeks two rough sleepers died on our streets and we know that in 2015/16 at least 18 homeless people died in Edinburgh. Worst of all, “affordable” houses are being built in Edinburgh which are simply not affordable to the people we rely on most – care workers, nurses and teachers. All of this should shame us.\nIt is within that context that I was delighted last month that Richard Leonard managed to force Nicola Sturgeon to pledge to halt evictions over the winter period. This week Edinburgh’s Labour councillors will back a plan that will develop a Council policy on winter evictions rather than wait for Nicola Sturgeon to “get on with her day job”.\nThis is just the start of Labour’s plans to tackle homelessness. Last week I proposed that the council should start systematically buying back council houses and at the weekend Richard Leonard promised to bring forward a Mary Barbour Law (report, 13/03/18).\nThis has the aim of regulating the minority of private landlords who seek to exploit their tenants by providing overpriced poor quality accommodation.\nThe Mary Barbour law will regulate the private rented sector to ensure that no one is forced to rent a home that pushes them into poverty or falls below the standards needed to protect their physical and mental health and well-being.\nFundamental to this is the belief that a home is a basic human right and that it is a government’s obligation to guarantee that everyone can live in security, peace, and dignity. Right now the SNP is simply failing too many people on this obligation and that’s why Labour will act.\nIf Labour can achieve this in opposition, just imagine what we can do if we are given a chance to govern.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_11_02_congestion-charging-by-the-back-door_comment-page-1/content_235.html": "As an avid reader of Steve Cardownie’s column I was a wee bit disappointed to see I had not made myself clear on my thinking regarding a possible congestion charge for Edinburgh.\nAs Edinburgh’s new Transport and Environment Convener, I am faced with a situation where Edinburgh is growing at an incredible rate and is the most congested city in the UK. More car use won’t solve this problem, particularly when we are faced with a climate emergency.\nThe opposition parties in Edinburgh think a Workplace Parking Levy is the solution, but myself and my friends in the trade union movement have doubts. If the opposition parties progress with this, however, I have a duty to make it work for our Capital.\nI am looking at a range of measures inside the city to encourage people to switch to sustainable transport modes, and to ensure new developments have first class public transport links. I must, however, also consider the traffic coming from outside Edinburgh.\nMy focus right now is increasing public transport capacity from surrounding local authorities. This is about making it safer, faster and more reliable. By 2025 I hope to have the public transport capacity in place to make a real dent in Edinburgh’s congestion problem. If people from outside the City of Edinburgh Council area prove reluctant to switch to public transport then a congestion charge may help encourage them.\nSteve Cardownie called this “congestion charging by the back door”, but I am planning on knocking loudly on the front door of drivers to ask them to make the switch to sustainable transport.\nThe congestion charge will be payable as car drivers from surrounding local authorities enter Edinburgh, but there may well be a higher rate for entering the city centre.\nFor all this to work, Scotland needs a joined-up public transport strategy which focuses on keeping bus, tram and rail fares affordable and the services reliable. Let’s hope we see progress on this by 2025.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_06_15_briefing-on-the-delayed-garden-waste-charging-scheme/content_641.html": "Below is a briefing from the Transport & Environment Convener (Cllr Lesley Macinnes, SNP Councillor for Liberton/Gilmerton Ward). My previously stated view on the plan is here.\nGarden Waste Service\nFollowing the decision at Council in February to introduce an annual £25 charge to collect garden waste every two weeks, work has been carried out in preparation for the roll out of the new service. Waste services have been working closely with customer, ICT, CGI, Oracle and partners, communications, finance and strategy and insight to ensure a joined-up approach to the development of the registration and payment process is put in place. To date, the following key actions have been\ncompleted:\n- Garden waste policy written and approved\n- On-line registration form created and tested\n- Terms and Conditions agreed\n- Merchant codes set-up and ready to take payment online and over the phone\n- Communications plan developed which includes awareness campaign and direct\ncontact via mailing to 245k households - Liaison with other services to agree entitlement for customers receiving Council Tax\n- Reduction Scheme or Garden Aid\n- DPIA has been reviewed and responses to risk mitigations agreed and approved by\nthe Information Asset Owner - Integration Impact Assessment drafted\nRegistration process\nResidents will be able to sign up for the new service from 18 June – 22 July on our website. Residents without access to the internet at home can use the self-serve kiosks at our locality offices, internet at libraries or register by phone. For online registration, residents will need to register for a MyGov account first if they do not already have one.\nWe are expecting a high demand for registration and additional web server capacity and extra staff in the contact centre are being put in place for six weeks.\nThe registration period will be supported by a five-week awareness campaign and we will also write to residents during this time to inform them of the changes and what they need to do.\nRegistration uptake will be tracked and monitored daily. Frequently asked questions will be reviewed and updated on our website daily as required. Information for residents is available on our website.\nResidents who choose not to sign up for the new service are being encouraged to continue recycling their garden waste by taking it to one of our recycling centres for free or by composting at home. If they no longer want their brown bin they will be able fill out an online form in October and we will arrange to collect their bins. The bins will either be re-used or recycled.\nBin permits and calendars\nOnce registration closes on 22 July the waste and cleansing team will create the new garden waste collection routes. Once completed new calendars will be created and sent to customers along with their permit sticker two weeks prior to the service to put on their bin. We will only empty bins with a valid permit sticker.\nThere will be another opportunity to sign up later in the year, but payments will not be prorated.",

The SNP lost 21 seats in a meltdown brought about by their obsession with #IndyRef2 and indifference to public services. Rather than accept this, however, they are seeking to blame others.\nA great example of this comes from the SNP’s chief apologist (post truth blogger Stuart Campbell). Rather than accept that Labour’s Ian Murray MP kept his seat because he’s hard working and opposes #IndyRef2 with real passion, Campbell seeks to undermine the result:\nThe first thing to note is that whilst the Tories did do well in May, Labour elected Councillors right across Edinburgh South. Indeed, in my Ward I was elected at the expense of an SNP Councillor and took Labour from fourth to second.\nThe second thing to note is that the reason Ian Murray MP won with an increased majority was because the SNP vote collapsed from 16,666 votes to just 10,755.\nThirdly, rather than running a “paper” campaign to support Ian Murray MP, the Tories actually worked hard and, unlike the SNP, increased their vote share from 17.5% to 19.7%.\nThe hard truth for Campbell and his SNP masters is that in Edinburgh South the SNP vote collapsed and Labour was the main beneficiary. No amount of moaning and crying can hide that fact.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_06_06_housing-we-can-complain-about-the-scottish-governments-indifference-but-we-cant-afford-to-sit-back-and-wait-on-them-to-act/content_496.html": "Andy Wightman MSP is right that where housing is concerned, our Capital has become a city of haves and have nots.\nAt a time when the Council is dealing simultaneously with Scottish Government cuts and a housing crisis, our capital has witnessed a rapid expansion in Airbnb type lets – It is estimated that there are 9,638 in Edinburgh. This sector of the economy is largely unregulated due to the Scottish Government’s unwillingness to bring forward legislation to ensure owners act responsibly and provide safe accommodation. Along with Sheila Gilmore, Convenor for Housing 1999-2007, I have therefore setup a petition to force the Scottish Government to listen to Edinburgh on this, readers can sign it at: ABetterEdinburgh.org\nThere is much the Council can do right now, however, to improve the housing situation in Edinburgh. Every chance I get, I make the case for the city buying back former council houses at the market rate and making them available to families that need them.\nI have also spent time looking at Edinburgh’s empty home problem. There are around 5000 empty homes in the city at any one time. The vast majority cause no problems and are empty for no longer than 6 months. Others are empty for longer periods and do result in problems – overgrown gardens, vandalism etc. One near where I live in Buckstone has remained empty for 20 years!\nEach year around August the Council produces a report on empty homes. This year for the first time, after a bit of pestering from me, it will cover problematic empty homes like the one in Buckstone. It is hoped it will also outline a policy for the use of Compulsory Purchase Powers to deal with them. If it does not contain that policy, the Labour Group will ask for it and systematically use it to bring homes back in to use.\nSo yes, we can complain about the Scottish Governments indifference but we can’t afford to sit back and wait on them to act.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2024_03_27_the-intractable-quiet-route-between-greenbank-and-cluny-gardens/content_113.html": "The “Quiet Route” between Greenbank and Cluny Gardens is a legacy Spaces for People project which is more controversial than it should be due to problematic consultations in the past, and the flawed way in which the opposition parties reopened Braid Road. At that point I requested that the reopening ‘should include consideration of a more clearly defined cycle route between Greenbank Crossroads and the Meadows, and how this interfaces with Comiston Road’, but this was blocked by the Edinburgh Greens. You can see the current situation here and I cycle the whole route here.\nThe result is that many residents, pedestrians and cyclists say they feel less safe. Officers made no recommendation in their report following a recent consultation which sought to address these concerns, but did present 3 options (see here). Out of that the 5 parties managed to adopt 4 positions(!). In the end it went to a three-way vote with the majority backing replacing the (not so) Quiet Route with segregation along a route we know ~50% of cyclists use (Hermitage Drive and Braid Avenue) . The final round of voting was 7 v 2 v 2 (a three way split), I provide an overview here.\nGiven the difficult history of the project, I have listened to local residents, and supported a trial replacing the modal filters with a fully segregated cycle route through the area.\nI have said in the Evening News that I would have preferred Option 2. I feel, however, that Option 3 is the best way of resetting our relationship with the local community. All the option components will remain on the table if residents want them via the ETRO process, and I am expecting a drift towards a hybrid position as the trial proceeds – I said this in the committee. I think it is better to work with the local community, not against it. We can all debate the merits of the options, but I hope everyone (inc those taking part in the Critical Mass ride this weekend (yes, I hope to attend)) understand the value of working with the local community.\nIf you are travelling through the area on bike (e.g. Oxgangs or Fairmilehead to City Centre), my view is that the segregated route will be safer than what we have right now as you won’t be mixing with rat-running cars at peak times. There will, however, also be robust traffic calming and speed reduction measures in place for those walking, wheeling or cycling within the Braid Estate.\nNoting that this is a trial, I think it is right that we look at robust but inexpensive ways to test the approach. Once the trial ends, the final design of planters and/or segregation in place will reflect the conservation area status.\nIt is important to put this in context, the route passes through an area of just 0.2 km square – it is tiny, but we are paying the price for poor political management in the past. We will soon consult on the Dalry 20 Minute Neighbourhood where excellent community engagement means we could be transforming an area many times bigger – this is a result of the type of engagement I would like to see normalised in the future.",

It does note, however, that a “public petition with over 1,000 signatures opposing the proposals was submitted to Councillors on 12 October“.\nIt appears that many comments have been dismissed or dealt with superficially – this is particularly true of comments raised by Community Councils and disability groups.\nFor example, the Edinburgh Access Panel say: “Please ensure the provision of access and parking for blue badge holders in the roads affected by your proposals is at least equivalent to the current provision“.

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_11_10_tipping-point-it-is-time-to-act_comment-page-1/content_330.html": "Fly-tipping is the illegal dumping of waste, and can vary in scale significantly from a single bin bag of waste to large volumes of waste dumped from trucks. Fly-tipping differs from littering in that it involves the removal of waste from premises where it was produced with the deliberate aim of disposing of it unlawfully, or as a result of legitimate outlets not being available.\nFly-tipping poses a threat to humans and wildlife, damages our environment, and spoils our enjoyment of our towns and countryside. Furthermore, I know from my professional work in flood risk management that it can cause real problems when it gets stuck in culverts. In my Ward I often report tipping – with Oxgangs House and Oxgangs Street being regular problem areas.\nTomorrow Edinburgh’s Transport & Environment Committee will consider the 2021 “Waste and Cleansing Services Performance Update“. This report updates the Committee on the Waste and Cleansing Services performance for the first two quarters of 2021/22 On tipping, it says this:\n“4.12 Dumping of items seems to reflect a national pattern of illegal behaviour which has been highlighted both by Keep Scotland Beautiful and neighbouring Councils. It’s possible that during the lockdowns people may have been enjoying their local green spaces more, and so are more aware of and more likely to report existing issues, but it is also possible that there is simply a growing national problem with fly-tipping and dumping.”\nThis implies there has been a rise in tipping reports (not quantified in the report), and this is Covid related. The pre-summer “Coalition Commitment” report, however, notes that there have been year-on-year rises since 2017:\nWhen I raised this with the Council, I received this response:\nCertainly recent increases can be attributed to the impact of COVID and I think this has been quite widely reported in national publications. However, as your data shows, we have seen also a big jump from 2017 to 2018. There are a few contributing factors to this I would suggest:\n- Improvements in online reporting which makes it easier for residents to tell us about issues\n- A bit of an increase in proactive reporting. This is particularly relevant in the SW locality where Street Enforcement (formerly Env Wardens) were actively logging items to be lifted.\n- The categorisation of what we capture as being dumped or fly tipped. For us this will include black bags left next to a communal bin for example. Given the number of communal bins we have throughout the City this will form a large proportion.\nIn terms of where the current hotspots are and how things may improve in the future, I received this response:\nThe Communal bin project proposes an increase in the frequency of collection from, in many cases, a twice per week collection to an every other day collection. This should relieve some of the pressure on colleagues in street cleansing who, outside of collection days, will assist in collecting any excess. Alongside the increase in frequency it will also be important to get the comms right. Looking at a recent heat map for dumping and fly tipping enquiries there is quite a high level of correlation to areas served by communal bins. That’s one issue we’ve highlighted through the communal bin project that this is an opportunity to properly engage with people about the responsible way to manage their waste. It’s not something that’s been done recently in my memory.\nI welcome the fact that there is potential for progress to be made with Edinburgh’s tipping problem in the near future. I’m still disappointed, however, that the original report did not contain a fuller assessment of the problem or outline the potential solutions. I’m grateful, therefore, that the Transport & Environment Vice-Convener/Convener agreed to amend the report as follows to ensure the issue is dealt with seriously:\n- Notes that tipping and dumping in Edinburgh has increased year on-year since 2017, and that this selfish and anti-social behaviour blights many communities, as it does in local authority areas across Scotland.\n- Notes that dealing with tipping and dumping consumes significant council resources, and that this money could be better invested elsewhere.\n- Requests a report within three cycles which details the extent of the problem, identifies hotspots and makes clear what options are available to deal with it, including the bulky household uplift service.\nI’m disappointed that this follow-up report is going to take several months to be published, and that it will not explicitly offer free uplift of bulky items (a manifesto commitment of mine), but I think this is a useful starting point.",

Over the past few days I have been speaking to Teachers, Parents, Council Officers, Nursery Staff, members of my party and the EIS about this issue. I have drawn the conclusion that there is not sufficient evidence to progress with this cut.\nAs someone who grew up in one of the UK’s most deprived areas and now works in education, I understand fully the role teachers can play in cutting the educational attainment gap between the richest and poorest in Scotland. I also know that closing this gap should not start in primary or secondary school – it must begin as early as possible. I was therefore concerned to see that the information used to justify this cut is dated and does not take into account social deprivation.\nAdditionally, I feel that removing teachers from nurseries now will create a leadership vacuum which will put undue pressure on the remaining SVQ3 staff. I therefore will be arguing that we reject this funding cut at least until sufficient SVQ3 staff have upgraded to the BA in Childhood Practice. I accept, however, that retaining qualified teachers is the best outcome. Indeed, the Scottish Government have been clear:\n“…the qualifications of pre-school staff – and particularly having teachers with early years skills, staff with a degree such as Childhood Practice and a mix of skills in the workforce – are key factors in determining the quality of provision.”\nThe proposal to cut teachers from nurseries will “save” £340,000, but the negative impact may be much bigger. That’s why I will argue that funding be found to block this cut. If that money can’t be found, I will suggest that every household in Edinburgh pays an extra £1.40 in Council Tax per year to help secure the future of our capital’s children.\nFrankly, it is unbelievable that SNP cuts are forcing decisions like this on Edinburgh.\nInformation regarding the importance of retaining Teachers and Head Teachers in nursery classes and nursery schools\nBackground\nThe first nursery in Scotland opened in Edinburgh in 1903. This historic legacy of nursery education, and in particular, sector leading nursery schools led by nursery head teachers, continues to this day.\nEdinburgh has invested heavily in the quality of its workforce, ensuring that there are full time teachers (who are degree qualified and GTCS-registered) in school nursery classes and in the standalone nursery schools.\nSeveral of the nursery head teachers work in partnership with The University of Edinburgh to deliver the Froebel in Childhood Practice courses and offer practice visits in their settings. The Scottish Government’s workforce review (Siraj, 2015) states\n‘The City of Edinburgh Council is one example of the best early learning focuses within Scotland. This is based on the professional development they provide for early years staff, much of which follows the Froebel model. This model is child centred with a play-based pedagogy, and is underpinned by a knowledge and understanding of child development which supports assessment, evaluation and planning.’\nConsiderations\nThe Growing Up in Scotland (GUS) report states, ‘the Effective Provision of Pre-school Education (EPPE) project (Melhuish et al, 2008), has shown that children in high quality provision prior to starting school achieved higher literacy and numeracy levels than those in low quality settings or who did not experience pre-school.’\nThe EPPE project explored factors that influence quality. Findings include:\n- Good quality can be found across all types of early years settings; however quality was higher overall in settings integrating care and education and in nursery schools.\n- Settings that have staff with higher qualifications have higher quality scores and their children make more progress.\n- Quality indicators include warm interactive relationships with children, having a trained teacher as manager and a good proportion of trained teachers on the staff.\nStaff Qualifications\nThe Scottish Government also acknowledges the importance that degree educated staff in nurseries make and have invested heavily in their Additional Graduate Programme for settings in areas of high deprivation in order to focus on closing the poverty related attainment gap.\nThe GUS report states ‘Research by Education Scotland (2012) found that settings which had access to higher qualified staff, particularly teachers with a background in early years methodology or staff with specific early childhood qualifications – such as the BA in Childhood Practice – were more likely to offer higher quality learning experiences.’\nThe budget proposal suggests replacing nursery teachers with early years practitioners. There is a significant difference in the level of qualifications between these roles.\n| Role | Qualification | SCQF Level | Number of Credits |\n| Early Years Practitioner | SVQ3/HNC | 7 | 96 |\n| Teacher | Honours Degree | 10 | 480 |\n| & often additional Postgraduate Diploma | 10 & 11 | 60 & 60 |\nCare Inspectorate Gradings\nAlthough available data is mixed and there is evidence that a few local authorities who have reduced access to teachers are performing well, there is also evidence that removing nursery teachers has had a negative impact on Care Inspectorate (CI) gradings. CI data in the GUS report, on which the officer recommendation to remove nursery teachers was based, was from 2010. The data here is current, as published on the CI website.\n| Local Authority | Teachers in class | Care & Support | Environment | Staffing | Management & Leadership |\n| Scotland | 71% | 64% | 72% | 58% | |\n| Edinburgh | Yes | 81% (+10%) | 73% (+9%) | 81% (+10%) | 74% (+16%) |\n| West Lothian | Yes until Aug 18 | 75% (+4%) | 70% (+4%) | 77% (+5%) | 67% (+9%) |\n| West Dunbartonshire | No | 32% (-39%) | 32% (-32%) | 47% (-25%) | 37% (-21%) |\n| Moray | No | 55% (-16%) | 68% (+4%) | 50% (-22%) | 45% (-13%) |\n| Borders | No | 58% (-13%) | 49% (-15%) | 64% (-8%) | 44% (-14%) |\n| Highland | No | 70% (-1%) | 41% (-23%) | 59% (-13%) | 47% (-11%) |\nThe 4 Local Authorities in this table without teachers in nursery are all are performing well under the national average, and significantly under City of Edinburgh.\nWest Dunbartonshire removed teachers from nurseries several years ago, however, they are now recognising this as a mistake (as is evidenced by their CI gradings which are up to 39% lower than the national average). They have also found that the impact has been a real disconnect between nursery and primary, which has manifested as disruption caused by P1 pupils in many of their schools.\nDundee is currently increasing its complement of nursery teachers, with the explicit aim of closing the poverty-related attainment gap. They have determined that the educational benefits of having nursery teachers working directly in classrooms with pupils, liaising with colleagues in primary schools, and leading teams of professionals, are likely to be a significant driver of improved outcomes at all stages in education – not to mention being a cost-effective way of using their Attainment Challenge funding.\nIt should be further noted that the very mixed provision in different local authorities makes direct comparisons difficult. It is instructive to look at the figures for the different types of provision within Edinburgh.\n| Local Authority | Teachers in class | Care & Support | Environment | Staffing | Management & Leadership |\n| Scotland | 71% | 64% | 72% | 58% | |\n| Edinburgh | Yes | 81% | 73% | 81% | 74% |\n| Edinburgh\nPartnership |\nNo | 56% | 57% | 59% | 49% |\n| Edinburgh Partnership | Yes | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |\nThis shows very clear correlations between the presence of nursery teachers in classrooms and quality in terms of care and support. Given all these are within Edinburgh, there are likely to be far fewer confounding factors than with data that goes across different local authorities.\nA final point – the CI gradings relate to Care and Support within nurseries. They do not report on educational outcomes and, in particular, do not look at how well children manage the transition into P1. Clearly, the specialist knowledge of nursery teachers, with their overview of Curriculum for Excellence and their ability to liaise closely with primary teachers, is central to ensuring that children can make a good start in school, with the lifelong benefits this brings. Edinburgh’s own policies and frameworks, in the Edinburgh Learns documents, highlight the centrality of good transitions, informed by close partnership working and a detailed knowledge of individual children’s circumstances and their learning. This cannot be replicated by teachers who act as “consultants” across many nurseries. It requires teachers working closely with the children, their families, other professionals, and the relevant primary schools. This problem is likely to be particularly acute when supporting children with additional needs. If we are serious about inclusion, and about Getting It Right for Every Child, then specific, individualised transition plans, that have a clear focus on learning and teaching, are essential, and these are something that require the specialist input of teachers.\nStandalone Nursery Schools with Head Teachers\nThe Care Inspectorate highlighted City of Edinburgh’s nursery schools in its recent publication My World Outdoors (2016)\n‘Many of the original child gardens continue to this day, still run by Froebel-trained headteachers. These nurseries consistently achieve high grades from the Care Inspectorate and were recently highlighted as examples of best practice by Professor Siraj’s recent Independent Review’ (My World Outdoors, 2016)\nThe standalone nursery schools, Balgreen, Cameron House, Greengables, Hope Cottage, Liberton, St Leonards, Stanwell and Tynecastle, led by nursery head teachers, drive quality across the authority, with 72% of Care Inspectorate gradings at Grade 6. It must be remembered that Grade 6 indicates “outstanding or sector leading”.\nCurrent City of Edinburgh Care Inspectorate Gradings\n| Setting | Grade 6 | Grade 5 | Grade 4 | Grade 3 |\n| Nursery Schools | 72% | 28% | ||\n| Primary School Nursery Classes | 8.5% | 68% | 21% | 2.5% |\nThis is significantly higher than in other local authorities\n| Local Authority | % Grade 6 |\n| Edinburgh | 14.7% |\n| West Lothian (had teachers until last year) | 5.3% |\n| Moray | 3.4% |\n| West Dunbartonshire | 1.3% |\n| Highland | 0.8% |\n| Borders | 0.55% |\nThis level of quality, where Edinburgh recognised as leading some of the best practice in Scotland, is more than likely to be lost if the nursery schools are subsumed into the local primary.\nContribution of Nursery Head Teachers\nCity of Edinburgh\n- Teaching on the Edinburgh Early Learning and Childcare Academy for Modern Apprentice and Trainee Early Years Practitioners. Currently 90 students and 60 more to start in August 19.\n- Delivering CPD – Teachers New to Nursery, SEAL, Aspiring Leaders, Developing Quality Environments, Block Play, Self-Regulation and more\n- Working groups – Head Teacher’s Executive, Additional Support for Learning, developing planning and tracking guidance and formats.\n- Practice visits for staff\n- Board member of the South East Regional Improvement Collaborative\nUniversity of Edinburgh in partnership with City of Edinburgh\n- Teaching on the Froebel in Childhood Practice certificate – 7 courses across Scotland – currently 300 students\n- Practice visits – sharing excellent practice with practitioners from across Scotland.\nWider impact\n- Leading practitioner research projects\n- Contributing chapters to Early Childhood education books and journals\n- Recognition of impact in national documentation, i.e. Care Inspectorate’s Our Creative Journey, 2017 and My World Outdoors, 2016; the Scottish Government’s workforce review.\n- Jane Whinnett (HT at Balgreen and Hope Cottage) has recently received an MBE for her services to Early Childhood Education.\n- Organising conferences – 10th conference took place in 2018 and had 550 delegates at the Assembly Rooms.\n- Speaking at national and international conferences and seminars\nImpact of Proposals\n- At a time of early years expansion, it will be impossible to replace 80 nursery teachers by August.\n- Losing 80 staff may undermine the ability of City of Edinburgh to deliver their expansion plans by 2020.\n- Quality is already under threat due to the expansion and removing the most highly qualified staff from nursery classes will have a significant impact on attainment and closing the gap.\n- Due to the pace of change, all early years’ staff are under significant stress. The impact of these proposals is already having a negative impact on morale and levels of sickness absence.\n- The plans to re-deploy nursery teachers to primary classrooms is of concern. Nursery teachers have chosen to specialise in Early Years pedagogy. Teaching in a primary classroom is completely different to teaching in nursery. Some have not taught in primary classes for over 20 years. There is likely to be a significant requirement for re-training, particularly for staff whose classroom teaching experience pre-dates Curriculum for Excellence. This will have a negative impact on children’s outcomes.\n- Although there is not a straightforward correlation as models and quality of support varies amongst local authorities, Care Inspectorate gradings are likely to be negatively affected by taking teachers out of nursery classes and replacing them with staff qualified to a lower level. As we know from the EPPE project, level of qualification has a positive impact on the quality of learning and on outcomes for children.\n- Removing nursery head teachers, will have an even greater impact on high quality practice and will likely result in City of Edinburgh losing its sector leading status.\n- It has been proposed that there will be locality-based teams of teacher and head teacher peripatetic support, however, there is no suggestion of future proofing this model. Without the opportunity to develop skills working in a nursery classroom, it will not be long before there is a significant lack of expertise. Teachers do not like working in peripatetic teams, for example Midlothian regularly lose their Early Years peripatetic teachers to nursery classes in other Local Authorities and have found it hard to recruit. Several East Lothian nursery teachers are now working in Edinburgh rather than in the peripatetic team.\n- There will be no progression pathway for teachers in Early Years, therefore no real incentive to specialise in this area.",

In the coming decades there will be a massive need for engineers to support economic growth – there is an expected 36,800 shortfall in qualified engineers predicted by 2050.\nTo address this we have to convince more students to take STEM subjects (Science, technology, engineering and mathematics), particularly underrepresented groups.\nIn October official figures revealed there had been a fall in the number of pupils taking STEM subjects at Higher in Scotland, and a lack of progress regarding the proportion girls taking these key subjects. This is bad for Scotland’s future prosperity and it is bad for the life chances of young Scots.\nNow we find that not only has there been a decline in the number of students studying STEM subjects in Scottish Schools, but standards are declining according the respected PISA standard.\nIn mathematics Scotland has gone from 9th in 2003 to 24th in 2015. In science Scotland is now 19th, compared to 10th in 2006.

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_04_28_initial-poll-results-changes-to-10-19-bus-service_comment-page-1/content_418.html": "Update (21-05-22) – Linked here are notes from a meeting myself and David Houston (Colinton Community Council) held with Lothian Buses. I am not happy with the outcome, but I now have a better idea if of what is driving matters.\nUpdate (18-05-22) – 366 people have now responded to my survey, with just 12.9% supporting the change, 20.7% requesting further consultation and 66.d% saying they prefer the status quo.\nUpdate (30-04-22) – 323 people have now responded, with just 12.7% supporting the change, 20.4% requesting further consultation and 66.9% saying they prefer the status quo.\nInterim Results\nLothian Buses have announced changes to the 10 & 16 bus services used by many in Colinton. The key changes with be that:\n- The 10 will serve Bonaly via Colinton; and,\n- The 16 will serve Torphin via Colinton.\nDetails are here.\nThe increased service to Bonaly is to be welcomed, but it appears that some in west Colinton will pay the price for this via:\n- A slightly slower service in to town.\n- More difficult journeys to Tesco & Allermuir Health Centre.\n- Losing the bus service to Firrhill High School, Meggetland, GWC, and Edinburgh Leisure’s Craiglockhart Leisure Centre & Tennis Centre.\nThe official response to these concerns I received from Lothian Buses on this was:\nThe network alteration is intended to improve the overall service provision for both Torphin and Bonaly. The current weekday daytime frequency is 2 buses each hour to Torphin and one bus per hour to Bonaly. From the change this will increase to 5 and 3 respectively. School children and elderly customers are entitled to free travel through the Scottish National Entitlement scheme and can change buses in Colinton at no additional cost. We appreciate that journey time is a factor in many peoples decision to use public transport, however service frequency is also a massive consideration and we believe that the significant increases in frequency will be a benefit to both areas.\nLothian Buses, 27-04-22\nI found these comments to be disappointing, “free” travel should not be second rate travel! I know there are a range of views locally, so I set up a poll to better understand local opinion on this issue.\nAfter just 24 hours, I have received 237 responses with just 12.2% supporting the change, 20.3% requesting further consultation and 67.5% saying they prefer the status quo.\nWhen I read the comments from residents (listed below), however, it is clear that opinion is less divided that these statistics suggest. I could see that the consensus is:\n- The bus service should be a viable alternative to using the car.\n- The current service, and the changes proposed by Lothian Buses, don’t meet the needs of the local community.\n- Residents would welcome an opportunity to provide feedback to Lothian Buses.\nSeparately, Colinton Community Council have contacted me raising concerns about what Lothian Buses are proposing. Based on this, emails I have received, and my poll results I have therefore taken the unusual step of contacting a member of Lothian Buses’ board to request that a representative attends the Colinton Community Council meeting scheduled for the 10th of May. A publicly owned bus service should be publicly accountable.\nIf you have not done so already, it is not too late to complete my poll.\nCllr Scott Arthur\nComments from those seeking consultation on the changes.\n- If the council want us to be more environmentally conscious when travelling in the city, they should invest more in public transport to benefit all residents, not just those who live near the tramlines.\n- The current route is better than the proposed route for reasons outlined in your post, but understandable that the bus company might need to make changes for economic reasons. A consultation would be a good middle ground to find out what the customers need. “\n- I think the 10 should cover both Torphin and Bonaly as one bus route and the 16 should remain as is.\n- Prior to lockdown I used the 10 Torphin daily to get into town or to Haymarket station via 10&4. But I also use the shops at Oxgangs Broadway & Morningside a lot so connect onto the 16. I now have to walk back most of the time from Westgarth on my return as the 10 timetable is reduced plus delayed by tram and road works so usually have to wait ages for a connection. So an alternating 10 and 16 with good frequency would be great. A major consideration I think is to ensure we keep a bus going up to Tipereth to allow service users access to independent travel and for the staff, many of whom I think are gap students on low income so not likely to have their own car. Also, don’t forget Braidburn pupils. In their senior years some undertake independent travel training so would rely on a 10 to get to or from school.\n- The reduction in frequency in the 10 since lockdown is an issue now that office working is back in place for many. Access to the local services is a must, and the ‘slightly longer’ journey on the 16 is considerable when getting to work in the morning, with adjustments to childcare now a concern that many will have to consider.\n- Our children travel to school on this service and will now find it harder to travel safely and increase the time to get to school. Hugely disappointing!\n- I like the frequency of the 16 servicing Torphin and it makes sense to extend this service. But we also need the bus to go to Firhill and Watsons for school children. Some people living here may also have bought their house because they could use the bus to get to work thus reducing car use. So we also need the 10 to Torphin. If we HAD to choose I would keep the 10 as it is but would prefer a blended approach.\n- I would like to know whether the no16 route is going to change beyond the extension to Torphin or continues it’s current route? Everyone is assuming the existing route.\n- Could the Bonaly and Torphin service be amalgamated. Up Woodhall Road, terminate at Torphin and return to the village via Bonaly ?\n- It is not about the “free” bustravel it’s about children having to now get two buses to school-the stop at Rustic cottages is busy as it is in the morning, has anyone from Lothian buses travelled the route at 8am when it’s full of school children? Has anyone from Lothian buses travelled the 16 route lately to understand the complaints about the ridiculous long journey time?\n- Streamline the 10 service to service torphin too\n- I would urge some peak time 10 torphin buses to accommodate school children travelling to Firrhill high school and commuters\n- Proposed changes to the 10 service are dreadful for city workers and school children.\n- “Surely the consideration of people in West Colinton’s needs should come into the equation not just service freqyency. There is no indication that the 16 and 10 services are going to synch and therefore there may be a considerable wait or repeated delays to get buses and connect to 10 if wanting to travel to town Craiglockhart GWC etc rather than use the slower route for the 16. Its the lack of consultation the impact on those with mobility issues or other difficulties and the older age group and impact on ability to shop or get to important venues that annoys the most.Its been a difficult time for many with the pandemic and if changes are brought in leading to further difficulties getting about when things are just starting to feel more normal and relaxed about using buses this could & probably will lead to furer isolation and social exclusion”\n- If the connection between the new 10 and 16 services are well coordinated then i have no issue\n- It is frustrating that there is a low frequency of buses, but the 16 route is very different to the 10 route. I realise it is being pointed out that people can either change buses or walk from Woodfield Avenue to Colinton village. These options all have issues, including additional cost, longer journey time, and a long walk along Woodhall Road alone in the dark will be considered a safety risk for vulnerable people. All these issues make it more likely that people will continue to choose cars as transport over buses.\n- Why not increase the number of buses?\n- Living in Bonaly I can sympathise with West Colinton residents at the proposed loss of No 10. Equally, I find current No 10 service to Bonaly quite restrictive.\n- The number 10 to Torphin is a much appreciated service and we’d be really upset to lose it. Taking the 16, or attempting to co-ordinate a change of buses, would significantly lengthen the journey into town. Surely it could be possible to plan a 10 route so that the same bus could serve both Bonaly and Torphin? It would make the journey slightly longer but would be much more convenient than travelling via Oxgangs/Braids/Morningside!\n- The removal of the number 10 will make travel into town longer via morningside (a congested route already) and will probably lead to more just using the car. The face that there has been no consultation is also very poor, likewise the fact that there is talk of proposed changes to the 16 route.\n- “Whilst i understand the need to improve services this does not feel like an improvement for the residents who use the Torphon service. Would it not make more sense to edit/combine the Torphin and Bonaly to one route as we had previously? This means that both areas benefit from an increased number of services whilst still allowing the residents to benefit from a 20 minute link to town instead of the almost 1 hour it takes on the 16.\n- I dont qualify for free travel and already have to take 2 buses to and from work. These changes would mean i needed to add another journey thus increasing my costs as well as the travel time by a a minimum of 30 mins each way as you can bet that the schedules wont match up nicely. As a key worker who has worked in healthcare throughout the pandemic the thought of adding extra time onto my already long shifts is disheartening and ultimately would presenta verydifficult decision to leave my current role or move away from Colinton.\n- For many the 15/20 minute walk to the villiage is not a hardship however on dark, wet and winter nights that has a severe impact on my feeling of safety in my local area.\n- The extension of the night bus when it began to include Torphin is invaluable so i fully respect the need for change. This simply is not the right change.\n- A final point is that a single decker 45 service cannot possibly manage the volume of pupils who rely on the no 10 to take them to school (gwc and heriots) and the bus stop at rustic cottages is dangerous at the best of time and causes massive traffic issues as it is let alone when you add multiple extra passengers. Pedestrians struggle to get past queues safely end frequently end up using the road to pass.\n- Thank you for taking the time to look into this.\n- A consultation would be best so that there is a debate on the pros and cons of services to Torphin with an outcome being a better understanding for all parties\n- Please clarify the new 16 route – imp to make a decision. Current route would add significantly to travell time\n- Can’t get to firrhill from Torphin as 16 takes you down towards Redford\n- I am not supportive of a more regular bus going down Woodhall Road which is a narrow road and has a narrow pavement (one side only at many points). This will be dangerous for young families. In addition, I do no support a change which means children will have to change bus to get to the local high school. I do not believe this is practical or in line with the council’s ‘safe routes to school’ obligation. It is impractical to take a number 16 into town as the journey time is much longer.\n- It would matter less if Lothian Buses changed the pricing structure to accommodate that bus changes are required as a result of route changes. Not everyone gets free bus travel so whilst we all need to be flexible about changing buses to make a journey not served by a direct route, we should not be penalised financially for doing so. In London the travel system accommodates changes required but here you are penalised if your single journey for a day turns into two buses being taken, never mind the wait times to connect.\n- At least some torphin 10s should be retained, especially during rushour when the 16 will be far too slow.\nComments from those in favour of the status quo\n- Definitely makes it more difficult for our kids to get the bus directly to school.\n- My son uses Craiglockhart gym regularly and will now need to get 2 buses there.\n- Longer travel time to get to work.\n- Feel that Lothian buses have made no attempt to consult with local residents.\n- Have bus times been coordinated if we choose to get a 16 into the village then transfer to the 10 then?\n- Cost implications!\n- I have a teenage daughter that uses the 10 everyday from the west mill stop to get to school – this ‘straight past firrhill’ service is cut out with the proposed change\n- The proposed changes will increase our commute to work in town. It will also impact our daughter when she moves to high school.\n- The detour through Morningside on the number 16 is a step back. Has anyone thought of the school children?\n- If the service has to be changed could we at least keep a more direct route into town at peak times. As the crow flies the 16 route isn’t much longer but the trawl through Morningside traffic takes much longer and doesn’t allow for quick transport to Napier, Craiglockhart, Meggetland and Polwarth.\n- The present service works well. What is being proposed might increase the frequency but if it doesn’t serve what customers need it is totally pointless!\n- Kids use no 10 to get to school, they can’t use a no 16\n- The 16 is too long and indirect to be considered a realistic option for those who live in colinton and get the bus to work. Also not ideal for school children – yes they can get too buses but the the waiting time in between makes this very inconvenient\n- This change means we have no direct access to our local high school, our commute to work will be 20+ minutes longer (both based in centre of town) and I see no benefits to the new system\n- If it ain’t broke don’t fix it!\n- Mental\n- These proposed changes show little understanding of the needs of the community. Frequency of service has never been an issue for those in West Colinton – easier public transport to schools, GP services, supermarkets etc. is far more important. The proposed changes significantly impact on these, particularly for younger families and older people. These changes would make most journeys less convenient and are likely to discourage use of public transport, therefore (cynically) allowing LRT to argue for reduced services in future. The lack of any consultation over the changes is particularly galling – LRT should be responsible to the community that pays for them.\n- The current service provides a direct and efficient route for commuters into the city centre, direct access to local secondary schools, sports facilities and supermarkets. The proposed changes are not an appropriate alternative. What evidence has been used to support these changes and what consultation and impact assessment has been undertaken with passengers or disability groups. I thought the policy was to improve bus services not make them worse. This will inevitably force people back into their private cars snd cause parking issues elsewhere in the network. Very very frustrated.\n- We live at torphin terminal. This will leave the kids with no easy bus route to school at firrhill nor all their after school activities at meggetland or craiglockhart Edinburgh leisure – their two lnearest sports facilities. We will almost certainly use the car more as a result. If change must be made then the number 10 should be re routed and cover both bonaly and torphin. There is not enough space on the number 10 home from school as it is without reducing services. It’s not so bad in the summer but we have long cold dark winters and this is a real negative step . It also defeats the purpose of their new free bus pass !!\n- Totally agree with all of the points made by the Councillor above. I would like to add that it would also affect those travelling to Colinton Medical Practice, St Thomas Aquinas , Heriots and other schools, places of work and destinations in the city .\n- It’s not going to work for me having to get the 16 into town. I work in the west end and have to get my children to child care beforehand. I will now need to drive and park at Craiglockhart as I won’t have enough time to walk into the village. The number 16 takes too long and I won’t get to work on time. Why change something that works perfectly? What about the children who need to get to Firrhill/Watsons when it’s raining and they live up Torphin bank/Campbell park? What about the elderly who use the bus for tesco and the doctors?\n- Please keep it as it is\n- This change would have a huge impact on access to schools and local amenities for the most vulnerable people in this community – children getting to school, older people, and those with mobility issues. This change would create more cars on the road. It is also a much, much longer route via Morningside into town, not slightly longer – the traffic on Morningside Road can be incredibly busy and no one commuting into town would choose the number 16 route. The current number 10 is also the best bus route to serve staff, patients and visitors to the Royal Edinburgh Hospital.\n- Either remain as it is or run no10 via Torphin and Bonaly. No access with proposed service to Craiglockhart or Meggatland,\n- I need a direct service to get to GWC\n- “I have 2 sons at Firrhill, one of whom is diagnosed with juvenile arthritis and one who is waiting a possible diagnosis. Both are fit and independent boy, however they have periods of time when they have difficulty walking. The no 10 is essential for them for independence and ease of access to school. Changing buses would be hard when you’re finding it difficult to walk.\n- The No10 provides an essential direction connection to the city centre and is much used and loved in this community. “\n- I travel to GWC for work. This new service means I would have a considerable walk at each end of my journey which I find completely unacceptable. The time involved is grossly unfair for work travel. The idea of getting two buses for such a short journey is ridiculous.\n- Would prefer the current service to continue but would also be happy with consultation over any proposed changes.\n- Will make the bus less appealing both for my kids travelling in to Heriot’s and my husband commuting into Central Edinburgh for work. Disappointed. Grateful if pressure can be applied on our behalf.\n- Increased frequency only helps if it makes journeys more convenient, the proposed changes have the opposite impact.\n- “We will use car and van transport much more.\n- This change will make the trips to school and sports activities more dangerous. “\n- I travel from Woodfield Avenue to Polwarth. I will now be unable to make this journey, and my kids will be unable to take the bus to Firrhill high school. It wouldn’t be so bad if we could board the Bonaly bus at Grant Avenue, however if I were to do this I’d be told to get off the bus at Bonaly store as well as paying 2 bus fares. This change is not helpful at all. Not everyone is travelling into the city.\n- “I work in Leith Street. The length of journey on the number 16 bus route is ridiculous. I do not qualify for a free bus pass and should not have to take 2 buses to get into town nor pay for 2 extra buses per day. It can already take nearly an hour to get to Leith Street on a 10, any longer is just unacceptable.\n- My son is at school at Firhill HS. No direct bus route to his school is again ridiculous. There’s absolutely no need to change the No 10 Torphin. Lothian Buses have not given any thought to how this change will affect so many people trying to get to work and school “\n- “It is very disappointing that a perfectly good bus service is being changed without any consultation with the local residents.\n- I have lived in Colinton for over 20 years and my children used the 10 bus service to reach their school at Tollcross. Local children going to the same school will now have to walk to Bonaly Avenue to catch this bus. I personally took the 10 bus through Bonaly this morning at 8.45am. It was horrendous due to the bus, moving cars, pedestrians and parked cars, especially coming down Dreghorn Loan. Basically it just all comes to a stop. Whereas the bus has much better, safer and quicker route coming down from Torphin along Woodhall Road.\n- Has anyone actually examined the Number 10 driving round Bonaly at rush hours? “\n- Definitely think it would be much worse if no number 10 coming to colinton as that is how our family travel to work and school just now and this would cause major disruption and delay on getting to our destination taking the 16.\n- I use the number 10 to get to work (GWC) and my daughter’s nursery. The extra time to swap buses or walk to a further bus stop will be a big impact on our day to and from work/nursery.\n- Cutting off part of a community. Will have to take the car to get my two children to nursery now in Craiglockhart. It is not free for me or feasible with working in town (to then get on THREE buses to work then THREE home) to take two children on two buses in the morning to nursery when there is a 10 bus stop outside my door that services is perfectly fine.\n- No doubt Lothian Bus Co will disregard customer comments\n- These changes remove frequency of provision to areas people actually need to go to. A service 16 from Torphin is a service of no use to man nor beast and actually makes the provision of a service much worse than we currently have.\n- Removal of the 10 to Torphin means a direct route to town would require 2 buses, and therefore increased cost, or else walking all the way to the stop at the doctors surgery. The 16 is a circuitous route that takes much longer and is not desirable as an alternative\n- My child gets the bus to and from Oxgangs Primary school every day from Woodfield Avenue and changes will result in a lot more added stress and worry for us as he will have to walk to Bonaly on his own or change buses.\n- The proposed change would make it hard for my son to get to Firrhill High and for me to get into town for work. Getting two buses or walking twenty minutes to Bonaly is not ideal especially in the winter.\n- Why would you create a bigger problem with traffic in our city as with these new change’s,more people will drive . This city is already behind our counterparts with its transport system, we are a joke\n- I’m so disappointed with the proposed change it will have a massive impact on me and probably result in me having to drive to work rather than get public transport.\n- 16 is a very long route and won’t help firhill\n- I am very happy with both the frequency of the number 10 torphin bus, and the route – it is the quickest route to city west end that i use for work. I have no need at all to catch a 16 bus to morningside – it takes so long, and does not pass any places i use the bus to go to. I catch the bus to work, but i am part time and is not cost effective to get a bus pass. I am a busy working mother and i only just have time to run for the 10 torphin bus at woodfield ave stop in the mornings as it is – i literally could not get to work on time if i had to walk 20mins to westgarth ave stop, or faff about catching a 16 and waiting for the timetable to match and changing for a 10 (its ludicrous!). I am actually really worried what i am going to do, as my office are now asking all staff to come into the office, but i just cant squeeze that in around school hours and journey times if this goes ahead. As for an increased frequency along woodhall road, i dont want it, the paths are very narrow and the busses go too fast – it just increases dangers for primary children walking to bonaly primary and back (which are already a local concern). The 16 bus will be empty on the extended torphin section – i dont know of anyone who would use it (not regularly, like for work/school, which are the main journeys the number 10 is used for daily). It makes no sense at all! If lothian busses want to ‘streamline’ their services i can not understand at all why the 10 service can not simply go around bonaly, then up to torphin, turn around and go back around bonaly! – it would not miss any stops, and in my opinion it makes much more sense for the bus to wait, change drivers etc up at torphin, where there is a big turn around (it is much better than the current place the 10 bonaly bus waits outside the bonaly corner shop totally in the way of cars in a busy area by the primary school). The number 10 bus is the bus that serves colintons amenities, it goes past colinton dr surgery, allurmuir health centre, firhill and george watsons schools, both napier university campuses, sports facilities at craiglockhart tennis club, thistle tennis club, meggetland, the local supermarket at tescos, the parish churches, the scout hall…. all the places local residents want/need to go to. The 16, well that just goes around the houses over morningside via redford and just is not a useful route at all. I never catch the 16 from princes street, it takes double the journey time to colinton, over an hour – even as a night bus, its just so long, i rarely use it. I hope this decision is reversed, it makes NO SENSE. There is no neccesity to have more frequent buses up at torphin, it will be empty, 5 buses an hour to morningside! – what is the justification by passanger numbers for that!, but taking away the 10 torphin service, a really useful well used local service that serves the local community/amenities/area is the opposite of what the council say they want people to do (which is make more people choose local journeys on public transport!!!!!). I am very unhappy. I will add that there is a huge disbelief about this decision in my local street whatsapp group (woodfield avenue) – the woodfield avenue number 10 torphin bus stop is always busy at commuter times (every day at least 15 wait at that stop).\n- There is absolutely no need to make changes to either service.\n- This proposed change will cause our household to drive more to save time & get where we need without time delays\n- This change is a massive detriment to the residents of Colinton/Woodfield. The children cannot get direct bus to school, many people will have huge changes to their work commute. The no 16 coming up to Torphin does not add anything to the service. The current number 10 is an extremely popular service that many residents rely on\n- I believe the school kids should have access to get to school or the local fitness centre without having to get two buses. Elderly people struggle a lot to get one bus without added confusion to doctor surgeries or Tesco. I would think of moving from this part of Colinton if it does not change.\n- This proposed change is very disappointing and would make the bus service much less useful to me and my family (I live on Torphin Road). The 16 route doesn’t go to the places we frequently visit and the significant added journey time would encourage me to drive rather than take the bus – which is really not what we should be aiming for either from a congestion or environmental point of view.\n- the 10 is a far more direct route and with kids at high school this is the best option when they don’t walk. I don’t have an issue with the 16 going to Torphin as this would improve access to morningside etc but in addition to the 10 not instead of. Saying the school kids can swap bus in the village is ridiculous as they would have to wait twice as it is unlikely that the busses will align time wise.\n- The proposed changes will have a seriously detrimental effect on my ability to continue with normal activities including staying healthy through use of the gym.\n- Lack of transport for school children is a significant concern as this is a very family orientated area.\n- If we do have to have the 16, could they send a 10 to Torphin once an hour?\n- There will be no bus for those travelling to George Watson’s. For some this will mean driving, but for some parents who work early it will mean children having to walk 5 miles into school!\n- The current number 10 route provides a direct practical route to key area such as firhill Craiglockhart Watson and can be in prince’s Street in 30 minutes. At rush hour the 16 takes 20 minutes longer into town. These changes will simply put people off using the bus. Is there any evidence for anyone asking for these proposed changes?\n- The no 10 from Torphin is the preferred route by most who use it to go to Craiglockhart, various schools and the West End. The no 16‘s route is not a substitute for this, especially during week days\n- “Most ridiculous decision ever by LBs.\n- Those most impacted are our young & old – but that’s OK according to LB, they don’t pay. Utterly disgraceful response and badly thought out. The changes effectively cut of the west side of Colinton from the most efficient route to town and our core catchment schools (Firrhill & Watsons) and adding significant journey times for Heriotts.\n- Was there a groundswell of objections to the Torphin 10, and demand for change from residents? No.\n- There was/is no issue with frequency.\n- “”If it ain’t broke……”””\n- The number 10 needs to be kept as it is to provide high school children with a safe and effective service to their education\n- I would like the present service with increased service provision. However if that’s not possible, then increased volume of buses is likely better in the long run, I do agree that the 16 route to town takes longer therefore it’s a less preferable option for many. However you can walk to the 10 in a short amount of time. Another option would be a “”combo”” ticket for Colinton allowing people to swap for the last section if they don’t feel they cant walk the last section with increased volume of buses this might work well. Finally your survey is rather frustrating as it doesn’t represent the options particularly well. It would be good to understand more details on the logic of the 10+ 16 swap.\n- It seems to me a hotch potch approach. The 10 service as is from Colinton to town centre is largely excellent and a flagship for Lothian buses. Surely extending the 16 to incorporate the Bonaly loop is better if costs have to be cut?\n- Half of Colinton will double commuting time or double costs and time if changing buses.\n- The proposed change is not a way to get people back to work, back to shopping or eating out or away from cars. Please rethink.\n- Local children use this service to get to and from school safely.\n- Could alternate the No10. Between Colinton and Torphin and the same with the 16. Gives both options. Not increasing frequency but maybe compromise.\n- The service is excellent at present. The 16 takes a much longer route into town so people will be less likely to use it.\n- Thank you for trying to sort this out Scott\n- Foe efficiency gains, I understand if you need to cancel no 10 Bonaly route, after all its a short walk to the no 16 bus.\n- This change will seriously inconvenience people living in parts of Colinton. The impact on the elderly will be significant. Free travel should not mean a second rate service.\n- These “improvemens” will almost double the journey time to the centre of Edinburgh !\n- To encourage reduction in car travel, Lothian buses should be increasing service level not making it harder. Connections to schools, sports facilities, supermarkets are essential and should be serviced more than they currently are – not less. I’d rather remove the free travel to ensure the services are as efficient as possible.\n- “This as a terrible move for commuters and school children. The No16 takes far to long to get into the city Center and many relying on this service will add an extra hour on there day traveling or two more bus journeys to try and cut the time slightly.\n- I would like to see the No10 servicing as it always has.”\n- The 10 service to Torphin is essential. The number of children that use that service everyday to access all the schools on route has is amazing. If you remove this service all the children at the Torphin end of the route will be stranded. The car congestion this will create will be huge making the junction at Woodhall road and Bridge road extremely congested as the 16 route does not serve the population in this area. This is totally illogical. Please do not do this.\n- The loss of no 10 overall frequency in this area will increase car use . No 16 is not a useful route to serve the area\n- As a regular user of the 10 from torphin bank into town for work this would materially impact my daily travel. Also my family regularly use the service for shopping at tesco and to go to and from craiglockhart. Our children are also not far off going to Firhill High and lack of servive there would be a problem. These changes have no real positives for us from what I can see.\n- The change means school children cannot get to school…so the free bus pass is rather meaningless.\n- In a time when we are being encouraged to use public transport, I feel this change will force local residents to use the car to make essential journeys!\n- At present Lothian buses provide a great service, why alter a good service?\n- For the distance involved, it seems ridiculous to suggest that using two buses to get from eg Torphin to Firrhill is convenient or constitutes an improvement…\n- “Residents in the Torphin area including secondary school children will no longer have a direct journey to Firrhill High School, Tescos, Craiglochart Sports Centre and Meggetland. I know you can jump off a 16 and jump on a 10 but not all residents have free bus travel. Also the possibility of standing in the rain/snow waiting for your 10 connection\n- The journey time for Torphin residents going into the city centre will also increase. The proposed new route takes you through the bottle necks of Commiston, Morningside and Bruntsfield adding a good 15 minutes onto your journey. “\n- This change will lead to more car use and be detrimental to the connection of our neighborhood to the city\n- “I have selected present service rather than consultation because I am not sure that consultation will lead to a better result. It doesn’t feel like LRT is listening to us yet.\n- I feel very concerned that LRT is proposing completely cutting the 10 service to Torphin – my family have lived here for over 25 years and historically the 10 service didn’t even go to Bonaly. People have chosen houses, flats and job based on the fast service into town and to other local facilities (e.g. Craiglockart tennis centre) and it feels very unfair that they should cut it entirely.\n- If LRT could arrange the timetable a bit more creatively so that the 16 sometimes came to Torphin, sometimes goes to Bonaly, and even sometimes just terminates in Colinton if that saves them money, that would be better, but not at the cost of the Torphin 10.\n- It would be ideal if perhaps one 16 an hour (or more) came to Torphin, and that we still had at least two Torphin 10s per hour, as at present.\n- The proposed changes mean that there will be no buses from Torphin or this area of Woodhall Road to Firrhill, Craiglockhart or Polwarth and that it will take a lot longer to get into town via the number 16 bus. The increased travel time will make it very difficult for commuters like me who only just have time to see off their kids in the morning before getting the bus to work. I choose not to own a car and use the buses very frequently to get to work and to meet friends in Polwarth or to go for appointments or to shop in town. My daughters live 35-40 minutes’ walk from Firrhill High School and this walk is difficult in the winter without a bus route. If they had to change in the village along with all the other many children who get the bus into school the pavement near the GP surgery will be dangerously overcrowded. The additional cost of changing buses for the short journey to Craiglockart or Polwarth will also put lots of current bus users off making sustainable choices and mean that they end up using their cars more, causing even more congestion in these areas. So please ensure that the number 10 continues to serve Torphin at least once or twice an hour. This would be particularly important at rush hour but I think that for everyone it is important that there is at least one bus each hour throughout the day. Before the pandemic there were at least 3 buses a day from Torphin along the 10 route.\n- Whilst I welcome there being more frequent services from Torphin via the 16 route, for the many residents who rely on the number 10 to get to work or school this change is not acceptable because the 16 route is very slow and goes via Oxgangs and Morningside and does not serve a large part of the number 10 route. I understand that LRT may need to make some economies but this could be done without cutting the route.\n- I am passionate about the great network Lothian Buses provides and about promoting active travel – if the council wishes to encourage people not to use their cars or buy new cars then it needs to ensure that we do not lose any routes. Thank you!\n- It’s really important that local residents are consulted on this, especially young people as this could impact their ability to get to school. I’d recommend getting in touch w the MSYPS for Edinburgh Pentlands – they might be good to try to talk to Lothian buses about young peoples views.\n- Please keep at least one no 10 service hourly! Our family (small children, teenagers, working-age people and pensioner) use this bus a lot and the 16 is a poor substitute\n- I am an older resident in Woodfield Avenue. It is very difficult to take a car into the city of Edinburgh, and very difficult and expensive to drive or park almost anywhere in the central or peripheral parking zones. So far I have not mastered the Ring go system. I therefore use the buses to go to Into Edinburgh or Bruntsfield, etc.utilising my wonderful bus pass (thank you for that) I can walk a reasonable distance but have moderately severe osteoarthritis, and have had two total knee replacements. Taking the number10 bus to Torphin is a great relief compared with a Number 10 Bonaly bus. In addition, I would like to draw to your attention that any children and young people attending Firrhill High school, the catchment High School, can take the number 10 from Torphin/Woodhall area directly to school. If the weather is inclement ( wet) they should not be expected to walk a long way before attending school therefore sitting in wet clothes and shoes all day. There are no lockers or changing facilities for outdoor clothes at Firrhill Secondary.\nComments from those that support the changes\n- Due to the previous infrequent service to Bonaly we drove to Westgarth Ave for a better choice of service, polluting the air for a short journey. Those in the Torphin area can use the 16 to the village and transfer to the no 10 which will still allow access to Firhill and other amenities.\n- Happy with increased frequency of both\n- I live in East Colinton/Bonaly so can only see a benefit of this change to me personally.\n- I live in Bonaly so the increased frequency of the 10 is welcomed.\n- Good for people in Bonaly, while not good for those in Woodhall / Torphin.\n- Your commentary leaves me with the impression that you’re not really bothered by Bonaly residents or their needs, an impression you’ve given me on a number of occasions. The current bus service to Bonaly is woeful, especially given we live up a steep hill. Three services an hour for Bonaly might actually make the bus a viable alternative to driving. [Note from Scott – In my election address I give a specific commitment to “Protect and improve the number 10 bus service, particularly at peak times and in the evenings” and have been working with Bonaly residents for some time on the issue. ]\n- You will never please everyone but a more frequent service must be a plus! The 16 route gives direct access to Morningside/Bruntsfield for banking, supermarket, cinema etc and would also give access to the No5 at oxgangs going to Newington for Queens Hall etc.\n- You will never be able to please everyone but a more frequent service must be a plus.\n- This will give a more frequent service and will enable easier travel to Morningside etc. for shops, banks, restaurants etc. No easy answers!\n- At the moment, despite what Lothian Buses have assured me isn’t happening, Bonaly only has one bus per hour between morming and evening rush hour. All the rest go to Torphin. This isn’t acceptable. Going back to every second bus coming to Bonaly would seem to be the best option for everyone.\n“\n“",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2024_02_24_briefing-collapsed-culvert-at-cameron-toll/content_125.html": "Below is a briefing from Council Officers on the collapsed culvert at Cameron Toll. It looks like the road will remain closed until the 10th of May.\nIntroduction\nOn 13 February during an unrelated inspection of the rail bridge, a partially collapsed culvert was identified below the road near Cameron Toll Railway Bridge and this has required closure of the roundabout between the Peffermill Road and Old Dalkeith Road arms of the roundabout.\nThe culvert carries the Pow Burn below this part of the roundabout and spans 3.6m. Most of the culvert is masonry and believed to be more than 200 years old, but under the footpath and central roundabout verge are concrete sections which were constructed more recently.\nExploratory works were immediately undertaken on the day of the collapse to expose and inspect the remaining structure. Due to the condition of the remaining length of masonry culvert, localised repairs would not be economical, and likely result in further regular disruption.\nA decision has therefore been made to replace the masonry section of culvert, a 10m long section running approximately between kerb lines.\nProgress to date\nMultiple utilities (including a water main, sewer and communications cables) cross over and through the culvert which makes its replacement more challenging. The culvert is also in the vicinity of the Cameron Toll Railway Bridge and railway embankment, and therefore approval from Network Rail is required for the works.\nUtility pipes running through culvert Pow Burn below roundabout\nA contractor has been appointed and precast concrete culvert sections have been sourced. Proposals have been submitted to Network Rail and their approval is awaited. Some in-situ concrete work to facilitate the services and tie the new culvert into the existing concrete sections is required, and a designer has been appointed for this aspect.\nTraffic Management remains in place which diverts vehicles via Peffermill Road, The Wisp, and alternative signed routes.\nThe Council has already utilised the emergency closure to replace some road gullies on the roundabout, and subject to the programme for the culvert replacement, may also be able to undertake additional surfacing works.\nNext steps\nThe contractor, Story Contracting, will be mobilising on site on Monday 4 March. Due to the Network Rail approvals and material lead-in times, an earlier start date would just result in unproductive standing time.\nThe works will then involve the following, utilising some weekend and night working:\n- Installing over pumping equipment to divert and pump the watercourse over the road, to create dry working conditions.\n- Removal of the remaining masonry culvert.\n- Preparation for installation of the precast units, then installing these (weighing over 6 tonnes each) using a crane.\n- Creating the in-situ concrete sections by installing formwork, reinforcing steel bars, and pouring concrete, in multiple stages to work around the services. This is one of the smallest parts of the job, but one of the most time consuming due to the concrete curing periods.\n- Backfill, reinstatement and resurfacing, in advance of re-opening of the road.\nThe footpath adjacent to the site is currently open, however as the culvert passes under this footpath, it will need to be closed for most of the duration of the works, and pedestrians will be required to walk around the other side of the roundabout to travel between Peffermill Road and Old Dalkeith Road.\nRe-opening\nThe works are expected to take up to 10 weeks, resulting in the road re-opening by Friday 10 May. The team will endeavour to improve on this date due to the recognised importance of this route, however it is vital that a well-engineered solution is constructed safely.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_08_26_lets-stand-up-for-the-cops-in-our-capital-and-demand-that-they-have-the-funding-they-need-to-keep-us-safe/content_619.html": "The 2016/17 crime data published by the Scottish Government show that Edinburgh has the fourth highest crime rate in Scotland – it is 31% above the national average. In response to that, police numbers have been cut and officers have been moved out of the Edinburgh Division and into centralised functions.\nThere are Councillors in Edinburgh that say this is not good enough, and there are those that choose to defend the Scottish Government’s record rather than stand up for our Capital. They claim crime in Scotland is at a 43 year low, but they fail to mention that crime is falling fast across the western world and that there was a 12.25% rise reported in sexual crime last year.\nAlthough the crime rate is above average and police numbers are being cut, it is worth noting that the Council actually gives Police Scotland £2.6m per year – that’s 10 times more than any other Council. That’s right, the Council is taking money out of schools, roads and social care to support the Police when it should be fully funded by the Scottish Government. Most recently this included buying four motorbikes for Police Scotland – one of which has travelled just 400 miles since April.\nIn my own Ward, the £2.6m pays the wages of two diligent officers who work tirelessly to keep the community safe. However, as far as I am concerned, they should be funded by the Scottish Government – not my Council Tax.\nAlthough the Council is working hard to ensure we get good value from that £2.6m, Senior Council Officers can’t guarantee me it is being well spent.\nSo let’s stand up for the cops in our Capital and demand that the Scottish Government give them the funding they need to keep us safe. I’m not talking about reopening closed Police Stations or putting “Bobbies on the beat”, I am talking about enabling them to meet the needs of the public without handouts from the Council.",

I am concerned that CEC proposes presenting solutions to Community Councils and residents with the aim of gaining feedback. I feel a better process would be to engage with residents/businesses to understand what they feel the challenges/opportunities are, and then use the outputs to generate designs for feedback.\nI have also raised concerns as it appears that only those residents living on the Lanark Road will have a say. I feel this should be expanded to include businesses and addresses on adjacent streets.\nUpdate – At the foot of this blog is a Q&A section on this briefing.\nUpdate – At the foot of this blog (after the Q&A section) I have included the slide pack that will be the “starting point” for discussions with Community Councils.\nBriefing\nAs you will be aware we recently completed a consultation exercise on the potential retention of Spaces for People measures. This was followed by the publication of the report on keeping these measures, which was considered at the meeting of the city’s Transport and Environment Committee on 17 June. The decision to retain or remove measures was based on consultation results, independent market research, a review by technical officers and consideration of how well such changes fit with the Council’s long-term transport policy objectives.\nAt this meeting it was agreed that a final decision on moving forward with the schemes should be made at the 24 June meeting of the City of Edinburgh Council.\nCouncil motion on Lanark Road\nThe Council voted to approve the report, with requests from Councillors to revisit the infrastructure and design of the Lanark Road corridor. Officers have been asked to engage with Lanark Road residents and local Community Councils to:\n- achieve cycle speed mitigation measures\n- reconsider parking provision where parking spaces sit outside protected cycle lanes, with a view to mitigating potential conflict and safety concerns as soon as practicable on the ground\nTo help us make more informed decisions, we are also currently monitoring traffic through the area, using cross-modal counters. You can read the full motion here.\nWe are now commencing with the required engagement with Community Councils and Local Residents – this engagement will take place over the coming weeks through the following means.\nMeeting with Community Councils\nCouncil officers are now developing proposed revisions to the cycle lanes on Lanark Road which aim to address concerns regarding cycle speed, and conflict at floating parking bays. We will discuss these proposals with representatives from the relevant Community Councils and have invited two representatives from each to attend an online discussion forum next week. At this meeting we will present a number of proposed changes and seek feedback and input on cycle speed mitigation and parking provision.\nResidents’ survey\nThe outcomes of this meeting in terms of proposals will be detailed in a survey on the Council’s website, which will be circulated to residents on Lanark Road via letter drop. This will allow us to gather a good sample of opinion in the local area in relation to the changes proposed.\nThe results of survey will help us to mitigate the concerns which have been voiced regarding this scheme and will sit alongside the results from the previous consultation when elected members decide on whether this scheme should be retained in the longer term.\nFollow up meeting with Community Councils\nAhead of the publication of the report in early September, and following the resident survey, we will reconvene the same group of Community Councils to discuss the findings from the survey. At this meeting officers will present a summary of the feedback from the Survey and outline officers proposals to be considered at the September meeting of the Transport and Environment Committee.\nWe hope that you find this information useful, please let us know if you have any questions.\nQuestions and Answers\nQ. I am concerned that CEC proposes presenting solutions to Community Councils and residents with the aim of gaining feeding. Would a better process not be to engage with residents/businesses to understand what they feel the challenges/opportunities are, and then use the outputs to generate designs for feedback?\nA. The officers will be presenting options within the parameters of the approved motion to generate discussion. This is not a definitive or closed option list but provides ideas of what could be changed to address the points in the motion. Following the Community Council meeting and resident survey the information gathered can be considered and proposals changed.\nQ. It also appears that only those residents living on the Lanark Road will have a say. Can this be expanded to include businesses and addresses on adjacent streets?\nA. This will include businesses within the attached plan. This has been expanded from the original letter drop area.\nQ. Please could you confirm with which Community Councils you are engaging and will elected members receive the final summary and feedback in advance as well as the CCs?\nA. We have invited the following Community Councils: Balerno, Currie, Juniper Green and Baberton Mains, Colinton, Craiglockhart and Longstone. So far we have received confirmation that Juniper Green and Baberton Mains CC and Longstone CC will be in attendance. Elected members will receive the full summary in advance of the TEC.\nQ. Is the letter drop to the same addresses that received notification of the initial works?\nA. We are increasing the letter drop area as per the attached plan. This adds in adjacent streets up to 100-150m from Lanark Road and streets that can only be accessed from Lanark Road such as Hailes Grove.\nQ. And, so I am clear, is the survey both postal and electronic through website?\nA. The letter that will be sent out will provide details of how people can request a paper copy of the survey so it is accessible to people who do not have the internet or who are not familiar or do not like using web based surveys.\nQ. Is the survey subject to market research or any weighting and is it all “in-house” or are other agencies involved?\nA. The survey is not subject to market research but is to inform officer and councillors of the residents opinions on the measures regarding the specific points of the motion and is all “in-house”.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_08_03_what-next-for-the-lanark-road-spaces-for-people-scheme_comment-page-1/content_323.html": "Today a mini-engagement activity gets underway which will help define the future of the Lanark Road Spaces for people scheme. This is happening because a recent consultation indicated that there was widespread opposition to the scheme, and that the main issue was safety.\nTo date, the public debate has been dominated by those who either strongly oppose or strongly support the scheme, and many people have been stuck in the middle. The polarisation of the debate in this way is partly due to the Council’s unwillingness to work with the local community to define the aims of the scheme, and co-design the response. The binary nature of the debate means often it can appear that we have to choose between the safety of cyclists and that of vulnerable pedestrians. The reality is that we should be focused on a scheme that treats everyone’s safety as equally important.\nWe should be aiming for zero accidents, rather than transferring the risk from one group to another (e.g. via floating bus stops!). For this to happen, however, those who either strongly oppose or strongly support the existing setup will have to compromise.\nHaving looked at the options the Council is using as a starting point (which were approved by Labour, Green, SNP, Independent, Lib Dem and Tory Councillors), the key one impacting on my Ward is just east of Gillespie Crossroads – a short section on the north side of the road between number 432 and Spylaw Park. The concern here is that there is a conflict between parents children accessing Cranley Nursery and passing cyclists. The Council is suggesting the existing lane is retained and floating parking spaces are removed (or vice versa). The existing setup is shown below.\nRemoving a short section of cycle lane here to reduce the conflict between children and cyclists has been described by one opponent as “ripping out protected cycle space in SW Edinburgh for extra on-street parking“. This is not correct as this is not a protected cycle lane (there are no bollards etc) and there will be no increase in parking. The Council’s argument for removing this short section of cycle lane is “anyone cycling on this section is likely to have cycled in from Lanark Road West and will thus likely be capable of cycling around the parking area”. There is some logic in this argument, but it clearly needs to be explored and challenged as part of the consultation.\nA second issue which the mini-engagement activity will consider is the ‘floating parking’ on downhill sections of the route. This is were the kerb and parking spaces are separated by a cycle lane (see image below). The issue here is that on the downhill sections of Lanark Road there is a risk that somebody alighting from a vehicle may be struck by a cyclist. I rode this section today, and was able to reach 24.4 mph with no real effort. The combination of my momentum and the poor running surface is potentially deadly – and there has already been an accident involving a toddler and an adult cyclist. I have spoken to the wife of the cyclist, and I understand he is strongly opposed to floating parking after his experience. It therefore appears correct, if the lanes are to stay, to consult on moving the parking to the uphill side of the road.\nI spent 2 hours (and cycled 30km) looking at the Lanark Road and Water of Leith Walkway today from Inglis Green to Balerno. There’s lots of debate about the future of both, but I hope everyone can agree the running surface on the Lanark Rd cycle lanes is abysmal! Even if the Lanark Road scheme was perfect, however, its success will always be limited.\nAt its west end the Lanark Road SfP scheme terminates just short of Gillespie Crossroads. The westward Lanark Road is too narrow to include any sort of protected feeder cycle lane (but the footpaths do need widened in places), and is not a comfortable cycling experience (see video – speeded up & normal speed). Those that proposed the scheme believed that cyclists would switch from the Water of Leith Path to the Lanark Road SfP scheme at Colinton. This probably looks great on Google Earth in some distance consultant’s office, but the hill makes it an unlikely proposition in the real world.\nAt the east end of the scheme, cyclists are dumped into the Inglis Green Road/Lanark Road/Slateford Road/Craig Lockhart Avenue interchange. This is not fun – CrashMap reports 125 accidents involving personal injuries over the past 22 years (see below).\nThese connectivity problems to the east and west are perhaps why the strongest supporters of the Lanark Road SfP refuse to say what level of usage would mean it could be called a ‘success’. Of course, there are other ways of measuring success (e.g. accident reduction) – this is something the local community should consider as part of the consultation. Indeed, a longer term plan and timeline from the Council on how Lanark Road SfP can be part of a larger cycle network would also be useful.\nOpponents of the Lanark Road SfP will point to the Union Canal Towpath and the Water of Leith Walkway as alternatives for cyclists. My view is that the Union Canal Towpath east of Meggetland should be avoided as it is at capacity. When not busy, however, it is a great route. The Water of Leith Walkway between the Union Canal and Balerno (NCR75) is good but a bell is needed (see video – speeded up & normal speed), and will get better if the plans to improve the surface are realised. Its main drawback is the lack of lighting (not easy to fix), so it does not work as a commuting route over the winter. Indeed, lone cyclists/walkers may not feel safe at any time of day/year.\nSo if there are limitations on cycling on the broad Lanark Road corridor, how do we cut congestion and reduce emissions along the route? The answer here, as for most of suburban Edinburgh, is public transport. I’d love it if people in Balerno & Currie had a safe cycling route into the city and other places of employment etc, but the reality is that if we are to tackle the climate emergency we have to look to making public transport more attractive. Once the future of Lanark Road SfP is settled, we need to give the same energy to improving public transport.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_05_01_briefing-waste-and-cleansing-service-recovery-plan-in-edinburgh/content_400.html": "Below is an update from the Council on the status of the waste collection system in Edinburgh. The key points are:\n- Recycling centres remain closed due to Government restrictions, but a plan is ready for their safe operation once they can reopen.\n- The special uplift service should return in the near future.\n- There are no plans to reopen public toilets as yet.\nBriefing\nThis briefing outlines the steps we’re taking to review and reinstate Waste and Cleansing Services during the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic. It also highlights some of the assumptions being made in the reinstatement of services, particularly any relaxation of current Government guidelines.\nA number of services were suspended during the outbreak both as a result of reductions in available staff, and the requirement to ensure physical distancing to reduce risks to collection staff. This reduced the numbers of staff who can occupy a vehicle cab. As a result, the service had to adapt and change the way in which collections were carried out.\nIt is particularly important to note that the current intention is to maintain physical distancing controls for crews until such time as we are comfortable that normal crew arrangements can be reinstated.\nIn Edinburgh, our focus was on maintaining the most critical services which were required to maintain public health, including general household waste, food collections, mixed recycling and all communal bin services.\nAbsence levels due to Coronavirus currently appear to have reached a plateau within waste collection. Staffing availability will continue to be tracked daily and forecast for the weeks ahead.\nThe following outlines the current position with regards to each of our collection services.\nKerbside and communal services\nWith the exception of blue box and garden waste collections all the remaining kerbside and communal services have been fully maintained. In some cases, across communal collections, the collection frequency has been enhanced to reflect people staying at home and generating more waste than they might normally.\nThere has been some media coverage suggesting an increase in rat/vermin sightings and reports.\nThe number of rat complaints received between 13 March 2020 and the 24 April 2020 was 27. For the same period in 2019 there were 81 requests for service.\nBlue box collections\nBlue box collections of glass were the first to be suspended. As staff numbers have stabilised over the last two weeks this service was reinstated with effect from 28 April.\nCommunications messaging has focused on residents assisting collection crews by not presenting excess glass waste outside of their boxes and instead asking residents to filter additional glass over the course of their next few collections.\nEarly indications are that we are collecting double the glass tonnage each day than would be collected under normal circumstances.\nGarden waste collection\nThose garden staff who remain at work have been used to support the core functions of collecting residual waste, mixed recycling, food and communal bins alongside allowing the service to provide additional collections to high rise properties to prevent increased fire risk.\nGarden waste collections will be reinstated in the week commencing 11 May. Relevant communications to the public have commenced. Customers are being emailed or written to in order to confirm reinstatement.\nIt is currently proposed to extend a customer’s permit to cover the number of missed collections resulting from the suspension.\nHousehold Waste Recycling Centres\nAll three household waste recycling centres (HWRCs) in Edinburgh remain closed and all HWRCs in Scotland are currently closed. This is in line with Government guidance that people should only leave their homes for defined essential activities and the provision of HWRCs is not considered by the Government to be essential at this time.\nThere has been discussion around a co-ordinated reopening of HWRCs in Scotland when the appropriate time comes to avoid any mass surge in visits to any particular Council sites should they be the first to re-open. This approach has not yet been confirmed on a national basis, although as a minimum Edinburgh are actively holding discussions with neighbouring Councils to establish their intentions.\nThe service is currently working to an assumption that the HWRCs will re-open following a relaxation of the current Government guidelines, however are awaiting further guidance.\nAt this stage we are assuming that when the sites re-open there will be a requirement for some form of social distancing to protect both customers and staff. Current proposals being considered are:\n- initially opening two of the three sites which may be defined by staff availability\n- restricting the range of materials accepted to core garden, black bag, bulky and possibly cardboard\n- restricting staff assistance to customers (to move materials to skips)\n- requiring physical distancing measures to be followed at all times and therefore restrictions on the number of customers on the site at any one time and following a one in, one out policy.\nCommunications messaging will need to focus on increased wait times and new site working arrangements to avoid additional frustration for customers. It is important to note that the way in which HWRCs operate, and the way in which customers use them, is likely to change significantly.\nWhen a reopening date is confirmed a further briefing will be provided to Elected Members and will focus on the arrangements that will be in place to protect staff and customers.\nSpecial uplifts of bulky waste\nAt the current time we are working towards a reinstatement date in the near future, although the precise date is yet to be confirmed. There is an element of direct support required from colleagues in Customer and their current working arrangements are being considered.\nOnline booking forms would likely go live one week ahead of the first job being carried out. It is highly likely we would be unable to provide assisted special uplifts (where operatives enter a person’s house to uplift) due to the obvious risks. We may also need to restrict the number of items that can be booked on one job to five rather than ten. The average number of items uplifted per job is two.\nWe normally provide ninety slots per day but can increase this if demand is excessive.\nWhilst Special Uplifts have been suspended, the staff have been providing support to Cleansing colleagues on the uplift of dumping and fly tipping. As the table overleaf shows the number of dumping/fly tipping requests/complaints has reduced when measured against the same period in 2019.\nCleansing\nCleansing functions remain reduced but have been bolstered by staff from other areas. This service continues to operate albeit in a reduced state, with a focus on emptying litter bins and removing fly-tipping. Increased focus on mechanical cleansing will require to take place once restrictions are lifted.\nPublic conveniences\nPublic conveniences remain closed. There are currently no plans to reopen these although as with all services our aim would be to do so when we are satisfied that we can provide a reliable and safe service.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_06_22_massive-faqs-list-on-the-reopening-of-schools-in-edinburgh/content_645.html": "Below are 70 frequently asked questions and answers from the Council. They cover a wide range of commonly asked questions under a series of headings:\n- Introduction\n- About arrangement for re-opening schools\n- About the curriculum and blended learning\n- About cleaning, and protective and infection measures\n- About getting to school and physical distancing\n- Childcare and support for children, young people and families\n- About support for staff\nPlease get in touch if you have any questions – Scott.Arthur@Edinburgh.Gov.UK\n1. Introduction\nWe are putting arrangements in place which will follow national guidance, physical distancing of 2 metres and hygiene regimes to keep our children and teachers safe. School rolls in Edinburgh have been rising due a growing population in the city. This means many of our schools are at capacity which makes physical distancing more difficult.\nPupils will receive a blended model (link to blended FAQ) of in-home and in-school learning. We’re doing everything we can to get to 50% by August including:\n- looking at all spaces within our schools and in other venues\n- encouraging and supporting schools to use outdoor learning as much as possible\n- talking to the Scottish Government about additional resources\n- planning for changes, for example a reduction in the 2m rule.\nYour school’s headteacher will be in contact with you before 26 June to let you know which days your child will be in school.\nWe will let you know arrangements for Early Years as soon as we can.\nThe Scottish Government proposes childcare facilities will reopen during phase 3 of the national recovery plan which should be in place before schools return. Our partner organisations are making their own plans to reopen when it is safe. We are working to make sure wraparound care services, such as breakfast and after school clubs, are open as soon as possible and we will work creatively with partners to do all we can to help.\nLetters sent to parents and carers\n1. 12 June 2020: Here is the letter sent to parents/carers from Alistair Gaw, Executive Director of Communities and Families, on pupils’ return to mainstream schools in August 2020.\n2. 12 June 2020: Here is the letter sent to parents/carers from Alistair Gaw, Executive Director of Communities and Families, on pupils’ return to special schools in August 2020.\n3. 29 May 2020: Here is a letter from Andy Gray, Chief Education Officer, updating parents/carers on pupils’ return to school.\n2. About arrangement for re-opening schools\nWhy will pupils not be going back to school full-time?\nThis is due to the need to maintain physical distancing. There will be a blend of inschool and at home learning. Pupils will spend more time in school as soon as it’s safe to do so. We are working to maximise the time children are in school and after the initial induction period from 12 August we are aiming for at least two days each week by 24 August. Our goal is to have all children back in school full time as soon as that is safe.\nSchool rolls in Edinburgh have been rising as a result of a growing population in the city. This means many of our schools are at capacity making physical distancing more difficult. We must also make sure that when pupils are in school, they receive good quality learning and teaching.\nWhen will schools reopen?\nThe City of Edinburgh Council will reopen schools on 12 August 2020. School staff will attend from 10 August. Your child’s school will provide more details to you on your child’s attendance pattern before the end of the current term on 26 June.\nWhy are children going back a week earlier than planned? What impact will this have on other holiday dates?\nThe date has been set by the Scottish Government for all schools across Scotland. All other session dates will remain the same except the summer term next year will now end on 25 June 2021.\nIs it safe for my child to go back to school? What assurance can the Council give parents?\nAll our schools are putting measures into place to make sure pupils and staff are safe and that all relevant guidance is in place and being followed. The decision to reopen schools is based on evidence that the virus is sufficiently under control. By putting measures in place to keep children and staff at a safe distance from each other and making sure everything is kept clean and hygienic, children can return safely.\nWhat will schools be like when they reopen?\nTo keep everybody safe schools will be making changes to the way they operate. We are working with our headteachers and their teams to develop new ways of working which will ensure adherence to safety protocols such as physical distancing.\nWhere physical distancing is not appropriate to the needs of children, additional risk mitigation will be in place by organising children into small groups with consistent membership. The main change will be that fewer pupils will be in school at any one time to begin with and we will have risk assessments and health and safety measures in place.\nThere will be more cleaning and other hygiene measures such as hand sanitisers and hand washing facilities to make sure schools meet the required national standards for infection control.\nWhy can’t children have more time in schools?\nWe aim to maximise in-school learning from 12 August and will continue to increase attendance as quickly as possible. Headteachers are working towards a 50% model of in-school learning, working with Government guidelines. When Government and health guidance changes, for example on physical distancing, we can increase the numbers. We aim to maximise in-school learning from 12 August and will continue to increase attendance as quickly as possible.\nWe’re doing everything we can to get to 50% by August including looking at all potential options for space within and out with school buildings and talking to the Scottish Government about any necessary additional resources. We are also planning for changes, for example a reduction in the 2m rule.\nWho will decide which children go to school and when? Can my children all go to school on the same day?\nSchools are currently planning for attendance in schools, taking into account factors such as school roll, classroom sizes, staffing and, in primary schools, family groups. This will allow sibling groups to go to primary school on the same day and with children in their own classes.\nWill the Council make a blanket decision about school time arrangements or will there be flexibility for individual schools? If no blanket decision, how will equity of education be achieved?\nSchools will plan the attendance pattern of pupils based on their own circumstances and context. The key factor is safety. All children will attend school for whole days and in Primary and Early Years children from the same family will be able to do so on the same day. Schools will advise parents of arrangements before the end of term to allow them time to plan for this.\nWhat are the arrangements for Special Schools?\nSpecial schools will open in August using a Blended Learning model. The safety of children, families and staff will be the paramount concern and we are working within current Scottish Government Health and Safety advice. Teaching will take place Mondays to Thursdays with 50% of children being in each special school at any one time. All children will attend two full days per week, or four full days per fortnight. Additional time will be offered to children of key workers as required. As and when Scottish Government guidance changes, our models will be reviewed to reflect this new guidance.\nSpecial Schools have undertaken an audit to establish the number of digital devices required to support blended learning. Blended learning approaches will include virtual assemblies, virtual circle-time and live-streaming of lessons where appropriate. Families will also be supported to access online learning and resources through the Additional Support for Learning (ASL) Website.\nTransport applications for children going to special schools are being reviewed in line with the usual process and transport will be in place from August.\nWill other premises be used for learning and teaching to support physical distancing? Will there be an opportunity to expand classrooms in school to allow more children to attend?\nWe are already planning to have as many children in school as possible, using all the space available in school settings. We are looking at additional venues and will use these where possible. There are additional risks in using non-school buildings, for example the experience can be unsettling for some children. This will be risk assessed and managed safely.\nCan school hours be changed, or can we have sessions on a Saturday to make up for time lost with teachers when pupils return on a part-time basis?\nWhile there may be an adjustment to school hours we will be keeping as far as possible to the familiar pattern of school days with in-school learning taking place Monday to Thursday. Where we can we will be keeping to the routines that children and families are familiar with. We are considering targeted support as part of the attendance patterns in schools.\nHow do schools being used as hubs throughout July prepare for the August return with facilities already being used?\nPlans are well underway to keep the Hubs open during the summer holidays and make sure schools will be ready for pupils from 12 August 2020.\nWill school meals be provided? If so, how will this be managed?\nThere will be no hot meals. If your child receives free schools meals, we will give them a packed lunch when they are in school and a direct payment on the days that pupils do not physically go to school.\nFor other pupils, we can provide a packed lunch which you will pay through ParentPay to avoid the circulation of cash. We are working on the choice of packed lunches at the moment.\nAlternatively, parents may wish to provide their own packed lunch\nWill schools be supported to make sure there are enough resources in class to prevent the need for sharing? Will children be expected to bring in their own pens/pencils etc? Can they bring in their own tablets/laptops and have access to school WiFi to help with learning?\nSchools already provide many resources for children; however, Health Protection Guidance tells us that it is safe for children to bring their own resources to school.\nThe Council is considering how we manage Digital Learning as part of Blended Learning. The current policy, and our long-term vision, is for school managed, one to one devices – but we are reassessing the risks to ensure this policy fits the new context. Over half of our learners use a Council provided, one-to-one device but we know that some families have bought devices for home learning. The decision will be in place for August and will depend on a range of factors, such as equity, safety and the extent to which digital learning is already in use.\nGiven the data coming from schools internationally and particularly in Europe as they adopt a phased return to education, will the Council look to learn from this and adopt good practice examples? What level of decision making in this respect is devolved?\nThis is something we have already been doing. Lessons learned from other countries have been shared as part of the initial planning for schools, and we will continue to do so.\nHow often will the return to school be re-evaluated? Will the part-time schooling arrangements be dropped if the statistics show that the virus is gone?\nThe Council will keep the return to schools under daily evaluation. We will continue to follow all current national guidance when considering for how long the blended model of learning and teaching will operate.\n3. About the curriculum and blended learning\nThis section focusses on arrangements for learning and teaching in City of Edinburgh schools from 12 August 2020.\nWhat will the focus be for learning and teaching during pupils time in school? Will it be on core areas like numeracy and literacy?\nThere will be a focus on teaching and feedback, with all areas of the curriculum included as far as possible. Guidance for the blended model of learning and teaching is being prepared at present, which will also include information for parents/carers. Further details will be made available as soon as possible.\nWill key workers’ children attending the Hubs be encouraged to complete their schoolwork?\nIt is intended that, after the summer holidays, key workers’ children will receive childcare. This will support families as schools will be able to plan learning and childcare together. There may be a need to offer childcare from an alternative building rather than a child’s school.\nWill all children be treated equally in terms of their access to learning? What assessment has the Council done and what does this work say the impact of this new style of teaching will be on outcomes for all pupils?\nPatterns of attendance will be dependent on the capacity of each school to make sure children can be accommodated in the building as safely as possible. There may be differences in these patterns across schools, but all schools will be making sure that all children receive the support required to access learning at home and at school. We will do all we can to make sure pupils are treated equally across the city.\nWhat is blended learning?\nBlended learning is a mix of in-school learning and learning away from school. Schools are getting their blended learning plans ready for August. This can include digital learning and homework as set and assessed by the teacher in relation to in school learning.\nThere are lots of factors which influence how it works in practice. These are:\n- the school values – these will continue to be at the heart of learning and teaching\n- the design of the curriculum – schools will be updating what and how they teach\n- the ages and stages of learners – blended learning in secondary could be different than in primary and special schools\n- the numbers of learners with digital devices and how the devices are used in school and at home\n- what the school community wants – for example more or less digital learning\n- the skills, knowledge and resources – devices, access to the outdoors, training, workshops for parents and so on.\nParents and carers will be asked about their views as schools develop blended learning plans. Parent and carers will also be asked if everything is working well as the term goes on and should always get in touch with the school to talk about any problems.\nDigital Learning is not essential for Blended Learning to work, but it helps. Since Lockdown every school in the City of Edinburgh has been making use of it. Most older primary and secondary pupils use Microsoft Teams to share learning. Younger pupils mostly use digital Learning Journals and workbooks. All schools used websites to keep in touch about learning.\nOur vision is that all learners will have a digital device that will help them learn at home or in school. Almost half of our learners have a digital device provided by their school, and more are being bought every day. We are working with the Scottish Government to provide as much as we can – especially to families living in poverty.\nDigital learning has to be safe, secure and fair. To make it work we must have teacher training, a good quality IT network and digital support. A lot of work has gone on in the background so far and there is more to be done. Next session we expect even more pupils to have live or pre-recorded lessons as part of their digital learning\nSome digital learning happens by posting lessons online, pupils uploading work and then teachers marking it. Other types include using pre-recorded video such as YouTube. Schools that use digital learning a lot might have live lessons. Often these are audio lessons, where pupils can see the teacher but not each other. A few schools have used live two-way video for lessons and check-ins and more will start to do this next session. Every Special School now has live two-way video.\nDigital learning is evolving in Edinburgh just as it is everywhere else. If your child has not yet experienced the full benefits of digital learning, it will happen. All schools are working on this right now and for next session. Two-way video on Teams has now been enabled for every special school in Edinburgh to support blended learning approaches for children with complex additional support needs.\nWith a split between time in school and home learning, what support will there be with, for example, video learning or IT kit?\nIn terms of support with for example\n- video learning (eg using Zoom/Teams/Skype/live streaming/recording of lessons)\n- improvement to technology infrastructure in schools (including WiFi)\n- provision of technology for families without laptops/tablets • support if families don’t have access to a printer schools are being supported with approaches to blended learning and they will communicate with parents and carers about these approaches.\nWill schools be supported practically and financially to provide as many opportunities for outdoor learning as possible?\nSchools will be encouraged and supported to use outdoor learning as much as possible.\nWill PE classes still take place? If not, will there be opportunities for pupils to be active and move during the school day?\nPE will be in place.\nHow will children be given the opportunity from August to learn at their own pace?\nTeachers will work with their classes to adapt the curriculum to their pupils’ needs.\nIs there an approximate amount of work (ie hours) expected to be set for each pupil for each year group?\nThe amount of work will be tailored by age and stage for pupils.\nIs there an opportunity to create and make available a more detailed forward plan (say a week in advance) of work for children for their home working to help parents/carers to plan better?\nIndividual schools will plan and communicate their arrangements to parents/carers.\nWhile schools have been closed, my child’s teacher has provided work online and they have been in touch regularly. How can teachers do this from August if they’re teaching in school as well? How will learning at home be supported?\nWe are currently reviewing the availability of teaching staff together with schools’ senior management teams and making plans to make sure that all pupils can learn effectively and make good progress, whether in school or at home.\nAny learning at home will be arranged and supported by your child’s teachers. You won’t be expected to ‘home school’ your child in the formal sense and teachers will be available to help and support your child with their learning at home. As well as the Learning Hub mentioned above, you can find lots of tips and advice, and the opportunity to sign up for a weekly newsletter, available on the Scotland Learns website, part of Education Scotland.\nHas the SQA given any indication of whether the exams will proceed next year and has there been any discussion about the possibility of pupils repeating the year if restricted attendance is in place for a prolonged period?\nThe Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) is assessing the situation with regard to qualifications and examinations in 2020/21. There have been no discussions to date regarding pupils repeating a year based on prolonged restricted attendance.\nWill parents’ evenings still take place?Your child’s teachers will continue to update you on their progress, but it’s likely that face to face meetings such as parents’ evenings will happen in different ways. Your child’s school will contact you to let you know what these new arrangements are.\n4. About cleaning, and protective and infection measures\nThis section is about safety, cleaning and other measure to help prevent spread of the virus.\nIs it safe for my child to go back to school? What assurance can the Council give parents?\nAll our schools are putting measures into place to make sure pupils and staff are safe and that all relevant guidance is in place and being followed. The decision to reopen schools is based on evidence that the virus is sufficiently under control. By putting measures in place to keep children and staff at a safe distance from each other and making sure everything is kept clean and hygienic, children can return safely.\nHow will cleaning be managed? Will this be done outside school hours to optimise pupil attendance?\nCleaning will be completed in line with the current Scottish Government and health guidance, including an enhanced cleaning regime between different groups. The main cleaning activities will take place outside school hours, but some cleaning of communal spaces and toilets will take place during the school day.\nWill there be additional cleaning/janitorial staff brought in to manage the extra cleaning requirements?\nOur Facilities Management providers are reviewing their resources and refocusing these as necessary so that cleaning is in line with the national guidance, particularly in relation to infection control.\nWill staff be wearing personal protective equipment (PPE)?\nStaff in our schools will not need to use PPE unless they would normally need to (for example, in a chemistry lesson). PPE is only needed in a very small set of circumstances. This might include where the care of children already involves the use of PPE, in which case schools will continue to make this available to staff.\nFor children whose care needs mean that additional PPE may be required for the staff working with them to keep everyone safe, individual risk assessments and plans will be drawn up in collaboration with parents and the relevant professionals working with the child. These plans will be in line with advice from NHS Lothian and Health Protection Scotland\nWill children be required to wear face masks/coverings or not? What happens if masks are compulsory and a child turns up without one?\nThe current Scottish Government guidance does not require anyone to wear a face mask in school, unless this has been identified through risk assessment, and for a particular task. Staff are provided with appropriate PPE.\nIf the government guidance around face masks changes this will be reviewed.\nWhat will the expectations for children and young people be in terms of hand washing, use of hand sanitisers and supporting infection control?\nHandwashing will be encouraged before and after any activity, such as mealtimes, break times and sporting activities. If children or young people have trouble washing their hands properly, help will be available. Where handwashing facilities are not immediately accessible, then hand sanitisers will be available. Schools will follow Scottish Government guidance.\nSomeone in our house has coronavirus symptoms – should my child come into school?\nNo. If you or anyone else in your household develops symptoms of coronavirus such as a high temperature, a new and continuous cough or a loss of/change in smell or taste, that person must stay at home for seven days. In addition, everyone else in the household must stay at home for 14 days. You can find all the information about what you need to do on the NHS Inform website.\nWill testing be available to staff, pupils and school transport people?\nSchools will follow the Scottish Government’s advice on the Test and Protect approach.\nIf a child or staff member falls ill with COVID-19 how will this be checked and what will the next steps be for detecting the spread and communicating around this? What will the deep cleaning arrangements be in this situation?\nSchools have in place contingency plans to deal with positive cases of COVID-19. The Test and Protect process will be followed. In addition, schools will have arrangements in place to isolate potentially infected areas, and arrange for the appropriate level of cleaning, in line with Health Protection Scotland guidance.\nIf classes are split and someone in that class has parents showing symptoms will all children have to isolate?\nThe Scottish Government’s guidance will be followed in schools, as well as current self-isolation rules. If a child has parents displaying symptoms, then they should selfisolate for 14 days. There is no requirement for anyone else to self-isolate, unless they have been contacted by the NHS Test and Protect service, or if they themselves have symptoms of COVID-19.\nWhat will the Council’s approach be to checking with families where there are underlying health conditions (not necessarily among children in schools, but parents or other family members)? Will this be considered as part of the planning for return to school? Will parents/carers where this is the situation be invited in to see the mitigation measures before children return to school?\nAs part of each school’s individual risk assessment, particular regard will be paid to those who fall within the vulnerable categories, as defined by the Scottish Government. Any risk assessment to support a pupil will be shared with their parent/carer.\nWhat happens if the virus recurs? Will schools have to close again?\nIf the virus gets worse after restrictions have been lifted, schools may need to close again, possibly even at short notice. These decisions will be taken based on national, expert advice and Scottish Government guidance, and your child’s school will make you aware of the specific arrangements.\nWhat happens if my child or someone else in our household is shielding?\nIf your child is shielding, they should continue to learn from home, and will be fully supported by their teachers to do so. If you have any concerns about your child returning to school, you should contact their teacher or headteacher to discuss this.\nIf a child lives in a household where someone else is shielding, you should continue to follow the latest government guidance on shielding and contact your child’s teacher or head teacher to discuss this further.\n5. About getting to school and physical distancing\nWill children sit at individual desks 2 metres apart? Could class groups be isolated from each other to avoid unnecessary social interaction? Would physical barriers be used in open plan areas to help with this? What is the possibility of the social distancing guidance being reduced to 1m?\nThe layout of classrooms will take into account physical distancing requirements. There will be a variety of methods used to make sure that groups of children are allocated to specific areas.\nOn 18 June the Scottish Government said it would review the need for two metre physical distancing. If the rules change, we will adjust the plans accordingly.\nSome children can struggle to follow rules for a number of reasons. What is the approach going to be where a child is unable to follow the social distancing rules?\nWe would expect, based on a full risk assessment, that a school will review each situation on a case by case basis and plan actions with parents, taking into account the individual circumstances. Where physical distancing is not appropriate to the needs of the children in the school, an additional risk mitigation approach will be in place which may include organising children into small groups with consistent membership, to decrease the number of interactions between different groups. Schools will try to maximise their use of outdoor space.\nHow can my child get to and from school safely (including vulnerable children)? How will drop-off/pick-up be managed to maintain physical distancing? How will this work for nursery age children?\nThere will be staggered drop off and pick up times where needed along with potential alternative entrances. Schools will advise of measures to support physical distancing at these times. We are looking at council transport for children who need this as part of planning for returning on 12 August 2020. We will give you further advice on this as soon as possible.\nWill there be support to for Safe Routes to School, to allow children and young people to walk/cycle to school safely? Where you can’t pass others safely on paths to school, will the Council put infrastructure in place?\nWe are encouraging Parent Councils to become involved in reducing the number of cars attempting to come near schools and to develop active travel plans for children.\nHow will schools give medication to children who need it during the school day while observing physical distancing?\nMedication will generally be administered as normal. Schools will follow advice from NHS Lothian regarding some procedures that should not be undertaken in school.\nHow will physical distancing/small groupings be managed in relation to children with additional support needs?\nFor some children with additional support needs, it is acknowledged that physical distancing will not be possible, e.g. if they require intimate personal care or if they are unable to understand the need for physical distancing. The risks of not being able to maintain physical distancing will be assessed and discussed with the child’s parents.\nWhere physical distancing is not appropriate to the needs of the children in the school, an additional risk mitigation approach will be in place which may include organising children into small groups with consistent membership, to decrease the number of interactions between different groups.\nWill there be physical distancing in ELC settings?\nWhen caring for younger children physical distancing is not desirable or appropriate. Our ELC settings will take other steps to ensure the safety and wellbeing of staff and children; for example, caring for children in small groups and using outdoor space more. Staff and parents/carers will still need to observe physical distancing, and therefore new arrangements may be put in place for drop off/pick up times to help with this. These measures will be based on public health advice.\n6. Childcare and support for children, young people and families\nThis section relates to childcare and support available as schools and Early Learning and Childcare (ELC) settings reopen.\nChildcare is a huge concern if children are part-time in school. What can the Council do to help?\nWe are currently engaging with parents on the implications of this and what we can do to help. We will also advise the Scottish Government what parents tell us. The Scottish Government propose childcare provision will reopen during phase 3 of the national recovery plan which should be in place before schools return. Our partner organisations are considering their own plans to reopen when it is safe to do so. We are working to make sure wraparound care services, such as breakfast and after school clubs, are open as soon as possible and we will work creatively with partners to do all we can to help.\nWill Early Learning and Childcare settings reopen in August?\nWe cannot confirm this yet. At present there is not an agreed timeline for reopening services other than the critical childcare currently being provided for key workers and other eligible children. The Scottish Government propose childcare provision will reopen during phase 3 of the national recovery plan. Childminders and fully outdoor nurseries may be able to open sooner than other settings. We appreciate this is a big concern for many parents and we will give you further details as soon as possible.\nWhat will Early Learning and Childcare (ELC) be like?\nOur Early Learning and Childcare (ELC) settings are acting on Scottish Government advice and putting in appropriate arrangements to support children. Parents/carers will be contacted by staff with more information when it is available. As a result of the epidemic the Scottish Government advised on 30 March 2020 that councils no longer have a duty to provide 1140 funded hours from August 2020. The national commitment to provide these funded hours remains in place, however full implementation of this is delayed at presentHas there been any consideration of the impact of these approaches on children and young people?\nAcross our schools there will be an overall focus on wellbeing and children, and we will monitor young people’s responses. There is guidance and support for staff on how to explain some of the measures. Educational Psychologists and Children’s Services will also work closely with schools to support best practice to maintain wellbeing and resilience.\nWill my child have the same teacher as last year?\nEach school will make its own arrangements about staffing.\nCan children be in the same group/attend on the same day as friends?\nWe cannot guarantee this, as many other factors relating to health and safety measures must be taken into account when planning.\nWhat support is being offered for children with additional support needs? Will support plans be updated to take blended learning into account?\nSome children, including children with additional support needs, may require more support to return to school or ELC settings, or may require additional support if they have a high level of vulnerability. In these circumstances, the child’s school will be in touch with parents/carers direct to discuss how best to support their return to school. The ASL Service and Psychological Services will work with schools to plan support for children with more complex needs, involving third-sector partners as required. Parents will be included in the planning process for their child and will be consulted at each stage of the plan.\nEnquire has a useful web page on what all the changes caused by Coronavirus mean for children with additional support needs.\nWhat about childcare over the summer holidays?\nYou can apply for critical child care over the summer at one of our summer hubs.\nWill Council consider offering wraparound care – breakfast and after school club to support working parents?\nLimited childcare for key workers’ children will continue throughout the summer. If you think your child may be eligible, you can find out more here.\nI’ve been asked to return to work and I’m not a key worker. What childcare will be available to me and when? Is the Council liaising with employment bodies so they can support the new proposal for teaching children and to make sure parents will not be penalised for not being able to be in work full time?\nThe Scottish Government propose childcare provision will reopen during phase 3, and partner organisations are considering their own planning to reopen when it is safe to do so. As an employer we recognise many of our staff will have childcare concerns and so we will be as flexible as possible to help them and hope other employers will do the same.\nWill external childcare arrangements be considered when allocating school places?\nIt is not possible to guarantee this, as we will have to ensure that children attend school in the patterns available to schools, based on their capacity.\nWhat about children who have Child’s Plans and are receiving child protection support having access to services previously provided in school? How will health professionals see children given physical distancing?\nAll Child and Young People’s Plans are regularly reviewed to make sure the most appropriate supports are in place at this time.\nWhat happens if children/young people don’t engage or struggle with the blended model? Is there any potential for pupils being held back a year?\nWe recognise that all children and young people will require to reconnect with school, and so the curriculum will be adapted. A focus group of children, young people and teaching staff is being formed to continue to develop blended learning approaches to fit the learning needs of all children and young people. We do not intend to take forward repeat years unless there are exceptional individual circumstances not pertinent to all children affected by school closures.\nWhat will the details of transition from nursery to P1 and P7 to S1 look like and what additional support will be given to those pupils transitioning?\nNursery to Primary 1 transition is a key focus for our schools and ELC settings, so that children at this stage have access to information about their new school and its staff. This will be completed in a variety of forms: for example, your child’s new school may produce a video to help your child become more familiar with their new school.\nAlthough children will not have had ELC for a number of months when they move into Primary 1, staff will be able to provide an environment and curriculum that suits and adapts to the needs of the children in their class. Transition arrangements will be put in place to make sure class teachers have detailed information regarding each child’s progress in learning so that they can continue a pathway suited to the child. It is also important to stress that activities that support building confidence and relationships will also be key to children successfully settling into Primary 1.\nFor P7 pupils going into S1, schools have been creatively using technology in a variety of exciting ways to prepare them as part of their transition programme. The usual processes to ensure information is appropriately shared are being followed and extra measures are in place for young people who need extra support.\nHow will the school day balance out academic and social aspects? Children and young people have missed the social interactions with their friends/opportunities to work with classmates on projects.\nPupils will work in classrooms alongside their peers and learning and social experiences will be planned by teachers and school staff in line with relevant guidance.\nMy child is worrying about going back to school – how can I help them?\nIt’s understandable that your child may be worried about going back to school after spending so much time with you at home. This is normal, and the school will be expecting it. If your child is feeling worried or if you have any concerns about how they will feel going back, you should discuss this with their teachers who will be able to provide further advice and support.\nDo children have to go back in August? If one parent is at home can they choose to keep them off?\nIt is important that children return to school if they can do so safely. If you have any concerns about your child going back, you should contact their teacher or headteacher to discuss this. If they need to stay at home, they should continue with learning at home based on the advice from their teachers.\nMy child should be starting school in August but I’d prefer they didn’t – can I defer and keep them in Early Learning and Childcare centre?\nSchools will be doing everything they can to support children when they come back to school, no matter what year they’re in. We will be working hard to make sure that children have a positive transition, so that they’re ready to start school. However, if you’re considering keeping your child in ELC for an extra year, please get in touch with our Schools team. Deferrals can only be considered for exceptional individual circumstances.\nMy child is in P7 or S6 – will they miss out on the leaving prom/ceremony altogether?\nChildren who have missed out on opportunities to celebrate leaving school will have the opportunity to do so at a later date. Your child’s school will be thinking about appropriate ways for children to mark these important changes and will contact you to let you know how these arrangements will be made. Make sure you keep in touch with updates from the school to see what they’re planning to do.\n7. About support for staff\nThis section covers support that will be provided for staff working in Early Learning and Childcare and school settings.\nWill there be additional staff brought in to support learning and teaching? Has consideration been given to bringing in student/probationer teachers earlier to help with this?\nWe will make sure schools have the staff they need to continue delivering learning and teaching. This will involve recruiting additional staff, including additional probationer teachers if necessary.\nWhat is the timescale for information coming to allow staff to plan for the reopening and their work?\nDetailed guidance is being provided to schools. This guidance covers all aspects of operating in current conditions in a safe and effective way.\nWill there be additional funds allocated to support schools and teachers through this period?\nThe Council is incurring additional expenditure in relation to COVID-19. The Scottish Government has allocated some funding to the Council and is allowing flexibility with ring fenced funding we receive to support Educational Recovery.\nWhat discretion will schools have to provide Parent Councils with the relevant information on a return strategy soon?\nSchools are engaging with parents and Parent Councils on an ongoing basis. Plans will shared by schools with parents by the end of June 2020.\nWill there be training for teachers and extra support for children experiencing mental health problems since the school was closed and throughout the return period?\nA range of materials and online learning opportunities are being provided to help teachers and education and care staff to best support children’s wellbeing and resilience at this time. Educational Psychologists and Children’s Services will also work closely with schools to support best practice to maintain wellbeing and resilience.\nIf teachers are absent how does the Council propose to fill this gap. Is there a Council strategy to deal with the potential teacher shortage and make sure there is additional staffing available?\nWe have a pool of supply teaching and support staff available. We will also review the availability of staff across all our settings so that, if needed, staff can move to settings where additional support may be required. Back to top\nWill external professionals (eg speech therapists or counsellors) still be able to use the school for 1 to 1 sessions?\nA range of partner organisations are supporting children, young people and families through online contact. It is anticipated this will continue for the moment and this has been included in risk management planning.\nWhat about teachers trying to juggle in-school and online teaching with their own childcare issues. Will they have priority for full time school places for their own children?\nTeachers and other school staff will be required to apply for critical childcare in the same way as all key workers.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_04_29_briefing-edinburgh-is-set-to-introduce-emergency-measures-for-pedestrians-and-cyclists/content_458.html": "Below is a briefing on a Council plan to close key roads to improve safety for cycles and pedestrians. I will share further details when I get them. I would welcome suggestions for measures to be implemented in my Ward.\nBriefing\nThe City of Edinburgh Council is set to become one of the first local authorities in the UK to introduce emergency measures to help pedestrians and cyclists to travel safely while observing physical distancing guidance.\nCOVID-19 has undoubtably changed the way in which the road network is being used and will continue to be used for the foreseeable future.\nThere is significant public concern and demand for changes to how parts of our road and footway network are configured to allow easier, safer distancing to be practiced when people are moving around for daily exercise or as essential workers. The Council needs to act quickly in response to this, so it can support safe travel by foot and bike for all our citizens.\nThere have been significant increases in the number of people walking and cycling during recent weeks in comparison to normal conditions.\nYesterday’s announcement from the Scottish Government confirmed a £10m ‘Spaces for People’ fund to help local authorities introduce such emergency measures. It will provide 100% funding for what are expected to be relatively low cost, emergency measures. Our Active Travel Team has been working closely with Transport Scotland and SUSTRANS to develop an approach within the current legislative framework.\nOver the coming weeks we’ll be implementing several changes to help prioritise walking and cycling. Immediate actions will tackle areas highlighted as pinch points for pedestrians and cyclists and will include some road lane closures and the implementation of temporary cycle lanes. There has been significant, understandable public demand for action to help facilitate safe daily exercise and the movement of essential workers.\nIn the medium term, as lockdown measures continue and are eventually eased, we will develop a citywide approach to more significant changes, such as expanded cycle lanes and the creation of bus gates. Longer term, it is proposed that progress on more permanent schemes under the Active Travel Programme is brought forward.\nImmediate measures will include the closure of the following roads:\n• Silverknowes Road (implemented by Thursday, 30 April)\n• Braid Road (implemented by Sunday, 3 May)\n• Links Gardens (implemented by Sunday, 3 May)\nThese locations have been identified in close dialogue with relevant Council services and Police Scotland who have expressed concerns in each area. Further emergency measures are being investigated for implementation in the weeks beginning 4 May and 11 May and these will be communicated as soon as possible.\nWe will continue to quickly address other ‘pinch points’ and local issues, making use of Temporary Traffic Regulation Orders where necessary, which allow urgent amendments to be made to road layouts to help create more space for people on foot or bike.\nA report will be brought to Policy and Sustainability Committee on 14 May 2020 detailing a city-wide approach to more significant network changes eg the creation of expanded cycle lanes, lane closures in vehicle space to create more space for walking or cycling or the creation of bus gates that prevent access to all but a few types of vehicles.\nFurther information on the Council’s response to the coronavirus outbreak is available online.\nLegal Framework\nIn creating new road layouts, the Council is required to use Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs). The process involved in doing so is onerous, due to the need to effectively consult on proposals. The need for more urgent changes to our network means that we need to find a more effective path towards effective action.\nSection 14 (1) of the Road Traffic Regulation Act (RTRA) 1984 allows the Roads Authority (the Council) to produce Temporary Traffic Regulation Orders (TTROs) in certain circumstances that can be in place for up to 18 months for a road or carriageway or six months for a footpath or cycleway.\nA TTRO carries a much lighter requirement for consultation and advertisement and, unlike a TRO, cannot be objected to.\nOne of the circumstances that Section 14 (1) of the RTRA allows a TTRO to be made under is where the Roads Authority are of the opinion that there is a ‘likelihood of danger to the public’. In this case, the danger would be the risk of COVID-19 transmission and the need to therefore mitigate this risk.\nLegal Services colleagues have confirmed that there is scope to apply this definition of a danger to the public.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_01_27_briefing-street-lights-in-edinburgh-are-switching-to-led-technology/content_625.html": "A briefing on Edinburgh’s conversion to LED street lighting is below.\nNew energy efficient street lights which will save the city millions, increase public safety and lead to fewer lighting faults are a step closer to being rolled out across the Capital after the Council appointed a contractor for the project.\nCouncillors on the Finance and Resources Committee approved a £15.219 million contract with Amey Highways to replace approximately 54,000 street lights across Edinburgh with energy efficient lamps by the end of 2020.\nThe move follows a 2014 pilot project to replace 7000 obsolete lanterns with Light Emitting Diode (LED) lights. These ‘white light’ technology lamps give off a clearer light and can last for more than 20 years compared to existing lights’ current life span of two to four years.\nThe crisper light and new technology enhance community safety by making CCTV images clearer and by allowing light levels to be varied.\nThe Council has approximately 65,000 street lights, costing around £3m in energy alone every year. Energy costs continue to rise and the current lanterns are becoming obsolete, making them harder and costlier to maintain.\nTo pre-empt these increases, £24.5m will be spent on upgrading all the city’s street lights; replacing inefficient lanterns with modern, energy efficient and environmentally friendly ones. This will achieve savings for the taxpayer of £54m over 20 years.\nAs well as saving millions of pounds, replacing the lanterns will help Edinburgh reduce CO2 emissions and comply with Scottish Government energy efficiency legislation.\nA dynamic street lighting monitoring and control system (CMS) will also be installed, giving much greater, centralised control over the city’s lighting. The CMS will provide real-time monitoring and reporting to identify and track faults, which will cut the number of residents’ complaints about broken street lights and remove the need for street lighting staff to undertake night-time scouting work to identify faulty lights.\nIt will also track actual energy consumption, submitting information directly to the Meter Administrator and increasing the accuracy of energy billing.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_09_13_we-cant-let-the-car-lobby-stop-the-city-centre-transformation/content_516.html": "As a new Councillor in Edinburgh I am always grateful for the work that those that came before me undertook to make our city what it is today. There is much to be proud of in terms of our culture, our built environment and our natural heritage.\nFrom a transport perspective we are lucky, the city is well connected with the outside world and we have a publicly owned bus service which is second to none.\nNonetheless, we live in a time of change and challenge where transport is concerned. The combined forces of economic growth, climate change, air pollution and congestion are placing real pressures on our city and those that live in it. The era of the car may not be over, but the notion that we can drive our way out of the challenges our city faces has no future.\nEdinburgh’s solution to the challenges we face is the “Edinburgh City Centre Transformation Strategy“, which aims to move the design of our city centre away from cars and towards people. The emphasis is on creating a city (not just a city centre) where it is easier for people to move around on public transport, foot and bike.\nThe temporal and spatial scale of the proposed change is daunting, but also energising. It’s called a transformation, but it is really a revolution. Indeed, I am reminded of the Edinburgh Bicycle Co-Operative slogan – “The revolution will not be motorised”.\nSo it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are, but our city was not built by those who wanted to wait or look backwards. Those who came before us made certain that this city rode the first waves of the Enlightenment, and this generation can’t founder in the backwash of others where creating a liveable city is concerned.\nTo be clear, the proposed end result will not be revolutionary, it is the process of getting there which is. The end result will be normal if you’ve been to places like Vienna and Copenhagen. To be sure, we are behind these cities right now, and will be behind for some time. But we should not intend to stay behind, and in the next decade, we have a chance to catch up and move ahead.\nSuch a Breath-taking strategy, however, creates new challenges as it dispels old. Key amongst these is ensuring that the accessibility of the city centre continues to improve as the plans develop. More work is also needed to better define the costs and benefits, particularly around public transport connectivity, emissions and air quality.\nCurrently, the costs are estimated to be £314.6m and the benefits £420m, and as this is just a strategy at this stage the optimism bias is 44%. It will be difficult (essentially impossible) for the Council to fund this, so resources will be sought via the Scottish Government (who think £120m for rebuilding Sheriffhall Roundabout is good value) via their STPR2 scheme. This would be part of a regional scheme focussed on connecting the city centre with the suburbs and surrounding towns via world class public / active transport links.\nPolitically, there is strong support in the Council for the strategy with only 3 of the 11 Councillors on the Transport Committee yesterday opposing it – Cllr Susan Webber, Cllr Graeme Hutchison & Cllr Nick Cook. Cllrs Webber and Hutchison admitted at the meeting they knew little (both were substitutes) of the history of the development of the strategy and the massive public consultation exercise which informed its development. It was also suggested that their ringleader, Cllr Nick Cook, had only attended 1 of 8 working groups meetings where it was possible to discuss and steer the project. Instead he chose to describe the strategy as a “plan to strip away pay & display parking and free movement of vehicles in the city centre”. I can’t be convinced anyone wants the “free movement of vehicles in the city centre”, or that introducing it will help manage the combined forces of economic growth, climate change, air pollution and congestion.\nOnce the gang of three lost the argument, however, they did manage to delay the further development of the strategy by demanding it is considered by all 63 Councillors at Full-Council next week. I expect they will repeat the same failed arguments, and lose again.\nWhilst this delay is limited, it is a sign that we all have to do more to convince others of the scale of the challenges we face. In the blog I have borrowed a few phrases from JFK (not for the first time), but I am reminded that in his “Moon Speech” he quoted William Bradford to convey the scale of the challenge. Although the challenge Edinburgh faces is different, the quote is still apt: “all great and honourable actions are accompanied with great difficulties, and both must be enterprised and overcome with answerable courage”.",

This is really to solve two problems:\n- Lots of people have embraced healthier lifestyles – more walking, jogging and cycling. However, footpaths are often too congested for people to keep a safe distance from others when walking and many cyclists are finding the roads unsafe.\n- As the lockdown lifts, it appears unlikely (in the short term at least) that people will go back to using the bus as they did before. The Council therefore wants to make the city safer to walk and cycle.\nI have received some ideas from local residents for making travel around my Ward safer for everyone. In short, these focus on making residential areas safer and improving safety for cyclists on key arterial routs through (and into) my Ward. Before I speak to the Council about this, I wanted to give people a chance to rate the ideas and make further suggestions of their own via this survey.\nYou can find the survey here.",

I will share further details when I get them. I would welcome suggestions for measures to be implemented in my Ward.\nBriefing\nThe City of Edinburgh Council is set to become one of the first local authorities in the UK to introduce emergency measures to help pedestrians and cyclists to travel safely while observing physical distancing guidance.\nCOVID-19 has undoubtably changed the way in which the road network is being used and will continue to be used for the foreseeable future.\nThere is significant public concern and demand for changes to how parts of our road and footway network are configured to allow easier, safer distancing to be practiced when people are moving around for daily exercise or as essential workers. The Council needs to act quickly in response to this, so it can support safe travel by foot and bike for all our citizens.\nThere have been significant increases in the number of people walking and cycling during recent weeks in comparison to normal conditions.\nYesterday’s announcement from the Scottish Government confirmed a £10m ‘Spaces for People’ fund to help local authorities introduce such emergency measures. It will provide 100% funding for what are expected to be relatively low cost, emergency measures. Our Active Travel Team has been working closely with Transport Scotland and SUSTRANS to develop an approach within the current legislative framework.\nOver the coming weeks we’ll be implementing several changes to help prioritise walking and cycling. Immediate actions will tackle areas highlighted as pinch points for pedestrians and cyclists and will include some road lane closures and the implementation of temporary cycle lanes. There has been significant, understandable public demand for action to help facilitate safe daily exercise and the movement of essential workers.\nIn the medium term, as lockdown measures continue and are eventually eased, we will develop a citywide approach to more significant changes, such as expanded cycle lanes and the creation of bus gates. Longer term, it is proposed that progress on more permanent schemes under the Active Travel Programme is brought forward.\nImmediate measures will include the closure of the following roads:\n• Silverknowes Road (implemented by Thursday, 30 April)\n• Braid Road (implemented by Sunday, 3 May)\n• Links Gardens (implemented by Sunday, 3 May)\nThese locations have been identified in close dialogue with relevant Council services and Police Scotland who have expressed concerns in each area. Further emergency measures are being investigated for implementation in the weeks beginning 4 May and 11 May and these will be communicated as soon as possible.\nWe will continue to quickly address other ‘pinch points’ and local issues, making use of Temporary Traffic Regulation Orders where necessary, which allow urgent amendments to be made to road layouts to help create more space for people on foot or bike.\nA report will be brought to Policy and Sustainability Committee on 14 May 2020 detailing a city-wide approach to more significant network changes eg the creation of expanded cycle lanes, lane closures in vehicle space to create more space for walking or cycling or the creation of bus gates that prevent access to all but a few types of vehicles.\nFurther information on the Council’s response to the coronavirus outbreak is available online.\nLegal Framework\nIn creating new road layouts, the Council is required to use Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs). The process involved in doing so is onerous, due to the need to effectively consult on proposals. The need for more urgent changes to our network means that we need to find a more effective path towards effective action.\nSection 14 (1) of the Road Traffic Regulation Act (RTRA) 1984 allows the Roads Authority (the Council) to produce Temporary Traffic Regulation Orders (TTROs) in certain circumstances that can be in place for up to 18 months for a road or carriageway or six months for a footpath or cycleway.\nA TTRO carries a much lighter requirement for consultation and advertisement and, unlike a TRO, cannot be objected to.\nOne of the circumstances that Section 14 (1) of the RTRA allows a TTRO to be made under is where the Roads Authority are of the opinion that there is a ‘likelihood of danger to the public’. In this case, the danger would be the risk of COVID-19 transmission and the need to therefore mitigate this risk.\nLegal Services colleagues have confirmed that there is scope to apply this definition of a danger to the public.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_04_18_introduce-a-congestion-charge-in-edinburgh-whilst-raising-rail-prices-is-bonkers/content_63.html": "On Saturday The Herald reported that the SNP plan to introduce a Congestion Charge in Edinburgh, similar to the one in London where drivers pay £15 to enter the cordon at peak time. Formally announcing this on Saturday means it comes a day after tens of thousands of people in Edinburgh started voting by post.\nThere can be no doubt that we have to work to reduce congestion and cut climate emissions in Edinburgh, particularly where people are commuting into our Capital from surrounding Local Authorities. This can only really be done by improving public transport and cutting the number of cars entering the city. Extra parking, or improved traffic light sequencing are not the answer.\nI’ve said that Edinburgh needs to work with surrounding Local Authorities to improve public transport links, and also invest in Park & Ride schemes. That will need collaborative working, and a regional strategy – I’m not convinced that the SNP plan to unilaterally introduce a Work Place Parking Levy and a Congestion Charge is the answer. Indeed, even they appear to be endorsing the view that it is simply part of a “War on Motorists” – unhelpful rhetoric given the challenges we face.\nKeep in mind that the SNP plan to introduce a Work Place Parking Levy and a Congestion Charge at the same time as increasing rail fares. This is incoherent at best, and certainly not joined up policy making.\nThis is how the SNP describe their policy: “We will introduce a commuter charging zone at the city boundary to discourage those living outwith the city from driving in, encouraging them to switch to bus, tram, train, foot or cycle. No Edinburgh resident – including those living in South Queensferry and the western villages – will ever have to pay the charge.”\nLeave aside the notion of people commuting by “foot” from Livingston, let’s have a think about what that could mean:\n- No charge for driving a SUV from South Queensferry into central Edinburgh, but somebody driving from Loanhead to visit a loved one at Marie Curie Hospice in my Ward would have to pay.\n- Drivers taking a break on long trips to the north or south at the cafes just off the bypass in my Ward would have to pay.\n- People enjoying Hillend Ski Slope would have to pay to access Craigdon Mountain Sports in my Ward.\n- Frontline NHS staff starting early and finishing late would be exempt from the Workplace Parking Levy, but would have to pay the Congestion Charge if travelling from outside Edinburgh.\n- Keyworkers with unsociable working hours would have to pay, despite often not having access to public transport.\n- Tradesmen coming into Edinburgh would have to pay, and the charge would be transferred to customers.\n- It would also essentially mean the reintroduction of a toll for driving from Fife to Edinburgh… from the party that removed it!\n- Most important of all, my family in Fife would be charged for visiting me!\nNo doubt some of these issues could be resolved, and I would also expect exemptions for Blue Badge holders. Like the Workplace Parking Levy, however, there is a risk that a Congestion Charge would simply gentrify driving. Indeed, if a Congestion Charge is introduced alongside increased public transport costs the consequences could be worse than that.\nSo what is the solution to Edinburgh’s congestion problem? Firstly, I think a Congestion Charge could work, but only as part of a region wide transport strategy focussed on public transport improvements. This would mean working collaboratively with surrounding Local Authorities to make public transport a cheaper and more efficient alternative to driving. The current SNP “plan” to introduce a Congestion Charge whilst raising rail prices is bonkers!\nBack in 2005 I was one of the 25.6% of Edinburgh residents that voted for a Congestion Charge. It was a bit of a muddle, but I thought it could be made to work. Almost 20 years later, things have changed. Congestion has got worse, the Climate Emergency is now a reality and Fuel Duty is on the way out.\nThe last point is important, around half of what is paid for petrol and diesel goes straight to the Government via Fuel Duty and VAT. Fuel Duty income in 2021/22 is estimated to be £26B – around £950 per household. The switch to electric vehicles, however, means this income will dwindle. Of course it is possible that a way could be devised to tax electric vehicle charging, but it is more likely that we will switch to “Road Pricing”. Road Pricing is similar to Fuel Duty in that if you drive more you will pay more, but it also offers other opportunities. It could mean people pay more to drive in congested areas/times and Blue Badge Holders could be exempt. People taking journeys served by public transport could even be targeted. The possibilities are endless, and it enjoys modest levels of public support.\nThe House of Commons Transport Committee has published a paper on the subject, and the Scottish Government are also looking at it. Of course the Congestion Charge is a form of Road Pricing, but it is clumsy and indiscriminate.\nI feel that the UK and Scottish Government should be working together on national Road Pricing now so that we can move away from Fuel Duty smoothly. They could make it cost neutral, but I think it could be used to manage congestion and pollution across the UK. If that happens in Edinburgh, the Council working with surrounding Local Authorities will still be key.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2021_02_12_edinburghs-city-mobility-plan-needs-to-be-smart/content_332.html": "Edinburgh is a growing city which, in normal times, has a congestion problem. If the city continues to grow, Edinburgh needs to think how people, goods and services can move around efficiently. Additionally, we have to think about the growing numbers of people commuting into Edinburgh, and how we deal with the climate emergency and air pollution.\nKey to solving all these issues is “modal shift” – getting a greater proportion of people using more sustainable modes of transport. Paramount to this is investing in public transport, but we also have to ensure new developments are better connected to shops etc.\nThe Council’s “City Mobility Plan” sets out how this could be done. This plan sets out what’s needed to deliver a more sustainable, integrated, efficient, safe and inclusive transport system over the next decade.\nThis plan is, however, largely unfunded – the report describes the funding situation as “challenging”. Let me be clear, the Council will need funding from the Scot Gov to deliver this vision.\nA second concern I have is the detail of what the Council hopes to achieve. Normally, SMART objectives (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Bound) are the starting point for any plan. Councillors are being asked, however, to agree the City Mobility Plan without any targets for modal shift in place. We are being told “mode share targets will be set out in a Technical Note to support the monitoring of this Plan”.\nThe plan is not perfect and will evolve in response to funding and other pressures, but it is a good starting point those of us who want people, goods and services to be able to move around our capital efficiently and sustainably.\nPeople will oppose this plan, but they need to explain how they’d solve Edinburgh’s future transport problems.",

People from across the Commonwealth and the world came to our aid and gave their lives in defence of freedom and democracy.\nNearby to this site is Napier University’s Craiglockhart campus, once Craiglockhart Hospital, a military psychiatric hospital during World War I. In an era of harsh treatments, Craiglockhart focused on listening and reassurance, recognizing that these men had faced extraordinary circumstances.\nThis unique environment brought together two extraordinary minds: Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon.\nA testament to the human cost of war, Owen’s poetry shines a light on the conditions faced by the regular soldier in the War and strips back the glorification of that conflict, providing us in this place invaluable motivation and cause to never allow such circumstances to occur again.\nNearby are Redford and Dreghorn Barracks. I am proud to stand here today as a representative of many members of the Armed Forces and their families, based there. I want to take this opportunity to thank them again for their service.\nWe must do more to support those in our Armed Forces. Sadly, many of those serving our country find themselves in accommodation that is not fit for purpose, and I look forward to seeing the work that this Government will do to ensure our service personnel are equipped with the best possible equipment and training and that they are supported with quality housing and services.\nAs Remembrance Day approaches, we must prepare ourselves across faiths, cultures and backgrounds to honour the service and sacrifice made by those who have fallen in defence of our nation and its values. We must also use the occasion as an opportunity to recommit ourselves to supporting our armed forces and veterans, and to play our part in building a world focused on peace and justice, not war.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2017_08_08_scottish-universities-are-full-if-your-are-scottish/content_205.html": "As parents, my wife and I are quietly happy to be having a break from the stress of waiting for exam results (report, 08/08/17). We know the huge pressure on children to perform well if they want to go on to their dream job or place at university/college.\nAs a Dean of one of Scotland’s best universities, I know the huge benefits that come with gaining a place at college or university. It is something we often take for granted, but it is always humbling to hear the sacrifices people make to attend university. This is a particular issue in Scotland where the SNP have cut the bursaries for the very poorest students – forcing many to work long hours to fund their studies.\nNonetheless, it is gratifying to see exam results improving across the board in Edinburgh. Indeed, a big argument for Labour going into coalition in our Capital was to block Edinburgh SNP having sole control of education.\nAs well as good news, however, the exam results texts and e-mails will contain bad news for some young Scots who hoped to attend university. For those who narrowly missed the entry criteria, rejection can be a bitter pill to swallow. It can be life changing.\nTraditionally, Scots in that position could enter the clearing system and find a place elsewhere. However, the SNP cap on university places means many Scottish universities will not enter clearing. Those that do, may only do so to find students from deprived backgrounds in order to meet Scottish Government targets.\nThat’s right, education is free in Scotland but bursaries have been cut and places are limited by the SNP. If you are English and want to study in Scotland, it is a different matter. However, unlike students from the EU, the SNP force universities to charge English students fees.\nScots students will be told this week that our universities are full, but next week room will be found for English applicants entering clearing for a place in Scotland – phone lines will stay open all weekend for them. Remember that the next time SNP say they are “Stronger for Scotland”!\nWe need an university system for the many, not the few.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_10_28_council-briefing-edinburghs-christmas-and-hogmanay/content_721.html": "Below is a briefing I received from the Council this evening on the situation in East Princes Street Gardens. It does provide some context, and explains the lack of planning permission for this colossal structure.\nIt’s frankly unbelievable that Underbelly can find the time to design and procure the colossal structure we see in East Princes Street Gardens, but are too busy to submit a simple planning application. The Council should take this loss of public amenity for private gain seriously.\nEdinburgh’s Old & New Towns form one of the most beautiful cityscapes in the world – we have a duty to cherish this brilliant piece of heritage. It comprises a rich cultural, built & natural environment, but the real problem appears to be that Underbelly can’t monetize it.\nI’m proud that Edinburgh is the UK’s greenest city, but what is happening in East Princes Street Gardens is completely unsustainable. In the near future Edinburgh will consult on its tourism strategy and the future of its winter festival. I hope residents will use this as a chance to protect our public parks and make Edinburgh’s visitor economy more sustainable.\nBackground\nAs at April 2019, the Council was in year three of a three-year contract with Underbelly to deliver Edinburgh’s Christmas and Hogmanay, with an option to extend for up to three further years, subject to agreed performance indicators.\nThe redevelopment of the Scottish National Gallery and the landscaping changes to East Princes Street Gardens required a solution to deliver the Christmas Market and to protect the new landscaping. Underbelly proposed a significant capital investment in a scaffold structure to protect the new landscaping in the gardens, significantly increase circulation space after concerns from previous years, and create a deliverable layout. The new structure also serves to increase the accessibility of the Christmas markets with more ramps and flat sections for those with a mobility or sensory impairment.\nUnderbelly agreed to meet these capital costs but sought the agreement of a two-year extension to the contract to allow them time to recover the capital investment. The Executive Director of Place, in consultation with the Convener and Vice-Convener of Culture and Communities Committee, agreed to a two-year extension under delegated authority due to time constraints. This decision was then reported to Culture and Communities Committee on 18 June 2019. It is acknowledged that the detailed design was not included in the Committee report.\nFrom June onwards, the Council’s engineers assessed the structure to be built in Princes Street Gardens. This was to double-check the calculations and proposals made by Underbelly’s own engineers and to ensure that the structure was safe and would not cause any significant or structural damage to the new landscaping in the gardens. This process was completed on 12 October 2019.\nThe redevelopment of the Gardens by National Galleries of Scotland has faced several delays. This has resulted in some areas being incomplete when the Gardens were due to be occupied by Underbelly for Christmas. One of the worst affected areas was a steep bank close to the top path in the Gardens.\nDue to the lack of completion of some sections of the works, Underbelly requested to move a section of the market from this steeper area to the area of the Gardens south of the railway line. This would allow this section a full growing season, the best chance to establish and increase crowd flow across the site as a whole.\nAfter consultation with the Convener and Vice-Convener of Culture & Communities Committee, it was agreed to move elements of the market that were to be sited in this steepest section to an area on the south of the railway. This area had been used in previous years but only for storing generators and other plant.\nThe overall number of stalls has increased in the Gardens with the move to the south section. However, the area of useable, open circulation space has increased significantly, allowing visitors a more comfortable experience during busier periods.\nPlanning Permission and Building Warrants\nUnderbelly met with officers from Planning and Building Standards on 30 August to discuss permissions required for the structures and their respective layout in East Princes Street Gardens. A determination of what was warrantable was reached and accepted by all parties. Underbelly agreed to submit a Building Warrant application for all warrantable works within the Christmas Markets.\nPlanning permission was also discussed at that meeting as the existing permission had expired. Underbelly were told that they needed to apply for this. Underbelly stated that they would be making an application but would not be able to meet the timescales required for a full application to be in place before commencing their build on 18 October because, at that stage, there was no final layout plan as engineers from the Council and Underbelly were still concluding their final assessments of the scaffolding structure and any necessary amendments. This was concluded on 12 October and a planning application is now expected. The application will be assessed in line with the Planning Acts.\nIt is therefore appropriate to request a retrospective planning application. Underbelly have contacted the Council’s Planning Service to update on progress. In the meantime, an enforcement file has been opened by officers, who will monitor the situation.\nWaverley Bridge\nThe Christmas Market has been a very popular attraction and getting busier every year; weekend attendance to the market regularly exceeds 100,000 per day (highest attendance last year was c. 124,000).\nAs a result of this popularity, special measures (additional stewards) had to be put in place at the crossing at the top of Waverley Bridge to manage the crowds at weekends last year to stop the public coming into conflict with live traffic.\nOngoing discussions are taking place between the Council, Underbelly and other partners over how best to ensure public safety whilst minimising disruption. This matter will be discussed with City Centre Councillors later this week.\nOld Town/High Street – Edinburgh’s Hogmanay\nThere have been some issues with wider communications from Underbelly regarding the use of the Old Town and residents’ access. Underbelly have been reminded of the need for early and clear communication. For clarity, the High Street and Royal Mile are not being used for Hogmanay; it is only West Parliament Square, outside St Giles’ Cathedral. The High Street will remain open throughout and no residents or businesses on the Royal Mile will require passes to access their properties. There is a well-established protocol for access to property within the street party arena and Underbelly will be contacting those properties very shortly.",

In my Ward , I understand Spylaw & Colinton Mains Parks are being considered – I have asked that the Community Councils are consulted. If there is community support, I have nothing against this. However, I hope it’s ice cream and coffee, rather than burgers and chips that are sold.\nTo deliver a city-wide Parks, Greenspace and Cemeteries service we are required to generate more income. An additional £150,000 from catering concessions operating within our parks is required for 2019/20 and while a re-tendering of existing concessions has contributed to the total more income is urgently required.\nIn support, Park Officers have identified local parks as having potentially suitable locations for hosting catering concessions:\nThe intention would be to allow a small/medium sized temporary mobile catering unit within each park to sell food and drinks from a location agreed by the Park Officer. The concessions will be for one-year running July-June with options to extend for a further 2 years.\nTenderers will be invited to provide a service that will:\n- be sensitive to the historic and/or greenspace that they occupy\n- provide an inviting environment which adds to the location in which they operate\n- offer a range of high quality food and beverages at a range of prices\n- offer a choice of healthy food and drink options\n- support locally sourced and Scottish produce and products\n- be proactive in taking measures to be environmentally responsible\nI hope that you will be supportive of this initiative as it is an important aspect of income generation for the service and it will provide a valuable presences and resource within each park.",

It is clear that unlike other roads traffic on Comiston Road is now at (or exceeds) pre-Covid levels (at least in part due to the Braid Rd closure). Traffic data is now being collected and will inform a review (yes, another one!) over the next week or two. This point and the briefing raises a number of questions which I have put to Council Officers. I posed these questions on the 1st of September, and alongside them below are the responses which I received yesterday (24th of September).\nSpaces for Exercise – On the 23rd of July I was told: “It is my understanding that Braid Road was one of the initial schemes in first phases of lockdown and was to provide a safe route to a green area when people were only permitted 1 hour of exercise a day. As we have moved through the phases more schemes are required to assist in containing the virus. All schemes go through various approval processes so that we know how they affect each other and are reviewed. Braid Road has been reviewed on a number of occasions with minor changes being made but I believe that there will be another review soon in which a more significant change will be made.” What has changed to justify the closure continuing?\nCouncil Response – Braid Road scheme was reviewed following collection of traffic count data and the report from this review will be circulated to ward Cllrs soon.\nSuitable for Cyclists – At the Ward Liaison meeting on the 7th of August Council Officers acknowledged that Braid Road was not popular with cyclists due to its steepness. Now that the Comiston Road scheme is coming on line, what role does Braid Road play in “enabling safe cycling”?\nCouncil Response – Counts from May show that on average around 600 cycle journeys per day are made on Braid Road. We will continue to monitor this once the Comiston Road scheme is complete to understand whether this use remains or is diverted. However, the closure of Braid Road also reduces the levels of traffic through the Braidburn / Cluny area which improves the safety of onward cycle journeys towards the city centre from the South which go through this area.\nSupporting Comments – The brief says “Various parties have called for it to be reopened, while some have called for it to be made permanent.”. Is it fair to say that the majority of people contacting the Council on this issue want Braid Road reopened? How many of the 4000+ comments lodged on the Common Place Portal asked for Braid Road to be closed?\nCouncil Response – Of the over 4,100 comments on the Commonplace site, there were 27 comments made relating to Braid Road, with 194 agreements. In respect of the road closure, the following is a summary of comments: (1) One comment requested the permanent closure with 30 agreements. (2) One comment was made with comments about allowing people coming in and out of the Hermitage to maintain a safe distance between each other whilst walking and/or cycling with 21 agreements. (3) One comment made reference to narrow footways at a section with people walking on the road if the road was opened with 19 agreements. (4) One comment requested that it become a dedicated cycle route with 9 agreements.\n11th of August Recommendation – This said the “closure [will] remain in place with a further review following the implementation of both the Comiston Road Cycleways and Greenbank to Meadows Quite Route”.\nTo whom was this recommendation made, and which of the seven Morningside and Fairmilehead Councillors were consulted? Were Lothian Buses consulted at that point?\nCouncil Response – This recommendation was made to the Spaces for People Board. No Councillors were consulted. Engagement did take place with Lothian Buses who did not express concern.\n[Cllr Arthur – I have been informed separately that the recommendation was made to the Transport Convener – I received this on the 12th of August – “The Transport Convener has a briefing and our recommendation following our Design Risk Assessment review. Rurigdh should be able to offer the Councillors from both Wards an update this morning as soon as we receive a response.”]\nImproved Bus Service Times – Can an analysis of the data on this be shared?\nCouncil Response – Colleagues within Lothian Buses have stated that service times are improving. Raw data on this has not been shared with the Council.\nPeople choose different routes – The Council appears to suggest that the congestion on the A702 will force cars on to other routes and thereby reduce queuing. Is this not the type of “rat-running” we should be trying to avoid? Indeed, some residents have told me they have stopped using the bus, and now drive! Do we want people to stop taking the bus up town to use businesses there?\nCouncil Response – Some people may choose different routes than the A702, though there are limited other options available. Any impact on other routes will be considered should it cause problems.\nReclaiming City Streets for People – At the core of this report is making available good quality public transport. Is the Braid Road closure having a positive impact on bus journey times?\nCouncil Response – This report establishes the principle of Traffic Disappearance – ie: Reducing network capacity generally leads to reduced traffic as people choose not to travel, or travel by other modes. Public Transport and other options such as walking and cycling play an important role here. We are in close liaison with Lothian Buses and are implementing protected cycleways. Both provide reasonable alternatives to private car for journeys along the A702 corridor.\nNumerous actions to address recent traffic and congestion issues – This is reassuring, can these be listed along with their impact?\nCouncil Response – (1) Linking traffic lights at Greenbank Drive with those at Greenbank Crescent to ensure joint operation. (2) Installing cycle detection on Braidburn Terrace approach to Greenbank Crossroads in order to ensure this green phase is only called when required as traffic is no longer making this manoeuvre. This will add approximately 12s per cycle to the available green time across other movements.\nTraffic Counts WB 31st of August – These are welcome, but will they quantify the delays to buses and allow a comparison with January 2018? Will any seasonal fluctuation in traffic volume be accounted for? Will pedestrian and cyclist numbers on Braid Road and Comiston Road be recorded?\nCouncil Response – Counts will not quantify delays to buses. There is no adjustment for seasonal variation. Ped and Cycle numbers will be recorded at Comiston Road. The counts duing w/c 31st Aug did not include Braid Road. However Braid Road has been included in the forthcoming counts to take place w/c 14th ad w/c 21st. Counts took places on Braid Road during May immediately after the closure.\nOptions 1 & 2 – I feel it is a mistake not to consider the option of reopening the road completely (as a benchmark if nothing else). I also feel an additional scenario of Option 2 with two-way traffic should be considered. Can these be included?\nCouncil Response – A full re-opening can be considered at each review.\nConsultation – Greater clarity is required on what part Ward Councillors will play in the decision making process, and how residents can make their views known.\nCouncil Response – We are following the notification and engagement process approved at the Policy and Sustainability Committee on 14 May and will be continuing to monitor the situation.\nSummation – The briefing does not fully detail the benefits and consequences of continuing the closure of Braid Road beyond the completion of Phase 1 of the Comiston Road scheme. Should this case not be made if the closure is to continue? Has any Councillor suggested that Braid Road should remain closed indefinitely?\nCouncil Response – The case for continuing the closure is related to the reduction in traffic, this will be assessed through the ongoing traffic counts. At least one Councillor and numerous local residents have suggested keeping Braid Road closed indefinitely.\n[Cllr Arthur – Edinburgh has 63 Councilors]\nThe Braid Road Briefing\nBackground\nAs part of the Council’s Spaces for People programme three individual related projects were developed, each aiming to remove through traffic from local streets, benefit pedestrians and enable safe cycling from the south of the city to the city centre.\n- Braid Road Closure (initially introduced as a Spaces for Exercise project)\n- Comiston Road Segregated Cycleways\n- Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route\nBraid Road Closure has been in place since early May. Various parties have called for it to be reopened, while some have called for it to be made permanent.\nThe Comiston Road scheme will provide segregated cycleways along the A702 from Frogston Road to Greenbank Crescent. Construction of the cycleways commenced on Monday 24 August and is expected to be complete by Friday 11 September.\nThe proposed Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route aims to establish a network of safe quiet streets using modal filters between Greenbank Crossroads and the Meadows, thus providing a safe cycleway from Fairmilehead to the city centre.\nBraid Road\nBraid Road was closed between the Best Western Hotel and Hermitage Drive. At this time Braidburn Terrace was designated One-Way Eastbound with a cycle contraflow. These interventions remove through traffic from many of the streets in the surrounding area by requiring most North-South trips to be made via the A702.\nThe Braid Road scheme was reviewed by the Design Review Group on 11 August 2020 and it was recommended that the closure remain in place with a further review following the implementation of both the Comiston Road Cycleways and Greenbank to Meadows Quite Route. (Scheme Review Form enclosed).\nThe main objections to the closure relate to concerns regarding the level of traffic on Comiston Road, and delays to bus journeys.\nTraffic on Comiston Road\nIt is acknowledged that traffic levels on Comiston Road returned to roughly pre-Covid levels earlier than other arterial routes, and this may be a result of the closure of Braid Road. However, this is not the only factor which has affected traffic levels.\nDuring the week commencing 10th August there were roadworks on the A701 at Kaimes Crossroads which likely diverted additional traffic onto the A702. Unfortunately, these road works coincided with the schools returning resulting in delays, including significant delays to buses. However, following removal of the temporary traffic lights Lothian Buses have reported that service times are much improved.\nIn order to better understand the current traffic situation on Comiston Road the Council has commissioned traffic counts at Greenbank Crossroads and Morningside Station. These counts will take place WC 31 August with the results available next week. This data will be compared against counts from January 2018 for both Greenbank Crossroads and Braid Road, allowing us to accurately quantify the impact of the Braid Road closure on traffic on Comiston Road, and inform the next project reviews.\nWhile it is likely that traffic will have diverted onto Comiston Road as a result of the closure of Braid Road – it will be important to consider whether overall levels of traffic on both streets has changed.\nFurthermore, any increase in traffic on the A702 that has occurred can reasonably be expected to reduce over time as people choose different routes, or make more sustainable travel choices through the principle of ‘traffic disappearance’ as people adapt their behaviours.\n[For more information on Traffic Disappearance see: Reclaiming City Streets for People by the European Commission]\nActions to Address Traffic on Comiston Road\nThe Council have taken numerous actions to address recent traffic and congestion issues on Comiston Road with further improvements planned.\nThe Council’s traffic signals teams adjusted the signals timings at the junctions with Greenbank Drive and Greenbank Crescent during the past week. This is expected to improve traffic flows.\nDuring the coming fortnight it is proposed introduce a bicycle detection system to the Braidburn Terrace approach to Greenbank Crossroads. This street has been designated one-way, meaning there is no vehicular traffic entering the junction. However, the traffic lights have been continuing to provide a green light phase to this movement, resulting in lost time. Adjusting the traffic lights so that this green phase is only called when required is expected to significantly improve north-south traffic flow on Comiston Road by increasing the green time for these movements.\nDelays to Buses\nWe have liaised closely with Lothian Buses regarding the impact of the Braid Road closure, and the interventions proposed for Comiston Road.\nIt has been reported that traffic is queueing in both directions from Greenbank Crossroads to an extent that causes delays to the bus services at peak times – especially following schools restarting during the week commencing 10 August.\nNorthbound it has been reported that queues are stacking back as far as Buckstone Terrace, which will cause delays to northbound buses. However, discussions with Lothian Buses have indicated that this is occasional, and that generally the queue does not extend further south than Comiston Springs Avenue, meaning buses can access the northbound Bus Lane and bypass the queue. (This is confirmed this week with Service 11 buses delayed at the 4 way TTLs at Lasswade Rd but not further delayed on Comiston Rd)\nSouthbound there are no bus lanes on the approach to this junction which mean that excess queueing will have a more immediate impact on buses. Throughout the week of the 10 August there were temporary traffic lights in place at Kaimes Crossroads on the A701. During this week there were significant queues on Comiston Road and the A702 which caused significant delays to bus services as a result of traffic transferring from the A701. However, following the completion of these works Lothian Buses have advised that traffic has returned to the A701 and they are not experiencing significant delays on the A702 during the pm peak.\nGreenbank to Meadows Quiet Route\nThe Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route is the second half of the proposed route from Frogston Road to the city centre. It will run along quiet roads parallel to Morningside Road.\nIn order to implement this proposed route road closures would be introduced at various locations to remove through traffic.\nAt its southern end the route runs along Hermitage Avenue between Braid Road and Hermitage Gardens. With Braid Road closed this link is lightly trafficked, however, were Braid Road opened this might require further intervention to ensure it was safe.\nThe proposed Greenbank to Meadows QR has been designed so as to cut out rat-running traffic from streets between Cluny Gardens and Comiston Road with strategic closures shown in the map overleaf (below). This would include diagonal closures at the junctions of Braid Road & Braid Crescent, and the junction of Cluny Drive & Hermitage Gardens, as well as a modal filter on Braid Avenue. With Braid Road closed, these further interventions would effectively eliminate traffic cutting through residential streets between Cluny Gardens and Comiston Road.\nAs part of Greenbank to Meadows QR It is also proposed to introduce two closures on Whitehouse Loan. One immediately south of Strathearn Road, the other immediately south of Bruntsfield Crescent. These closures will enable safe cycling on Whitehouse Loan and reflect proposals which have been put forward by local community group ‘Blackford Safer Streets’.\nBraid Road – Options\nOptions considered for the current Braid Road closure.\nOption 1 – Retain Closure – This option retains the maximum level of provision for walking and cycling and – alongside Greenbank to Meadows QR – removes through traffic from the greatest number of residential streets. Strategic diagonal closures at several points make it all but impossible to cut through between Cluny Gardens and Comiston Road, without having undue impact on residents’ ability to access the road network by car.\nOption 2 – One-Way Southbound – Opening Braid Road to southbound traffic only would be a reasonable alternative on completion of the road safety cycle segregation and resurfacing works. There is no Southbound bus lane on Comiston Road, meaning that queueing traffic heading south on the A702 has a greater impact on buses than the reverse.\nHowever, Option 2 requires that through traffic is permitted to travel between Cluny Gardens and Braid Road via some residential streets. Through traffic will tend to route along Midmar Avenue where it is worth noting that residential properties are only on one side, and so traffic will affect the minimal number of households.\nFull Re-Opening – A full re-opening of Braid Road is not proposed at this stage, though could still be considered at a further review as the Spaces for People Programme continues.\nOption 1 and Option 2 are shown below, along with a table outlining their respective costs and benefits, and where appropriate the mitigations for these.\nNext Steps\nA further review of all options will be considered in more detail in 2/3 weeks when information regarding traffic counts and traffic light sequencing changes has been received.\nOption 1\nBenefits:\n- Greatest improvement for people walking and cycling\n- Through traffic removed from all streets between Cluny Gdns and Comiston Rd\n- Contribution to Traffic Reduction\nCosts\n- Some increase in traffic on Comiston Road (impact on residents as well as road-users)\n- Some impact on bus delays on Comiston Road\n- Less resilience in case of emergency road closure on A702\nMitigations/ Caveats\n- Traffic increase appears to be minor (TBA)\n- Bus delays appear to be minor\n- Both will continue to be monitored\n- Traffic likely to fall over time Closure can be reversed in emergency\nOption 2\nBenefits:\n- Reduce impact on southbound traffic on Comiston Road\n- Reduce impact on southbound buses on Comiston Road\nCosts\n- Less provision for people walking and cycling\n- Through Traffic reintroduced on Midmar Avenue and Hermitage Dr\n- Additional measures required on Hermitage Drive to provide safe cycling route –impact on parking (for segregation) and additional expense\n- Reduced opportunity for traffic disappearance\nMitigations/ Caveats\n- Coherent route still deliverable – though at slightly greater expense\n- Small number of households affected\n- Braid Road still closed northbound",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2024_05_19_7060/content_47.html": "In 2023 Lothian Buses’ passenger numbers grew by 17%. This is incredible, and comes after a huge (and ongoing) effort to recruit more drivers. I’d love it if this continued, and we entered an era of exponential growth in public transport use in Edinburgh. It would certainly help us cut congestion, hit net zero, and accommodate the up to 37,000 homes that could be built in Edinburgh in the coming years.\nThe reality is, however, that the growth in bus use last year was mostly people returning to public transport after the pandemic. Weekends are busier than ever, but weekday bus travel is still being impacted by some people continuing to work from home.\nIndeed, we know that to grow bus patronage we need to make using services more attractive. This is not just about having a modern bus fleet, we need to have the right routes and ensure buses can move quickly through our city.\nThis is why I was disappointed that the Scottish Government “paused” funding bus priority schemes which would have allow buses to cut through congestion.\nRight now buses are too often held up in congestion, and those who are able to afford a car end up driving because it is faster. Of course, in a true Catch-22, those people end up making congestion worse. People living in every from Balerno to Fairmilehead will be familiar with this situation.\nThis situation is why the Council intends to trial “7-7-7 Bus Lanes” before the end of the year along the 44 route (between Balerno and Musselburgh). The aim being to improve bus journey times and reliability by moving the existing bus lanes to 7am to 7pm operation 7 days per week. This should benefit bus passengers along the route (inc those in my Ward).\nIf this works, it will be rolled out city-wide – and perhaps we really will enter an era of exponential growth in public transport use in Edinburgh.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_09_01_braid-road-briefing-a-full-re-opening-of-braid-road-is-not-proposed-at-this-stage/content_342.html": "Updated 25th September\nBelow is the latest briefing from Council Officers on the closure of Braid Road. It is clear that unlike other roads traffic on Comiston Road is now at (or exceeds) pre-Covid levels (at least in part due to the Braid Rd closure). Traffic data is now being collected and will inform a review (yes, another one!) over the next week or two. This point and the briefing raises a number of questions which I have put to Council Officers. I posed these questions on the 1st of September, and alongside them below are the responses which I received yesterday (24th of September).\nSpaces for Exercise – On the 23rd of July I was told: “It is my understanding that Braid Road was one of the initial schemes in first phases of lockdown and was to provide a safe route to a green area when people were only permitted 1 hour of exercise a day. As we have moved through the phases more schemes are required to assist in containing the virus. All schemes go through various approval processes so that we know how they affect each other and are reviewed. Braid Road has been reviewed on a number of occasions with minor changes being made but I believe that there will be another review soon in which a more significant change will be made.” What has changed to justify the closure continuing?\nCouncil Response – Braid Road scheme was reviewed following collection of traffic count data and the report from this review will be circulated to ward Cllrs soon.\nSuitable for Cyclists – At the Ward Liaison meeting on the 7th of August Council Officers acknowledged that Braid Road was not popular with cyclists due to its steepness. Now that the Comiston Road scheme is coming on line, what role does Braid Road play in “enabling safe cycling”?\nCouncil Response – Counts from May show that on average around 600 cycle journeys per day are made on Braid Road. We will continue to monitor this once the Comiston Road scheme is complete to understand whether this use remains or is diverted. However, the closure of Braid Road also reduces the levels of traffic through the Braidburn / Cluny area which improves the safety of onward cycle journeys towards the city centre from the South which go through this area.\nSupporting Comments – The brief says “Various parties have called for it to be reopened, while some have called for it to be made permanent.”. Is it fair to say that the majority of people contacting the Council on this issue want Braid Road reopened? How many of the 4000+ comments lodged on the Common Place Portal asked for Braid Road to be closed?\nCouncil Response – Of the over 4,100 comments on the Commonplace site, there were 27 comments made relating to Braid Road, with 194 agreements. In respect of the road closure, the following is a summary of comments: (1) One comment requested the permanent closure with 30 agreements. (2) One comment was made with comments about allowing people coming in and out of the Hermitage to maintain a safe distance between each other whilst walking and/or cycling with 21 agreements. (3) One comment made reference to narrow footways at a section with people walking on the road if the road was opened with 19 agreements. (4) One comment requested that it become a dedicated cycle route with 9 agreements.\n11th of August Recommendation – This said the “closure [will] remain in place with a further review following the implementation of both the Comiston Road Cycleways and Greenbank to Meadows Quite Route”.\nTo whom was this recommendation made, and which of the seven Morningside and Fairmilehead Councillors were consulted? Were Lothian Buses consulted at that point?\nCouncil Response – This recommendation was made to the Spaces for People Board. No Councillors were consulted. Engagement did take place with Lothian Buses who did not express concern.\n[Cllr Arthur – I have been informed separately that the recommendation was made to the Transport Convener – I received this on the 12th of August – “The Transport Convener has a briefing and our recommendation following our Design Risk Assessment review. Rurigdh should be able to offer the Councillors from both Wards an update this morning as soon as we receive a response.”]\nImproved Bus Service Times – Can an analysis of the data on this be shared?\nCouncil Response – Colleagues within Lothian Buses have stated that service times are improving. Raw data on this has not been shared with the Council.\nPeople choose different routes – The Council appears to suggest that the congestion on the A702 will force cars on to other routes and thereby reduce queuing. Is this not the type of “rat-running” we should be trying to avoid? Indeed, some residents have told me they have stopped using the bus, and now drive! Do we want people to stop taking the bus up town to use businesses there?\nCouncil Response – Some people may choose different routes than the A702, though there are limited other options available. Any impact on other routes will be considered should it cause problems.\nReclaiming City Streets for People – At the core of this report is making available good quality public transport. Is the Braid Road closure having a positive impact on bus journey times?\nCouncil Response – This report establishes the principle of Traffic Disappearance – ie: Reducing network capacity generally leads to reduced traffic as people choose not to travel, or travel by other modes. Public Transport and other options such as walking and cycling play an important role here. We are in close liaison with Lothian Buses and are implementing protected cycleways. Both provide reasonable alternatives to private car for journeys along the A702 corridor.\nNumerous actions to address recent traffic and congestion issues – This is reassuring, can these be listed along with their impact?\nCouncil Response – (1) Linking traffic lights at Greenbank Drive with those at Greenbank Crescent to ensure joint operation. (2) Installing cycle detection on Braidburn Terrace approach to Greenbank Crossroads in order to ensure this green phase is only called when required as traffic is no longer making this manoeuvre. This will add approximately 12s per cycle to the available green time across other movements.\nTraffic Counts WB 31st of August – These are welcome, but will they quantify the delays to buses and allow a comparison with January 2018? Will any seasonal fluctuation in traffic volume be accounted for? Will pedestrian and cyclist numbers on Braid Road and Comiston Road be recorded?\nCouncil Response – Counts will not quantify delays to buses. There is no adjustment for seasonal variation. Ped and Cycle numbers will be recorded at Comiston Road. The counts duing w/c 31st Aug did not include Braid Road. However Braid Road has been included in the forthcoming counts to take place w/c 14th ad w/c 21st. Counts took places on Braid Road during May immediately after the closure.\nOptions 1 & 2 – I feel it is a mistake not to consider the option of reopening the road completely (as a benchmark if nothing else). I also feel an additional scenario of Option 2 with two-way traffic should be considered. Can these be included?\nCouncil Response – A full re-opening can be considered at each review.\nConsultation – Greater clarity is required on what part Ward Councillors will play in the decision making process, and how residents can make their views known.\nCouncil Response – We are following the notification and engagement process approved at the Policy and Sustainability Committee on 14 May and will be continuing to monitor the situation.\nSummation – The briefing does not fully detail the benefits and consequences of continuing the closure of Braid Road beyond the completion of Phase 1 of the Comiston Road scheme. Should this case not be made if the closure is to continue? Has any Councillor suggested that Braid Road should remain closed indefinitely?\nCouncil Response – The case for continuing the closure is related to the reduction in traffic, this will be assessed through the ongoing traffic counts. At least one Councillor and numerous local residents have suggested keeping Braid Road closed indefinitely.\n[Cllr Arthur – Edinburgh has 63 Councilors]\nThe Braid Road Briefing\nBackground\nAs part of the Council’s Spaces for People programme three individual related projects were developed, each aiming to remove through traffic from local streets, benefit pedestrians and enable safe cycling from the south of the city to the city centre.\n- Braid Road Closure (initially introduced as a Spaces for Exercise project)\n- Comiston Road Segregated Cycleways\n- Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route\nBraid Road Closure has been in place since early May. Various parties have called for it to be reopened, while some have called for it to be made permanent.\nThe Comiston Road scheme will provide segregated cycleways along the A702 from Frogston Road to Greenbank Crescent. Construction of the cycleways commenced on Monday 24 August and is expected to be complete by Friday 11 September.\nThe proposed Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route aims to establish a network of safe quiet streets using modal filters between Greenbank Crossroads and the Meadows, thus providing a safe cycleway from Fairmilehead to the city centre.\nBraid Road\nBraid Road was closed between the Best Western Hotel and Hermitage Drive. At this time Braidburn Terrace was designated One-Way Eastbound with a cycle contraflow. These interventions remove through traffic from many of the streets in the surrounding area by requiring most North-South trips to be made via the A702.\nThe Braid Road scheme was reviewed by the Design Review Group on 11 August 2020 and it was recommended that the closure remain in place with a further review following the implementation of both the Comiston Road Cycleways and Greenbank to Meadows Quite Route. (Scheme Review Form enclosed).\nThe main objections to the closure relate to concerns regarding the level of traffic on Comiston Road, and delays to bus journeys.\nTraffic on Comiston Road\nIt is acknowledged that traffic levels on Comiston Road returned to roughly pre-Covid levels earlier than other arterial routes, and this may be a result of the closure of Braid Road. However, this is not the only factor which has affected traffic levels.\nDuring the week commencing 10th August there were roadworks on the A701 at Kaimes Crossroads which likely diverted additional traffic onto the A702. Unfortunately, these road works coincided with the schools returning resulting in delays, including significant delays to buses. However, following removal of the temporary traffic lights Lothian Buses have reported that service times are much improved.\nIn order to better understand the current traffic situation on Comiston Road the Council has commissioned traffic counts at Greenbank Crossroads and Morningside Station. These counts will take place WC 31 August with the results available next week. This data will be compared against counts from January 2018 for both Greenbank Crossroads and Braid Road, allowing us to accurately quantify the impact of the Braid Road closure on traffic on Comiston Road, and inform the next project reviews.\nWhile it is likely that traffic will have diverted onto Comiston Road as a result of the closure of Braid Road – it will be important to consider whether overall levels of traffic on both streets has changed.\nFurthermore, any increase in traffic on the A702 that has occurred can reasonably be expected to reduce over time as people choose different routes, or make more sustainable travel choices through the principle of ‘traffic disappearance’ as people adapt their behaviours.\n[For more information on Traffic Disappearance see: Reclaiming City Streets for People by the European Commission]\nActions to Address Traffic on Comiston Road\nThe Council have taken numerous actions to address recent traffic and congestion issues on Comiston Road with further improvements planned.\nThe Council’s traffic signals teams adjusted the signals timings at the junctions with Greenbank Drive and Greenbank Crescent during the past week. This is expected to improve traffic flows.\nDuring the coming fortnight it is proposed introduce a bicycle detection system to the Braidburn Terrace approach to Greenbank Crossroads. This street has been designated one-way, meaning there is no vehicular traffic entering the junction. However, the traffic lights have been continuing to provide a green light phase to this movement, resulting in lost time. Adjusting the traffic lights so that this green phase is only called when required is expected to significantly improve north-south traffic flow on Comiston Road by increasing the green time for these movements.\nDelays to Buses\nWe have liaised closely with Lothian Buses regarding the impact of the Braid Road closure, and the interventions proposed for Comiston Road.\nIt has been reported that traffic is queueing in both directions from Greenbank Crossroads to an extent that causes delays to the bus services at peak times – especially following schools restarting during the week commencing 10 August.\nNorthbound it has been reported that queues are stacking back as far as Buckstone Terrace, which will cause delays to northbound buses. However, discussions with Lothian Buses have indicated that this is occasional, and that generally the queue does not extend further south than Comiston Springs Avenue, meaning buses can access the northbound Bus Lane and bypass the queue. (This is confirmed this week with Service 11 buses delayed at the 4 way TTLs at Lasswade Rd but not further delayed on Comiston Rd)\nSouthbound there are no bus lanes on the approach to this junction which mean that excess queueing will have a more immediate impact on buses. Throughout the week of the 10 August there were temporary traffic lights in place at Kaimes Crossroads on the A701. During this week there were significant queues on Comiston Road and the A702 which caused significant delays to bus services as a result of traffic transferring from the A701. However, following the completion of these works Lothian Buses have advised that traffic has returned to the A701 and they are not experiencing significant delays on the A702 during the pm peak.\nGreenbank to Meadows Quiet Route\nThe Greenbank to Meadows Quiet Route is the second half of the proposed route from Frogston Road to the city centre. It will run along quiet roads parallel to Morningside Road.\nIn order to implement this proposed route road closures would be introduced at various locations to remove through traffic.\nAt its southern end the route runs along Hermitage Avenue between Braid Road and Hermitage Gardens. With Braid Road closed this link is lightly trafficked, however, were Braid Road opened this might require further intervention to ensure it was safe.\nThe proposed Greenbank to Meadows QR has been designed so as to cut out rat-running traffic from streets between Cluny Gardens and Comiston Road with strategic closures shown in the map overleaf (below). This would include diagonal closures at the junctions of Braid Road & Braid Crescent, and the junction of Cluny Drive & Hermitage Gardens, as well as a modal filter on Braid Avenue. With Braid Road closed, these further interventions would effectively eliminate traffic cutting through residential streets between Cluny Gardens and Comiston Road.\nAs part of Greenbank to Meadows QR It is also proposed to introduce two closures on Whitehouse Loan. One immediately south of Strathearn Road, the other immediately south of Bruntsfield Crescent. These closures will enable safe cycling on Whitehouse Loan and reflect proposals which have been put forward by local community group ‘Blackford Safer Streets’.\nBraid Road – Options\nOptions considered for the current Braid Road closure.\nOption 1 – Retain Closure – This option retains the maximum level of provision for walking and cycling and – alongside Greenbank to Meadows QR – removes through traffic from the greatest number of residential streets. Strategic diagonal closures at several points make it all but impossible to cut through between Cluny Gardens and Comiston Road, without having undue impact on residents’ ability to access the road network by car.\nOption 2 – One-Way Southbound – Opening Braid Road to southbound traffic only would be a reasonable alternative on completion of the road safety cycle segregation and resurfacing works. There is no Southbound bus lane on Comiston Road, meaning that queueing traffic heading south on the A702 has a greater impact on buses than the reverse.\nHowever, Option 2 requires that through traffic is permitted to travel between Cluny Gardens and Braid Road via some residential streets. Through traffic will tend to route along Midmar Avenue where it is worth noting that residential properties are only on one side, and so traffic will affect the minimal number of households.\nFull Re-Opening – A full re-opening of Braid Road is not proposed at this stage, though could still be considered at a further review as the Spaces for People Programme continues.\nOption 1 and Option 2 are shown below, along with a table outlining their respective costs and benefits, and where appropriate the mitigations for these.\nNext Steps\nA further review of all options will be considered in more detail in 2/3 weeks when information regarding traffic counts and traffic light sequencing changes has been received.\nOption 1\nBenefits:\n- Greatest improvement for people walking and cycling\n- Through traffic removed from all streets between Cluny Gdns and Comiston Rd\n- Contribution to Traffic Reduction\nCosts\n- Some increase in traffic on Comiston Road (impact on residents as well as road-users)\n- Some impact on bus delays on Comiston Road\n- Less resilience in case of emergency road closure on A702\nMitigations/ Caveats\n- Traffic increase appears to be minor (TBA)\n- Bus delays appear to be minor\n- Both will continue to be monitored\n- Traffic likely to fall over time Closure can be reversed in emergency\nOption 2\nBenefits:\n- Reduce impact on southbound traffic on Comiston Road\n- Reduce impact on southbound buses on Comiston Road\nCosts\n- Less provision for people walking and cycling\n- Through Traffic reintroduced on Midmar Avenue and Hermitage Dr\n- Additional measures required on Hermitage Drive to provide safe cycling route –impact on parking (for segregation) and additional expense\n- Reduced opportunity for traffic disappearance\nMitigations/ Caveats\n- Coherent route still deliverable – though at slightly greater expense\n- Small number of households affected\n- Braid Road still closed northbound",

We also provide the gas emergency service in these areas.\nWe are investing £242,000 to replace our old gas mains and services with new plastic pipe to ensure a continued safe and reliable gas supply to the Colinton area.\nIn consultation with the City of Edinburgh Council, we will start work on Monday 1 October.\nWe’ll be working in Colinton Mains Drive between Colinton Road and Colinton Mains Road for approximately 11 weeks. To keep everyone safe, we’ll have temporary traffic lights in place in Colinton Mains Drive. These traffic lights will move with us as our engineers progress northwards along the road. We’ll be manually controlling our temporary traffic lights at peak times to help keep traffic flowing along Colinton Mains Drive.\nWhen we start our project, we’ll need to temporary close Colinton Mains Road at its junction with Colinton Mains Drive. Signed diversions will be in place for motorists. Once we’ve upgraded this section of our pipe and moved our traffic lights away from the junction, we’ll be able to reopen Colinton Mains Road.\nWhen we reach Colinton Mains Gardens, we’ll need to close that road at its junction with Colinton Mains Drive. Once we’ve progressed safely past the junction and moved our temporary traffic lights, we’ll reopen the road again.\nWe understand that people can get frustrated by roadworks. However, the new plastic pipe has a minimum lifespan of 80 years. This means that when the work is complete, local residents will continue to enjoy the benefits of a safe and reliable gas supply for years to come.\nWe always aim to minimise disruption and we will make every effort to ensure our works are completed as soon as possible.

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_01_14_councillor-nick-cook-misses-the-point-on-bins/content_609.html": "Councillor Nick Cook makes a number of interesting points about Edinburgh’s waste collection crisis. However, he manages to overlook the key cause.\nThe waste collection crisis facing our capital is a direct result of cuts imposed on Edinburgh by the SNP Government. With fewer staff and no spare capacity in the vehicle fleet, is it any wonder bins lie uncollected? We can’t do more with less, and the most vulnerable in Edinburgh feel the impact most.\nIndeed, in November COSLA reported that the Scottish Government had cut Council funding 10 times more than Tory austerity over the past five years. This highlighted the fact that SNP cuts to council funding were politically driven.\nThe budget Edinburgh is facing for 2019/20 will mean it has to make around £40m of “savings”. Councillor Nick Cook could have chosen to join Labour in opposing these cuts, or perhaps he could have joined Edinburgh’s nationalists in ever so quietly accepting them. Instead, he chose to suggest essential public services delivered by the Council should be privatised.\nGiven that he completely failed to explain why this would help, I can only assume this is the Tory equivalent of a comfort blanket. I’d respectfully suggest that if he thinks privatisation solves everything he looks at the performance of Scotrail or commercial waste collection in Edinburgh.\nThe truth is that rather than proposing ill-thought measures to deal with the cuts, Councillor Nick Cook should join Labour in opposing the damage Scotland’s nationalist government is imposing on our Capital.",

Indeed, alert readers will note his column was full of opinion but lacked any direct quotes from either myself or Cllr Munro.\nThe only point we make is about leadership. We strongly feel that the City of Edinburgh Council deserves to have a leader that stands up for its interests rather than one that is simply an apologist for the Scottish Government.\nSpecifically, we feel that the Council Leader, SNP Councillor Adam McVey, should live up to his pledge to “oppose austerity in all its forms”. He has, however, so far only shown a willingness to enable it.\nIn a section of his most recent “Leader’s Report” entitled “Change for the Better” McVey boasts about how the Council has “saved” £240m since 2012. He then goes on to urge Edinburgh to be “forward thinking” and “embrace” the next round of brutal cuts our capital faces – a further £106m.\nLet’s not forget, McVey has refused to rule out cuts to classroom assistants and head teacher funding in the forthcoming budget.\nAll we ask is that McVey stands up for Edinburgh and tells his SNP party elite in Holyrood that Edinburgh deserves a better deal. He needs to tell them that the days of them choosing to triple Tory austerity and pass it on to councils are over.\nSteve Cardownie knows this is the only point we make. He knows this is not about personal ambition. He knows the Labour Group are united in calling for Edinburgh to be fairly funded. Just like McVey, however, Cardownie chooses to put the SNP before the interests of our city.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2020_07_24_briefing-public-safety-improvements-at-junction-of-liberton-brae-kirk-brae-liberton-road-mayfield-road-and-blackford-glen-road/content_541.html": "Below is a really useful update from Council Officers on public safety improvements at the junction of Liberton Brae, Kirk Brae, Liberton Road, Mayfield Road and Blackford Glen Road.\nBackground and Context\nThis junction is located on the busy A701 corridor and during the am and pm peak periods (particularly am) it is extremely busy with vehicular traffic, to the extent the junction is operating over-capacity, resulting in peak period vehicular delays. Due to the location of the junction and the make-up of the surrounding area, the pedestrian activity is minimal (see below for results of recent pedestrian surveys).\nBelow are some background facts on the existing junction: –\n- The junction was fully refurbished circa 2000. As part of this refurbishment, “walk with traffic” pedestrian phases were provided across Liberton Brae and Liberton Road. Prior to this refurbishment, no pedestrian facilities were available. The pedestrian phase across Liberton Brae shows a green man when Kirk Brae traffic is showing a green to vehicles as there is a banned left turn in place on Kirk Brae allowing this to happen. Similarly, the Liberton Road pedestrian phase appears when Mayfield Rd traffic is running as there is a banned left turn for Mayfield Rd traffic\n- During this refurbishment, a ramp was constructed at the top of Mayfield Road (as the footway doesn’t continue around the corner) allowing pedestrians access to the Liberton Road crossing.\n- As this junction is around 20 years old, it is unlikely to be refurbished for another 10 years or so. There are many traffic signal junctions throughout the City, with significantly older infrastructure and some have no pedestrian facilities whatsoever.\n- During the above-mentioned refurbishment, investigations were carried-out to determine if staggered crossings could be installed at the top of Mayfield Rd and bottom of Kirk Brae. However, due to the need to relocate existing services (fibre optic) at the foot of Kirk Brae the costs proved prohibitive at that time.\n- Due to this junction being on a strategic route and after extensive modelling, there is no scope to install an “all stop” pedestrian stage. Nonetheless, installing islands on Mayfield Rd and Kirk Brae, to allow a staggered crossing movement, would be feasible. Blackford Glen Road would have to remain un-signalled (no pedestrian phase) as there is no way to incorporate a pedestrian phase at this crossing point without stopping all traffic. The large footway area at the bottom of Kirk Brae could be reduced in size to gain the extra width required to install a staggered island and Mayfield Rd may be wide enough already as there is currently only one large lane marked, although vehicles sometimes queue in two lanes. The gradients at the top of Mayfield Rd could prove difficult to deal with and would require further investigation to determine what engineering measures would be required.\n- Cycle early starts were introduced around 18 – 24 months ago. Their installation necessitated an overall reduction in vehicle green time of around 12 seconds. This generated larger queues in the AM peak and led to several complaints. This is an example of how over-saturated this junction is (in terms of peak traffic flows) and testament as to why an all-stop pedestrian stage (necessitating roughly 25 seconds of loss time to vehicles) would not work.\n- Estimated cost to refurbish this junction, with staggered pedestrian crossings across Kirk Brae and Mayfield Rd, is c. £450k.\nExisting Junction – Facilities for Pedestrians and Cyclists\nThe junction has five approaches:\n- A701 Liberton Brae – three traffic lanes – single stage signalised pedestrian crossing phase incorporated into junction signals – main arterial traffic route.\n- Blackford Glen road – two traffic lanes – no pedestrian crossing facilities – lightly trafficked, no through road.\n- – marked as two traffic lanes but often functions as three– no signalised pedestrian crossing facilities but refuge island in place at crossing point.\n- A701 Liberton Road – three traffic lanes – single stage signalised pedestrian crossing phase incorporated into junction signals – main arterial traffic route.\n- Kirk Brae – two traffic lanes – no pedestrian crossing facilities.\nGoogle Streetview images of the junction are below.\nThere are Advanced Stop Lines for cyclists in place at all junction approaches. However, the junction is not ideal for cyclists, due to its large overall size, unusual layout and some fairly steep uphill slopes i.e. when heading southeast on the Mayfield Road entry and Kirk Brae exit and south on the Liberton Brae exit. These slopes mean cyclists are travelling more slowly, increasing the risk of conflict with vehicles.\nThe Active Travel team has previously investigated the possibility of improving the junction layout to assist cyclists but concluded that this would only be possible if the junction were to be fundamentally reconfigured, at significant cost. Given other competing calls for investment in Active Travel improvements, it was considered that this could not currently be prioritised. Early release signals phases for cyclists were, however, introduced at the junction around 18 months ago.\nExisting Junction – Traffic Signals Operation\nThe traffic signals operate the following stage sequence: –\n- Stage 1 Liberton Brae and Liberton Rd (green for vehicles)\n- Stage 2 Mayfield Rd (green for vehicles) Green man across Liberton Road\n- Stage 3 Kirk Brae (green for vehicles) Green man across Liberton Brae\n- Stage 4 Blackford Glen Rd (green for vehicles)\nStages one, two and three are preceded by a three seconds cycle early start signal, there is no cycle early start for Blackford Glen Rd.\nThere are currently no controlled pedestrian crossings across Mayfield Road, Kirkbrae or Blackford Glen Road.\nThe traffic signals mode of operation is fixed time during the weekday AM peak between 07:00 and 09:30, running a cycle time of 120 seconds.\nAt all other times apart from the weekday AM peak, the junction runs vehicle actuated (VA) mode, responding to the traffic demands as required.\nRoad Safety – Collisions\nThe Road Safety team has undertaken a Collision Retrieval covering a distance of 75m in each direction from the notional centre point of the junction. This captured the whole of the junction itself and the approach to each of the junction STOP lines.\nThe Council uses a three-year period for investigating collision data as part of its established Accident Investigation and Prevention (AIP) protocol. If there are three or more similar collisions within that period, the location will be given consideration for an appropriate intervention. However, for the purpose of this investigation, a five-year search period has been used.\nIt is important to recognise that the Council only holds details of personal injury collisions supplied by Police Scotland, which is responsible for the collection of all personal injury road traffic collision data within its force area. No data is available on collisions that do not involve personal injury (often described as ‘damage only’) or incidents described as “near misses”; as these types of incident do not have to be reported to the Police (or to anyone else) there is no way of collecting comprehensive data. In addition, what constitutes a near miss is open to interpretation and any data would therefore be subjective.\nUsing the latest vetted data set, which is currently to the end of December 2019, there were three personal injury collisions recorded in the five-year period investigated. The locations of these collisions are shown in Image 7, with each collision represented by a green mark.\nSummary details of these collisions are as follows:\n- The three collisions resulted in four slight casualties.\n- None of the collisions involved Vulnerable Road Users (pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists) or anyone crossing the road.\n- Each collision occurred at a different part of the junction.\n- Collision 1 – a car collided with an unattended parked car in Mayfield Road.\n- Collision 2- a car stopped unexpectedly while travelling east – west through the junction, when the driver mistakenly reacted to a red light which did not apply to their direction of travel, resulting in following vehicles collided with each other and then it.\n- Collision 3 – a driver approaching a red light in Kirk Brae failed to react and stop in time and collided with the rear of a vehicle already waiting in the queue, pushing it into the rear of another vehicle, which was then pushed into the rear of a fourth vehicle.\nThere is no pattern to these collisions that would initiate a road safety intervention as part of the Council’s AIP process.\nRoad Safety – Speeds\nThe speed limit on Liberton Brae, Mayfield Road, Liberton Road and Kirk Brae is 30mph. There are no current plans for permanent reductions in the speed limit on any of these roads. Blackford Glen Road has a long established 20mph speed limit in place.\nThe Road Safety team undertakes bi-annual batches of traffic surveys at locations where speeding concerns have been raised. Traffic data allows us to direct our resources to the locations where there is significant speed limit non-compliance. Recent traffic surveys have been undertaken at the following locations:\n- Liberton Brae, between Alnwickhill Road and Orchardhead Road, from 26 March to 1 April 2019. A free flow average speed of 28.5mph was recorded.\n- Kirk Brae, between Orchardhead Road and Claverhouse Drive, from 29 March to 4 April 2019. A free flow average speed of 29.7mph was recorded.\nBoth of these traffic survey results are within normal tolerance for a posted 30mph speed limit.\nRoad Safety – Pedestrian Crossing Improvements Programme\nThe Road Safety team manages the Council’s ongoing programme of pedestrian crossing improvements. This delivers stand-alone crossing improvements, such as signalised puffin crossings and unsignalized zebra crossings, refuge islands and pavement build-outs. A formal assessment and prioritisation system is used to evaluate locations and the crossing type most suitable for each location. This system was approved by the Council’s Transport, Infrastructure and Environment Committee on 28 July 2009. The programme does not deliver new signalised junctions or upgrades to existing junctions.\nThe base data which is used to assess if a location is suitable for a crossing is known as the PV2 value. This is a nationally recognised value that indicates the number of passing vehicles and crossing pedestrians. Pedestrian and vehicle counts are taken over the peak hours of a week day, from 7am to 10am and 3pm to 6pm, and avoiding school holidays or any other factors which might cause an abnormal result.\nThis base PV2 value is then adjusted to take account of local factors such as the age of those crossing, the composition and speed of passing traffic, the road width, the number of pedestrian accidents and the presence of nearby trip attractors such as schools, doctors’ surgeries, shops etc.\nA location with an adjusted PV2 value of 1 or higher (2 or higher on a dual carriageway) would be considered for a puffin crossing, locations with a value of 0.3 or higher would be considered for a suite of measures that includes a zebra crossing, refuge island or pavement build-outs. If a very low PV2 value is achieved, no additional crossing facilities may be recommended.\nWithin the last three years, pedestrian crossing assessments have been undertaken at the following locations:\n- Mayfield Road, approximately 100m north of the Liberton Brae junction, on 20 March 2018. An adjusted PV2 value of 0.216 was measured.\n- Liberton Brae, at the junction with Orchardhead Road and Tower Mains, on 20 March 2018. An adjusted PV2 value of 0.448 was measured.\n- Kirk Brae, at Double Hedges Road, on 29 May 2019. An adjusted PV2 value of 0.026 was measured.\nThe locations surveyed on Mayfield Road and Kirk Brae did not therefore meet the required criteria for a pedestrian crossing facility. It is, however, proposed to provide a non-signalised crossing improvement, such as a zebra crossing, refuge island or pavement build-outs on Liberton Brae, at Orchardhead Road and Tower Mains. Further investigations will be undertaken to determine which would be the most appropriate option at this location. It is currently anticipated that this pedestrian crossing improvement will be delivered within the 2022/23 financial year.\nThere is currently budget and staff resource capacity to progress between 10 and 15 crossing improvements concurrently, at an annual cost of around £200-250k. The total budget available for the various road safety initiatives delivered throughout the city, including the crossing improvements programme, varies from year to year but is generally around £600-700k.\nAn update to the programme will be reported to the Policy and Sustainability Committee on 6 August and the updated programme will contain proposed improvements at 75 locations, representing a full work programme through to financial year 2024/25.\nProvision of New Pedestrian Crossing Facilities\nEstablished Council policy is to install signalised pedestrian crossing facilities at new signalised junctions, on all legs where there is a demand for pedestrians to cross. In the past there has been a programme of work, with an identified budget, to retrofit pedestrian facilities at existing signalised junctions where they were missing. However, this programme and budget were discontinued some years ago and this type of improvement is now only generally undertaken when junctions are being upgraded, either as part of a wider project or as part of the Traffic Signals team’s ongoing programme of traffic signals refurbishment work.\nSpaces for People Programme\nAs part of the Spaces for People (SfP) programme, it is proposed to introduce temporary enhanced bus lane and cycle segregation provision along the A701 Liberton Road/Craigmillar Park/Mayfield Gardens corridor, commencing just north of this junction.\nThe junction is one of the top 20 locations identified by feedback submitted via Commonplace as a barrier to walking. The SfP team still in the process of analysing the issues raised at each of these locations and considering whether there is a feasible and affordable intervention can be undertaken. It is hoped to have this shortlisting work completed and to produce a list of publicly generated schemes within two weeks There is, however, no current plan to take a temporary pedestrian enhancement forward at this junction as part of the SfP programme.\nGoogle Streetview Images",

However, in my most recent blog I revealed that Lothian Buses where now claiming only smaller buggies could now fit alongside a wheelchair.\nToday I received a more detailed explanation on this from Lothian Buses:\nAll of our vehicles comply fully with the Public Services Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000 (PSVAR), which in terms of the provision of a dedicated wheelchair space require that the length for the space should be a minimum of 1300mm.\nThe 100 seat buses have a dedicated wheelchair space which is 397mm larger than the legally required minimum and is designed so that both wheelchairs and buggy users can co-exist in a shared space.\nThis implies that when the wheelchair space is occupied, there will be 397mm available for a buggy. This got me wondering just how wide a buggy is… so I went Mothercare.\nI found they had a HUGE range of buggies and prams to choose from. However, of the 40 buggies I measured none were narrower than 397mm. They were not even anywhere near that.\nThe smallest I found was the Mothercare Jive Stroller with “hearts” design. A really helpful staff member confirmed that at just £34 is was one of their most popular models. However, even it is 450mm wide – far too big for the space allocated by Lothian Buses.\nIt is important to note that on their website, Lothian Buses say:\nTo make the travel experience even better for you if you’re travelling with young children, many of our newest buses have an additional space for a buggy as well as the wheelchair space.\nI like this as it makes it clear that Lothian Buses recognise the value of ensuring families have access to public transport. However, it’s not clear why Lothian Buses decided that this policy should not apply to the Enviro400XLB or why customers were not consulted.",

The next ten years or so will see 55,000 new homes built in Edinburgh, and many more will be constructed in the surrounding local authority areas.\nThese homes, and the people that live in them, will put huge pressure on our capital. In Edinburgh we will have to ensure that they come with, for example, GPs and school capacity, and good transport links. Labour’s manifesto tackles this head on.\nGiving people in these new developments in and around Edinburgh access to viable alternatives to using the car is essential if our city is to thrive. Our Capital is already one of the most congested cities in the UK, and this impacts on the economy and our wellbeing.\nI hope that the next 10 years will see a significant increase in active travel in our Capital, but I feel that public transport has the potential to deliver a real step change on the path to making Edinburgh a more liveable city.\nOur first aim must be to ensure that all developments are on good quality public transport routes, and residents can meet their day-to-day needs within a 20 minute walk of their home. This is how things used to be!\nPerhaps more importantly, however, is to work collaboratively with surrounding local authorities to reduce commuter traffic coming into Edinburgh. Pre-covid, 63,300 people were commuting into Edinburgh every day by car. We have to reduce this number, and I feel providing reliable and efficient public transport links into Edinburgh is key. Where possible, I would hope that the aim is people completing their whole journey via public transport, but I am also open to more investment in Park & Ride schemes.\nWhilst some may question the manifesto, I hope we can all agree that we can’t drive our way out of the challenge these new homes will bring.",

Of the 2 UK leaders and 3 Scottish Leaders we’ve had in the party since I joined in 2014, she’s had the best mix of leadership, personal ambition, political nous and ability to connect with people.\nI first encountered her early in the independence campaign when I was in the audience of a BBC education debate. During the course of that show she convinced me the attainment gap was the biggest problem facing Scotland and that the solution wasn’t breaking up the UK.\nIndeed, her relentless championing of the attainment gap crisis is a big part of why it’s at the top of the political agenda in Scotland. We have much to be grateful for.\nThe same happened with “looked after children”. Kezia raised the support this group gets from the Scottish Government, and was delighted when the SNP quickly “stole” her policy on supporting them through higher education.\nKezia Dugdale’s impact went far beyond influencing the Scottish Government. She took Labour from virtual annihilation in 2015, to modest success in both the 2017 Council Elections and General Election. Let’s be clear, she took the UK Labour “hold” General Election strategy and made the biggest proportionate gains in any part of the UK for the party. Keep in mind that in Scotland we were not just fighting a muddled Tory Party, but highly effective nationalist campaigns run by Ruth Davidson and Nicola Sturgeon.\nYes, there are critical voices in the party regarding the election result. Such is the warmth of support for Kezia within the movement, however, the trouble makers largely restricted themselves to implicit criticism on social media. Their argument was so weak they did not dare present it to the Scottish Executive Committee, instead their views were fed to the enemies of the party for use against us.\nDespite these recalcitrants, Kezia leaves Labour in Scotland stronger, prouder and more respected than when she took up office. At 36, she still has huge potential to campaign for the kind of Scotland we all want. I just hope she continues to do that from within the party.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2022_11_02_congestion-charging-by-the-back-door/content_16.html": "As an avid reader of Steve Cardownie’s column I was a wee bit disappointed to see I had not made myself clear on my thinking regarding a possible congestion charge for Edinburgh.\nAs Edinburgh’s new Transport and Environment Convener, I am faced with a situation where Edinburgh is growing at an incredible rate and is the most congested city in the UK. More car use won’t solve this problem, particularly when we are faced with a climate emergency.\nThe opposition parties in Edinburgh think a Workplace Parking Levy is the solution, but myself and my friends in the trade union movement have doubts. If the opposition parties progress with this, however, I have a duty to make it work for our Capital.\nI am looking at a range of measures inside the city to encourage people to switch to sustainable transport modes, and to ensure new developments have first class public transport links. I must, however, also consider the traffic coming from outside Edinburgh.\nMy focus right now is increasing public transport capacity from surrounding local authorities. This is about making it safer, faster and more reliable. By 2025 I hope to have the public transport capacity in place to make a real dent in Edinburgh’s congestion problem. If people from outside the City of Edinburgh Council area prove reluctant to switch to public transport then a congestion charge may help encourage them.\nSteve Cardownie called this “congestion charging by the back door”, but I am planning on knocking loudly on the front door of drivers to ask them to make the switch to sustainable transport.\nThe congestion charge will be payable as car drivers from surrounding local authorities enter Edinburgh, but there may well be a higher rate for entering the city centre.\nFor all this to work, Scotland needs a joined-up public transport strategy which focuses on keeping bus, tram and rail fares affordable and the services reliable. Let’s hope we see progress on this by 2025.",

I support this despite the following reservations with respect to the schemes that touch on my Ward:\n- The public should be involved in the further review of the Braid Road and Comiston Road schemes, and these should be considered together.\n- Many will welcome the removal of the Lanark Road scheme, but I would have preferred greater dialogue with the local community about this as there may be some aspects they want retained.\n- I’m concerned that a way could not be found to do more to improve the environment for pedestrians.\nThere has been a lack of clarity for some time regarding the aims the Braid Road and Comiston Road schemes. The reviews need to clearly define this, and work with residents to establish the best way forward.\nI can’t say if the amendment below will be accepted, but I do hope that it is part of the discussion at the Transport & Environment Committee and that all the Councillors there can reach consensus on a way forward that meets Edinburgh’s needs.\nAmendment as agreed by the Labour Group in Edinburgh.\nCommittee:\n- Welcomes the high level of public engagement through the consultation and recognises the complexity of competing needs expressed around road space allocation, particularly in ensuring accessibility.\n- Notes that officer recommendations are based on:\n- Public consultation\n- Market Research\n- Stakeholder surveys\n- Assessment against previously agreed criteria\n- Assessment in light of existing transport policy and direction\n- To better reflect the consultation responses of residents and businesses, in particular where feedback has been fairly definitive in the views of respondents, Committee agrees to:\n- Remove the scheme at Lanark Road, as one of this scheme’s main purposes was to relieve lockdown pressure on the water of Leith paths. However requests officers retain the speed limit at 30mph which has improved safety for all residents and consider any actions to minimise conflict on the water of Leith path-users at this section.\n- Ask officers to further engage with the local residents and community reps ahead of an ETRO to further address resident parking pressure along the Longstone Corridor.\n- Bring a report to the next Transport and Environment Committee on options for modifications to Silverknowes Road South, including the removal of the scheme.\n- Bring a report to the next Transport and Environment Committee on options for Comiston Road, to improve public transport connectivity and reduce impacts on local residents.\n- Bring a report to the next Transport and Environment Committee on options for modifications to Drum Brae North based on the concerns expressed through the consultation.\n- Bring a report to the next Transport and Environment Committee on options for retaining Forrest Road and George IV Bridge, based on the support identified in the consultation, until the permeant scheme can be implemented- including options to accelerate the delivery of those schemes.\n- Bring a report to the next Transport and Environment Committee on Braid Road, with options for the reopening of the road in both directions, including analysis of impacts on traffic levels, resident connectivity and vulnerable road users walking, wheeling and cycling.\n- Improve signage at West Harbour Road/West Shore Road to more clearly inform motorists of the closure and increase disabled parking bays at the closer point to improve disabled access.\n- Agree the remaining recommendations for schemes as set out in the report however also agrees to:\n- Continue to work with Living Streets, local businesses and the access panel to explore long term replacements for the Shopping Streets schemes being removed to give adequate safe space for pedestrians.\n- Continue to make any changes required to improve safety and accessibility for residents and disabled people for all other schemes progressing to an ETRO through those statutory processes.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2019_01_25_marketing-edinburgh-briefing-call-to-protect-the-future-economic-growth-of-edinburgh/content_665.html": "Below is a briefing from John Donnelly (Chief Executive, Marketing Edinburgh) on the proposed cut to Marketing Edinburgh.\nYou will be aware of draft budget cuts by the City of Edinburgh Council, announced last week (18th January). As part of these cuts, it is proposed that £567K (64%) in 2019/2020 and a further £223K in 2020/2021 is taken from Marketing Edinburgh’s current grant of £890K which equates to 89% cut over two years. This will be by far the deepest of all reductions outlined in the draft budget plan – and would have serious consequences for the city’s economy.\nRemoving over £0.5M from Marketing Edinburgh’s financial plans would leave Scotland’s Capital as the only major city in the developed world without a Destination Marketing Management Organisation, which includes Edinburgh’s Marketing Team, Convention Bureau and Film Office.\nWithout a body that unites public and private sectors in the city’s promotion and economic development, we will severely compromise the city’s ability to attract talent, conferences, business and visitors – while our ability to talk to those who live and work in the city, as consumers, will cease. These are all critical pipelines to a successful future Edinburgh and we sever them at our peril.\nMost immediately, these cuts would damage the £72M created by business tourism and the £16M delivered by the film economy. It would remove the ability for Marketing Edinburgh to rally the private sector, ending the significant financial contribution they currently make to city campaigns. It would also halt momentum and growth across all of our digital platforms; our campaigns, including edinburgh.org, the authoritative ‘Official Guide to Edinburgh’, have reached an audience of 80.1M worldwide in just one calendar year.\nWith the uncertainty currently faced by the UK, we should be doing everything in our power to safeguard our economic future, rather than leaving it vulnerable.\nThe latest European Cities Marketing annual survey showed that Marketing Edinburgh’s funding is already amongst the very lowest in Europe, with all comparable cities receiving significant multiples of Edinburgh’s income. The proposed cuts would mean that even cities with much smaller populations, such as Darmstadt, Aalborg or Ljubljana receive more promotional funding.\nThis is frustrating for many reasons, not least that Marketing Edinburgh has proven its effectiveness by creating £99 for the city’s economy for every pound it spent in 2017/18, from its already restricted budget.\nMarketing can be viewed as a seemingly easy target when it comes to budget cuts. However, whilst I fully understand the huge fiscal burden on the Council, perceptions need to be reframed. We champion the city, ensuring Edinburgh retains its rightful prominence on a national and global scale, as a world leading destination in which to live, work, study, visit and invest. Marketing Edinburgh brings the city demonstrable value, while also playing a critical role in managing issues such as over-tourism.\nIn short, we both create and manage success. The question that must be asked now is not simply what the city can afford, but also what it cannot afford to lose.\nWithout Marketing Edinburgh, a dangerous gap would exist, one that our inception was rightly designed to fill. Our demise would see Edinburgh take a significant backwards step, with city promotion, management and economic development becoming increasingly fragmented.\nWe believe there has to be another way. We suggest that the draft cuts are phased differently so to afford Marketing Edinburgh the time in the short term to create a different model. In tandem, we also recommend and commit to working in collaboration with you and the wider Council to find an alternative funding model and plan.\nEdinburgh has always been an innovative, progressive and enlightening city and it will pay a heavy price, at both an international and local level, if it is forced into becoming inward-looking and insular, which I believe could be the result of these cuts.\nTaking the above into consideration, I ask that you:\n- Challenge the proposal at the Finance Resource committee meeting on 1st February\n- Should this proposal be passed, I ask that you stand against the cuts at the Council Budget meeting on 21st February and work with us to find an alternative solution – it is our intention to deliver a counter proposal that delivers fiscally without placing the city at a disadvantage\nAs Frank O’Donnell, Editor in Chief of the Scotsman Group, has publicly stated: “Marketing Edinburgh has proven itself to be a valuable part of the Capital, helping to manage areas including the 2050 vision, business tourism and film tourism, all driving vital revenue. The council must reconsider.”\nI am hopeful of your support. Thank you for your time.\nYours sincerely\nJohn Donnelly\nChief Executive, Marketing Edinburgh",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_03_30_why-i-still-have-concerns-about-edinburghs-proposed-garden-tax/content_469.html": "Having been a Councillor for 11 months I know that where Council policy is concerned the devil is always in the detail. This is particularly true of the plan to charge Edinburgh residents for the collection of garden waste.\nI argued strongly against this policy, but ultimately lost the argument. However, I feel that if people knew then about the policy what we know now then the implementation of this regressive charge could have been stopped.\nA key argument against the “garden tax” is the uncertainty around what will happen to garden waste from those that choose not to pay the charge. We now know that 67,000 households are predicted to choose to opt out. Although the Council does not expect any problems to arise from this, I don’t know anyone that doubts that there will be more fly-tipping, a return of garden bonfires and the misuse of the other waste streams. Before anyone shrugs their shoulders at this, I know from work I have undertaken in Belfast that fly-tipped garden waste makes a significant contribution to culvert blockages, and so increases flood risk.\nWe also know that those that don’t pay the charge will have to return their brown bins to the Council. The cost of this, where the 67,000 bins will be stored and what will happen to them is not clear.\nA further issue is affordability to low income households. Due to arguments I and others made, the Council has agreed to exempt those who qualify for the Council Tax Reduction Scheme. However, individuals will have to apply for this exemption cap in hand rather than it being automatically allocated. Indeed, this is expected to take the cost of administering the scheme to over £100,000.\nI am therefore in no doubt that the implementation of this charge will come with significant problems and that many will find introducing this charge along with a rise in Council Tax is unacceptable.\nHowever, we have to remember that the charge was proposed because the Scottish Government cut our Capital’s budget. That is perhaps the bigger problem. Yes, the Council can always be more efficient but the underlying issue is a Government that has other priorities.",
  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_05_02_my-account-oxgangs-ps-parent-council-qa-meeting-about-maintenance-of-the-school_comment-page-1/content_522.html": "This evening I attended a Q&A meeting in Oxgangs Primary School which had the aim of giving parents a chance to ask questions about the design, operation and maintenance of the school.\nThe school has been in the news since a wall on the east end of the building collapsed in 2016. I wasn’t a Councillor back then, but I did spot the wall had collapsed on my walk to work in January 2016 – indeed, the BBC often use the image I took early that morning when I reported it. Later that year I was one of a group of people that went around every door in Colinton-Mains with a handful of Councillors to ask people if they needed help dealing with the temporary closure of the school.\nThese memories are important as much of the Q&A meeting focussed on that time rather than the more recent failures. This focus was because that was the point at which parents lost trust in how the School building is being managed. This is understandable as the school opened too quickly after the wall initially collapsed and had to close again when it became clear that failure was a small part of a much bigger problem.\nIndeed, it is clear from parents this evening that the worry and frustration about how the building is being managed stems back to 2016. They simply feel let down by the Council and ESP, the PFI company that runs the school building. The fact that the Council has now caught up with parents and also lost trust in ESP’s ability to provide a safe teaching environment may be welcome, but many parents feel it is long overdue.\nAndrew Kerr, the Council’s Chief Executive, was clear this evening that the latest problems at the school had meant the contract with ESP was now being securitised and payments to them (over £1.5m per month for 17 schools) were being withheld. On ESP’s failure to attend the Q&A meeting, he was clear that it was “wholly reprehensible for them not to face the community they had let down”. ESP did, however, provide this statement.\nRon Fishie (Director) and John Paterson (Operations Director) from AMEY, the company who maintains the school for ESP, gave a clear apology to parents and said the standard of service they had provided had been acceptable. AMEY recognised that they had lost the trust of the school community, but were determined to rebuild it.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, it is now clear to me that inspections undertaken in 2016 did not go far enough and ESP can’t be trusted to run the building without independent scrutiny. Within that context, the following changes to how the building is managed look likely to be agreed:\n- At their own cost, ESP will introduce an enhanced monitoring regime undertaken by an independent party.\n- AMEY will publish details of all work and inspections undertaken in the school.\n- The Council will publish details of how the work and inspections undertaken by AMEY is being scrutinised.\nAlthough these changes are simple, the tone in which they were agreed was important. ESP and the Council have a lot of work to do if they want to regain the trust of parents, but it feels like the meeting tonight marked a change to a more constructive relationship. Time will tell!\nThe Council and ESP have a lot to do when it comes to regaining the trust of parents with children at Oxgangs Primary School, but it feels like the meeting was a step in the right direction. In the coming months and years, I will be working with parents to ensure they are not let down again.",

Even before they were formally published, the combined forces of UK and Scottish nationalism were lined up to argue against his progressive platform. They fear the real change Richard Leonard is offering as they know it threatens the status quo they both cherish.\nTwelve hours after being inspired by Scottish Labour’s alternative budget I was faced with the harsh reality of a meeting convened to plan the implementation of the SNP’s cuts on our Capital. The contrast between Richard Leonard’s optimism and the brutal reality of what the SNP is imposing on Edinburgh could not be starker.\nDecisions the SNP have made to cut the tax paid by some above average earners, many of whom earn over £50k per year, mean that Edinburgh’s budget must be balanced on the backs of the poorest in our Capital. This is austerity.\nThe list of services under threat is long and heavily features services for families. For example, library budgets face cuts – this is a move which will surely make it harder to reverse the decline in education across Scotland. This is austerity.\nAlso under huge pressure are the proposals to tackle “holiday hunger” – the plan to ensure children from low income households have access to nutritious food 365 days a year is under threat. Likewise, my proposal to increase the School Uniform Grant to at least the national average may well be scrapped. These proposals, which could have helped kids from the very poorest households get a better start in life, may well now be quietly dropped alongside plans to better fund services for children with additional support needs. In short, policies designed to help slow the rise in child poverty in Edinburgh may be cut. This is austerity.\nWorse than the direct cuts being forced on Edinburgh, is the funding gap we are faced within key areas. The under-funding of Police Scotland and the unfunded pay rise for Council staff will cost Edinburgh almost £5m this year. This is austerity.\nThe only hope for Edinburgh now is that progressive minds in Holyrood can combine to oppose Nicola Sturgeon and make the argument along with Richard Leonard for investing in the potential of the Scottish people. Further to this, our capital’s administration must also live up to its commitment to fight austerity.",

I was born just a few days before Apollo 11 was launch and grew up when it and the other missions were still very much spoken about.\nIn 2017 I visited the Apollo 11 launch site to see another rocket being launched, and really was struck by the scale of what was achieved after JKF said “We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard” in 1963.\nWhen I returned from Florida I read a book by Gene Kranz called “Failure was not an option”. This was not a fiction book, but it did tell the amazing true story of how around the time I was born in 1969 approximately 400,000 people worked together to build the 2,800 tonne Saturn V rocket that took men to the moon (there were no women astronauts then!).\nThat book told me that when we work together, we can achieve anything.

This money should help transform it from a car park to a place designed for people, and all involved in the project should be warmly congratulated for the time and energy they have invested in it.\nIt is worth thinking about, however, where the Scottish Government found the money. Research published by Holyrood in July showed that although the Scottish Government’s Revenue has fallen by 2.8% between 2013-14 and 2018-19, they have chosen to cut Council funding over the same period by 7.5%. This manifests itself in Edinburgh in the form of a social care system in crisis, cratered pavements, blocked drains, full litter bins, rampant weeds and schools where teachers buy the pencils. Frankly, at times I am embarrassed at the state of our city and utterly frustrated by these cuts.\nSo Micheal Matheson MSP (Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity) turning up with funding for George Street is akin to a burglar clearing out my house and coming back the next day with a couple of DVDs he didn’t fancy.\nIt’s little wonder that the only Edinburgh Councillors that turned up to meet Matheson to take part in the charade were nationalists, others may have been tempted to ask where there rest of our money was.\nThe reality is that Councils should not have to submit “bids” and “compete” for money to be “awarded” to them. This money should be there’s by right, not something they have to bow and scrape for.",

It’s easy to joke about people peeing in public, but it is disgusting and rightly an offence.\nFor those that don’t know, Parkrun is a completely free 5km (3.2 miles) run held in parks across the UK every Saturday, and often also Christmas Day and New Year’s Day. These are inclusive events which welcome elite runners alongside couch potatoes, children and people with disabilities. Recent weeks saw everything at Parkrun from an octogenarian completing her 250th run to the total distance now covered by all runners exceeding 149,597,870 kilometres.\nEdinburgh is blessed with two Parkruns (Portobello and Cramond), plus a third nearby at Vogrie Country Park. On a typical Saturday morning well over 1,000 people will complete these courses. That’s 1,000 children and adults taking part in a community organised event where all that’s needed to take part is a pair of trainers.\nI have now completed 152 runs, 141 of them at Cramond where I also try to volunteer once per month. Parkrun has helped me hugely – after I had my cardiac pacemaker fitted in December 2015 it was a key part of how I recovered my health and confidence. Others use it to lose weight, spend time with friends or simply build up their fitness.\nThe people taking part in Portobello Parkrun are no different. Each of the 5 times I have completed that Parkrun with my son I have been amazed by the range of people taking part. Alongside grannies there are elite runners. Alongside people running with their dogs there are mums running with the babies in buggies. This diversity is what makes Parkrun so special.\nThe pride I have in being a Parkrunner is why I am so angry with those that undermine what it stands for with their behaviour. Before every single Parkrun we are reminded that we must respect other park users and the local community. Portobello Parkrun specifically tells runners to “use the toilet before you leave home in the morning” and makes them aware that public toilets are nearby.\nI don’t speak for Parkrun, but I’m sure I speak for all Parkrunners when I say that people that disrespect Parkrun, park users or the local community are simply not welcome at Parkrun.",

  "https_drscottarthur_scot_/https_drscottarthur_scot_2018_09_15_update-campbell-park-asset-transfer-consultation-2/content_567.html": "I am fortunate enough to have 4 large urban parks and several much loved playparks in my Ward. Key to my job as a Councillor is a duty to protect these spaces and ensure they are well used.\nIn recent months I played a small part in getting Fairmilehead Park its Green Flag Award, I helped Oxgangs Trinity FC be allocated Colinton Mains Park as their “home ground” and most recently I’ve been working with Pentland Community Centre to find the £100k needed to upgrade the neighbouring playpark.\nOne park, however, has taken up more of my energy in recent times than any other: Campbell Park. This is situated just off Woodhall Road and comprises a large sports field, a pavilion and a playpark for younger children. The area was orginally donated to the community by a local farmer and has been much loved since it was dedicated as a recreation area in 1936.\nThe challenge the community now faces is that Currie Star Football Club and Edinburgh Cricket Club, both fantastic organisations in their own right, hope to use new Scottish Government legislation to take over the long-term management of the site. They plan to invest tens of thousands of pounds improving the playing surface to make it one of the best natural sports surfaces in the city.\nThis, however, comes with a catch. Once the surface is improved it will be used more intensively by the clubs. I think all Colinton people welcome young people taking part in physical exercise, but the community around the park have voiced legitimate concerns about the impact of over a hundred people arriving at once on an already often unacceptable parking situation and ongoing problems with litter control.\nThe clubs concerned have been running a consultation on their proposals over the summer which they would agree has been botched. A frank discussion took place regarding the proposal at the September Colinton Community Council meeting (where other community groups were well represented) where is was agreed the clubs would start afresh with their consultation.\nA full and proper consultation is important as I have been clear that the proposal can’t proceed unless the community’s questions are answered and they offer their support for the plans put forward by the clubs.",

The reality is that both the SNP and the Tories are out trying to win votes for Theresa May.\nThe SNP know their vote is crumbling both nationally and locally, so their only hope is to split the substantial pro-UK vote element of Ian Murray’s support. They are doing this by claiming the seat is an SNP / Tory marginal, when in fact the Tories are in a distant third place and Labour is fighting it out with the SNP. Nobody can be surprised that the SNP is trying to divide and mislead the public.\nOf course, they don’t mention Ian Murray personally as he has a huge personal vote. I’ve knocked on 1000s of doors for Ian and I’ve lost count of how many people I’ve spoken to that say he’s helped them. It’s this record that explains why people who normally support other parties are happy to back Ian Murray, not just his complete opposition to a second independence referendum. Indeed, his record helped me win my Council seat from the SNP last month.\nThere’s a rumour circulating that Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP candidate plan to pose for victory photographs next to the Morningside Clock on Friday. People in Edinburgh South need to decide if they want to see Nicola Sturgeon and her acolytes or Ian Murray and Kezia Dugdale there on Friday."
