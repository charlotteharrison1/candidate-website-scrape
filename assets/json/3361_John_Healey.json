The Tories dither and delay has meant thousands of shopworkers have needlessly suffered physical and mental injury.\n“We’ve been calling for tougher action on those who assault shop workers for the past 10 years but this government has voted against Labour plans for better protection.\n“Shopworkers have reported that they’ve been spat at, threatened with knives and faced verbal abuse. It’s important that we respect our shopworkers who provide an important service. Abuse should not be part of the job.”\nJohn has previously backed Usdaw’s Freedom from Fear campaign and shocking statistics from the union’s annual survey of members last year revealed that:\n• 65% have experienced verbal abuse\n• 42% were threatened by a customer\n• 5% were assaulted\n• 60% of incidents were triggered by shoplifting\nThe Labour Party announced plans earlier this week to tackle anti-social behaviour and shoplifting so that people feel safe when they go out to shop, eat or socialise in their local high street.\nThe plans include putting 13,000 more neighbourhood police and PCSOs back on the beat and scrapping the Tories’ £200 rule which stops shoplifting being investigated.",

Abuse should not be part of the job.\n“Labour would create a new specific offence of assault against retail workers. We will reverse the Conservative Government’s decision to downgrade the response to shoplifting under £200, to make it easier to take action against repeat offenders and return to proper neighbourhood policing.”\nThis week is annual Respect for Shopworkers Week which aims to highlight the issues faced by public facing workers and make it clear that abuse is not part of the job.\nThe annual Respect for Shopworkers Week runs from 13-19 November, with Usdaw members also raising awareness of the union’s year-round Freedom from Fear Campaign.\nYou can find out more here: USDAW – Respect for Shopworkers Week",

  "http_www_johnhealey_net/http_www_johnhealey_net_2024_03/content_3.html": "Transport Secretary should end taxi sub-contracting loophole\nJohn Healey has written to the Transport Secretary calling on him to end the taxi sub-contracting loophole enabling drivers to avoid Rotherham’s high standards.\nThere’s an increasing problem of taxi companies being\nable to sub-contract fares and bookings to an out of Rotherham company which\nthen uses drivers and vehicles licenced by a different authority to the one\nwhere the original company is based.\nRotherham Council implemented significant improvements\nto local policy from 2015 for Hackney Carriage and Private Hire licensing. The\nchanges brought about much higher standards and expectations for taxi drivers\nand vehicles in the borough.\nThe new standards included requirements for applicants\nsuch as: completing a BTEC Level 2 certificate; completion of an approved\ncourse on safeguarding children and vulnerable people; completing an advanced\ndriving skills test to DVSA standard; and the need for the vehicle to have a\ntaxi camera system installed.\nIn his letter to the Minister John says: “I understand\nthe Government introduced this concept of sub-contracting after making\namendments to private hire legislation through the Deregulation Act 2015. This\nchange has now made it lawful for a Private Hire operator to accept a booking\nand then sub-contract it to another operator that is licensed by a different\nlocal authority.\n“I’m very concerned this loophole is allowing drivers\nand vehicles to circumvent our high requirements in Rotherham and obtain a\nlicence from an area where the standards are lower. This would then allow such\nindividuals to work in our borough even though they may have previously had\ntheir licence refused or revoked by Rotherham.\n“This is clearly highlighted in the example of\nWolverhampton City Council where I understand they currently licence just under\na staggering 40,000 taxi drivers, compared to just around 1,200 licensed by\nRotherham. This is even more stark when you consider the populations of Wolverhampton\nand Rotherham are very similar as shown in the Census 2021 data, with\nWolverhampton at just below a population of 264,000 compared to just below\n266,000 in our borough. I’m also informed that our taxi driver levels have\nremained relatively constant in our borough but levels in Wolverhampton have\nincreased significantly since 2015.”\nIn his letter John explained: “My concern then was the\nsame as now, that taxi passengers are better protected and the taxi trade is\nproperly licensed. Ten years on, there has been no Government action on\nnational safeguards or standards.",

Labour will work with banks and, where necessary, bring in new powers for the Financial Conduct Authority to stop people being left in ‘banking deserts’ guaranteeing communities access to face-to-face banking services.\nJohn secured a banking hub for Wath from LINK earlier this year after the town was left without any bank branches.\nJohn Healey said: “Many people feel that banks are pushing them to use online banking and removing face to face banking services.\n“But there are lots of people that only bank in branch and don’t feel comfortable with online banking. Local businesses also need somewhere to go to access funding and deposit cash that isn’t miles away.\n“Labour’s plan will bring banking services back to communities who have seen them disappear over recent years, meaning more people across the country will be able to access the services they need closer to home.”\nWhile the Conservatives have delivered just a handful banking hubs, Labour’s plan could see at least 350 banking hubs established on local high streets and, as hubs are shared by the major banks, customers from almost every bank can use the hub.\nThe plans come as Labour reveals the shocking lack of banking services available on British high streets. Almost half of bank branches in the UK have shut since the Conservatives won their majority in 2015, with Yorkshire losing nearly two thirds of bank branches.\nAlongside the plans to bring back banking to communities Labour will also back the great British high street with plans to:\n- Give councils the power to tackle shuttered up shops\n- Tackle antisocial behaviour and shoplifting through dedicated police patrols\n- Replace business rates with a fairer system\n- End late payments to support small businesses.",

We need our steel – that is why a Labour government will invest £3billion into securing the industry’s long-term future.”\nTata formally responded to reject the Multi-Union Plan that Community and GMB unions presented to the company and announced a £1.25 billion investment in Electric Arc Furnace technology in Port Talbot, backed by the Government.\nIn addition to the threat to jobs and steel communities, the proposal would slash the UK’s steelmaking capacity by nearly 1 megatonne, make the country highly reliant on a UK scrap supply chain that does not yet exist, and without any blast furnaces, end the UK’s ability to make virgin/primary steel leaving the industry highly reliant on imports.",

It’ll take pride and place on the wall of my office.\nA print copy of “The Thousand Yard Stare” was given to John by The Daparian Foundation, a veteran and emergency services staff PTSD research organisation which was set up to help improve the lives of those living with trauma.\nThe group were given the rights to the image by the artist, Steve Stonestreet, and auctioned the original painting to help UK veterans with PTSD through targeted support.\n“The painting is thought provoking and helps you to understand the challenges faced by veterans suffering with PTSD on a daily basis.\n“The group do some great work supporting veterans and carry out important research to help those experiencing trauma.”\nIt comes as figures show veterans’ homelessness rose by 14% in the year 2022-23 compared to the previous year.\nLabour’s analysis of the latest quarterly homelessness statistics has found there are around 500 veterans’ households being made newly homeless every three months – up to 180 households a month.\nData shows that 2,110 households containing someone who served in the Armed Forces were assessed as homeless, up from 1,850 in the previous year.\nJohn Healey said: “Labour is deeply proud of our Armed Forces personnel, veterans, and their families for the enormous contribution they make to our country. But they are being let down by this Government.\n“Ministers have created a postcode lottery for veterans, halved employment support and more veterans are homelessness this year than last year.\n“In Government, Labour will fully incorporate the Armed Forces Covenant into law, fulfilling the moral contract our society makes with those who serve and make sure that former personnel have easy access to high quality, affordable homes fit for our heroes.”",

The\nchanges brought about much higher standards and expectations for taxi drivers\nand vehicles in the borough.\nThe new standards included requirements for applicants\nsuch as: completing a BTEC Level 2 certificate; completion of an approved\ncourse on safeguarding children and vulnerable people; completing an advanced\ndriving skills test to DVSA standard; and the need for the vehicle to have a\ntaxi camera system installed.\nIn his letter to the Minister John says: “I understand\nthe Government introduced this concept of sub-contracting after making\namendments to private hire legislation through the Deregulation Act 2015. This\nchange has now made it lawful for a Private Hire operator to accept a booking\nand then sub-contract it to another operator that is licensed by a different\nlocal authority.\n“I’m very concerned this loophole is allowing drivers\nand vehicles to circumvent our high requirements in Rotherham and obtain a\nlicence from an area where the standards are lower. This would then allow such\nindividuals to work in our borough even though they may have previously had\ntheir licence refused or revoked by Rotherham.\n“This is clearly highlighted in the example of\nWolverhampton City Council where I understand they currently licence just under\na staggering 40,000 taxi drivers, compared to just around 1,200 licensed by\nRotherham. This is even more stark when you consider the populations of Wolverhampton\nand Rotherham are very similar as shown in the Census 2021 data, with\nWolverhampton at just below a population of 264,000 compared to just below\n266,000 in our borough. I’m also informed that our taxi driver levels have\nremained relatively constant in our borough but levels in Wolverhampton have\nincreased significantly since 2015.”\nIn his letter John explained: “My concern then was the\nsame as now, that taxi passengers are better protected and the taxi trade is\nproperly licensed. Ten years on, there has been no Government action on\nnational safeguards or standards.",
