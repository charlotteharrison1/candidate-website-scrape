I've proudly called this town home for 20 years, living in the heart of our ward with my wife and two boys.\nI work for a local company, and my children attend Banks Lane and Stockport School, where I also serve as a governor.\nAs a Manor resident, I understand what makes our area special and where improvements are needed. Since being elected, I've continued with the rest of the Manor Labour team for regular litter picks because action speaks louder than words.\nWoodbank Memorial Park and Vernon Park are gems of our community, and I’m committed to fast-tracking their improvements, starting with playgrounds at Woodlands and Woodbank.\nTackling anti-social behaviour is a key priority. I'm working closely with the police, schools, community groups, and the council to find long-term solutions that make our neighbourhood safer.\nAffordable housing remains one of my main goals. I'm pushing for more housing options across the borough, ensuring these developments include the essential facilities that residents need.\nNo matter your political stance, I'm here to represent you. Feel free to reach out through the contact details on this site, and I look forward to continuing to work hard for Manor."
