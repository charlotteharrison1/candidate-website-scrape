  "https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_/https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_news_window-westminster-15-february-2024/content_29.html": "Last Friday I hosted my third of Blyth Valley Apprenticeships Fair with the DWP at Concordia Leisure Centre in Cramlington. Supported by over 30 of the region’s best employers, almost 400 visitors attended the fair, many of them young people. I'm sure that over the next few months dozens of people will make a start in or a change to an exciting new career as a direct result of attending the fair. I’d like to publicly offer huge thanks to the DWP and the all of the employers for making the effort to attend and showing what excellent opportunities there are locally.\nThe day before we hosted a visit by Gillian Keegan, Secretary of State for Employment, to the Offshore Renewable Energy catapult in Blyth in the morning and another visit by Clare Coutinho, Secretary of State for Energy Security to EDF Energy at the Port of Blyth. We then had a trip out on a boat around an offshore wind farm in the North Sea off the coast of Blyth. It was a fascinating visit but I don’t have sea legs and I was glad to be back on dry land at the end.\nTwo Secretaries of State visiting Blyth Valley in the same day must be unprecedented and it demonstrates the Government's commitment to our area. They see the potential we have in the renewable energy sector and are supporting people here with investments to create more jobs and more opportunity.\nI tend to stay away from pure politics in this column, but I have not been impressed with events in the Labour Party in recent days. Keir Starmer's initial support for his candidate in Rochdale is a real worry and demonstrates that nothing much has really changed in their party. Anybody holding those views should not be allowed to stand for parliament. Mr Starmer’s claim to have acted decisively was laughable when he finally withdrew his support for the candidate making those appalling comments.\nThis week is English Tourism week, a great opportunity to get out and about and see what’s on your doorstep. For starters, I’d recommend a walk along the beach from Blyth to Seaton Sluice or a visit to Seaton Delaval Hall or to Northumberlandia. There’s lots more in Blyth Valley of course.",
  "https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_/https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_news_northumberland-line-update-0/content_13.html": "Progress on the Northumberland is going really well and it will be open for passenger services this year. It was my pleasure to welcome the Minister of State for Rail, Huw Merriman MP to travel on the Northumberland Line route and visit some of the stations. We departed from Newcastle Central Station and had an update form the project manager about the achievements, challenges and developments of each station. The Northumberland Line is the governments flagship rail project as part of their £500m investment in our rail networks and is now nearing completion.\nLater this year passengers will be able to get the train from Ashington through to Newcastle directly. It was exciting to journey on a Northern train through Northumberland Park, Seaton Delaval, Newsham, Bebside, Bedlington and Ashington to see the huge progress that has been made.\nWe also had the opportunity to have a roundtable with stakeholders to hear specifics on the developments, technology updates, construction and timelines. One of the real stand out moments for me during the visit was standing on top of the new road bridge in Newsham and having a freight train pass beneath.\nThis rail link will have a huge impact to the community and it has been announced that fares will start at £1 - great news.",
  "https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_/https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_news_blog-week-ending-21st-april/content_7.html": "On Monday morning I arrived in Westminster early to catch up after parliamentary recess. I had a lot of post and briefings to go through in the London office before the official business of the day began. My first meeting of the day was the Ministers meeting for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. This is a chance for the parliamentary private secretaries of the department to feed back to Minister Gove on updates and any new concerns. I was able to share the fantastic news that our Conservative run Northumberland County Council have agreed an investment worth up to £10 BILLION at the former BritishVolt site after months of toil and hard work behind the scenes. This deal with Blackstone / QTS is set to put Northumberland at the heart of the Artificial Intelligence revolution with a colossal AI campus. This is one of the biggest ever private investments into the UK. It will create up to 1600 direct jobs during operation with thousands more in supply chain and construction. I have worked closely with the Council and Government to ensure the best possible outcome for the Blyth Estuary, South East Northumberland and the wider region. The initial construction jobs and then the longer-term jobs on the site will continue the transformation of our area and I will be doing everything I can to make sure that as many of these jobs as possible go to local people. The spin offs for education and skills development will be outstanding.\nFrom here I held our weekly team meeting with both parliamentary staff based in Westminster and in the constituency. We discussed ongoing casework, workloads and the diary for the upcoming couple of weeks. I was also sad to see our parliamentary intern leaving us for pastures new, Yasmine was a fantastic member of the team, and I am delighted she has now found a full-time position in parliament due to the experience she received in my office.\nI then headed to the chamber as I had six votes. Once voting was completed, I attended an event with Defence Secretary Grant Shapps, he shared that our UK defence spending is at its highest level in history. He stated that we must rise to the challenges of an increasingly dangerous world and ensure we're able to protect our nation's interests. I posted on my Facebook page some of the staggering defence stats which showcase our military strength as a country. I left parliament around 9.45pm.\nThe following day I had a constituency surgery with a local charitable organisation regarding funding. Then I went along to Westminster Hall to meet a couple who I had organised a tour for, I was delighted to hear they enjoyed their tour and even had the chance to sit down and have a cup of tea and a chat. I didn’t have much time before I was required in a Westminster Hall debate on Citizen’s assemblies and local democracy supporting Minister Hoare. This was an interesting debate and highlighted the importance of using your vote. Often, especially when the topic/bill is emotive, I receive more comments on Facebook than I receive emails for action or requests for constituent surgeries. I cannot stress the importance of turning up to vote instead of sharing content online. The local elections on 2nd May are your chance to vote for your North East Mayor, your Police and Crime Commissioner and your local councillor.\nI then had a meeting with the North East and North Cumbria Integrated Care Board for an update on dentistry and GP appointment stats in the area.\nFrom here I went to my weekly meeting with my fellow Parliamentary Private Secretaries for an update and to discuss the arrangements for future Tea Room surgeries whereby other MPs can arrange a time slot and discuss specific matters from their constituency. After this we had several votes including the free vote on the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, I took the decision to vote with the government to make it an offence to sell tobacco products to those born on or after 1st January 2009. After having a long career in the NHS, I have seen first-hand the devastating consequences of smoking. This bill also sets out to reduce the appeal and availability of vaping products, introducing a ban on the free distribution of vaping products to under 18s. It was a late one leaving the chamber, so I headed back to the flat to get some rest ahead of another busy day.\nWednesday morning, I went to CCHQ (Conservative Campaign Head Quarters) to hear from the Party Chairman & Isaac Levido on the latest polling data and ensure we are going into the General Election campaign in the best possible position. From here I walked to the Westminster office to write my question in the hopes of being selected for an oral question in PMQ’s that afternoon. I wanted to highlight Northumberland County Council’s announcement of up to £10 billion of investment into the AI campus on which will bring around 1700 jobs to the Blyth Estuary. This shows what can be achieved with a Conservative County Council and a Conservative Government after decades of Labour neglect.\nThat afternoon I met with the CEO of Transport for the North, following many constituents contacting me via email and on social media to raise concerns about poor/cancelled bus services in Blyth Valley. I want to work with the local authority and Arriva to find a meaningful solution. This daily disruption cannot carry on. Following this event, I attended the Environmental Audit committee and was delighted to hear we will be hosting the Chair and Chief Executive of the Environmental Agency regarding sewage and sea pollution next week.\nI then had the pleasure to sponsor an event in the Speakers House in parliament in partnership with Liz Twist MP and Suicide Bereavement UK. This was to launch the Suicide Bereavement UK's, At Your Side suicide bereavement guides for the Armed Forces Community which were commissioned by the NHS to help service men and women, their families and veterans. Sadly, many people who have been impacted by a suicide have a significantly higher risk of dying by suicide themselves. These guides have been developed to break that chain and save lives. This was a very important event for me to sponsor in parliament, after years of working within mental health I have seen the devastation suicide leaves behind. I will be sharing these guides at my next Veterans roundtable in May and with my colleagues at the Royal British Legion Blyth branch. Thank you again to Dr Sharon McDonnell for inviting me to be a part of this launch. I did have to leave early due to vote but then, once the business was complete for the day, I left around 8pm to travel on the Tube to the Science Museum for the 2024 Offshore Wind Industrial Growth Plan launch. It was an absolute privilege to hear about the innovation being carried out within the green energy sector in the UK.\nI met with representatives from Catapult and the Port of Blyth, and we listened to key stakeholders in the industry about our global leadership within advanced turbine technologies, systems and cables manufacturing and smart environmental services. We heard from the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, Claire Couthino about this collaborative plan for growth to triple UK’s offshore wind supply chain manufacturing, boost the UK economy by £25billion and create tens of thousands of jobs.\nOn Thursday morning I worked in the office until around 11.30am and started the long drive home to Blyth Valley. I was disgusted to see the red paint defacing the Ministry of Defence buildings. This is disgraceful behaviour and I was glad to hear that arrests had been made. Whilst travelling home, I had a call to say that I would be required in Westminster next week (I was due to have a week working and campaigning in the constituency) as the Rwanda bill is set to go through parliament on Monday.\nFriday morning, I had several constituency surgeries, then a meeting with the newly appointed Chief Constable for Northumbria Police, Vanessa Jardine. This was a very productive meeting to discuss local policing and share several issues that local councillors had provided me from their wards. From here I drove to Cramlington to meet with a manager for the Northumberland FA to discuss youth football and what I can do to support our local teams. I listened to the concerns and have since arrange a meeting with the Football Foundation and have scheduled a meeting with Lucy Frazer, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to see what more we can do to support local, youth football.\nFinally, at the weekend I had a fantastic time attending the Fifth Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers St Georges Parade in Ashington followed by a luncheon at Fox Barracks in Cramlington. The parade marked the 350th anniversary of antecedent regiment Northumberland Fusiliers and it was wonderful to see so many people supporting the event.\nOn Sunday I had a wholesome Sunday lunch at home with my family in preparation for another busy (an unexpected) week in Westminster.\nAs always, should you wish to contact me or arrange a surgery, please call 01670 338435 or email [email protected]",

  "https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_/https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_news_blog-week-ending-10th-march/content_5.html": "This week I was based in the constituency, which meant I could get to the office for around 8.30am. I had a catch up with the office manager before jumping on to the weekly Ministers meeting with the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. This meeting is essential to the workings of the department and gives the ministers and their parliamentary private secretaries a chance to report back on MP surgeries and local issues.\nI had lots of paperwork and office related tasks to complete before the team meeting in the afternoon. We have this meeting to bring together the staff from both the Blyth Valley office and Westminster to discuss upcoming events, casework and media. In the evening I visited Elsdon Avenue church in Seaton Delaval to meet with the Beavers, Cubs and Scout leaders. There was a great atmosphere in the session and these groups are fantastic for young people to develop life skills such as leadership, teamwork, resilience and making lifelong friendships. The young people can go camping, have sleepovers and experience new adventures alongside learning. I spoke with Brian about the impact lockdown had on them, I was pleased to hear they are now seeing increased numbers joining the groups. They currently have spaces for young people in all sections to join, which cover ages from 6-14yrs. I want to personally thank Brian, the volunteers and the children for a brilliant visit and for doing so much for the local community. I am looking forward to attending more events in the future.\nTuesday, I spent the morning in Cramlington to chat with residents about their priorities ahead of the general election. I did not have as much time as usual as I was heading to Westminster on the train in the afternoon to be in parliament ready for the Spring Budget. I got to London around teatime and had a quick catch up with Tim Harding, Head of Government Relations & Public Affairs at Catapult in Blyth. It is always fantastic to hear about the projects and opportunities in our area.\nThe following day I arrived early in the London office for a call with the Long-Term Plan for Towns stakeholders to discuss the strategy for the new deal board. It is massively exciting for Blyth and the town centre with huge investment happening right now. Since 2019, my residents in Cramlington, Seaton Valley, and Blyth have received significant funding for our cultural assets including:\n- £16.5 million pounds Blyth Marketplace Culture Hub and Market improvements which will contain:\no An exhibition space dedicated to local art\no An independent three-screen cinema\no Children’s play provision\no A performance area/stage\no Food and beverage offering\n- The Culture Hub project is scheduled to be complete by August 2025.\n- Headway Arts Covid recovery fund £90,250.\n- Isabella heap, East Cramlington Local Nature Reserve, and Valley Park QEII commemoration schemes.\n- Tall Ships £170,000 Culture and heritage funding.\n- Theatre N16 Group £61,000 Culture and heritage funding.\n- Seaton Delaval Hall £316,000 Historic England Fund, with a further £160,000 culture recovery fund.\n- Plus over £17,000 awarded to grassroots football clubs and schools in 2023 for pitch upgrades.\nThere is much to be excited about in our area.\nFrom here I attended PMQs for the Spring Budget. Taken together with the measures at the Autumn Statement, the now 4% cut to the National Insurance you pay means someone on the average salary will save around £900 a year. £720 for the average bricklayer, £1,054 for the average nurse, and £1,270 for the average teacher or police officer. We’re Supporting half a million families through changes to Child Benefit Charges by raising the threshold and halving the rate at which Child Benefit is withdrawn, benefiting some parents by an average of £1,260. By April 2026 we will also end the unfairness for single earner families. We are extending the temporary 5p cut in fuel duty rates for a further 12 months and have cancelled the planned inflation increase. Supporting our drivers. Saving motorists an average £250 per car since this cut was introduced in 2022, a £3.1 billion tax cut for drivers! The VAT registration threshold will be increased from £85,000 to £90,000 from April 1st. We are supporting and reforming the NHS with £2.45 billion for next year and a new £3.4 billion productivity plan, saving money, freeing up clinicians’ time to focus on patients, and cut wait times. For pensioners, the state pension will rise by 8.5% next month - more than double the current rate of inflation. Inflation is now expected to be down to 2% or less by the summer.\nThe choice is clear – you can stick with the plan that is working under the Conservatives which will deliver a brighter future for the country or go back to square one with Keir Starmer and Labour, who can’t say what they’d do, because they don’t have a plan. Labour would fill the economy with mass migration to artificially bump up GDP, while we are bringing genuine support for workers and businesses across our nation.\nI then had a meeting with the Environmental Audit Committee before leaving to catch a train at Kings Cross. When I got to the station, all the trains had cancelled and after waiting a good while, I returned to my accommodation.\nThe following morning, I got on an early train from London back to the constituency, due to issues with travel I then missed a World Book Day visit to Seaton Sluice first school which was terribly disappointing and I had to rearrange a meeting with Cllr David Ferguson to discuss facilities for Seaton Sluice Football Club.\nIn the evening, I campaigned in Wideopen, this town will be a part of the new Cramlington & Killingworth seat to which I am a candidate for the next election.\nFriday morning, I took my nephew on a visit to the new welding centre by the Port of Blyth, and at their construction centre in Seghill where school leavers are able to learn valuable skills that will set them up for future careers. For many young people in our area, university may not be for them, however these courses can provide excellent pathways into employment in some of our fastest growing sectors.\nTheir free construction taster sessions are perfect if you’re aged 15+ and thinking about what’s next after you leave school:\n- Multi Skills\n- Electrical\n- Plastering, dry lining, and interior systems.\nIn the evening I met with Lisa Mavin, her family and friends at the services club to launch a petition for stronger sentences for those who drive under the influence, speed, drive negligently and causes death. I will be supporting the families of Corey and Connor with their petition, and I will be looking to host a Westminster Hall debate on the subject with urgency.\nThe weekend was spent with family and friends before getting ready to head back to Westminster on Monday morning. As always, should you wish to contact me or if you would like to arrange a face-to-face or telephone surgery, please call 01670 338435 or email [email protected]",

  "https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_/https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_about-ian-levy/content_10.html": "About Me\nIan was born in Blyth on 14th February 1966 and was educated at Crofton, Delaval middle and Ridley high school. His family can trace his ancestry back 500 years in the town and spent much of his childhood as a farmhand in South Beach.\nIan had a long career in the NHS as an auxiliary nurse working within mental health. The turning point in his journey to becoming an Member of Parliament began on a walk home from a local restaurant with his wife Maureen. Blyth was once a bustling market town but all Ian saw now was a huge decline and neglect. Maureen told him to stop moaning and do something about it. So he did.\nThen in December 2019, Ian was returned as the Member of Parliament for Blyth Valley in the general election. The first Conservative candidate to gain a seat in Blyth Valley in its history.\nSince then, Ian has brought in an astonishing investment of £379million into the constituency including securing £140million for the Northumberland Line. The economic benefits of the train line is staggering in reducing congestion and journey times, increasing inward investment into to South East Northumberland, increasing property values, giving easier access to metropolitan areas and new jobs in construction using local people where possible.\nIan is passionate about STEM development in Blyth Valley and is supporting the efforts of bringing a University Technical College to the area. Funding was secured for the new Education Hub at the Port of Blyth and construction has already begun.\nIan also serves as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Rt Hon Grant Shapps the Secretary of State to Defence. In this role Ian supports the Secretary of State, and all of the Defence Ministers with their parliamentary responsibilities, bringing forward important legislation that will support our national defence, veterans and global matters such as the war in Ukraine.\nIn 2023 the boundary commission announced the creation of two new constituencies. Blyth & Ashington and Cramlington & Killingworth, splitting the current patch of Blyth Valley in two. Ian already represented 9 of the 14 wards in the Cramlington & Killingworth seat so many local people there already know how committed he is to the area. Ian would have loved to carry on representing the same constituents and it was a difficult decision, but, he has now confirmed his position to stand as the conservative candidate for Cramlington & Killingworth.\nIan is committed to seeing the area prosper and attain its full potential and will also continue to champion the whole area, aiming to secure more projects to bring opportunity to the North East.",
  "https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_/https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_news_918-premises-blyth-valley-have-access-fastest-broadband/content_20.html": "Project Gigabit, the Conservative Government’s flagship policy to connect properties with the best internet speeds, has now upgraded broadband connectivity to more than one million properties. 91.8% of premises in Blyth Valley now have access to the fastest broadband, allowing them to connect to the internet seamlessly, making work and leisure easier thanks to the Conservative Government sticking to the plan to deliver a brighter future.\nI welcome the news that 91.8% of premises in Blyth Valley now have access to superfast broadband thanks to the Conservative Government sticking to its plan to deliver ‘Project Gigabit’. Our Government announced Project Gigabit in 2019 – a flagship £5 billion programme to enable hard-to-reach communities access to lightning-fast gigabit-capable broadband. By sticking to this plan, gigabit coverage across the UK has increased rapidly in recent years – from one in ten households in 2019 to eight in ten today.\nThe majority of premises can now access gigabit-capable networks and is a significant improvement in a short timeframe, with the UK currently building gigabit networks faster than any EU country.\nBetter connectivity boosts productivity for businesses and unlocks new digital opportunities for people in every corner of the country, as the Conservative Government sticks to the plan to help to grow the economy and create a brighter future for all.\nFamilies and businesses across Blyth Valley rely heavily on the internet for work and leisure, so it is brilliant to see the Conservative Government delivering on ‘Project Gigabit’.\nWith 91.8% of premises across Blyth Valley now having a superfast broadband connection, it’s clear the Conservative Government’s plan to level up broadband is working. This is making work and leisure faster for people and helping to grow our local economy, as the Conservative government sticks to the plan to create a brighter future for all.\nAchieving a million gigabit-ready premises shows our plan to turbocharge British broadband is working. Thanks to our investment, rural communities held back by achingly slow internet can now tap into the best speeds on the market.",
  "https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_/https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_news_statement-ukraine/content_35.html": "The situation in Ukraine is deeply troubling and it is essential that we stand square and work with our European and NATO allies to exert all pressure on Russia to halt this act of aggression. I have a great deal of respect and admiration for this independent sovereign nation which upholds democracy and western values. Its Government, overwhelmingly endorsed by its people in the most recent elections, have made clear their determination to join the free nations of the Western World and in due course to become members of the EU and NATO. As an independent sovereign state, they are fully entitled to do so. It is their success which so frightens President Putin whose declared ambition is to restore the power and borders of the Soviet Union.\nI welcome the responsible supportive approach the vast majority of opposition MP’s have taken. We need to stand unified.\nThe Prime Minister has been clear that we will do what we can to assist refugees from Ukraine. The initial priority was to support British nationals and their dependants who are resident in Ukraine and wanted to get out. Officials are working around the clock to process visa applications and we have multiple routes available for Ukrainians who are not dependants of British nationals. Staff have been sent to centres in nearby countries, including Poland, Moldova, Romania and Hungary, to help those who made it across the border.\nRussia's actions are likely to bring painful consequences for us all in terms of higher energy costs, a surge of refugees and the damage to world order and international law. However, these are small compared to the agonies of the innocent people of Ukraine.\nI very much welcome the leadership that the UK Government has shown both in supporting Ukraine and in seeking the toughest sanctions against Russia. Both must be increased further if Russia continues its aggression. The war that Putin has launched is not just against Ukraine but against democracy and the values that we all hold dear. His willingness to tear up the pledges that Russia has made in the Helsinki Final Act, the UN Charter, and most recently the Minsk Agreements shows that this is not someone who we can trust or do business with. It is essential for global security that his aggression is not allowed to succeed.",

The Government has made the difficult decisions necessary to guide our country and economy through these challenges whilst doing everything possible to protect the most vulnerable in our society.\nKey announcements include:\n✅More money for the NHS, Schools and Social Care, an increase of £11bn in funding over the next 2 years. Improving skills and education in Blyth Valley will help people to take new and better jobs.\n✅Benefits increasing in line with inflation, by 10.1%.\n✅Pension triple lock confirmed meaning pensions will rise more than ever before.\n✅Energy Price Guarantee extended from April 2023 to April 2024.\n✅£12bn extra to support most vulnerable, including £900 for households on means tested benefits, £300 for pensioners, and £150 for those with disabilities.\n✅Increasing National Living wage by 9% to £10.42, raising annual incomes for lower earners by £1,600. That is the largest ever increase.\n✅Social Housing rent increases frozen below inflation.\nThese increases in public spending will be funded through:\n📌An increase in the energy levy on oil and gas companies, from 25% to 35%.\n📌A new 45% temporary levy placed on electricity generators.\n📌Reducing the threshold for the 45p tax rate from £150,000 to £125,140.\n📌Freezing the tax-free allowance for income tax for the next two years.\n📌Cutting the thresholds for capital gains tax, inheritance tax, and dividend tax.",
  "https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_/https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_news_blog-week-ending-3rd-march/content_23.html": "On Monday morning I travelled on the early train to Westminster, when I arrived, I was straight to the weekly ministers meeting with the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. This is an opportunity for ministers and parliamentary private secretaries to come together and discuss both local and national issues. We have been organising many surgeries for Members of Parliament to discuss pressing local issues and keep building on the greater picture of what is needed and what is going well within the workings of the department. Once this meeting had concluded I headed to the Conservative Campaign Head Quarters referred to as CCHQ, to discuss my campaign plan for the new Cramlington and Killingworth seat of which I am a candidate. I have been knocking on doors in the area to chat to residents about their priorities and with this information I can create a plan that will address local issues. I then headed back to the Houses of Parliament in time for voting. My final event of the day was to attend APPG for the Armed Forces briefing with Sir Richard Knighton KCB ADC FREng to be updated on the RAF.\nOn Tuesday I met with Leo Brosh the North East Manager from the Jewish Leadership Council and Danny Stone of Antisemitism Policy Trust to discuss the Israel-Hamas War and how that is affecting the Jewish community and extremism in society.\nI had the privilege to sponsor an event in the Houses of Parliament to support Breaking Down Barriers to Law, the project is about the role local law firms have across the country and the impact they have on local communities. The Attorney General, Rt Hon Victoria Prentis and the Minister of State for Prisons, Rt Hon Ed Argar all spoke at the event, and it was fantastic to see such a great show of effort in developing a series of recommendations for short and long-term action. The nationwide project focuses on the four key areas of outreach, access, recruitment, and progression where those from disadvantaged and underrepresented backgrounds face the greatest barriers.\nI was delighted to welcome Richard Wearmouth, the Deputy Leader of Northumberland County Council and Cabinet member at the North of Tyne Combined Authority to parliament. We had a chance to chat about ongoing projects such as the developments in Blyth Town Centre, the Northumberland Line and the Cambois gigaplant site (the north Blyth site remains the best venue in the country for a gigaplant). This meeting was brief as I then had to support Minister Hoare in surgeries with MPs.\nIn the evening, I attended the British Kebab awards at the Park Plaza in Westminster, unfortunately, the businesses I had nominated did not win. The awards celebrate the rich and diverse culinary heritage of the kebab industry in the UK.\nThe following morning, I was in Westminster early to attend a Delegated Legislation Committee meeting on Non-Domestic Rating (Rates Retention: Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2024 alongside other MPs. This meeting lasted a couple of hours, but I still had time to quickly visit the Breast Cancer awareness event in Portcullis House before Prime Ministers Questions. This is a cause that is close to my heart and I was pleased to show my support for this fantastic charity.\nDuring Prime Ministers Questions the PM paid tribute to Ronnie Campbell and gave his condolences following his sad passing last week. An MP raised Voting without fear, this is an issue which came to the forefront of debate last week when parliament was set to vote on various motions on a Gaza ceasefire, however many of my colleagues have had their offices vandalised, and one having his burnt to the ground. Others have had protestors at their home intimidate them and their families. Countless have had intimidating communications including my own office. Regardless of how MPs vote, and regardless of their political allegiances we must all agree that how we vote must be free from violence and fear. I was incredibly pleased to see the government announce the new dentistry recovery plan, this will create an extra 2.5 million appointments by increasing funding, reforming the UDA formula, and kickstarting new initiatives. Also discussed was the new childcare plan will mean from April thousands more parents will have access to free childcare, a provision we are increasing to 30 free hours for eligible families.\nAfter PMQs I supported Minister Rowley in a Westminster Hall debate on Leasehold Reform and New Homes. I am looking forward to welcoming Minister Rowley to Cramlington in the coming weeks to have a roundtable with residents regarding leasehold issues in our constituency. After all business is the House was resolved, I got the late train back to Blyth Valley and arrived home around 1am.\nThe following day, it was my pleasure to welcome the Minister of State for Rail, Huw Merriman MP to travel on the Northumberland Line route and visit some of the stations. We departed from Newcastle Central Station and had an update form the project manager about the achievements, challenges, and developments of each station. The Northumberland Line is the governments flagship rail project as part of their £500m investment in our rail networks and is now nearing completion. Later this year passengers will be able to get the train from Ashington through to Newcastle directly. It was exciting to journey on a Northern train through Northumberland Park, Seaton Delaval, Newsham, Bebside, Bedlington and Ashington to see the huge progress that has been made. We also had the opportunity to have a roundtable with stakeholders to hear specifics on the developments, technology updates, construction, and timelines. One of the real stand-out moments for me during the visit was standing on top of the new road bridge in Newsham and having a freight train pass beneath. This rail link will have an enormous impact to the community and specific information on fares will be announced in March. I will say that I am working with Northern, Nexus and the government to ensure the fares are as reasonable as possible.\nOn Friday I welcomed David Johnston, Minister for Children, Families and Wellbeing to Blyth Valley. I organised a visit to the The Dales School for the Minister to see their fantastic facilities and meet some of the children and teachers. We were shown around the learning carriages, their gardens and forest school which all help to promote independent life skills, career aspirations, encourage decision making and discovery learning. I have been working closely with the Dales School and wanted to showcase this amazing school and dedicated staff, but also give their Head Teacher Dr Sue Fisher the opportunity to discuss the challenges SEND schools are facing. Visits like this allow opportunity for central government to understand local issues and ultimately, bring action for change.\nI left the ministerial visit early to pay my respects at Ronnie Campbell’s funeral at St Mary’s Church in Blyth. Ronnie was a good man who I know loved Blyth and all the people who lived and worked here.\nA constituent from Seaton Delaval then invited me to cut the ribbon for the opening of the new Chickpizz Food Stop takeaway in Cramlington. They will be serving their delicious chicken and pizza dishes from 3.30pm this afternoon. Best of luck for their new venture. I want to promote as many of our fantastic local businesses as possible and showcase the people who are investing in our towns and villages.\nMy next meeting of the day was with Ian Henderson from the Duality Group to chat about Blyth Valley and decarbonisation. We had met previously at an event in Westminster and invited me to visit his office and discuss the Clean Heat Market Mechanism, critical labour shortage in the UK, decarbonisation of UK home heating and the work they are doing with a Newcastle based charity National Energy Action to help combat fuel poverty. This was an interesting meeting with lots of actionable take aways to discuss in parliament.\nAt the weekend, my wife and I attended a spring ball organised by Hope into Action which is a charity finding homes for the homeless but most importantly, turning their lives around so they can get out of their situation and move on to live full independent lives. It was a wonderful evening, and I was delighted to contribute to such a worthwhile cause.\nOn Sunday afternoon I attended the RNLI 200th Anniversary service at the Central Methodist church in Blyth. It was lovely to see so many people turn up for this community event and my daughter kindly crocheted decorations for their display.\nThis was a busy week both in Westminster and the constituency, our conservative plan is working, and we are seeing results. I am looking forward to the Spring Budget next week.\nAs always, should you wish to contact me or if you would like to book a surgery in person or on the telephone, please contact 01670 338 435 or email [email protected]",

There had been a theft of cables on the East Coast main line, so I wasn’t alone in having my train cancelled and those trains that were running were extremely busy and subject to delays. I eventually made it to Westminster at 4:40pm having missed a number of meetings during the afternoon. Business in the House on Monday was the second day of the report stage of the Online Safety Bill as it makes progress through the House.\nOn Tuesday I met with Rupert De Mauley to discuss getting better facilities for the Army Cadets in Blyth. My own children were Army Cadets for quite some time, and I know how hard the volunteers work to provide developmental opportunities to the children who attend. Later in the day I met with Minister Lopez, Minister of State for Media, Data and Digital Infrastructure to discuss an issue regarding fibre optic installation for DA Chemicals in Seaton Delaval and am delighted to hear that their issues have now been resolved. The National Union of Fire Fighters were conducting a day of action in Westminster, and I had been contacted by Cramlington resident John Percy to discuss the ongoing pay dispute. I enjoyed the opportunity to talk to John about his work at Tyne and Wear Fire Rescue Service and hear his views on the salary negotiations and would like to thank him for taking the time to travel to London to meet with me.\nLater, Tuesday afternoon, I was able to take part in a Westminster Hall debate and spoke in favour of using dormant assets to support a Community Wealth Fund. I will continue to pursue additional support for areas such as Cowpen, Isabella and Kitty Brewster which have all been identified by Local Trust as being ‘left behind’ and was delighted to again be able to mention the good work being carried out by the ‘Forget me Nots’ in Cowpen.\nWednesday saw me attending Prime Minister’s Questions in the House and later at a Tea Room Surgery with Minister Andrew who is the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Sport, Tourism and Civil Society, and Minister for Equalities. I took this opportunity to discuss provision of a running track which is being championed by Blyth Running Club. The remainder of the afternoon was spent on the Environmental Audit Select Committee where we discussed sustainable forestry and timber supplies for the UK building trade. I asked questions on what more the government could do to help and support the forestry trade and whether land should be taken out of arable use particularly while there is a war in Ukraine affecting grain prices.\nI was able to ask two questions of Cabinet Office on Thursday morning. The first was to recognise the work carried out in Blyth Valley by the Royal British Legion who have branches in both Blyth and Cramlington and also by Forward Assist in Dudley where I was invited by volunteer Jack Hearn who recently celebrated his 100th Birthday. I then asked for an assurance that the government would recognise the service of nuclear test veterans and make sure there is proper commemoration of their service.\nFriday was a day of animals – I visited the Cat and Dog Shelter in Newcastle to deliver some warm blankets and to hear about the issues they face. I followed this with a visit to LK9, Doggy Day Care, where I saw the facilities on offer to those needing a little help looking after their pets whilst out at work, or if they are no longer able to provide sufficient exercise due to health reasons. There was even a visit from Santa to meet some of the pampered pooches.\nI stopped off in Dearnley’s Café in Bowes Street where I purchased a delicious toastie and cup of tea. It’s great to see Bowes Street reopened following the refurbishment and I took the time to call into Northumberland Goldsmiths to chat with the owner who is delighted with the additional street parking that has been provided.\nMy afternoon was spent in East Cramlington doing a door-to-door survey to get feedback from residents on their priorities for the NHS and discuss any other concerns they may have. The highlight of my week was a visit to Seaton Delaval Arts Centre (oh no it wasn’t - oh yes it was!!) 😊 to see Aladdin. The cast had great energy and enthusiasm and the show was much enjoyed by everyone. This was 50 years of pantomime at this venue and I got the opportunity to meet the cast after the show. I was particularly impressed with the professionalism shown by such a young cast and look forward to seeing them perform again.\nAs always if I can help in any way, please don’t hesitate to contact me on 01670 338435 or email me at [email protected]",

Blyth Tall Ship is inspired by a little-known part of the area’s past and delivers a future for individuals who wish to undertake industry standard qualifications up to NVQ3 in marine engineering.\nJust over 202 years ago, Seaton Sluice born, and Blyth educated Captain William Smith made the first recorded landing in the British Antarctic Territory on King George Island in the South Shetland Islands. His vessel which was a merchant brig named Williams was subsequently chartered by the Royal Navy to conduct further exploration which resulted in the sighting of Antarctica itself on 30 January 1820.\nThe project has its own 100-year-old plus tall ship which is of similar size to Captain Smith’s, and it has been renovated and appropriately renamed as Williams II. The renovation was undertaken at the project’s unique heritage boatyard on Blyth quayside at almost the same location as the original ship was built.\nOpportunities to sail on Williams II are regularly available. These sailings recreate some of the voyages of William Smith around the UK and include day trips, week long experiences and longer expeditions. The project also offers great experiences for young people and I was delighted to learn that two Kickstart trainees taken on by Blyth Tall Ship went on to successfully secure jobs at the Port of Blyth.\nSpecific training modules include wooden component making, marine engines, wire rigging and marine finishes. There are also opportunities to learn how to lay a keel, fitting planks and decking, rigging a vessel and carrying out all forms of fitting and maintenance. Trainees work alongside volunteers with a lifetime of experience in the offshore and engineering industry.\nBlyth Tall Ship offers a life changing ‘Gangway to the Sea’, that brings hope and aspiration to Blyth Valley by providing skills training and individual development. This is a brilliant approach from a fantastic project, and it is of little surprise that funding has been awarded by the Government and previously by the County Council, Jobcentre Plus, the Rotary Club of Blyth and Awards for All.",

I wish to speak in favour of creating a community wealth fund through the next wave of dormant assets.\nI will briefly outline some of the evidence as to why it is so important and why the core elements behind the idea of a community wealth fund have worked in the past.\nI hope Members will agree that we can work for left-behind neighbourhoods, such as those in Blyth Valley, and supporting the community wealth fund would signal a real commitment to levelling up communities that have been overlooked and forgotten for so long.\nWe know that investment in boosting local connectivity, such as transport, is vital, and I am pleased that we have made great progress with the Northumberland line, reconnecting communities that have suffered as the result of the Beeching cuts to our railways.\nHowever, community regeneration must involve investment in social as well as physical infrastructure, as the progress made by the Forget Me Nots clearly shows.\nI have been working in the Cowpen ward with people who felt that enough was enough, and who have set up a group called the Forget Me Nots — the name says it all about how they feel.\nImagine how much more could be done if proper funding was in place to support such groups.\nRegenerating our communities is no easy task. Areas such as the Cowpen, Isabella and Kitty Brewster wards in my constituency have not only high levels of deprivation but some of the highest levels of community need in the country, with a lack of assets, low levels of community engagement and poor connectivity.\nThe Forget Me Nots now have a place to meet up for a coffee and can host drop-in sessions with crisis management services, such as citizen’s advice bureaux, debt counselling charities and outreach groups.\nThey all make a real difference in their area, and they are the heart of the community.\nThey know better than anyone what support is needed by local residents.\nOur goal should be to make lives better for people in those areas and give them the chance that they have been crying out for. This is our opportunity to do that, using the community wealth fund to change and improve lives. In doing so, we will level up.\nA community wealth fund targeted at building social infrastructure will work to regenerate local communities, and it will do so from the bottom up.\nPioneering and cutting-edge research by Oxford Consultants for Social Inclusion, and shared intelligence from the All-Party Parliamentary Group for ‘Left Behind’ Neighbourhoods, has assessed the additional benefits of community-level interventions.\nIt is robust, and it is factual. Early results indicate that in areas where community-led economic partnerships are active, crime and antisocial behaviour are lower, and there are stronger social relationships and higher levels of participation in local activities than in areas without such interventions.\nThe evidence shows that putting power and resources in the hands of the people who need them works best, and I am hopeful that the Government will ensure that this most important of initiatives benefit from the dormant assets funding needed to make the community wealth fund a reality and truly level up the communities in most need of investment.\nSpeech made in the Westminster Hall debate on Dormant Assets Funding: Community Wealth Funds on Tuesday 6th December 2022.",

  "https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_/https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_news_social-care-rail-and-prime-minister/content_39.html": "In the last fortnight there has been significant debate regarding the Government’s plan to introduce a cap on social care costs and on the £96bn Integrated Rail Plan. Both are complex issues and I want to set out exactly what the proposed changes will mean for Blyth Valley residents.\nThe existing social care system exposes far too many people to unlimited costs with one in seven adults over 65 facing care costs of more than £100,000 during their lifetime. The Government’s plan will put a stop to the lack of certainty on costs faced by introducing an £86,000 cap on the amount that people have to pay for their own care.\nThis means that not one person will be worse off than under the current system and two thirds of people will receive some state support for their costs compared to half at present. People with assets below £20,000 will not have to pay anything for their care through making use of those assets. This is in comparison to £14,250 now and is a part of the more generous means test that is proposed.\nIn addition, the upper capital limit, the point at which people become eligible to receive some financial assistance from their local authority, will increase more than four-fold from £23,450 to £100,000. By the time these reforms are implemented from October 2023 it is estimated that 150,000 people will be benefiting from them at any one time.\nThe Government’s Rail Plan for the North and the Midlands represents the largest and most ambitious programme of investment ever in the railway network encompassing £96bn of rail construction and upgrades to be delivered over the next 30 years. The outcome will be faster journey times including from Newcastle to London, Birmingham, Manchester, and Leeds.\nAn operational Northumberland Line from 2024 will also massively improve Blyth Valley’s accessibility to the national rail network. Services from Cramlington are about to be improved with an earlier morning southbound service at 7.11am due to get underway from 13th December. The future of rail services in Blyth Valley and beyond is therefore a positive one.\nFinally, the Prime Minister was in Blyth Valley for the third time in less than 12 months on Monday when he joined me for a visit to Tharsus in Blyth. It was a great opportunity as it was previously to showcase Blyth Valley at the national level",
  "https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_/https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_news_window-westminster-1st-march-2024/content_34.html": "I was deeply saddened to hear of the passing of my predecessor as Blyth Valley MP, Ronnie Campbell. Ronnie was a good man who I know loved Blyth and all the people who lived and worked here. He was an engaging, lively, straight talking, decent man and although our political views differed, he was always very friendly, generous with his advice and up for a cup of tea and a chat. My thoughts are with Deirdre and the rest of his family at this sad time.\nI attended his funeral service this morning at St. Wildfred's Church in Blyth. As you would expect the church was packed with Blyth people wishing to support his family and pay their respects.\nI visited Northumbria University recently. Around 50% of their students are from the North East and they are very excited about the opportunities that the Northumberland Line will bring. Students along the line, from Ashington, Bedlington, Blyth, the Seaton Valley and around Northumberland Park will all have easy access to this excellent University on their doorstep without having to rack up debt paying for accommodation in Newcastle. Potential students will also have easier access to Kirkley Hall.\nAhead of next week’s budget the Chancellor has been speaking to the One Nation group of Conservative MPs in Westminster and highlighted that the IMF expect UK inflation to be lower than EU and US inflation by the end of the year, that people on lower wages are 25% better off than in 2010 and that many pensioners have had a £900 triple lock rise this year. When I met with the Chancellor, I highlighted the need for work to Moor Farm roundabout, further funding for the Northumberland line and more money for potholes. There is still much to do on the economy after the twin shocks of Covid and the war in Ukraine but the Chancellor and the Prime Minister are relentless in push forward as quickly as possible.\nThere has been much in the national press recently about MPs being able to go about their business with fear of intimidation or harassment. It’s important for all elected officials at every level and of every party and for our democracy. I have experienced a situation where libellous accusations have been made against me in a sustained campaign of harassment and despite one individual having to pay a substantial five figure sum for the harm to me, my family and my staff there are others who continue to do that.

If passed this bill would see that people who come to the UK illegally from a safe country would be sent to Rwanda, East Africa. Our country is ready for this process to begin and has commercial charter planes scheduled and a team of highly skilled professionals in place to manage the physical removal of illegal migrants from the UK.\nI read the recent article on the BBC about the overcrowded inflatable boat that was set up to illegally take 40 people including children across the channel. The traffickers allowed a last-minute influx of men to pay their way on to the boat which resulted in a crush, killing five of the people onboard. I pushed myself to read the desperate words from a father who despite great effort could not save his young daughter. This is why we must go ahead with this bill. To protect those from taking a huge risk to their own lives and that of their families. I learned of a local woman whose family was split up just before boarding a small boat from France. Herself, her husband, and young son were sent on one small boat and her two other young teenage boys were sent on another. It has been over a year and her family have never heard from her teenage boys. This is heartbreak I could never imagine.\nThese traffickers are criminals. They are not heroes helping the desperate to gain a better life. They are vile humans that extort money and send people across a dangerous channel and guarantee nothing. This bill is a deterrent to those who are looking to make this journey, this will be less attractive to traffickers and will ultimately save lives. When illegal migrants arrive in the UK they will be interviewed and informed that they will be taken to Rwanda for processing. They will receive accommodation, food and security. They will be safe and can still process an asylum claim as before.\nThe process is clear for asylum, a person in desperate circumstances can exit their country and get to their nearest safe port. From here they can apply for asylum. Home Secretary James Cleverly said teams were 'working at pace to swiftly detain those who have no right to be here', referring to it as a 'pioneering response to the global challenge of illegal migration. This is a complex piece of work, but we remain absolutely committed to operationalising the policy, to stop the boats and break the business model of people smuggling gangs.'\nIt was essential that this bill received royal assent from the King, now the government can move forward in protecting the people who live in our country, the NHS, our public services, our welfare system and in turn protect the people who truly require our country as a place for asylum.’ Finally, late into the night, the Rwanda Bill was passed- meaning illegal migrants who come to the UK will not stay.\nThe Conservatives are the only Party committed to stopping the boats.",

  "https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_/https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_news_ian-levy-weekly-blog-12/content_4.html": "I had travelled down to London the day before as I had an early visit planned to tour Heathrow Airport following an event in parliament last year, which discussed sustainable aviation fuel. As part of my role in the Environmental Audit Committee, net-zero aviation is a high priority for us. Heathrow is one of the busiest airports in the world, serving millions of passengers every year and connecting to over 214 destinations across 84 countries. I discussed the issues facing all airports across the UK in dealing with border control, noise considerations for those who live under the flight path and emergency preparedness for exceptional circumstances such as bad weather. It was so fascinating to hear that Heathrow airport is also the biggest port in the whole of the country with more goods shipped in and out than any seaport. I then travelled back to Westminster to attend the weekly ministers meeting, this gives the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities a chance to discuss funding and feedback from other members.\nSeveral of my constituents asked me to attend a drop in event in parliament concerning assisted dying. It is always important to hear from all sides of this very emotive subject. My wife and I have opposite views on this based on our own life experiences with our parents. This shows how difficult this issue is to debate. I had a conversation with a very brave woman who came to Westminster to talk about her own illness and what assisted dying could mean for her personal situation. She spoke about dignity for herself and protection for her family. Thank you to everyone who got in touch about this event. These conversations are vitally important to have in parliament and constantly keep raising the question of choice. I headed back to the office for our weekly team meeting to have a catch up with both the constituency and Westminster team for updates on casework, social media, and the following week’s diary appointments. I had to leave the meeting early to attend a meeting with the Secretary of State for Culture, Media & Sport, Lucy Frazer to discuss Grassroots sports funding and costs. Recently, I was contacted by local clubs and the Northumberland football league about the financial challenges they are facing hiring 3G pitches in the area. Following this I met with the manager of Cramlington Town Football Club and then I arranged a meeting with the Football Foundation to push for more funding for grassroot clubs. It was great to hear about the number of projects being funded already which benefit the community in Blyth Valley. With this information in hand, I requested a meeting with the Secretary of State and highlighted all these issues. The Football Foundation will also be visiting both Cramlington Football Club and Seaton Sluice Football Club in the near future. The final item in my diary was the Crisis drop in to discuss how we can make history and build a future free from homelessness.\nTuesday morning I met with Amanda, the Community Fundraiser for the Great North Air Ambulance Service who looks after Northumberland, Newcastle and North and South Tyneside. There are currently no volunteers in the Blyth area, and she has asked me to share some details of what the charity does to raise funding as they require around £20,000 worth of funding per day to keep the charity running. I informed Amanda about community events happening in Blyth Valley over the next few months, the GNAAS have fundraising stall at events, provide talks to schools and to children’s and adult groups too. From here I ran to the chamber to ask an urgent question about what the government are doing to secure humanitarian support in Gaza. Our government are providing over £100million in support to Gaza, however I know many of my constituents want to help to provide aid to Gaza too. I then had a Westminster Hall debate to support Minister Lee Rowley in a Westminster Hall debate on The Khan Review: Threats to Social Cohesion and Democratic Resilience.\nMy final appointment in the diary was to attend Number 10 to welcome Helen Morris and Sheri Devine from Cramlington Kids Club for the Community Childcare Champions reception. This event was hosted by David Johnston OBE MP, Minister for Children, Families and Wellbeing to recognise local childcare companies, local schemes and organisation that support early years and give children their best start in life. It was a fantastic day, and I was delighted that Helen and Sheri were able to attend.\nWednesday morning, I was supporting Minister Rowley in another Westminster Hall debate before PMQs. After a quick lunch I attended the Backing British Farmers Event in partnership with Lloyds bank to discuss getting the right financial support to our agricultural and rural businesses. Our farmers feed our nation and play a vital role in protecting and enhancing nature and are central to adaptation and resilience to climate change. This year, the farming sector will benefit from the largest-ever round of grants on offer to support investment in agricultural productivity and innovation, with £427 million of government funding crowding in additional private sector investment.\nIn the afternoon I attended the Environmental Audit Committee, then I supported Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, Felicity Buchan in a Westminster Hall debate as part of my role as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the department. I then met with the Minister for Skills, Apprenticeships and Higher Education, Luke Hall MP, to discuss maintenance loans for university students. I wanted to highlight the that the loan that students are given for day-to-day life has not increased in over 10 years. This puts pressure on hard working families or pushes students to work long hours on top of their studies. We discussed access to resources on money management, debt counselling and living independently which I believe will help with how students budget and ultimately promote good mental and physical wellbeing. The Minister was very interested in my recent meeting with the Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive of Northumbria University, Professor Andy Long, and I passed over the insights from the university and how vital the maintenance loans are for students in our area. Once I had finished some office admin I drove back to Blyth and got home in the early hours of Thursday morning, ready for local election day.\nOn election day I supported local councillors in North Tyneside and of course went to the polling station to vote. The Conservative candidate for North East Mayor – Guy Renner Thompson was a strong candidate and placed a lot of time, energy and really hard work in to his campaign. I have worked alongside him many times within his role of Cabinet Member for Children and Young People for Northumberland County Council. Under his watch, 96.6% of Blyth Valley schools are now rated as being Outstanding or Good compared to 74.1% under the Labour. Ros Munro was the Conservative candidate for the Police and Crime Commissioner and has been committed to crack down on crime in the North East.\nFriday morning, I held a business breakfast at the Snowy Owl in Cramlington, local business people came together to network and listen to guest speaker Sir John Hall. It was a great event and I look forward to future meet ups. From here I visited Browns Bedrooms and Kitchens Ltd to meet with Managing Director Peter Brown. The business began in Peter’s garage in 1983 and is now looking to expand on its 300,000sqft site in Cramlington. Browns are the UK's leading manufacturer of made to measure doors and glass splashbacks for kitchens, bedrooms and bathroom furniture and employs around 70 local people. It was great to have a chat with Peter about some casework before having a tour of this remarkable factory. I was taken around the factory floor and saw the full process from creating the panels through to the delivery service which has 8 wagons and 10 sprinter vans. It was great to meet with Peter and the team, I always try to support our local businesses where I can. In the afternoon I met allotment owners and local councillors in Seaton Delaval to hear concerns about the proposed closure of the allotments. This is an ongoing issue, and I am working closely with all parties to find a reasonable solution.\nIt was disappointing to not gain the result I had hoped for in the mayoral and PCC elections in our area. Guy had worked so hard to build his campaign however I congratulate Kim McGuinness on her win, and I look forward to working with her to ensure the billions of pounds the Government have invested for the North-East devolution deal are put to good use. Likewise, I campaigned with Ros Munro for PCC, she is very passionate about the policing in our communities and would have been fantastic in the role. Congratulations to Susan Dungworth on her successful election as Police and Crime Commissioner for Northumbria. When we look at Local Elections. Northumberland did not have any Councillors up for election this year so there have been no changed for my constituents in Blyth Valley. However, as you will be aware the boundary change splits up our constituency of Blyth Valley into ‘Blyth and Ashington’ and ‘Cramlington and Killingworth’, with the majority of my current patch falling into Cramlington and Killingworth, which will be where I will be standing at the General Election. This new seat takes in areas of Newcastle and North Tyneside, who did in fact have local elections this year. In Newcastle the Conservatives have had their first Councillor elected in over 32 years! In North Tyneside the Conservatives have gained a number of new councillors. I was very glad to see Conservatives in Tyneside making historic gains this year.\nOn Saturday I had the pleasure to attend the annual end of season junior football presentation at The Grand Hotel in Gosforth. This was an evening to celebrate the teamwork, commitment and dedication of the players, parents, coaching staff and officials. Thank you to the Northumberland FA and Grassroots Football UK for their support in harnessing young people to flourish through football. A huge well done to all the award winners! Everyone looked very smart in their club ties, and I want to thank Ian Coates for inviting me along to be a part of the event.\nSunday, I had a meal with family and packed my bags ready for another busy week in Westminster. As always, should you wish to contact me please call 01670 338435 or email me at [email protected]",

Schools will though continue to provide care for a limited number of children who are vulnerable and children whose parents are critical to the Covid-19 response and cannot be safely cared for at home.\nVulnerable children include those with a social worker and those with Education, Health and Care Plans.

I will be meeting later today with a number of community groups and agencies to link up their fantastic efforts. I am also updating my Facebook page regularly with the latest information.\"",

I have attended the service in Ridley Park every year since I was 17 and I found this year to be particularly moving. I am a proud member of the Royal British Legion as well as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Ben Wallace who is the Secretary of State for Defence and value the understanding that talking to veterans and serving personnel gives me. I am always touched by the number of people who attend the various ceremonies to show respect for those who died so that we could enjoy the freedoms that we have. For those events I couldn’t attend I visited the memorials and laid wreaths as a mark of my respect.\nMonday started as it does most weeks with an early morning train to London. I arrived in time to attend the weekly Ministers Meeting and then spent much of the afternoon in the House carrying out my PPS role for a Ministerial statement by Ben Wallace regarding the situation in Bali followed by a general debate on Ukraine.\nThe rest of the week continued to be busy and included a catch-up with my team to discuss responses to the many constituents who contact me. On Wednesday I met with Moderna to discuss the importance of being prepared for future viruses and potential opportunities for Blyth Valley. I also met with the Minister for Transport to discuss the many ongoing projects around Blyth Valley. This gave me an opportunity to press for final approval for the Northumberland line as well as reiterating my support for a Blyth relief road and making further representations about the importance of improvements to the Moor Farm roundabout.\nThe boundaries of all UK constituencies are being reviewed and I spent some time looking at the current proposals. Should the changes go ahead in their current format Blyth Valley will be split into 2 new areas. Blyth will join with Ashington, Bedlington and Newbiggin to create a constituency named Blyth and Ashington. Cramlington would remain with Seaton Valley and take in parts of North Tyneside including Killingworth, Dudley and Wideopen. Any changes will not be finalised until October 2023 and won’t take effect until the next general election. In the meantime, I will continue to be the MP for the whole of Blyth Valley.\nReports of a missile strike on Poland reached us on Tuesday evening meant on Thursday, the Secretary of State for the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office made a statement in the House after Prime Ministers' Questions.\nOnce back in the constituency on Friday I hosted a community support event at the Buffalo Centre in Blyth and had the pleasure to meet with BVCVA, Forget me Nots, Silx, Buffalo Centre and Northumberland Communities Together alongside the team from Lloyds bank to discuss what support they can offer to organisations in Blyth Valley. Later in the day, I attended the housing development in New Hartley to meet the site Manager who has recently been given the NHBC Pride in the Job award. In the evening I visited Blyth town centre to see this year’s Christmas Light Switch on. As I looked around the market place it was great to see so many people out enjoying the town and I can’t wait for the next phase of improvements to take place which will include among other things a Culture Hub due to be complete by autumn 2024.\nAs the week draws to a close I look forward to spending a little time with my family over the weekend.

My first visit was to meet Emma from Felix and Fern in New Hartley. Emma gave me a tour of the creative hub which encourages creative play and craft activities for children. I attended the Monday morning session and saw families enjoying time doing crafts, reading books and playing together. The hub is inspired by nature and encourages children to explore and learn about the seasons. Emma also told me about the adult sessions she runs such as wreath making and art & relaxation classes. I was delighted to hear that the community have been welcoming and the business is going well. It is always great to see new and inventive businesses opening in Blyth Valley and I think Emma has a wonderful set up. From there I headed to county hall to meet with Glen Sanderson who is the leader of Northumberland County Council. I wanted an update on the gigafactory and we discussed the relief road, the Blyth town development, SEND education in Northumberland and the closure of the adult learning centre in Cramlington.\nAfter the meeting I travelled back to the office to meet Sunday Odekunle who is the pastor of a new Champions Global Church Pentecostal church based in Neptune HQ on South Beach estate in Blyth. The church began in September this year and the service is open to anyone who wishes to attend and is held on a Sunday afternoon. We had a great chat about community and the events the group are hosting over the next few months and into the new year.\nI then had a TEAMS call then grabbed a quick lunch before driving to the Isabella Centre in Cowpen for the Blyth Relief Road consultation. It is great to see that Blyth is on the way to getting the much needed additional road into the town. I am fully supporting Northburn. Councillor Wayne Daley and Councillor Helen Morris. in their concerns regarding the closure of the slip road at top of Laverock Hall road heading on to the A189. This will cause undue disruption and I know we can find a better and more efficient solution. My last visit of the day was with my family to cast my vote at the St Cuthberts Christmas tree festival. My daughter had decorated a tree this year in aid of Breast Cancer UK and had crocheted the decorations. It was a lovely atmosphere and it was great to see the community coming together and enjoying the festivities.\nOn Tuesday morning I visited Opus21 in the Atley Business Park in Cramlington who are one of the UK’s leading packing mock up and sales sample suppliers. I met with the owner Mark Hunter Purvis and we chatted about digital printing and working with big brands. Opus 21 works with mega household names such as Coca Cola, Rowntree’s, Nestle, Pepsi, Tesco, Walkers, Cif and many more. Mark showed me the fantastic new product developments which had been printed and packaged on site. These mock ups are used for TV commercials and for pitching new products/ranges. We then had a tour of the factory floor and I saw how the production works and met his talented team. I was shown a new packaging concept for a well-known drink and followed the printing process until I was shown the final product at the end of my visit. Mark has worked within the print industry from being 16 years old and his passion for the industry shows. It is great to see another business success story in Blyth Valley.\nFrom there I went back to the office for constituency surgeries and an hour or so of office admin.\nThe following day I had a personal appointment in the morning and went to the office around lunchtime for a meeting with my team and a catch up on casework.\nThursday morning I went to Neptune HQ on South Beach in Blyth to meet the Chairperson Robert Crumpton to chat about the great work the centre is doing in the community. I had a tour of the facilities and just missed out on taking part in a Zumba class! Robert discussed various grants the centre has received for renovations including new disabled access toilets and a new kitchen. The centre also raised funds for a defibrillator which is for community use on the front of the building and has been used several times since its installation. It is brilliant to see so many community groups using the centre. The Scout groups in the centre are very popular and operate a waiting list. Robert is a Group Scout leader himself and talked about the importance of teaching life skills to young people and how much they enjoy a challenge. He also mentioned they are looking for adult volunteers for the Scout groups, if you think this is something you would like to do please contact them directly at [email protected]\nI then headed out in the rain to meet a very dedicated volunteer group in Valley Park, Cramlington. The ‘Friends of Valley Park’ was established in July 2022 to protect, conserve and enhance the 52 acre green space of Valley Park. I met with volunteer Jill and she showed me the huge progress in the woodland since my last visit, the overgrown pathways have been cut back and resurfaced to make the park wheelchair accessible, two ponds have been dug out and filled, which is attracting lots of new wildlife and birds. We had a walk around the track and at every turn there was a smiling volunteer helping to maintain the area. Along with the routine maintenance the volunteers do water testing, work with other organisations to track the wildlife and they are soon hoping to install bat boxes. This group of community volunteers come out in all weathers to look after this area and have even planted a community orchard which will be available to the enjoyment of local residents. I want to personally thank them for giving up their time and congratulate them on such a fantastic achievement.\nIn the afternoon I met with the owner of the Fat Butcher to organise a huge donation of turkeys that they have very kindly offered to supply to local community centres and groups. The turkeys will be picked up the week before Christmas and I will deliver them to various centres and groups across Blyth Valley who are serving the community over the festive period. Whether it be the Forget-me-Nots in Cowpen or the veterans charity Forward Assist.\nOn Friday morning I travelled to my old place of work, St Nicholas hospital to meet with James Duncan who is the CEO of CNTW in the NHS. We talked about the challenges of mental health in the area and are now working in partnership to orchestrate a social care round table for South East Northumberland which will take place early next year. My next meeting was the North East MPs and Peers Transport Update with Chair of the North East Joint Transport Committee and the Managing Director of Transport North East , this is a regular briefing session focussing on Transport issues in the region.\nI then had a full afternoon of face to face constituency surgeries before driving to the Lord Of The Manor pub in Cramlington to meet with the owner Bridget and area manager of Stonegate pubs, Graham. Bridget and Mark have owned the pub for around 7 years and have recently had a whopping £311,000 spent on renovating the pub. It is great to hear that the wet led hospitality group, Stonegate, are investing in our local pubs. I had a tour of the newly refurbished bar area and even had the chance to pull a pint. I also spoke to Graham about local pubs that have been left empty for a long time and asked them to put them on the Stonegate radar for potential future projects. I named several specific examples and was pleased to hear that these would be reviewed, these buildings are important to our communities and the area.\nFrom there I met with Peter Saleem to congratulate him on the opening of his new business Pizza Spice on Broadway Circle. The takeaway shop is getting great reviews already and I wish him the best of luck in his new venture.\nThen it was panto time at the Phoenix Theatre to see the production of Dick Whittington! As always, it was a spectacular event with lots of laughs and family fun.\nMy weekend was spent with family and friends. As always, if you would like to contact me or arrange a constituency surgery, please call 01670 338435 or email me at [email protected]",

  "https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_/https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_news_cop26-and-benefits-blyth-valley/content_32.html": "In recent days I am sure everyone has heard COP26 mentioned on the news. I spent two days in Glasgow last week to learn more about the United Nations climate change conference.\nThe meaning of the name is assumed when reported but it is something that many people have asked me about with COP standing for ‘Conference of the Parties’. The parties are most countries on the planet who have been coming together every year since 1995 except for 2020 which gives the name COP26.\nThe Paris Agreement came out of COP21 and this was critical in determining how the world would respond to climate change. For the first time, there was an agreement to limit global warming to below 2 degrees and to aim for 1.5 degrees, as well as to make funding available to deliver the target. With a marginal increase in temperature having potentially devastating consequences the Paris Agreement provides the framework to mitigate against this.\nNationally Determined Contributions are a key part of this approach with countries committed to developing their own plans for reducing their emissions. Every 5 years an updated plan is required which should be as ambitious as possible. Glasgow is the time for countries to update what they can do to slow global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and to consider actions that are necessary as temperatures increase.\nThe UK has an unrivalled record in tackling climate change pre-dating the Paris Agreement whilst maintaining economic growth. Between 1990 and 2019, the economy grew by 78% with our emissions falling by 44% which was the fastest decline in the G7 which includes the UK, USA, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, and the EU.\nWe have also decarbonised our economy quicker than any other G20 country since 2000 and we are the largest producer of offshore wind energy in the world. The UK was also the first major economy to put into law that we will reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. In addition, new petrol and diesel cars will no longer be available for sale in the UK from 2030.\nI see these policy changes also as opportunities for Blyth Valley and south east Northumberland. I therefore welcome the work taking place at COP26 and look forward to our area also benefiting economically through green jobs.",

  "https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_/https_www_ianlevy_org_uk_news_rest-peace-sir-david-amess/content_37.html": "Two weeks ago, a very good MP went to work and didn’t make it home after the senseless actions of a coward who attacked him in a surgery for his constituents. Sir David Amess was a husband, a father, a friend, and a true gentleman.\nThe 15th of October was a dark day in the political history of this country and one that also brought back memories of what happened to Jo Cox in 2016. It has certainly made me think about my own safety and that of all my parliamentary colleagues who are striving to do the best for their constituents.\nReviews are already underway as to how MPs do their jobs including whether surgeries should have a Police presence which is a very drastic step but one that underlines the seriousness of the situation. It is not just MPs who are at risk but also their staff and members of the public who attend surgeries with genuine concerns.\nAs an MP elected just ahead of the Covid-19 outbreak most of my surgeries with constituents have been either over the telephone or via Teams and Zoom. I therefore do not share to the same extent the attachment to traditional surgeries of my more long-standing parliamentary colleagues and whilst I do prefer a face-to-face surgery it has been demonstrated that there are alternatives.\nSafety must come first whether that is to prevent the spread of disease or to protect MPs from random attacks. Until reviews are complete, I will continue to hold telephone and virtual surgeries rather than face to face surgeries. This is not ideal, but I hope residents do understand the very difficult choices that MPs now face.\nI don’t mind admitting that Parliament was a very daunting place when I was first elected. But Sir David was always there for me to offer support, a few words of reassurance and a cup of tea in the tea room. My own father died a few weeks ago and I still feel the acute pain of loss and will do for some time.\nBut I was fortunate as I had the opportunity to say goodbye to my father. Sir David’s family didn’t have that chance and I can’t imagine the pain they are feeling."
