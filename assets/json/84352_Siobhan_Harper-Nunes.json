There should be no room in politics for the ugly Islamophobia and Anti-Semitism that we have seen recently.”\n“Racism in all its forms is a sad reality for too many, one we should all be ashamed of.”\n“Anti-racism is not a passive act of tolerance, but proactive work to root out prejudice and systemic injustice. I will use my position to lead by example and work to tackle racial injustice head on.”",

The people of the West Midlands deserve this and we must get on with delivering it.”\n“Some of our poorest communities have the lowest rates of car ownership, yet also have some of the worst roads in terms of safety, noise and air pollution, and have seen the least action to tackle dangerous driving.

Over that time, she has successfully attracted millions into the sector through successful bids and fundraising campaigns. Siobhan’s role has often\nnecessitated working in organisations and managing their staff to enable more efficient fundraising, monitoring and evaluation, giving her a great overview of what makes organisations work.\nSiobhan has worked with grassroots organisations that provide a range of services from equality and human rights campaigners, domestic violence charities, green campaigners, to fitness and wellbeing services. She has also worked on a regional basis at Regen WM connecting key players from Government Office, Advantage West Midlands, Public and Third Sector agencies, to encourage regional collaboration and to forge partnerships which benefitted economic and civic recovery.\nIn 2007, she founded Shakti Women, an organisation that supports women in both personal and professional development through coaching and training.\nShe is also currently vice-chair of Birmingham Race Impact Group, a group working for many years to promote racial justice in Birmingham.\nHaving worked in the development of community-led activities in some of Birmingham’s most deprived communities to divert people from crime, Siobhan knows the challenges they face from direct personal experience. This gives her knowledge of the support that should be given to allow all areas across the West Midlands to thrive.\nPromoted by Margaret Okole on behalf of Siobhan Harper-Nunes (Green Party), both at 2A Blackthorn House, Birmingham B3 1RL",

The Green Party has always been the party of new ideas, and our manifesto for West Midlands Mayor is no exception, so I urge people who are fed up with the status quo to look at what we’re offering.\nOur policies will help tackle the crippling inequality in our region. I will support communities that have been overlooked and left behind for so long, ensure that action on the climate crisis is at the right scale and speed, and create a more democratic and accountable Combined Authority.\nSeven years ago we were saying the Mayor should take buses back into public control. Now the other parties have finally caught up on that, but they are still way behind on other issues.\nThroughout this campaign I’ve been championing investment in warmer homes and social homes, putting the needs of people and planet first. The other parties can’t be trusted to prioritise this.\nIf you want a Mayor who’s going to work for everyone, look after the planet and bring true democratic engagement and accountability to the region, vote Green on May 2nd.”\nSome of Siobhan’s key pledges are to:\n- Appoint people to a number of key roles to drive the most urgent priorities, such as\n- A Deputy Mayor charged with championing community wealth building\n- A Homes Transformation Lead to set up and fund major retrofit programmes across the West Midlands to improve levels of energy efficiency, create thousands of jobs and transform the lives of people who have been struggling to afford energy bills.\n- A Walking and Cycling Commissioner to drive a ‘vision zero’ approach of no serious injuries or deaths on our roads.\n- Establish a community wealth building grant fund, to support local community organisations working on a local level to strengthen local economies and wellbeing.\n- Establish an investment/business support fund for locally based Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), Social Enterprises and Co-ops targeted at the areas of the region that need most support and the sectors that will bring most benefits.\n- Work with colleges across the region to deliver the skills needed for the Green jobs of the future, including those needed for mass home retrofit programmes. Also, undertake a detailed assessment of the skills gaps to ensure our young people are prepared for the future opportunities that investment in Green technology will bring.\n- Lobby for funding for fare-free public transport for under 22s, those looking for work, those in full time education and 60-65 year olds., and conduct a study of the feasibility and benefits of extending this to everyone.\n- Come together with Councils to issue Green Bonds to assist with decarbonisation, fund low-carbon infrastructure and support our low-carbon future.
