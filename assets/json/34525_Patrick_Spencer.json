  "https_www_patrickspencer_co_uk_/https_www_patrickspencer_co_uk_about/content_16.html": "I am Patrick Spencer, the Member of Parliament for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich.\nI live in Suffolk with my wife Anna and two sons. My family arrived in Suffolk from Essex in the 80s. I live in the same village my grandparents moved to all those years ago. My happiest childhood memories were spent on the Aldeburgh seafront, playing golf at Ufford Park, or watching Ipswich at Portman Road.\nSuffolk is indeed a wonderful place to live, and as the MP for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich I want to work to keep it that way. We have stunning countryside, beautiful market towns, sites of huge historic importance, some great local businesses that export around the country and globe, as well as Ipswich, which I believe can become one of the growth engines in East Anglia.\nAt the General Election in 2024 I made 6 pledges:\n- Deliver better quality health services for people across Central Suffolk and North Ipswich - This includes increasing availability of GP appointments, especially in Needham Market and North Ipswich, and improving access to dental services.\n- Improve services for children and young people – This includes campaigning against unfair funding of schools in Suffolk, delivering great outdoor activities for young people of all age groups, and driving an improvement in SEND services across the county.\n- Reduce crime and create safe neighbourhoods – This includes fighting for fairer funding for Suffolk Constabulary, increasing the number of police officers operating in Suffolk and campaigning for greater commitment to tackle rural crime.\n- Deliver better support for people at risk of and impacted by flooding – This includes pushing Environment Agency and Suffolk County Council to invest more in flood mitigation, reducing house building on flood plane and risky areas, as well as giving landowners more power to take action to reduce risk of flooding.\n- Protect our countryside – This includes standing up for our farming community, pushing back against plans to build unnecessary developments on rural land, and campaigning against the Norwich to Tilbury Pylon line.\n- Back Suffolk business - I want to champion businesses across the constituency, large and small, so that we continue to create jobs and economic opportunity here in Suffolk. This means standing up for lower taxes and lighter regulation of business, as well campaigning for more public investment in our high streets.\nI began my career in finance and business, sitting as a Director of a family-owned private equity company for 7 years. In 2016 I went to work at the Centre for Social Justice, before becoming a Senior Adviser at the Department for Education and a Director at the Jobs Foundation. Outside of work I was a Governor at a Federation of local Primary Schools, a mentor with the Social Mobility Foundation and I sat on the Advisory Council for the Living Wage Foundation.\nI am a Conservative because I believe the state does not know best, that free-enterprise is the engine for economic growth, that individual responsibility is a fundamental value, that Britain should play a pro-active role on the world stage, and that social mobility comes from a leg-up, and not a hand-out.\nSince getting to Parliament I have joined the Education Select Committee, the APPGs for Flood Prevention, Private Capital, Babies, and Care Experienced Children and Young People. I have spoken in debates around taxation, police funding, rural mental health, the small business economy, and the environment. I have asked Minister’s questions in the house on increasing prison places, ensuring a community benefit scheme for people affected by Pylons, making Flood Risk Activity Permits cheaper, how the Government plans to address child poverty as well as plans to change the National Curriculum.",

However, the developers regularly review design and functionality accessibility on the website platform, including:-\n- Improving layouts and colours to enhance simplicity and contrast\n- Ensuring that text appears in a legible font size\n- Ensuring that tap targets are an accessible size and not too small or close together\n- Considering accessibility in all design and functionality decisions\n- Publishing best practice for website administrators relating to content accessibility\nHow accessible is the website platform?\nDue to the devolved nature of the administration of a website platform, the responsibility for accessibility of content rests with the content creators. The developers are aware of the potential to add or modify content that is not as accessible as it could be, including:-\n- Images used as links\n- Broken links\n- Text as images in some locations, such as infographics and logos, without supportive descriptions\n- Non-optimal images and pdfs, such as scanned letters\n- Some historic images lack alternative text (prior to August 2016, when alt text became mandatory on the platform)\n- Not all videos feature subtitles and/or descriptive text\nThe developers of the website platform have no control over nor can take any responsibility for the content added to the website, but strive to resolve these where possible through aspects of the functionality as well as integral and disseminated best practice. It is entirely possible for all of these accessibility issues to be resolved by content creators themselves.\nBrowser accessibility\nThis website has been optimised for the latest versions of the following browsers:-\n- Google Chrome\n- Mozilla Firefox\n- Apple Safari\n- Microsoft Edge\nIf the website does not display correctly, please update to the latest version of your browser.\nHow to request information in an accessible format\nThis website has its own administrator and if you need information in a different format, please contact that individual using the form or details on the Contact page in the menu.

Data Controller\nThe Data Controller is Patrick Spencer\n2. Contact\nIf you have any questions about this policy or for more information about how we use your data or would like to exercise any of your rights contact Patrick Spencer.\n3. Lawful basis for processing\nAll processing is carried out by consent or either under the legitimate interest of Patrick Spencer, or public interest. These cover processing to conduct casework, campaigning and communication. Where processed under the lawful basis of a task carried out in the public interest, it is to support or promote democratic engagement. This includes fundraising activity in order to support democratic engagement.\n4. Data sources\nData held is that provided by you when you contact us and correspondence with third parties in response to cases taken up on your behalf. We may also hold data that you provide when we contact you – for instance, if we ask you to participate in a survey or petition. If you do not wish for us to contact you by telephone please do not provide this information. We perform a database lookup automatically upon any form submission to include electoral boundary data. The Register of Electors that councils provide to authorised persons under the Representation of the People Act is also used for electoral purposes.\n5. Data Security\nPersonal data is stored electronically and securely. We ensure that our service providers comply with the same high standard that we do, and we store our data on the Bluetree servers in the UK.\n6. Special category data\nSpecial category data will be processed under the lawful basis indicated in section 3, as is permitted in clauses 22, 23 and 24 of schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act, covering political parties and elected representatives.\n7. Transferring your data outside of the European Economic Area\nThe EU GDPR adequacy decision means that data can continue to flow between the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA). Some service providers are located outside of the EEA and therefore it may be necessary to transfer your personal data outside of the EEA. Where the transfer of your data outside of the EEA takes place we will make sure that it is protected in the same way as if the data was inside the EEA, and it only occurs with your consent.\nWe will use one of the following safeguards to ensure this:\n• Where the European Commission has issued an adequacy decision determining that a non-EEA country or organisation ensures an adequate level of data protection.\n• A contract is put in place with the recipient of the data obliging them to protect the data to the same standards as the EEA.\nLegally it is not permitted to transfer certain types of data, such as Electoral Register Data, outside of the EEA, and we honour that obligation.\n8. Data retention policy\nPersonal data will be held for no longer than necessary. Some types of data may be held for longer than others. Typically the maximum retention is two election cycles. Review of the data held will occur in each election cycle to determine whether it should be maintained or put beyond use. We also comply with the ICO's expectation guidelines relating to petitions.\n9. Subject Access Requests\nWe will request verification of the identity of any individual making a request, ask for further clarification and details if needed and respond within one calendar month once we have confirmed it is a legitimate request. In accordance with ICO guidelines, we keep a log of Subject Access Requests that contains details of the request, including that which can identify you personally, indefinitely.\nData subjects have the right to the following:\n• To be told whether any personal data is being processed\n• To be given a description of the personal data, the reasons it is being processed and whether it will be given to another organisations or people.\n• To be given a copy of the information comprising the data, and given details of the source of the data where this is available.\n10. Will we share your data with anyone else?\nIf you have contacted us about a personal or policy issue, your data may be passed on to a third-party in the course of dealing with your enquiry, such as local authorities, government agencies, public bodies, health trusts, regulators, and so on. Any third parties that we may share your data with are obliged to keep your details securely, and to use them only for the basis upon which they were originally intended.\nWe may need to share your data with a third party, such as the police, if required to do so by law.\nUnless otherwise specified, data may also be shared with entities of Political Party associations, federations, branches, groups and affiliates in order to assist you or maintain contact with you in support of democratic engagement.\nCasework and other submissions from the Contact form are sent directly to their destination. The nature of casework and other enquiries are not retained on the website, but this information is available for a limited period on the Bluetree servers in the UK for access only in the event of a police investigation. Your name and contact details submitted via the Contact form are only retained on the website if you grant consent to join the email subscriptions list. Anonymised data from the Contact form is retained for benchmarking purposes.\nYour personal data is only used as outlined here and within your reasonable expectations based on the nature of the communication, and recognising the need of politically related engagement in wider support of democratic engagement.\n11. Data Rights\nAt any point you have the following rights:\n• Right of access – you have the right to request a copy of the information held about you.\n• Right of rectification – you have a right to correct data held about you that is inaccurate or incomplete.\n• Right to be forgotten – in certain circumstances you can ask for the data held about you to be erased from our records.\n• Right to object – you have the right to object to certain types of processing, such as direct marketing.\n• Right to object to automated processing, including profiling – you also have the right to be subject to the legal effects of automated processing or profiling.\n• Right to judicial review: if our office refuses your request under rights of access, we will provide you with a reason why. You have the right to complain.\n12. Making a complaint\nIf you are unhappy with the way that we have processed or handled your data then you have a right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). The ICO is the supervisory body authorised by the Data Protection Act 2018 to regulate the handling of personal data within the United Kingdom.
