  "https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_/https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_campaigns/content_4.html": "Affordable housing: Everyone deserves to have a home they can be proud of, but all to often this is not a reality for many. From the high cost of buying and renting, to unscrupulous landlords taking advantage of tenants and providing substandard housing. I’ve called on housing developers through my roles on Newham’s Strategic Development Committee, Local Development Committee and the London Legacy Development Corporation’s Planning Decisions Committee to build more genuinely affordable homes.\nYoung people: I believe young people in London should have the best opportunities to succeed in life. This can be provided through school, college, apprenticeships and university. The voluntary, faith and third sector also deliver provision that enhances the lives of our young people and they should be supported. As former governor at Newham College of Further Education, an external board member of Newham All Star Sports Academy (NASSA) and a former member of the Local Government Association (LGA) Children and Young People; Safer Communities Boards, the issues that affect young people and their well-being is a priority for me and I will be fighting every step of the way to ensure they have the resources to thrive.\nTackling crime and anti-Social behaviour: A safer London is a priority for me. The police are vital for the safety of all Londoners, but there have been too many times they have let Londoners down. As a Cabinet Member for Crime and Community Safety I worked hard to ensure we tackled crime and reduced anti-social behaviour across Newham. I did this by building strong links with residents, the police, statutory and voluntary sector partners. I will continue to campaign for a safer London, more police and greater accountability of police officers.\nThe environment: In Custom House I have called for more electric charging points to encourage the shift to electric and hybrid cars. While not being anti-car I want to encourage more people to walk, cycle and take public transport which is sustainable, cheap and good for you and the environment. I encourage more efforts to be made to create well maintained community gardens and safe, clean public spaces. Trees are an important part of our local environment and should be planted and appropriately maintained.\nHealth inequality: Improving the health outcomes of people who live in the ward I represent and Newham as a whole is an important issue to me. Whether it is promoting healthier lifestyles or calling on the local clinical commissioning group to be more ambitious I am eager to see that Londoners get the best quality care and health service provision. Good healthcare shouldn’t be a post code lottery; that is why I want our services to provide the best care possible.\nAmbitious for London: London is an international city we have the political and economical power to help shape the lives of 8 million people and build a city based on fairness, environmental responsibility and safer streets for all. We may have left the European Union but we are city which has so much to offer culturally, economically and socially. We can have a prosperous future but only one where all Londoners reaps its rewards.",

It has been busy and exciting few months on the council. I continue to see many people in my surgery about their housing concerns. Housing continues to be an issue for many in our ward. I want to ensure we help residents in these difficult times by working closely with local housing associations, we encourage the development of more affordable houses and we maintain our council stock so that it is fit for purpose.\nI am enjoying working with councillors and officer to help shape housing developments in Newham. The Local Development Committee gave permission for new cycle shelters. These will help encourage more residents to take up cycling as an alternative mode of transport.\nThis month I took part in the West Ham CLP quiz night. My team the “Red Levels” finished a respectable third after several rounds of gruelling questions.\nI also joined members and councillors from neighbouring wards Green Street West and Forest Gate South for our own joint ward social. The food was excellent and the company was great. We were joined by City and East GLA Assembly Member Candidate Unmesh Desai, who thanked members for their support. He also showed his skills as a auctioneer and fundraiser getting us to dig deep to raise funds.\nLet me wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. Whatever you are doing over the festive period be safe, enjoy and I shall see you in 2016.\nYours sincerely\nCouncillor James Beckles\nPlaistow North ward\nContact me on:\nTwitter: @James_Beckles\nLeave a comment",

It was strongly felt that LME should be proactive and set the bar for being a pro-Europe voice within the Labour Party and strongly urge the leadership to challenge the government’s chaotic “strategy”.\nI had the pleasure of speaking on one of the panels – “How should a generation who overwhelmingly voted Remain react to Brexit?”\nI spoke about my experiences kf campaigning in Newham, a young, diverse and multi-cultural area and the challenges Brexit will have on this area and young people nationally.\nThe final panel was excellent and helped set the tone of a fjture campaign to keep Europe and especially our relationship with it at the centre stage of our political discourse. There will no doubt be obstacles but Labour is and always will be an internationalist party and we should all champion those ideals.\nLeave a comment",

  "https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_/https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_2017_10_27_black-history-month-in-newham_comment-page-1/content_160.html": "Yesterday, Thursday 26th October, Councillor Seyi Akiwowo and I met with the Mayor of Newham, Sir Robin Wales and the Cabinet member for Equalities, Tahmina Rahman.\nThis meeting was called after the events of last week when a teacher from St. Winefried’s RC School, sent a letter to parents asking them to dress their children as slaves to ‘celebrate’Black History Month. This letter was as Seyi and I pointed out inappropriate and disappointing; and did not reflect the essence of what Black History Month was trying to convey.\nBack to our meeting we had prepared a PowerPoint presentation (slides below) and a plan for change in Newham which we presented to the Mayor and Tahmina. At the heart of our presentation was a draft set of ideas for a five year plan which if implemented would make the preparation, commissioning and delivery of Black History Month in Newham part of our business and more organic. The Cabinet had a week before agreed to set up a working group to explore how best to celebrate Black History Month I’m the future. This was a positive step but to go further the group will need buy-in at a political and corporate level, both points Seyi and I raised.\nWe set out how best we could work with this new working group, one suggestion was to make it an action group therefore it would be proactive and not laden with bureacracy and diktats that can stifle good ideas but it should be targetted and focused with the objective of delivering a workable model that would make Black History Month in Newham relevant, educational and informative.\nIt won’t be an easy task but me and Seyi are prepared to play out part in getting this group off the ground, developing a plan that is inclusive, informative and more importantly steers us away from the misconceptions held by some about what Black History Month is and should be about.\nTwo years ago a group including myself, Seyi, Rokhsana Fiaz and Darren Steer, held a well attended Black History Month discussion. We did that on a very limited budget with good will from UEL/Birkbeck and the high profile speakers. It just took will and commitment. We are hoping for the same now going forward. Just imagine what more a local authority could achieve, not just with financial resources but through links and reputational clout. We will be working hard to ensure that this is another legacy we can be proud of.\nLeave a comment",

  "https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_/https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_2017_03_11_newham-co-op-continued_comment-page-1/content_190.html": "On Wednesday 8th March Newham Cooperative Party welcomed Claire McCarthy our General Secretary.\nIt’s not everyday members of the Cooperative Party or any party for that matter with the sight of a General Secretary checking membership details at the door. But that’s the beauty of the Co-op movement and the state of play of Newham.\nAfter members had been signed in everyone took their seats. There was some tension in the air as you would expect from the last heated meeting. But chaired by a London region representative the meeting kicked off. There were some noticeable absences including the Chair of Newham branch, Lester Hudson, who we were told was attending an awards ceremony. Nonetheless the meeting began.\nThe positions not filled at the last meeting were up for contention. These included Secretary, Treasurer, Membership Officer, Assistant Secretary and the New position of Events/Social Secretary. All candidates had to submit prior to the meeting a 100 word statement for the position they were standing for and it was good to read supporting statements and what candidates would do if elected.\nThere was a point of order or clarification raised whether candidates who were nominated would be on the ballot. The representative from London region was clear that all Newha Co-op members were afforded the opportunity to stand for a position as long as they submitted a statement.\nOnto the vote for Secretary, Gill Hay vs. Neil Wilson. A tense ballot and count and Gill was victorious. The Treasurer was next, as there was only one candidate, Averil Donohue who is current Treasurer, they were duly elected.\nMembership Officer again had only one candidate, Alan Griffiths, he was duly elected. Assistant Secretary, currently John Gray, was elected as the sole candidate.\nThen came the exciting part. The positions no-one submitted statements for. These included the new post of Events/Social Secretary and the Auditors (x2).\nThe candidates for Events/Social Secretary were Sugathan and Neil Wilson. Both spoke on the spot and gave good reasons why they should be elected. The ballots were distributed and counted. The winner we Neil Wilson.\nFinally the heralded positions of Auditors. This I where I dear reader come in. I was nominated by four fellow cooperators and I was duly elected. Thank you!\nThe second Auditor elected was Conor McCauley and much desired.\nFinally the highlight of the evening was the speech by Claire McCarthy. In consistent Newham fashion those who were there solely to vote left and those I assume who were generally interested in hearing from our General Secretary stayed.\nClaire gave a clear and impassioned speech about co-op values, ethical politics, supporting Labour councillors who wanted to stand as Labour/Co-op councillors (which I think would be advantageous and I may consider it) and continuing to build a cooperative and mutual based society in Newham and beyond.\nOverall the evening was well ordered and considering the positions up for grabs it was good natured. Perhaps having Co-op HQ present officiating made certain potential offenders behave on the night. But we do need more meetings like these where it’s about speakers, debates about policy and positions, development of co-op values at a local level that is inclusive and supportive of Newham’s communities.\nAgain I sign off by saying I look forward to the next Newham Coooperative Party meeting and hope I will be able to attend.\nLeave a comment",

  "https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_/https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_2023_08_20_are-owners-of-shared-ownership-properties-being-forgotten/content_15.html": "In July 2023, I wrote to Lyn Brown MP about the problems faced by residents with their shared ownership properties. While shared ownership is marketed as an affordable housing option for first-time buyers and those with modest incomes, it can become expensive in the long run due to rising service charges, rents, and mortgage costs.\nShared ownership property owners are in a precarious situation as they have short-term leases (less than 99 years) or are “mortgaged tenants” who do not fully own their share of the property. As highlighted in the report Shared Ownership: The Consumer Perspective buying more shares in the property through stair-casing can also be costly, making it difficult for many to afford.\nI was and am also concerned about the seeming lack of legal attention and protection shared owners are receiving in the Government’s recent Leaseholder Act 2022, which promised to do away with the medieval leaseholder system but is still very much intact.\nI highlighted my concerns to Lyn stating:\n“Shared owners (or mortgaged tenants) are not within the scope of the Act or even covered by other legislation that is making its way through parliament. Shared owners who own a share of their property while paying a subsidised rent on the outstanding share of the property they do not own are:\n•Subject excessive service charges which can raise to 13% – a cap should be introduced.\n•Unable or discouraged from selling their share of the property by housing associations who are either not equipped to buy back or reluctant to purchase the mortgages tenants share if they chose to sell their share – housing associations should purchase the shared owners property share or advise house they can sell it on the open market without excessive fees\n•Subject to the whims of management agencies often chosen or operated by a housing association – a common good should be introduced to allow shared owners more say and rights in the management of their buildings and homes,\n•Penalised for stair-casing (buying additional shares in their home) by excessive legal fees and cost placed up them by the housing association – an affordable flat rate should be introduced, and fees should be transparent and accessible.\n•Classed as leaseholders when they have ‘purchased’ a share in a property – their share should be converted to a freehold or commonhold\n•Given short term leases – leases should be longer than 99 years granting more security and providing an asset to pass on to relatives rather than the present system where shared owners have to buy extensions to their lease again at exorbitant rates placed on them by their landlords the housing associations.”\nLyn’s response was considerate and thoughtful. I have referenced it below.\nDear James,\nThank you for contacting me regarding the shared ownership scheme for purchasing property. I understand your concerns on this issue, and I fear for the conditions shared owners face, particularly given the current economic climate.\nAs you are aware, shared ownership is a method whereby new buyers can purchase part of a property and pay rent to a housing association for the rest, only paying the mortgage for their part of the property. The individual who owns part of the property can then purchase more shares in the property from the housing association, sometimes leading to the eventual outcome of the buyer owning 100% of their property and becoming the outright owner.\nI share your alarm over the lack of protections and reforms for shared owners within the Leaseholder Act 2022. I do not feel the Act went far enough to overhaul the antiquated and feudal leasehold system, which leaves leaseholders open to excessive service charges and poor-quality maintenance companies.\nFor some, shared ownership schemes are a useful way of getting onto the property ladder without having to pay prohibitively large deposits. However, I know that for many in Newham and across the country, the lack of proper protections for those within shared ownership agreements has resulted in great difficulties for primarily new homeowners.\nFor example, I have heard from many constituents about the pain that excessive service charges have brought. Currently, service charges can rise up to 13%, often from housing management agencies providing sub-standard service. These charges are simply unaffordable for many young couples and working families, especially as the prices of food and energy continue to soar.\nMoreover, one of the advertised perks of shared ownership is the promise of ‘stair-casing’, whereby shared owners can buy more of their home as they can afford it until they own the property outright. However, I know that many shared owners have been hit by excessive and cumbersome legal fees and other costs placed upon them by housing associations, thereby preventing them from buying more of the property.\nOn top of this, many owners are either unable or dissuaded from selling their portion of a property should they decide to leave the home, often by housing associations who are either unequipped or unwilling to buy back the shares. This leaves some shared owners in properties they simply cannot sell or afford to leave.\nFinally, I am aware many shared owners have issues with the leasehold process itself. Despite owning a portion of the property, they are legally classed as leaseholders and often given short-term leases. This creates insecurity for those living in the homes and introduces all of the problems we know come with the leasehold system.\nI believe that our housing system, from rental to leasehold and outright home ownership, needs fundamental and wide-reaching reform.\nIn 2019, during a debate on leasehold reform, I told the Government of the conditions that many leaseholders are forced to endure, from instances of completely dead water pressure to non-existent waste disposal services. I called on the Government then to free leaseholders from the injustice of the leasehold system, but I fear that they did not listen. I will link this speech below.\nhttps://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-07-11/debates/329FC410-5C69-40AC-80B1-32D470DB8B0C/LeaseholdReformhighlight=leasehold#contribution-7EBDA717-D61F-4597-8492-D3F8A1B98C50\nMoreover, on 23 May this year, I voted for an Opposition motion calling on the Government to end the sale of new private leasehold houses, introduce a workable system to replace private leasehold flats with commonhold and to implement the Law Commission’s recommendations on enfranchisement, commonhold and the right to manage in full. This motion passed unanimously.\nI have written to the Minister for Housing and Planning, Rachel Maclean MP, to further raise these concerns. I have asked what steps the Government are taking to ensure that shared owners are given the protections they need to live securely in their homes. I have also asked how the Government plans to reform the shared ownership and wider leasehold sector to end current abuses.\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me again on this, or any other, matter.\nKind regards,\nLyn Brown\nClearly Lyn has been advocating for the rights of leaseholders and owners of shared ownership properties. Shared ownership can be the right housing option for some, however more needs to be done to ensure there is equity in the housing system and share ownership is not the forgotten section of our housing system.\nLeave a comment",
  "https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_/https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_2017_03_11_newham-co-op-continued/content_129.html": "On Wednesday 8th March Newham Cooperative Party welcomed Claire McCarthy our General Secretary.\nIt’s not everyday members of the Cooperative Party or any party for that matter with the sight of a General Secretary checking membership details at the door. But that’s the beauty of the Co-op movement and the state of play of Newham.\nAfter members had been signed in everyone took their seats. There was some tension in the air as you would expect from the last heated meeting. But chaired by a London region representative the meeting kicked off. There were some noticeable absences including the Chair of Newham branch, Lester Hudson, who we were told was attending an awards ceremony. Nonetheless the meeting began.\nThe positions not filled at the last meeting were up for contention. These included Secretary, Treasurer, Membership Officer, Assistant Secretary and the New position of Events/Social Secretary. All candidates had to submit prior to the meeting a 100 word statement for the position they were standing for and it was good to read supporting statements and what candidates would do if elected.\nThere was a point of order or clarification raised whether candidates who were nominated would be on the ballot. The representative from London region was clear that all Newha Co-op members were afforded the opportunity to stand for a position as long as they submitted a statement.\nOnto the vote for Secretary, Gill Hay vs. Neil Wilson. A tense ballot and count and Gill was victorious. The Treasurer was next, as there was only one candidate, Averil Donohue who is current Treasurer, they were duly elected.\nMembership Officer again had only one candidate, Alan Griffiths, he was duly elected. Assistant Secretary, currently John Gray, was elected as the sole candidate.\nThen came the exciting part. The positions no-one submitted statements for. These included the new post of Events/Social Secretary and the Auditors (x2).\nThe candidates for Events/Social Secretary were Sugathan and Neil Wilson. Both spoke on the spot and gave good reasons why they should be elected. The ballots were distributed and counted. The winner we Neil Wilson.\nFinally the heralded positions of Auditors. This I where I dear reader come in. I was nominated by four fellow cooperators and I was duly elected. Thank you!\nThe second Auditor elected was Conor McCauley and much desired.\nFinally the highlight of the evening was the speech by Claire McCarthy. In consistent Newham fashion those who were there solely to vote left and those I assume who were generally interested in hearing from our General Secretary stayed.\nClaire gave a clear and impassioned speech about co-op values, ethical politics, supporting Labour councillors who wanted to stand as Labour/Co-op councillors (which I think would be advantageous and I may consider it) and continuing to build a cooperative and mutual based society in Newham and beyond.\nOverall the evening was well ordered and considering the positions up for grabs it was good natured. Perhaps having Co-op HQ present officiating made certain potential offenders behave on the night. But we do need more meetings like these where it’s about speakers, debates about policy and positions, development of co-op values at a local level that is inclusive and supportive of Newham’s communities.\nAgain I sign off by saying I look forward to the next Newham Coooperative Party meeting and hope I will be able to attend.\nLeave a comment",

Thank you for your support.\n#London’s schools, colleges & universities are vital to the capital’s future.\nAs your Labour London-wide candidate for the #LondonAssembly I will campaign for more resources to support London’s students, teachers, and education sector.\nAs we enter a new year, it is important to reflect on the significance of education in shaping the future of our capital, London. The SEA’s mission to prioritise the needs of our students, teachers, and the entire education sector is commendable.\nLondon’s schools, colleges, and universities play a pivotal role in preparing our young minds for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead and upskilling those who return to education. They not only provide knowledge but also foster creativity, critical thinking, and innovation.\nHowever, it is no secret that the resources available to support our education sector have been stretched thin in recent years. Budget cuts and increasing demands have put immense pressure on our schools and colleges, leaving many struggling to meet the needs of their students effectively.\nThis is where my campaign for the #LondonAssembly to provide more resources becomes crucial. As a Labour London-wide Assembly Member I will fight to ensure that London’s students have access to the best possible education, regardless of their background or circumstances. By advocating for increased funding, we can empower our teachers with the necessary tools and support to deliver high-quality education to all.\nInvesting in our education sector not only benefits the students but also lays the foundation for a thriving and prosperous city. A well-educated workforce is essential for driving economic growth, attracting businesses, and creating job opportunities. London’s future success depends on the knowledge and skills of Londoners, and we must do everything in our power to nurture and cultivate that talent.\nMoreover, it is important to recognise that our teachers are at the heart of our education system. As a school and further education governor I have seen first hand how teachers devote their time, energy, and expertise to shaping the lives of our students. Therefore, it is imperative that we provide them with the resources and support they need to excel in their profession. By doing so, we can ensure that our students receive the best education possible, enabling them to reach their full potential.\nI want to tackle the barriers that can impede education such as childhood poverty and reforming further education.\nWhen ballots arrive to decide your Labour London-wide Assembly Member candidates vote James Beckles for your 1st preference so that we can continue to campaign and fight for a decent, high quality and well funded education sector for students and education professionals.\nLeave a comment",

The situation for refugees in Greece and France was described as distressing.\nHowever there are organisations mainly in the charity and voluntary sector who are reaching out to these vulnerable groups of people. They offer advice and support from befriending to mental health and language skills. These are services are in high demand and can help refugees find the support they are often denied.\nThe audience present were people with a keen interest in helping refugees and one lady spoke of the work she did locally to help them, although she mentioned the struggles she had with her local authority when she wanted to offer a room in her council house to house a refugee.\nWhat I came away with after this discussion was a positive sense of the good work and good will provided by ordinary people who just want to help people at their most vulnerable, who through no fault of their own have fled their home countries for safety.\nThe rhetoric we often hear and see in the media is inflammatory and dangerous. It is used to whip up resentment and division. This is something we should all combat.\nThose of us born, raised and living in the UK and the west are fortunate and we should extend our fortune to those most in need.

The discussion was thoughtful and positive with an enthusiasm for Labour to build on its successes and continue to maintain a campaign footing for any future election, although I suspect the Government as battered and bruised under Theresa May’s leadership is not as willing to subject themselves to another election so soon after their disasterous campaign which cost them their majority.\nNext we moved to Officer reports, due to the summer period there wasn’t much to report and we moved to the highlight of the evening, in my opinion anyway, the Councillor reports. As I was the only councillor present in the meeting I had the court. I updated the branch about my report and activities I took part in over the summer period including the Summer Reading Challenge and cases I managed. After my update I took questions from members.\nOne of the questions raised was about the £40 million loan Newham Council made to West Ham through their investment vehicle Newham Legacy Investmest Limited (NLI). The news that Newham Council may not get our £40 million back was of concern to members. I informed branch members of what I knew that this investment was now “impaired” but not a write off and that the Mayor would be making a full report at the next Full Council on Monday 18th September 2017 and that I would raise their concerns if they had any questions.\nI also took questions regarding two alleyways on East Road, the delivery of NewhamMag and possible closure of a community centre, not in the ward but linked to the closure of other community centres in the area.\nI thanked members for their questions and stated they could contact me anytime about local issues via email.\nThe secretary then suggested dates for possible campaign sessions to members, agreeing best dates for those members present and stated these would be related to the branch organiser for confirmation.\nThe date for the next meeting was set and so ended the meeting. I look forward to the next branch meeting, this month will be a busy one and at the end of the month I will be attending Labour’s annual conference in Brighton for what I know will be full of policy, diverting speeches and no doubt surprises.\nLeave a comment",

  "https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_/https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_2017_10_30_a-case-for-term-limits-for-directly-elected-mayors/content_184.html": "Elected mayors haven’t been the success that was initially hope for when the legislation drawn up to create was enacted.\nAs I write excluding the new ‘Metro Mayors’ for city regions, there are only 16 local authority areas with a directly elected mayor, two areas, Hartlepool and Stoke-on-Trent, choose to return to a leader and cabinet model. There have been 53 areas have held referendums in England and Wales to establish elected mayors, out of these areas 37 have rejected the introduction of the post.\nI’ve excluded the new Metro Mayors and City Regions because their frameworks are still new and their level of accountability has yet to be tested. So I’ll focus on single local authorities as that is the area I know well.\nSo what has caused this rejection of creating a powerful, singular position that is directly elected by the people and supposedly accountable to them. Well partly it is to do with power and how it is used and precisely who are they accountable to. Executive functions can result in a power grab that stifles the ability of councillors to shape policy, elect who their peers in to the cabinet and build consensus on a range of other political areas.\nHow could term limits help? Well short of abolishing the role of elected mayor and returning to the old model, term limits of say two terms of four years would help, in my opinion, candidates be more targeted and focused on delivering their agenda within their eight-year programme, there would be more consensus building, residents would have a choice of candidates, there would be new ideas and new directions which would be open to debate.\nTerm limits would create a process of succession planning where new and old candidates can set their stall out and make their pitch, set out whether they will do things differently or whether they were continuation, status quo candidates who will carry on the agenda from the previous administration. But whatever platform was taken at least people including councillors, party members and the public would know what a candidate stood for.\nTo my knowledge only three directly elected mayors have left office – Sir Steve Bullock in Lewisham will be retiring, Jules Pipe resigned due to being appointed Deputy Mayor for Planning, Regeneration and Skills by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and Lutfur Rahman who was unceremoniously forced out of office due to a number of controversies. What these examples highlight is how once elected the incumbents decide when to leave office (like leaders in non-democratic states think Angola or Russia) or they are forced out due to legal challenge (Richard Nixon springs to mind).\nIn Newham two years ago West Ham Constituency Labour Party held a vote on a motion to introduce term limits. The vote for limits narrowly missed out by two votes. I had voted in favour of term limits but to no avail. An argument against term limits for directly elected mayors could be that candidates are giving up their day jobs to pursue this role therefore staying in post is a viable career. I would counter and say the exposure, contacts and experience of being in such a position makes you more likely to have other career avenues open to you once you’ve left office which would be far more lucrative.\nNo doubt there will be those who will say that directed elected mayors have a direct mandate from the communities and people they serve. Such mandates are bestowed on the incumbent with good will and the best of intentions but what happens when a leader becomes entrenched and unwilling to leave? Then you get power plays and internal battles where ‘allies’ covertly and on occasion openly seek to gain influence and discredit the post holder and other potential candidates.\nThis is not a healthy political scenario to work in, if you are in the fray, or watch if you are a by stander or constituent. The ideals of elected office are that those you elect should concern themselves with advancing your causes and issues rather than their own. Of course ambition, positioning and poisoning (figuratively of course, we aren’t in the Roman Senate or Ukraine) are part of politics but could be partially avoided with a term based system.\nTo conclude anyone who wanted to become a directly elected mayor in the future should be asked the following how long do you intend to stay? And what measures will you put in place to increase accountability and limit your powers? Any candidate who couldn’t answer or refused to probably wouldn’t get my vote. Power that is willing to be curtailed is more trustworthy and ultimately more beneficial.\nLeave a comment",

This letter was as Seyi and I pointed out inappropriate and disappointing; and did not reflect the essence of what Black History Month was trying to convey.\nBack to our meeting we had prepared a PowerPoint presentation (slides below) and a plan for change in Newham which we presented to the Mayor and Tahmina. At the heart of our presentation was a draft set of ideas for a five year plan which if implemented would make the preparation, commissioning and delivery of Black History Month in Newham part of our business and more organic. The Cabinet had a week before agreed to set up a working group to explore how best to celebrate Black History Month I’m the future. This was a positive step but to go further the group will need buy-in at a political and corporate level, both points Seyi and I raised.\nWe set out how best we could work with this new working group, one suggestion was to make it an action group therefore it would be proactive and not laden with bureacracy and diktats that can stifle good ideas but it should be targetted and focused with the objective of delivering a workable model that would make Black History Month in Newham relevant, educational and informative.\nIt won’t be an easy task but me and Seyi are prepared to play out part in getting this group off the ground, developing a plan that is inclusive, informative and more importantly steers us away from the misconceptions held by some about what Black History Month is and should be about.\nTwo years ago a group including myself, Seyi, Rokhsana Fiaz and Darren Steer, held a well attended Black History Month discussion. We did that on a very limited budget with good will from UEL/Birkbeck and the high profile speakers. It just took will and commitment. We are hoping for the same now going forward. Just imagine what more a local authority could achieve, not just with financial resources but through links and reputational clout. We will be working hard to ensure that this is another legacy we can be proud of.\nLeave a comment",

We are pleased to have an exhibition provides by Eastside Community Heritage which perfectly set the tone and provided an educational and positive perspective of black people and various black cultures and communities.\nPaula had been invited to give her presentation by the Newham African and Caribbean Network and the Wast Ham CLP Women’s Forum. Her presentation delved into history of the black community in the UK and their/our influences on British society. The discussion ranges from contributions to Britain’s music scene to politics and mainstream society. Some of the history were familiar but others were untold stories which often get over looked from a historical context.\nPaula and her colleagues have also developed and written a book in line with the national curriculum which can be taught to children but also inform adults. I purchased a copy so that I would have a beater understanding of my culture and pass on that knowledge to my young son so that we can learn together.\nAs I have written previously I believe black history is part of UK history the two are intertwined going beyond slavery and more recent historical landmarks such as the Empire Windrush’s arrival. Black people have played their part in making this nation what it is today and continue to do so. The book Paula Perry and colleagues have written goes so way to highlighting that.\nI would urge members of the community from all ethnicities to read the book and/or ask for it to be stocked in your local library. It’s informative and a fun way to learn about a subject often sidelined by mainstream narratives about British History.\nLeave a comment",

It was fitting that I could deliver this speech in the borough I have grown up in and which has a proud history of welcoming many from African and Caribbean communities.\nAfter ten years of black history month being sidelined it was timely that this celebration of black history and culture was once again supported by the council. Black History Month is an inclusive month of learning ancd sharing and is important now more than ever. This is not the end of the campaign to keep Black History Month relevant in Newham but only the beginning.\nHere is my speech below:\nBlack History Month\nIn this month of October we celebrate Black history month. This year I am particularly pleased to be celebrating Black history month in Newham, after ten long years it has been revived and we are able to immerse ourselves in talks, books and presentations in our libraries and public\nspaces.\nFor those of us who have campaigned to put Black history month back on the agenda this is a significant milestone and thanks should go to our new Mayor and Deputy Mayor for their efforts\nand leadership on this.\nBut thanks should also go to the many who came before the unsung campaigners and heros who work tirelessly to ensure Black history is accessible and available throughout the year. People like Linda Bellos a former councillor and leader of Lambeth Council who pioneered Black History Month by helping to introduce it the UK more than 30 years ago to\nchallenge negative stereotypes of black people in 80s Britain and Patrick Vernon, another former Labour councillor and founder of the 100 Great Black Britons Campaign.\nBlack history like all history has its good and bad moments. We often reflect solely in the bad. A well known adage is that black history didn’t start with slavery and it didn’t so it is crucial that this month look holistically at history of black communities and the African diaspora from art, literary culture even the mainstream sport stars and personalities but they should be balanced with what impact they have had on the UK and all its people. Black history is intertwined with UK\nhistory and that should be celebrated as well as deconstructed.\nSo I would urge colleagues and members of the public here tonight to be brave and venture out to your local library to either read a book or hear a panel discussion during this Black History Month. You will find you will learn alot and share in the celebration.\nHappy Black History Month!\nLeave a comment",

The situation for refugees in Greece and France was described as distressing.\nHowever there are organisations mainly in the charity and voluntary sector who are reaching out to these vulnerable groups of people. They offer advice and support from befriending to mental health and language skills. These are services are in high demand and can help refugees find the support they are often denied.\nThe audience present were people with a keen interest in helping refugees and one lady spoke of the work she did locally to help them, although she mentioned the struggles she had with her local authority when she wanted to offer a room in her council house to house a refugee.\nWhat I came away with after this discussion was a positive sense of the good work and good will provided by ordinary people who just want to help people at their most vulnerable, who through no fault of their own have fled their home countries for safety.\nThe rhetoric we often hear and see in the media is inflammatory and dangerous. It is used to whip up resentment and division. This is something we should all combat.\nThose of us born, raised and living in the UK and the west are fortunate and we should extend our fortune to those most in need. Refugees should be welcomed and integrated into their new host country. We should actively support them in their new lives here. Civil society has taken the lead and I only hope our government will follow.\nLeave a comment",

His language and tone haven’t been tempered by his victory or holding the highest and most prestigious political office in politics.\nHis executive orders have come thick and fast, but it’s his executive order to ban visitors from seven mostly-Muslim majority countries has been the cause of much consternation across the world. The executive order which has been dubbed on social media as the #Muslimban has divided many. His supporters at home remain committed to this “maverick” businessman turned politician and others home and abroad have been appalled by his stance.\nTo clarity the list of seven countries was drawn up by the Obama administration but it is the Trump administration which has enacted it to fill effect and withdrawn the United States of America from international norms on refugees.\nMany in Europe are appalled about President Trump’s discriminatory policy. However in Europe vilification of Muslims, immigrants and anyone non-European has been on the rise. Through mainstream media’s reporting of Muslim and immigrant crime, questioning certain groups ability to integrate in host countries and the economic “burden” placed on those counties have not helped matters.\nTrump has turned rhetoric into practise and held up an uncomfortable mirror to western democracies exposing the often one sided shaming of minority and immigrant communities who live within their borders.\nBut that is for another day. Monday was about people coming together to rally against a President who is treating this great office into a farce. Although I couldn’t stay longer to see and participate in the rally, Labour Group beckoned, my support went out to all those present. I hope it makes a difference.\nLeave a comment",

I would also like to extend my thoughts to the memories of Henriett Szucs, Mary Jane Mustafa and Shadika Mohsin Patel and Kelly Stewart who all sadly lost their lives to violence in Newham.\nIn the Community Safety service, we work in partnership with the police and other agencies through the Newham Community Safety Partnership (CSP) which has identified tackling Domestic & Sexual Violence as one of its priority areas of work for 2021/22.\nWe have a multi-agency subgroup of the Newham Community Safety Partnership which focuses specifically on tackling Domestic Abuse & Sexual Violence, with representatives from across the Council, working closely with Police, Probation, Health, London Fire Brigade and community sector partners to develop plans to tackle violence against women and girls.\nCurrent work underway in Newham and within the service area of my cabinet colleague for Health and Adult Social Care includes;\n- The Hestia Service (the Newham Domestic and Sexual Violence) supports Newham residents through;\n- Independent Domestic Violence Advocates/Independent Sexual Violence Advocates (IDVAs/ISVAs)\n- Domestic and Sexual Violence Floating Support\n- Specialist Domestic Abuse Court Coordinator\n- Female Genital Mutilation Support\n- A Multi-agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC) Coordinator\n- Domestic and Sexual Violence Peer Support\n- Exiting Sex Work Support Workers\n- Hestia works closely in partnership with Housing, Police, Adults and Children Social Care, Children’s Centres and CGL, Newham’s commissioned substance misuse provider in the borough. There will be a new service opening at Newham hospital commencing in April 2021.\n- Operation Encompass – which directly connects the police with schools to ensure support for children living with domestic abuse in their homes when there has been the police attended an incident of Domestic Abuse. Rapid provision of support within the school environment means children are better safeguarded against the short, medium and long-term effects of domestic abuse.\n- We have a Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) service and an exiting sex work service in place in the borough supporting those women affected by these issues.\n- The Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC) is a risk management meeting that meets four times a month and is where professionals share information on high-risk cases of domestic violence and abuse and put in place and monitor a risk management plan for cases presented.\n- The NIA Project delivers services for women and girls who have been subjected to sexual and domestic violence and abuse, including prostitution. NIA run the East London Rape Crisis Centre and deliver support, crisis intervention and counselling to women, in Newham and elsewhere, as they deal with the issue’s associated with rape and the Court process.\nGoing forward\nThe London Borough Newham and our partners are currently developing a broader programme of work to ensure that we better understand and tackle Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG), in all forms, in our borough, as we know these crimes are at unacceptable levels across London. This will include developing a Newham Violence against Women and Girls Strategy, reshaping and expanding services as required to meet the needs of our communities and ensuring that we champion consistent messaging across all partners that Violence Against Women and Girls is unacceptable in Newham.\nIn November, Newham Full Council passed a motion calling for misogyny to be made a hate crime. The Council voted unanimously for the motion, stating that the hatred of women and girls must be recognised by the law. Ensuring safety for women on our streets and in their homes will only come with cultural change; we need action in our schools, workplaces and communities to challenge the structures that lead to this violence. The national government must step up and take the lead on this. We need a nationwide approach to dismantling the structures that lead to this violence. Women should not have to change the way they live their lives to avoid harassment, discrimination or violence and we will be doing all we can as a partnership to play our part in making that change.\nLeave a comment",

  "https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_/https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_2019_02_08_the-ecam-question/content_193.html": "On Tuesday night (5th February) I joined cabinet colleagues at East Ham Town Hall for our regular Cabinet meeting to agree important items including our new budget framework, our internal review commission, establishing our affordable homes for Newham programme and our new changes to the Every Child programme for a new enrichment programme for children and young people.\nThe last of these would prove to be the most controversial. On the same night a group of lobbyists including teachers, children, members of the public and local councillors had gathered at the steps of the town hall. Before the start of our official cabinet meeting the Mayor and Cabinet met the lobbyists at the front of the town hall. The Mayor addressed the crowd to dispel the myths and misconceptions around the proposed offer that was to be discussed on the night. Some of the lobbyists still remained sceptical.\nTrue to the new administrations committment to transparency and openness members of the gathered crowd were invited into the council chamber to view what would be discussed and crucially have their moment to put across their view.\nBack in the chamber cabinet members took our seats and we were joined by members of the lobby outside. A speaker from the group a music teacher called Mr Prescott spoke on behalf of the group and stated the importance of musical education.\nAfter the Mr Prescott’s speech Cabinet went into great detail about the proposed offer that would be available to children and young people and it was heartening to hear fellow cabinet member Councillor Julianne Marriott speak eloquently about the proposed changes how they would offer a comprehensive offer that would be inclusive and more in line with the needs of our children and young people. There was also a wide ranging and advertised consultation to give interested parties their opportunity to comment on the proposals.\nAfter a full discussion and questions from the lobbyists and some interruptions from some backbench councillors present it was time make a decision. The Mayor to allay the concerns of the lobbyists present and to ensure there were no misconceptions proposed the insertion of three key words at the end of section 2.1.4. the key words being “that includes music”. These three words would ensure that any change to the current Every Child programme to a new enrichment offer would include music. Cabinet agreed the introduction of the new wording and took a vote. The proposed changes were agreed.\nThe work will continue to work with partners and interested group and engage them in the changes. One such group is the Musicians Union, who by chance are being advised by fellow Labour Party member Barry Cunning’s new PR agency Pentland Communications. Interestingly on Pentland’s website former Mayor Sir Robin Wales is listed as a Senior Associate. Let us hope that misconceptions and myths about the new agreed enrichment programme end and all partners and interested groups engage openly in this process. Because people are at the heart of everything we do.\nLeave a comment",

He spoke about his experiences in Britain, joining the British army and the importance of the EU and it’s peace project binding European nations together.\nOnly a Labour win at these European elections will deliver a Europe that will promote worker rights, clean air and environment and more opportunities for people especially our young people.\nThere is only one option, that is Vote Labour!\nLeave a comment",

The Covid 19 pandemic and the three lockdowns have prevented normal interactions among friends and family. We have also not been able to meet as a Labour Party branch, especially as we restart the London Mayoral campaign. As one of your three local Labour councillors alongside my two colleagues Councillors Sarah Ruiz and Patricia Holland, we have been working hard to represent you and Custom House even within the circumstances we have faced recently. Below is a summary of my work and activities from January to March 2021.\nLocal ward work -Cases have included:\n• Parking Emissions responses to residents.\n• Housing enquiring from a leaseholder regarding a leaking roof.\n• Fly-tipping and anti-social behaviour referral around Woodhatch Close\n• Received a petition regarding anti-social behaviour and young people causing a nuisance around Stansfield Road and calling for CCTV.\nCustom House and Newham Campaign Academy Phonebanking and Dialogue training session\nSaturday 13 March Custom House and Newham Campaign Acamedy organised a phone-banking and training session on the Labour Party’s new phone-banking software Dialogue. We were taken through the in and outs of how to set up our phones on the system and make calls for Labour Party campaigns. It was good to see and hear from branch members from Custom House and prepare ourselves for the hard work of getting Sadiq Khan re-elected as our Labour London Mayor. In terms of contacts, Custom House stands at number 13 out of 20 wards. If we campaign regularly we can be in the top ten of voter contacts, therefore I urge all branch members to join one of Newham Campaign Academy’s phone-banking sessions every Saturday and call Custom House voters. Where we can we are urging voters to vote safely and vote from home by applying for a postal ballot.\nOne UK appearance discussing the impact of COVID 19 on young people\nOn 17 February I appeared as a guest speaker on TV One UK to discuss what Newham Council was doing regarding youth crime and the impact of Covid 19 on young people in the borough. The discussion was lively with many probing questions from the host Ajmal Masroor. I spoke of the investment Newham has made in its young people including the Brighter Futures service, cultural offer, the support offered remotely and working with schools to provide children and young people with the computers and equipment they need to get online and stay updated with their studies. Other guests included Dr Ali Jahan, who spoke about young people’s mental health which has been affected during the various lockdowns we have undergone, and Councillor Jas Athwal, Leader of Redbridge Council, who spoke about the efforts made by his Labour-led council to address the needs of children and young people.\nWest Ham Labour and Newham Unions phone-banking\nI joined a group of Labour comrades and local Newham Trade Unionist to phonebank for the Sadiq Khan re-election campaign on 2 March. We were joined by our London Assembly Member for City and East Unmesh Desai. Unmesh spoke of the work Sadiq Khan has accomplished since his election in 2016 from freezing bus fairs to funding provided for affordable housing. There are still contentious issues to be addressed like knife crime and the Silvertown tunnel, both of which negatively impact our residents’ security, health and well-being. However, having a labour Mayor is far better than having a Conservative one. Stephen Timms also spoke passionately at the zoom event. Members then engaged in calls to Newham voters to convince them to vote Labour. Due to the pandemic and the restrictions we cannot take any vote for granted and must engage residents and voters. Sadiq Khan launched his London Campaign on 4 March with a key message for his second term – Jobs, Jobs, Jobs.\nEverybody’s Business Network Presentation\nOn 25 February I was invited to speak at the Race Equality in Newham (REIN) facilitated Everybody’s Business Network about my role as lead member for Crime and Community Safety. I outlined the services my portfolio cover including animal welfare, anti-social behaviour, regulatory services and a small complement of 16 council-funded Metropolitan police officers. I spoke of the statics to frame the discussion about how Newham Council and the administration were addressing the challenges in the borough by taking an intelligence-led approach, working with our multi-agency partners including the police, probation service, health and social care services and the voluntary and community sector to tackle the most pressing issues in the borough. After the presentation, I took questions and distributed the presentation for Network members to digest and get back to me if they had further queries.\nInternational Women’s Day\nMonday 8 March was International Women’s Day. This year’s theme is #ChooseToChallenge and it is an important message that all of us and not just women have to challenge the structures that oppress and hold women back. I attended a brilliant webinar about women who did just that and it was amazing to see so many inspiring and engaging women talking about their experiences and how they made strides in their lives and chosen fields.\nNewham People’s Budget 2021\nOn Monday 1 March we passed our Newham People’s Budget. The budget provides a one-off £330,000 Mayoral Covid-19 Hardship Relief Fund to help people hardest hit by the pandemic and continues record investment in youth services and affordable housing. However, due to the cost of Covid which has taken its toll on council services, the council has been forced to approve a 4.99% council tax rise to cover the shortfall in our budgets which the Conservative government has not funded us for. The additional money raised from the increase will be used to meet the growing cost of adult social care.\nFurther details and help\nDue to the coronavirus and lockdown, I haven’t been able to attend my usual resident surgeries in Custom House Library. However, I have been able to engage local residents by email and Zoom. If you need to get in touch with me or have any issues that you would like to discuss please contact me by email – James.Beckles@newham.gov.uk\nCouncillor James Beckles, Custom House ward\nLink to online ward report: https://issuu.com/jamesbeckles/docs/councillor_start_of_year_report_2021\nLeave a comment",

However they have been underserved by the current Tory GLA member. There is a need for more affordable housing for families and young people, safer streets, improved green spaces and more support for local small businesses.\nAs your candidate for the GLA I will fight for the resources to ensure people in Havering and Redbridge have their share of London’s opportunities and prosperity. I will fight from day one or more truly affordable housing at social rent levels, more investment in policing and higher targets for air quality.\nSmall businesses are the back bone of our economy not the large corporate businesses found in the city. Yes they play a part in London’s wealth but it small shops and small businesses which support the local economy in Havering and Redbridge. I will fight to get more grants to improve our high streets and argue that it is the high street that needs rates cut to support small businesses and help local communities thrive.\nThese are my pledges and if you want to here more about my ideas and what I will do, then do get in contact. #BackBeckles\nLeave a comment",

As local black councillors and having grown up in one of the most diverse boroughs in the UK it was surprising that a teacher had not taken the time to research appropriate and effective ways to celebrate Black History Month and educate their pupils.\nYes colonialism, slavery and both its impact on future generations and countries is world history-that cannot and should not be forgotten. However, there is so much more to Black History Month than the transatlantic slave trade and this was not the intentions of Akyaaba Addai-Sebo- the founder of UK Black History Month. A more rounded approach to the teaching of black history was needed here. Time and time again we see missed opportunities to celebrate black Britons who have achieved and contributed so much, an opportunity to inspire children and make learning history relatable.\nThere are several good resources available for teachers, schools and parents to refer to,\nPaula Perry’s Black British History guide for example\n. Even a quick search online about Black History Month will yield a large resource of information including notable figures, diverse cultures and histories pre-slavery which should be explored in a place of learning.We understand regretful mistakes are made. We hope there’s true learning from this awful situation and next year we see all schools mindful of the significance of Black History Month taking a renewed holistic approach to teaching this to our children.\nCllrs.

We are pleased to have an exhibition provides by Eastside Community Heritage which perfectly set the tone and provided an educational and positive perspective of black people and various black cultures and communities.\nPaula had been invited to give her presentation by the Newham African and Caribbean Network and the Wast Ham CLP Women’s Forum. Her presentation delved into history of the black community in the UK and their/our influences on British society. The discussion ranges from contributions to Britain’s music scene to politics and mainstream society. Some of the history were familiar but others were untold stories which often get over looked from a historical context.\nPaula and her colleagues have also developed and written a book in line with the national curriculum which can be taught to children but also inform adults. I purchased a copy so that I would have a beater understanding of my culture and pass on that knowledge to my young son so that we can learn together.\nAs I have written previously I believe black history is part of UK history the two are intertwined going beyond slavery and more recent historical landmarks such as the Empire Windrush’s arrival. Black people have played their part in making this nation what it is today and continue to do so. The book Paula Perry and colleagues have written goes so way to highlighting that.\nI would urge members of the community from all ethnicities to read the book and/or ask for it to be stocked in your local library. It’s informative and a fun way to learn about a subject often sidelined by mainstream narratives about British History.\nLeave a comment",

The charred remnants of homes are all that remain of Grenfell Tower.\nAs I write 79 people have been confirmed dead and there are others who are missing. As the facts begin to be reported daily we learn that this tragedy could have been averted. Residents of Grenfell had repeatedrepeatedly raised concerns about the refurbishment of the block including questioning the type of cladding, which we now know was the cause of the fire spreading so fast in such little time, and the lack of sprinklers. These concerns were ignored. In fact everything the residents voiced about Grenfell, which was their home seems to have been ignored and residents labelled as trouble makers.\nWhat is most shocking is that this tragedy happened in The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the richest borough not just in London but the country. Grenfell holds a mirror up at housing and wealth inequality in London and by extension Britain. Below the veneer of nicely manicured streets and exclusive addresses poor housing conditions were hidden under a beautification project which cosmetically changed the look of the building from the outside but did very little to improve the lives of those living inside.\nMany questions will follow and the residents and media will demand answers. The public inquiry will investigate but a fully independent inquest would and should be the best route to get answers.\nAs a councillor in Newham there have understandably been questions raised about our tower blocks and I am sure this tragedy has focused the minds of elected councillors, housing officers and local services to review and reassure residents living in these buildings.\nMy thoughts go out to those who have lost young ones and people who are without homes. The people of Grenfell deserve to be rehoused close to their old home, community and familiar surroundings. To deny them this dignity would only exacerbate their suffering.\nLeave a comment",

I was in my ward of Plaistow North on Saturday with fellow party members and activists knocking doors and talking to people about why a Labour government is important and why they should vote for a Labour candidate.\nSome residents take it for granted that Labour will simply get back in but that type of thinking by party members can lead to complacency and that is how you lose votes and forget the important rule in politics…listening to the voters. It is voters that gives us the mandate and it is voters who ultimately decide the fate of political parties and politicians.\nOn Sunday I was in Forest Gate North with Lyn Brown and local councillors and party members to pave the streets and talk to more residents. We had a good response from people and it is reassuring to know that a have support for our candidate in the local area. But presence is everything and residents knowing we are there and visible can bolster our own confidence and help us win. An effective ground campaign I always let to keeping the opposition at bay and we at certainly able to do that in Newham and hopefully in other contested seats.\nLeave a comment",

I felt that in my Newham cabinet role as lead for crime and community safety I could enquire about the successes and challenges in this area.\nI was not disappointed. Ashley introducedt me to David Jamieson the Police and Crime and Crime Commissioner for the West Midlands, and we spoke about his role and how he used his office to make an impact in the region, tackle and reduce crime. I found the discussion very beneficial.\nAshley then introduced me to one of the policy officers in community safety who was leading on implementing the recommendations from a gangs commission the West Midlands PCC office had set up. What was interesting about this commission and it’s recommendations was that it was very much community focussed and community-led, with input and resources from the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner and public sector agencies.\nI found this interesting as empowering communities is often spoken about but not always done. These recommendations would be different and how they would be implemented would depend on the ‘buy-in’ from local communities and their participation.\nThere was plenty for me to learn and I would take back lessons to be applied in Newham. An offer of a visit to Newham was extended and I look forward to hosting Ashley and others and showing them how we manage crime and community safety in Newham.\nLeave a comment",

  "https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_/https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_2019_08_15_a-masterclass-in-politics-in-britain/content_217.html": "On Thursday 8th August I was invited by the founder of the Equip Boys School, Noreen Mukalazi, to deliver a workshop on Politics in Britain to the young boys attending the Equip Boys summer programme.\nI was delighted to do so; not only am I keen to share my experiences about my journey into politics but I also enjoy talking to and encouraging young people to get involved into the political process. What sets the Equip Boys School out is its focus on young black boys and encouraging them to succeed. This is a timely programme as the attainment levels of young black men can fall short behind their white peers and where they do succeed they face a number of hurdles and barriers.\nI spoke to the young people about my educational experiences from A level to degree, my first office job – working for my local member of parliament in her Westminster office and my professional experience before I entered local politics.\nTo make the workshop more engaging I gave the boys a task, to answer the question – How can politics engage you? – and for them to present their ideas to the rest of the class. I wanted to gage how much they are engaged by politics, what can politicians whether locally or nationally do to involve them in decision making and whether they wanted to be involved in that process.\nThe boys took turns to feedback and I was impressed by their answers and it gave me ideas how I might engage young people in the future. I provided my own comments that exercises like these would be used as part of a consultation exercise to get their views.\nI ended the class by thanking the group for their time, wishing them well on the rest of the course and the educational studies in the future. I have every confidence that they will succeed in life and with people like Noreen and guest lecturers including Geoff Thompson MBE supporting them they already have great mentors.\nLeave a comment",

It has been a great privilege to serve you and this community during my first year.\nSince being elected by you I have thrown myself into my new role joining the Regeneration and Employment Scrutiny Committee, working with colleagues to scrutinise the Council’s budget as a member of the Budget Working Group and ensuring we build high quality developments in the borough as deputy chair of the Local Development Committee. But all of this doesn’t match the work I do with members and residents in Plaistow North.\nI have met many local residents in the course of my work, whether at; my local surgery, community events such as the opening of First Avenue’s community garden or taking part in the planting of Northern Road’s garden space, and attending Plaistow North’s ward panel meetings. I get the opportunity hear about your concerns and listen to what is important to you and how we can improve our local area. I hope that over the next year I will meet more of you and we can work together to continue the improvements made.\nMe and my colleagues work hard to ensure the residents of Plaistow North are represented and your views and concerns are heard at the Town Hall. We want to ensure the services we deliver meet your needs. Plaistow is a fantastic place with many exciting things happening and I hope as members of this vibrant branch you take the opportunity to get involved in the local community and upcoming activities in the ward.\nFeel free to drop by my surgery on the 2nd and 4th Saturday of the month at Plaistow Library. You may have a concern or simply want to talk about what we offer in Plaistow North but my door as it were is always open.\nI look forward to seeing you at the next branch meeting.\nYours sincerely\nCouncillor James Beckles\nPlaistow North ward\nContact me on:\nMobile: 07533942363\nTwitter: @James_Beckles\nLeave a comment",

An Action Group of councillors met to discuss the best way forward. Future meetings to be scheduled.\nPlaistow held it’s first Artist Open House studio event which was a Plaistow wide arts and culture event showcasing the work of local artists from their own home, Plaistow Library and artist studios. It’s a shift away from what we currently do in Plaistow but offers new opportunities for us to enjoy the best of arts and craft in Plaistow North.\nI attended the Audit Board meeting in November to discuss council procedures for safeguarding council resources and money.

There were representatives from the Metropolitan Police, residents, Community and Youth activist, Newham MPs and Councilllors all there to discuss and respond to the increasing number of youth crimes and deaths occurring in our borough. It was a thoughtful event and I hope members will play their part in working with police and councillors to help us tackle any criminal activity in the ward.\nPlaistow South Big Local organised their regular Youth Market with students from NewVic Sixth Form. The market was well organised and displayed the entrepreneurial skills from students and local residents. I picked up a few treat a for friends and family and I would recommend the next one members of that are free should attend.\nAs one of the members of the Fire Safety Scrutiny Committee, I visited two Tower Blocks in the borough to speak to residents about how they feel Newham’s response has been lost Grenfell.

The scrutiny committee will publish a report next year. I will share the key findings when published.\nBeing nearly Christmas I have attended Branch socials including the joint Plaistow North and West Ham Christmas Social which had a quiz, my team Soar to New Heights came 3rd, a raffle, music from one of our ward members, an appearance from our MP Lyn Brown and the customary Labour Family photo.\nFurther details and help\nIf there are any concerns or issues you would like to discuss please contact me on email –\nJames.Beckles@newham.gov.uk or visit me at my resident surgery held on the 2nd and 4th Saturday of each month at Plaistow Library 10:30am to 11:30am.

I attended with a number of other cooperators from across the country and London. The London Co-operative Party held a simultaneous event so members were able to go between the two conferences and here the ideas and panels from a range of speakers who are putting co-operative principles into practice up and down the country where Labour and Cooperative councils are in power and making tangible differences in the lives of people they represent.\nAs a Labour and Cooperative councillor I am one of 360 plus councillors elected this year who is taking the core values of the Co-operative Party of fairness, social justice and community and making changes that will revive our high streets, tackle the inequalities that affect many in our communities and support our local areas to be economically successful through through collective good and establishment of new cooperatives and encouragement of existing ones.\nThe event was the first in person Co-operative Party event since the Pandemic and there was plenty of discussion of recent events including the recent elections and catching up with familiar faces old and new, which is what every good political event consists of (socials and networking). Overall it was a successful event with policy discussions, welcoming newly elected councillors, metro mayors and bringing together cooperators intent on common good.\nLeave a comment",

I would also like to extend my thoughts to the memories of Henriett Szucs, Mary Jane Mustafa and Shadika Mohsin Patel and Kelly Stewart who all sadly lost their lives to violence in Newham.\nIn the Community Safety service, we work in partnership with the police and other agencies through the Newham Community Safety Partnership (CSP) which has identified tackling Domestic & Sexual Violence as one of its priority areas of work for 2021/22.\nWe have a multi-agency subgroup of the Newham Community Safety Partnership which focuses specifically on tackling Domestic Abuse & Sexual Violence, with representatives from across the Council, working closely with Police, Probation, Health, London Fire Brigade and community sector partners to develop plans to tackle violence against women and girls.\nCurrent work underway in Newham and within the service area of my cabinet colleague for Health and Adult Social Care includes;\n- The Hestia Service (the Newham Domestic and Sexual Violence) supports Newham residents through;\n- Independent Domestic Violence Advocates/Independent Sexual Violence Advocates (IDVAs/ISVAs)\n- Domestic and Sexual Violence Floating Support\n- Specialist Domestic Abuse Court Coordinator\n- Female Genital Mutilation Support\n- A Multi-agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC) Coordinator\n- Domestic and Sexual Violence Peer Support\n- Exiting Sex Work Support Workers\n- Hestia works closely in partnership with Housing, Police, Adults and Children Social Care, Children’s Centres and CGL, Newham’s commissioned substance misuse provider in the borough. There will be a new service opening at Newham hospital commencing in April 2021.\n- Operation Encompass – which directly connects the police with schools to ensure support for children living with domestic abuse in their homes when there has been the police attended an incident of Domestic Abuse. Rapid provision of support within the school environment means children are better safeguarded against the short, medium and long-term effects of domestic abuse.\n- We have a Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) service and an exiting sex work service in place in the borough supporting those women affected by these issues.\n- The Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC) is a risk management meeting that meets four times a month and is where professionals share information on high-risk cases of domestic violence and abuse and put in place and monitor a risk management plan for cases presented.\n- The NIA Project delivers services for women and girls who have been subjected to sexual and domestic violence and abuse, including prostitution. NIA run the East London Rape Crisis Centre and deliver support, crisis intervention and counselling to women, in Newham and elsewhere, as they deal with the issue’s associated with rape and the Court process.\nGoing forward\nThe London Borough Newham and our partners are currently developing a broader programme of work to ensure that we better understand and tackle Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG), in all forms, in our borough, as we know these crimes are at unacceptable levels across London. This will include developing a Newham Violence against Women and Girls Strategy, reshaping and expanding services as required to meet the needs of our communities and ensuring that we champion consistent messaging across all partners that Violence Against Women and Girls is unacceptable in Newham.\nIn November, Newham Full Council passed a motion calling for misogyny to be made a hate crime. The Council voted unanimously for the motion, stating that the hatred of women and girls must be recognised by the law. Ensuring safety for women on our streets and in their homes will only come with cultural change; we need action in our schools, workplaces and communities to challenge the structures that lead to this violence. The national government must step up and take the lead on this. We need a nationwide approach to dismantling the structures that lead to this violence. Women should not have to change the way they live their lives to avoid harassment, discrimination or violence and we will be doing all we can as a partnership to play our part in making that change.\nLeave a comment",

Not only was there a great turnout of supporters and activists but there was enthusiasm for this campaign.\nThe response on the doors was generally positive although some people wanted greater clarity about Labour’s position on a second referendum. That same day Jeremy Corbyn, Leader of the Labour Party, announced that Labour would but a People’s vote if we could not get changes to the Withdrawal Agreement or a General Election.\nThere is no doubt that in London there is a call for a People’s vote which would go someway to moving forward from the current deadlock the conservative government has boxed itself into.\nThe campaign continues and looking forward to it!\nLeave a comment",

So now papers have been signed and submitted I can reveal that I will be a #Labour London-wide candidate in the upcoming 6th of May elections 2021. Due to a vacancy on the London-wide list, I was asked if I would be interested in stepping up and joining the list, obviously, I said yes. I will be the only Black working class man on the list and running for Labour so feel it’s important to have that diversity reflected, especially now.\nThe caveat is unless there is a seismic vote for Labour it’s not likely I will be elected but I’m here to help campaign for our fantastic Labour Mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan and get him re-elected; along with as many London Assembly constituency and London-wide candidates get into the Assembly and represent the people of this great city.\nAs a Labour and Co-operative Party councillor and a committed trade unionist I want to use this opportunity to speak about the issues Londoners want raised such as the creation of well paid jobs, affordable homes, an accessible city, a safer city, cleaner and greener streets, opportunities for young people, fairness and equality.\nThese elections are crucial, they were delayed last year due to the pandemic lockdown and it will not be fought in the same ways as elections gone by. But technology has made campaigning from home easier, social media allows us to reach out and engage with people who might not be thinking of voting labour but who may share our values. No vote can be taken for granted and I will be campaigning, as will many other activists, to secure as many votes as possible to keep London Labour.\nLeave a comment",

Not to mention our shared values of democracy, pluralism and tolerance.\nI was dismayed by the initial EU referendum vote in 2016 and I’ve been continually disappointed by the lack of progress in the withdrawal negotiations. The multiple red lines imposed by the Tory government has meant that we were never going to agree a deal that would retain some of the benefits of membership such as a compromise EEA membership the so-called “Norwegian Model” or a deal that seriously safeguards the Good Friday Agreement. Theresa May while appeasing those who want a hard Brexit has jeopardised peace in Northern Ireland and the finances of ordinary people and families who will be hardest hit by a tariff heavy no deal Brexit.\nSo I’m standing to ensure those concerns are not forgotten in the debate about whether we stay or go or the type of deal we get. I want guarantees for the rights of workers, people from minority groups like me and to make sure environmental regulations will be protected and not lowered but enhanced if or when we leave the EU.\nOriginal article published on neweuropeans.net: https://neweuropeans.net/article/2715/james-beckles-labour-london-uk\nLeave a comment",

  "https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_/https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_2021_05_09_london-election-special/content_86.html": "The London elections for Mayor and London Assembly are over. The good people of London ballots cast their votes on Thursday 6th May and right up until the close of the polls I and many other Labour activists across London pounded the streets to remind and encourage the electorate to vote for our candidates – Mayoral, constituency and list. I’m proud to have been a Labour London-wide list candidate, and although I was far down on the list it was a great opportunity to campaign in different constituencies, meet other candidates and activists in person and put in a good performance for the party.\nMy entry on the list was unexpected and at the 11th hour, but I couldn’t refuse the opportunity to step up and be part of great team of candidates including our mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan and tremendously hard working party staffers who organise and tell us where to go and when. These elections would be crucial, not only would they determine who will govern London for the next three years but they would show what Labour can do in power against a national backdrop of Tory Party rule and a country re-emerging after three pandemic lockdowns. My role as a list candidate was to put in a good showing, support constituency candidates and their teams, an raise my own profile in the process.\nI have to say that I have enjoyed the opportunity to campaign in my home borough of Newham, Waltham Forest, Redbridge and Islington both for Sem Moema but also for my friend Valerie Bossman-Quarshie who was standing as a candidate in Bunhill ward and has successfully been elected as a councillor! And not forgetting phone banking on Dialogue.\nI’ve met a number of committed and dedicated Labour members along the way, some were councillors and others MPs but all going above and beyond to campaign and get a Labour mayor and Assembly Members elected across London.\nI had two long days at the election count at Excel London, handily based in my Custom House ward. The first night was mixed with wins and losses for Marina Ahmad (Win), Stefano Borella (Loss) and Judith Garfield (Loss). The second day was more successful with wins for Len Duvall and Unmesh Desai.\nThe final count of the campaign was at City Hall with my London-wide list candidate comrades. Due to restrictions we did spend the best part of two hours waiting outside in the cold before we could enter but knowing Sadiq Khan was re-elected as Mayor of London made the wait that bit better. Inside City Hall we had our final photos and chats then the results of election were announced. I was pleased to see Elly Baker and Sakina Sheikh elected as our two newest labour members on the London Assembly but disappointed that current serving Assembly Member Murad Qureshi, third on the list, didn’t get re-elected. Politics can be hard and unforgiving profession. As party we didn’t do as well as we had hoped, although we picked up votes the list results delivered four Conservative, three Green, two Lib-Dem and two Labour Assembly Members. But we importantly maintain the mayoralty and we can do good things during a challenging time and hostile government to make the lives of Londoners better.\nI will be forever pleased that I had this opportunity to take part in this campaign as a candidate and support my party and campaign for a positive and progressive vision for London. I remain optimistic for the next challenge and campaign. Let’s get it done!\nLeave a comment",

My story is interwoven with this city’s vibrant history, mirroring the struggles, resilience, and indomitable spirit that define London. My parents, like countless others, sought a better life here, and I’m living proof of the opportunities this city has to offer.\nEast London has been my home and witness to the transformative power of change. I’ve seen the celebration of the Olympics and the subsequent regeneration, but I’ve also witnessed the stark contrast between those who’ve benefited and those who’ve been left behind. After 13 years of Tory rule, the life chances and quality of life for Londoners are dwindling.\nThat’s why I decided to step up and fight for a more equitable London. In 2014, I stood as a councillor in Newham, driven by a sense of civic duty and a burning desire to amplify the voices of those who felt unheard. I advocated for better homes, schools, healthcare, and access to jobs, ensuring that everyone has a fair chance at a brighter future.\nAs a former Cabinet Member for Crime and Community Safety, I played a pivotal role in reducing crime and antisocial behavior in Newham. My 3 and a half years in office were marked by strong partnerships with senior police officers, resident groups, and community safety cabinet members across London.\nI’m not just a candidate; I’m a proven leader, having run as a London Assembly List Candidate for the 2021 Mayoral and London Assembly elections and as a Labour MEP candidate for London in the 2019 European Parliamentary elections. I understand the political landscape, I’m connected to the people of our city, and I’m determined to translate my principles into tangible improvements for all Londoners.\nJoin me in my campaign to make London a better, fairer, and greener city. We’ll fight for a London where every voice is heard, where every neighbourhood thrives, and where every Londoner can reach their full potential. Together, we can keep London Labour and send a resounding message to City Hall: London’s future is safe in our hands.\nVote for me to be your next London-wide Assembly member, and let’s shape a London that truly reflects its people’s aspirations.",

Officers from across the Council joined with partners from the Metropolitan Police to walk the streets of Stratford to talk to residents about issues which affect their daily lives.\nDuring the three days of action, officers were joined by Cabinet lead for Crime and Community Safety, Councillor James Beckles, who saw first-hand the impact such events can have on the local environment and residents. He said: “We are determined to make the streets of Newham safer for all. That means getting out into the community, talking to people about the issues affecting them and what could be done to make their lives safer and more pleasant. “During these three days our teams have tackled everything from crime and vandalism to anti-social behaviour like littering, street drinking and inconsiderate parking. We have also been reiterating the Covid-19 rules and how to follow them to keep our community safer.”\nAs a result of the patrols, fines were issued for obstruction of the highway, fly-tipping and waste in front gardens. In addition a number of beggars and buskers were moved-on and alcohol removed from streets drinkers.\nAlmost 70 businesses were given advice around the wearing of face coverings in indoor settings and 861 people were advised about wearing face coverings in Stratford Mall.\nCllr Beckles said: “Through these exercises we are bringing the Council together with residents and delivering direct action to our streets. Of course during the Covid-19 pandemic our officers will be reminding businesses and residents about the rules and restrictions in place to keep us safe. It’s all about engagement, encouragement and only in the last resort enforcement.”The event in Stratford is the latest in a series which has already seen Manor Park, Little Ilford and Forest Gate targeted. The exercises are directed at hotspots which are identified from analysis of complaints and reports from residents.\nLeave a comment",

We spoke about young people, crime, community safety and police reform.\nUnmesh is longstanding member of the London Assembly’s Police and Crime Committee, so is keenly aware of the background to a number of policing and crime issues affecting east London. In my capacity as cabinet member for crime and.community safety I have direct insight into the council’s efforts to tackle ASB and crime working alongside the police. We both share a desire to tackle these issues for our constituents, however we cannot do so where trust and confidence in the police is questionable and belief that the police will treat you fairly irrespective of who you are is low.\nIn an area such as Newham which is diverse, afflicted by serious crime and has a significantly young population the police have to take this into account and work with communities.\nPolice reform, a topic we delved into, is much needed. Sadly the now departed Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick became the victim because of the slow pace of police reform and the number of misdemeanors and misdeeds of serving police officers who undermined her and the wider Met police force. If the metropolitan police is truly to change and be a force fit to service London and its people it has to be open, transparent and willing to tackle the racist, sexist, homophobic and toxic culture which has led to the resignation of one commissioner and will be a mountain to overcome for the next.\nLeave a comment",

Polling day had arrived and it was going to be just as busy!\nAfter casting my vote, for Labour of course, I set of for Pimlico to join activists in Cities of London and Westminster to knock doors and get out the vote – GOTV as we call it in Labour circles.\nAt one polling station I came across a TV network from Austria called the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF), the equivalent to the BBC. I explained I was a Labour candidate for London and gave an impromptu interview.\nWe had a good round of door-knocking and spoke to as many people as possible. I spoke to a young man who was thinking about voting Lib Dems. I explained what Labour’s position was and why it was important to vote for us. We had a progressive manifesto and we are the only party committee to investing in our public services and infrastructure as well as a committment to a public vote. He seemed convinced.\nAfter spending time in Pimlico I headed further west to Westminster North where I continued to knock doors with another set of dedicated activists to get the message out that it was polling day and Labour was the party to vote for.\nI then headed back to familiar territory to east London. Where I met up with the organised and still active West Ham CLP team in Stratford for a final polling station push. I was pleased to see many familiar faces returning from doors they had knocked based on labour promises and to see one committed volunteer imputing data and calculating turnout. It’s great to have such people working hard and tirelessly for the party they love.\nAs 10pm approached we knew we had done all we can, although you always have that feeling that if you visited one more area or knocked one last door then that would be one more vote to acquire. But as polling station closed it was good to spend it with colleagues and friends and know we did enough and put all into this campaign.\nWhatever the result it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet a number of great people, dedicated Labour members and volunteers, travel around London to knock on unfamiliar doors and talk to Londoners.\nLeave a comment",

The workshop was on Forming and Joining a Multi-Academy Trust (MAT).\nThe workshop was delivered by an experienced trainer Pam Garrington who had been through the MAT process herself and shared her experiences of the intricate procedures, governance processes and the questions governors should ask if they are in a MAT, forming one or joining a MAT.\nI found the session very informative and the questions asked by other governors on the night were precise and displayed their enthusiasm towards the training.\nMulti-Academy Trusts are a reality and they will become more prominent structures for schools to pursue. However well informed governors can ensure that the best interests of the pupils and the community are primary considerations in existing and new MATs.\nLeave a comment",

We made out way up toward Barking Road to talk to residents living above the shops on this busy commercial street.\nAs is customary in many a campaign session we knocked the doors, waited for a response. If a resident opened the door; we asked them if there were any concerns in the local area they wanted to raise with one of their local councillors. Finally we always ask if they voted Labour and if they would do so at an upcoming election.\nA had a good number of positive respinse from those who answered their doors and where there were no response we left an out card with the names and contact details of the councillors so people can get in touch if they want to raise a local issue.\nDoor knocking is an enjoyable and valuable experience for councillors and activists. It keeps you in-touch with your local residents and community. You hear their concerns and they are you have to face on the doorsteps.\nWe can’t take our communities and voters for granted, engaging, listening and learning is important.

The commissions involved academics, experts, local businesses and crucially local residents. Newham despite continuous development and population growth still has high levels of deprivation, higher than the boroughs named. Such a commission would go some way to help us tackle poverty and engage external expertise from local residents and stakeholders.\n- Have Newham’s officers looked at the findings of the reports?\n- Will Newham be undertaking a similar commission to look at what more we can do to alleviate and tackle poverty in the borough?”\nI received two responses to my question from Councillor Rachel Tripp. Although I thank Councillor Tripp for her response, it only answered part of my questions and didn’t tackle how we will engage and work with our local partners to tackle deprivation in Newham.\nAs a council we do and provide a lot of services but we cannot tackle and alleviate the scurge of poverty in our own. We need new ideas and different approaches. Some of these I believe would come from engaging with and involving all out partners in the local area.\nLeave a comment",

My work in March 2017 has included:\nLocal case work\nHousing remains a key part of my case work. Two residents have attended my surgery regarding housing including one for emergency housing. Currently talking with the residents and the relevant services to get assistance for the parties and/or alternative arrangements.\nOne case involving an older resident and a complaint regarding a nuisance neighbour which has been escalated to the relevant council team to review.\nWorking with residents on Stock Street on RPZ on their road.\nOne request for more parking permits, resolved with an answer from the highways team.\nCouncil Budget\nOn the 27th February voted with other Newham councillors on Newham’s budget. This includes a council tax freeze for the 9th year in a row and protection of key services used by Plaistow North and Newham residents.\nOther work\nI sit on Newham’s Overview and Scrutiny Committee. On 7th March we met representatives of Newham Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), the lead member for health – Cllr Furness, Healthwatch and Newham residents to discuss the Sustainable Transformation Plan (STP) put forward by Newham CCG. These are plans that will change how the NHS commission services in Newham and how residents will access them. The committee was reported on by the Newham Recorder along with one of my questions: http://www.newhamrecorder.co.uk/news/health/risks_of_newham_healthcare_proposals_discussed_1_4924836\nLocal Development Committee – my ongoing work to ensure houses and small developments are in line with Newham’s local plans and benefit residents locally by being well built and sustainable. I was elected vice-chair, in february until the end of the municipal year.\nAudit Board – 22nd March attended the Audit Board meeting. I asked questions about how we safeguard Newham’s funds from fraud and ensure we have robust procedures in place, how our auditors (Ernst & Young) analyse and monitor our performance and what we do internally to strengthen our audit capabilities.\nPublic Realm improvement meeting – 27th March attended a briefing on proposals to improve public spaces and the street scene in Forest Gate, Maryland and Stratford. Raised question on the improvements taking place in Plaistow and ensuring these are of a high quality.\nFinally\nThe events on the 22nd March outside of Parliament, have shown us that there are individuals who want to divide our communities. But we should remember the hard work of the police to make our streets safer, especially our local ones. If you can please get involved in your local police ward panel and help make our ward safer.\nIf there are any concerns or issues you would like to discuss please contact me on email – James.Beckles@newham.gov.uk or visit me at my resident surgery held on the 2nd and 4th Saturday of each month at Plaistow Library.\nKind regards\nCouncillor James Beckles\nPlaistow North\nLeave a comment",

It was a full house, which is always an indicator of a crucial vote or positions up for grabs. Last night the latter was the case.\nBefore the meeting officially started there were already grumblings that the time taken to start the meeting was excessive and points of order were already being raised. Although points of order before a meeting has actually started are merely comments and cannot be stated as points of order, these opening remarks gave a clue to how the meeting would therefore proceed.\nAfter a long awaited start, Gill Hay the former Chair giving time for more delegates to attend and allowing time for an informal discussion, the meeting began. Officers’ reports a normal formality were agreed as read, partially due to the time but mainly to get to the real meat of the evening – votes for officer positions!\nNow the chair of Newham branch would be the most hotly contested position and their were two sets of slates (lists of preferred candidates) for each position.\nSlates are a political tool in politics depending on your political stance, who you’re friends with, who you don’t like or if you just want to get on, slates are used to select candidates for positions. I of course am just a humble observer and an impartial voter who just wants to see the best person in the role who has a ‘genuine’interest in cooperative principles.\nBack to the race. The two candidates for Chair, Gill Hay and Lester Hudson, gave their speeches and then ballot papers were handed out. There was some snubbing of ballot papers but as they say “politics is personal and the personal is politics”. It wouldn’t be a real election unless there were contested results and excessive ballot papers and there were plenty. This continued throughout the evening.\nThe votes finally came back and Lester Hudson was elected to be the new Chair.\nNext elections were for vice-chair which were two positions. The candidates Ayesha Choudhary, Jeanette Dye and Mehmood Mirza set out their positions. Votes were cast and the results for the two vice-chair went to Ayesha Choudhary and Jeanette Dye.\nThen there was the position of Secretary. Gill Hay, recently the Chair, stood against Lakmini Shah. Ballot papers were handed out, returned, votes counted and discrepancies found. Too many people had voted and two had mistakenly voted for candidates in the next election for Treasury, which was Averil Donoghue vs Aleen Alarice.\nThe vote was rerun but it was a tie – 34/34 – and as the meeting was nearing 21:45 and well past the tolerance of delegates attending it was time to go and officers elected at the last AGM would remain in place until the AGM was recalled whom to complete the votes. For the record I remain one of the auditors of Newham Coop Party branch.\nPersonally I want any political organisation in Newham to do three things – 1) meet regularly, 2) be well managed and 3) encourage meaningful discussions. Politics can be bland enough without all the procedural chicanery, infighting and un-Coop-erative (see what I did there) behaviour.\nPeople switch off because of it and lose interest in politics. The borough is changing rapidly and if newer residents and established ones are not involved or feel they cannot get involved in local politics without witnessing political grenades exploding before their eyes they will reject the status quo.\nFor evidence of these comments look at the current state of the Labour Party where no seat right now is a certainty; none more so than in Scotland where the party has been virtually wiped out (in Westminster representation).\nOne suggestion would be that out branch sends a delegate to the Cooperative Party national AGM and report back to members verbally and in writing for those not in attendance on what was discussed, what workshops they attended and how we might incorporate some best practice in Newham.

  "https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_/https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_2020_08_24_councillor-james-beckles-custom-house-ward-mid-year-report-2020/content_90.html": "Dear Member,\nThe last four months have been challenging as the Covid 19 pandemic and lockdown has meant many of us have spent months apart from friends, family and loved ones. It has also meant that as a branch we have not had the opportunity to meet in person. However, as one of your Labour Councillors for Custom House along with my colleagues Councillor Pat Holland and Councillor Sarah Ruiz we have been working hard to ensure we represent you effectively and resolve issues you raise with us. Below is a summary of my work and activities.\nLocal ward work\nCases have included:\n- Handling reports of local antisocial behaviour\n- Responding to a complaint regarding a council contract supply repair team\n- Responding to and raising with the highways and repairs teams a leak and flood of garages.\n- Reports of squatters using a vacant property near Leslie Road\n- Responding to concerns about people not socially distancing and a lockdown party in a garden in the ward.\n- Visited 3- 5&9 Freemasons Road to see the work undertaken to refresh and provide the former shop units as a facility for nurses working at the Nightingale Hospital at ExCel, and other beneficial uses for local people including a community kitchen.\nCouncil activities and Coronavirus\nCoronavirus has meant that Council had to change how it delivered services to residents in Newham. Due to Government guidance on social distance much of the council’s work including my own has been done online and remotely. The council’s main focus during lockdown was ensuring people were adhering to government guidelines and groups most vulnerable to the effects of coronavirus were shield.\nMy colleague Councillor Sarah Ruiz and I set up the Custom House Covid 19 support group so that we could bring together members of the community and share information about people in need in the local area. The level of response and kind heartedness has been immense and it is to the credit of Custom House that there is such community spirit and willingness to help locally.\nIn Newham, sadly, we had the highest rates of infection and the largest death rate. Only the science is still to be conclusive on all areas of the impact of Covid 19 we know that people from a Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) minority background are more likely to be affected by Covid 19. Newham is 75% BAME and this can be exacerbated by poor housing, multi-generational housing, underlying health conditions and job type i.e. working on the frontline and in roles with increased exposure to the virus – drivers, nurses, cleaners etc.\nThe rate of infection in the borough has since gone down but the risks remain so it is important to remain safe and follow government guidelines, even if ministers and their advisers do not.\nWithin my cabinet portfolio area of crime and community safety there have been challenges. The council’s community safety team has been relieved of its enforcement powers under the coronavirus legislation and it has been the primary role of the police to enforce social distancing. The community safety team has been commendable during lockdown with regular visits to parks and open spaces daily and on occasion advising people to go home and socially distance.\nOur 16 council funded police officers have also been patrolling the borough ensuring lockdown guidance were being followed and working with their North-East borough command unit (Newham & Waltham Forest) police colleagues ensuring the borough was adequately policed. There were some incidences – one resulting in the death of a young man in Custom House – David Gomoh, an NHS worker. The perpetrators have been caught and charged, but this does not make up for the loss of a young man who was working within our NHS to keep us safe.\nNewham subsequently had increased numbers of police from their violence suppression unit and we saw dramatic decrease in violent crime across the borough. As we emerge from lockdown it will be the responsibility of my portfolio area – community safety, other council colleagues and the police to ensure we provide the security and confidence our residents deserve both in Custom House and the wider borough.\nThere has been some positive news. The police conducted a number of raids on the 8th July in Newham. They arrested 21 people for drug offences and removed lethal Class A and Class B drugs off our streets and confiscated offensive weapons. The operation known as Operation Swona, was the result of the council’s community safety team and police working together using reports from local residents about antisocial behaviour and the police gathering eight-months worth of information about local drug dealers in Stratford. Many residents will sleep soundly knowing their raised concerns contributed to making their area safer.\nI was fortunate to have the opportunity to be interviewed live on air for Revive FM’s morning Drive Time programme about my role as a councillor in Custom House, my cabinet portfolio and Newham’s response to coronavirus pandemic. It has been challenging but I conveyed the response in Newham has been to galvanise the community and ensure no one is left with the help and support they need at such a difficult time.\nA New Labour Leader\nOn the 4th April Keir Starmer was announced the new Leader of the Labour Party with Angela Rayner elected as Deputy Leader. Keir promised during his campaign that he would work to unite the party and since his election he has formed a shadow cabinet of capable MPs to take the fight to the Tories. None of this will be easy, Labour suffered a crushing defeat in December 2019 so rebuilding trust and confidence in the electorate and in the seats we lost will be crucial to our path back to government.\nBlack Lives Matter\nThe tragic and horrific death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in the United States. This tragic loss of life through police brutality has led to mass demonstration in the States and globally as protesters call for greater equality for Black people and call for the end of police brutality under the banner of the Black Lives Matter Movement.\nCouncillor Terry Paul, Cabinet member for Finance, and I wrote an article in response to this tragic event and laid out an action plan for the Labour Party to affect change. Our article “The legacy of subjugation corrupts American society – and shows us why we need to put our own house in order too” can be found here – http://progressonline.org.uk/the-legacy-of-subjugation-corrupts-american-society-and-shows-us-why-we-need-to-put-our-own-house-in-order-too/\nFurther details and help\nDue to the coronavirus and lockdown I haven’t been able to attend my usual resident surgeries in Custom House Library, and I have to say I am missing them. But I have been able to engage local residents on email and Zoom. If you need to get in touch with me or have any concerns that you would like to discuss please contact me on email –James.Beckles@newham.gov.uk.\nCouncillor James Beckles\nCustom House ward\nLeave a comment",

  "https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_/https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_2017_02_07_west-ham-labour-goes-to-stoke/content_94.html": "On Sunday 5th February some of West Ham CLP’s activists made our way to Stoke-on-Trent Central. A key seat where the resignation of its sitting Member of Parliament, Tristram Hunt, has launched a by-election, which will be held on the 23rd February.\nFive of us, Daniel, Rohit, Karl, Alan and myself, joined local Stoke activists on the day; knocking doors and talking to residents about why Labour and Labour’s Prospective Parliamentary Candidate, Gareth Snell, are well suited to representing the interests of Stoke-on-Trent Central.\nStoke-on-Trent Central is also a target seat for the Conservatives and UKIP. Paul Nuttall, UKIP’s Leader, has launched his campaign to be Stoke Central’s next MP. Stoke-on-Trent was an area that voted resoundingly for the UK to leave the EU and this has emboldened UKIP. They remain a credible threat and there is undoubtedly some support for their toxic and divisive brand of politics. During our canvassing session we decided to pay Paul Nuttall’s alleged address a visit and posed for pictures outside. There should be no ‘no-go areas’ for Labour and this was one of them.\nLater in the afternoon we joined more activists from Stoke, Wales and Keele University’s Labour students. We talked to resident about why Gareth and Labour are the right choice for Stoke Central. He’s local, he will stand up for the NHS, children centres and be a voice for Stoke and not London.\nThis by-election is not a certain victory for Labour and that’s why it’s crucial Labour members and activists who can help should help. It’s a test for the Party and it all all our determination and policies which will make it break this campaign.\nLeaving Stoke I’m glad we could lend our support for this constituency. It’s almost natural that we consider areas like this as safe but there are no safe seats and we do have to treat every seat like a marginal if we are to win and keep constitiences like Stoke Central Labour.\nGood luck to Gareth Snell and the Labour team. They are doing great work and there’s still everything to fight for.\nLeave a comment",

  "https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_/https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_2017_02_14_all-we-want-is-a-little-coop-eration/content_120.html": "Yesterday night was Newham branch Cooperative Party AGM. It was a full house, which is always an indicator of a crucial vote or positions up for grabs. Last night the latter was the case.\nBefore the meeting officially started there were already grumblings that the time taken to start the meeting was excessive and points of order were already being raised. Although points of order before a meeting has actually started are merely comments and cannot be stated as points of order, these opening remarks gave a clue to how the meeting would therefore proceed.\nAfter a long awaited start, Gill Hay the former Chair giving time for more delegates to attend and allowing time for an informal discussion, the meeting began. Officers’ reports a normal formality were agreed as read, partially due to the time but mainly to get to the real meat of the evening – votes for officer positions!\nNow the chair of Newham branch would be the most hotly contested position and their were two sets of slates (lists of preferred candidates) for each position.\nSlates are a political tool in politics depending on your political stance, who you’re friends with, who you don’t like or if you just want to get on, slates are used to select candidates for positions. I of course am just a humble observer and an impartial voter who just wants to see the best person in the role who has a ‘genuine’interest in cooperative principles.\nBack to the race. The two candidates for Chair, Gill Hay and Lester Hudson, gave their speeches and then ballot papers were handed out. There was some snubbing of ballot papers but as they say “politics is personal and the personal is politics”. It wouldn’t be a real election unless there were contested results and excessive ballot papers and there were plenty. This continued throughout the evening.\nThe votes finally came back and Lester Hudson was elected to be the new Chair.\nNext elections were for vice-chair which were two positions. The candidates Ayesha Choudhary, Jeanette Dye and Mehmood Mirza set out their positions. Votes were cast and the results for the two vice-chair went to Ayesha Choudhary and Jeanette Dye.\nThen there was the position of Secretary. Gill Hay, recently the Chair, stood against Lakmini Shah. Ballot papers were handed out, returned, votes counted and discrepancies found. Too many people had voted and two had mistakenly voted for candidates in the next election for Treasury, which was Averil Donoghue vs Aleen Alarice.\nThe vote was rerun but it was a tie – 34/34 – and as the meeting was nearing 21:45 and well past the tolerance of delegates attending it was time to go and officers elected at the last AGM would remain in place until the AGM was recalled whom to complete the votes. For the record I remain one of the auditors of Newham Coop Party branch.\nPersonally I want any political organisation in Newham to do three things – 1) meet regularly, 2) be well managed and 3) encourage meaningful discussions. Politics can be bland enough without all the procedural chicanery, infighting and un-Coop-erative (see what I did there) behaviour.\nPeople switch off because of it and lose interest in politics. The borough is changing rapidly and if newer residents and established ones are not involved or feel they cannot get involved in local politics without witnessing political grenades exploding before their eyes they will reject the status quo.\nFor evidence of these comments look at the current state of the Labour Party where no seat right now is a certainty; none more so than in Scotland where the party has been virtually wiped out (in Westminster representation).\nOne suggestion would be that out branch sends a delegate to the Cooperative Party national AGM and report back to members verbally and in writing for those not in attendance on what was discussed, what workshops they attended and how we might incorporate some best practice in Newham. This would to some degree encourage discussion about wider policies at play outside the borough and we might forge links with neighbouring branches and hold discussions. Lofty ideas I know but isn’t that what politics is about?…\nI look forward to the next meeting of Newham’s Coop Party branch. I hope it will be good and ripe with discussion about Cooperative principles and ideas.\nLeave a comment",

  "https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_/https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_2017_01_27_brexit-the-european-parliament-what-it-means-for-trade/content_96.html": "On Thursday 26th January, the European Parliament in the UK held a well attended forum meeting to discuss the future of trade with the European Union post Brexit.\nThe panel was high-level experts from academia, representatives from business and their associations, a Labour MEP and a BBC journalist as moderator and chair.\nThe panel discussed what the possible outcomes of anu trade negotiatiomd woukd be for the UK and its businesses. The representative from ADS Group, an organisation that represents the aerospace sector, was not concerned with the prospect of tariffs due to the multinational nature of the aerospace sector which is an internationally intergrated industry. The academic view was Britain would have to revert to WTO rules in the event they have to negotiate nee trade deals outside o the sphere of the EU.\nThere was reference to adooting a Swiss model which would be a framework to begin negotiations with the EU. However not everyone on the panel were convinced that such a model woukd be right for the UK. David Martin MEP emphasised that a bespoke model would be needed but cautioned that any deal would be inferior to full membership, which has been reiterated by Europe’s politicians including Malta’s Prime Minister who holds the current presidency of the Council of EU. David Martin with one eye on the Government’s overtures to the United States said that any rushed deal with America would be a bad deal.\nPerhaps due to the location and pro-EU composition of much I he audience questions had an air of caution especially small and medium sized business owners who foresee tariffs and the introduction of more reguakation as a problem for their business. One person had already felt the effects of the EU referendum result on their business.\nWe know that once Article 50 is activated the UK Government will have have negotiate hard to develop a trade deal that caters to the needs of business, people and maintains Britajn’s place as an international trading and business centre. There is alot of doubt about what a deal will look like and what Britain’s future bi-lateral and multi-lateral deals will look like.\nIt remains to be seen what the Government’s strategy will be however many interested parties all be watching, lobbying and commenting on any trade deals.\nLeave a comment",

This strategy builds on a number of internal policies, current work underway and the Co-operative Party Charter Against Modern Day Slavery we adopted in our procurement processes.\nMy introduction to the Cabinet paper and the strategy are below:\nI’m pleased to bring this paper to cabinet.\nThe End Modern Slavery Strategy connects a number of critical policies and approaches adopted by our council and will form a clear approach concerning safeguarding and public protection of our communities against modern slavery.\nWe know that Modern Day Slavery and the exploitation that surround it happens in plain sight and it is important that we do not turn a blind eye to those at risk of harm and exploitation. As you will read in the report and the testimony in the case studies of victims the experience is harrowing but the support provided can change their lives\nWithin our Strategy there are four distinct elements that will be utilised to address modern day slavery – Prevention, Protection, Prosecution and Partnership.\nAs you will read from the report 95% of those referred in Newham are children and now more than ever as we are in the year of the child we will work with our partners to protect our young people and adults who are victims of exploitation.\nThe strategy includes work that is currently underway from awareness raising and training of adult social care staff, we have taken steps in procurement to implement the Cooperative Party Charter and reduce the risk of Modern Day Slavery from the Council’s supply chain but there is more to do such as improving our data, collection and insight on Modern Day Slavery and work with the Private Rented Housing team on the increased role they could play to identify potential victims of Modern Day Slavery\nIn terms of the implementation plan we will consult to ensure a broad range of people and partners have their say on this sensitive subject. Only through more effective partnership working can we protect more of our residents and achieve our ultimate goal of ending Modern Day Slavery in Newham.\nThe full report can be read here.\nLeave a comment",

It was Ascension Church’s Fun Day, helped by the sunny weather, local residents and families gathered to take place in fun and family friendly activities ranging from raffles, bracelet making, football and video game tournaments.

During the meeting we were shown a portfolio of Black History Month activites that had been planned for this year and told about BHM events that had happened in previous years. There was the sense that this incident had shocked and embarrassed the school and the reputational damage would be very hard to live down despite work done in previous years. Seyi and I set out our initial reaction to what had happened and the need for us to speak up about this incident as elected representatives. We also offered advice about how this might be avoided in the future. To their credit the school were receptive and were reviewing their procedures to avoid a similar incident in the future.\nAlthough these measures could not take away from what occurred it did show consideration and understanding of the situation and a need to repair trust with parents.\nBefore leaving the school we were given a tour, where we met a number of students and their teachers. Like most schools in Newham, St. Winefride’s has a diverse school population and there was, on first impressions, an indication the school sought to reflect that.\nWe cannot say what the outcome of any investigation on the teacher will be and it isn’t our place to pass judgement here. But we came away with a sense the school wants to work with us and move past this incident. They also, crucially, do not want a repeat of what happened.\nLeave a comment",

  "https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_/https_jamesbeckles_wordpress_com_2020_05_10_seven-weeks-of-lockdown-a-brief-summary/content_168.html": "As we leave behind the seventh week of the UK Lockdown, I reflect on what has been a challenging time for me, as a councilor and cabinet member, the borough of Newham and the country. It is times like this where you have to capture briefly what has happened, what you’ve done and what comes next before the memories fade and the exercises are forgotten.\nFirstly being in lockdown and avoiding travelling any long distances has been a change of pace for me. Like most people my normal daily routine involves getting ready in the morning and travelling to the office. Instead my new office are the rooms in my flat, the flexibility of which depends how much light is coming through the windows, a very important factor especially during remote Zoom meetings.\nThe whole structure around work has changed for many people. A number of people have been furloughed or are working from home. Many others have lost their jobs because their employers, organisations or firms would not or could not afford to keep them at home. Some due to insecure work and zero hour contracts are in a quandry not able to claim the benefits the government have allocated.\nCoronavirus has changed the dynamic of work. Employers should ask the question do all workers need to be in the office if they have the capacity to work from home? Allowing some workers to continue to work from home could ease congestion on transport as well as minimise the risks of coronavirus spread.\nAs a councillor my role has been tested. My normal twice monthly resident surgeries have been put on hold until the lockdown ends. I still try to communicate to residents and the wider political movement through Facebook, Twitter and our new lockdown tool of choice Zoom. But there is nothing quite like meeting residents and other stakeholders face to face. I stay engaged with my ward through the Custom House Covid Support WhatsApp group I set up which has taken on a communitarian life of its own. In my role as the cabinet member for crime and community safety, I have been involved in discussions about how our borough respond to the pandemic and how we monitor and work with the police to enforce the soci distancing guidelines set by government. The latter part has proved to be highly contentious with a number of people intentionally disobeying the guidelines and flagrantly congregating in public spaces. I accept that the guidelines set may set harsh and imposing on our rights to travel and go where we please with whom we please but the measures save lives and stop the spread of the virus. Newham has already suffered a heavy toll with the number of infections and deaths the highest in London. The UK due to short-sightedness and poor preparation by the government has the highest number of COVID-19 related death due in some part to the complexities and diversity of our borough population – predominantly black and minority ethnic, high levels of poverty, multi-generational households, overcrowded dwellings, poverty and workers in front line and public facing jobs. This factored with some individuals and groups choosing not to or unable to socially distance has detrimentally impacted our borough.\nOn matters of enforcement and ensuring people socially distance there has been much criticism of the police and the council for not being tougher on those who breach the guidelines. The police have chosen to take an even handed approach, although in the early days of the lockdown members of the public complained some police forces were being too over zealous. I’m of the view that the guidelines were mixed in the beginning but we now have a good grasp of what is and isn’t acceptable and doing actions to the contrary is a matter of choice rather than clarity of message. But should the police take a tougher stance and more importantly would that be welcomed or seen as over reach? These are some of questions I’ve faced on conversations with the community safety team and police as they patrol, observe, warn and report incidents in breach of guidelines. It’s not an easy task and has been met with mixed reviews some of which I take on board, sometimes reluctantly. I will advocate that my service are dealing with a difficult task without the necessary government issued powers enforce infractions but it remains an exercise of crisis management during an unexpected event.\nThe Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is expected today to set out some easing on the restrictions and a plan to restart society. There will be arguments that we should not rush and gradually bring people back to work, shops reopening and move society forward. If there is a second wave we will be back at square one, so it’s crucial that all possibilities are explored, a coherent plan published and the public made aware of the risks and benefits. Never before has public health been a national topic of discussion as it is now. The public, civil society and political establishment have to question to what degree should we return to normal, what does that look like and should we go back to the why things were? On evidence we now have a “new normal” and going back to how things used to be should not be an option.\nLeave a comment"
