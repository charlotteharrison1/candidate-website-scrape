If you are yet to receive either your first or second dose, please do so as soon as possible. To help get Tooting vaccinated, the Pearl Chemist Vaccination Centre is now offering a walk-in clinic for those aged 18+ at St Boniface Church on Mitcham Road (Monday to Saturday 9-5pm). Appointments are available for first doses as well as second doses. Second doses can be given eight weeks after the first. Any questions can be directed to Pearl Chemist on 0208 049 6640. With the re-opening of non-essential retail, I took the opportunity to shine a spotlight on the local businesses/business owners that make our vibrant community such a fantastic place to live and work. The easing of national Government restrictions marks an important point in our recovery - our community and high street have so much to offer, so for six weeks I showcased the stores, restaurants, cafes, and other small businesses that make Tooting what it is! A huge thank you to every single business, business owner, employee, and customer who got behind the campaign. The past year has been challenging, so to see our community come together to support the local economy has been truly heartwarming. While this week marks the final instalment (for now) of Spotlight Saturdays, I will continue to find new ways to shine a bright light on Tooting and our wonderful community. Wandsworth is in the top 5 for vaccination rates across London! This is a great step forward and I am proud of everyone here in Tooting who has taken the steps to protect themselves and others by receiving their jab. However, we still have a way to go before everyone is protected against coronavirus. We need to keep pushing to ensure that those who can do so, are vaccinated as soon as possible. Information on how to book your vaccination appointment can be found here. It is also vital that if, for any reason, you have to change or cancel your vaccine appointment that you let the GP surgery or vaccination centre that you appointment is booked with know. You can manage your vaccination appointment here. If you are still unsure about having the jab or have any questions, more information can be found on the vaccine and answers to many common concerns on Wandsworth Council’s website here. The work of biomedical scientists and laboratory staff is incredibly valuable - and this has never been clearer than since the outset of the coronavirus pandemic. Often overlooked as a profession, I was pleased to join others in thanking those working in healthcare sciences. For every coronavirus test conducted, a biomedical scientist has been behind it, working hard to ensure PCR tests are returned safely. I would like to thank, in particular, our incredible microbiology team at St George’s. Working in A&E, I know just how much our NHS relies on the incredible efforts of lab staff. I have included photos of the microbiology team at St George’s, featuring Chris James, a Specialist Biomedical Scientist in Biochemistry who has worked at St George’s for 9 years, and Silva, a Specialist Biomedical Scientist in Medical Microbiology and Virology who has worked St George’s Hospital for the past 4 years, after moving to the UK from Portugal. Silva’s words about her work as a biomedical scientist are impactful and I hope everyone is able to recognise the incredible work they do. “Being a biomedical scientist is an extremely impactful role in healthcare. Even though it’s not patient facing, our work and the speed and accuracy with which we can produce results is essential for patient care.” As you will no doubt be aware, the Covid-19 situation remains serious, with the Delta variant spreading rapidly throughout the country. One of the most important steps we can take to stop the spread of the coronavirus is to get vaccinated as soon as possible. For this reason, a range of walk-in vaccination sites have been launched across South West London. People aged over 18 are invited to drop into the Tooting and Mitcham United F.C. vaccination centre on Saturday 19th or Sunday 20th 9am - 8pm, to receive their first or second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Unvaccinated over 40s and over 40s who have received their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine before mid-April can also head down to the Roehampton Vaccination Centre, located in the Queen Mary’s Hospital car park, on Sunday between 8am and 7.45pm to receive their second dose. Together we can stop the spread of Covid-19. Details of additional walk-in vaccine centres in South West London are available here. Today I had the pleasure of visiting the impressive walk-in vaccine clinic, based at St Boniface Church on Mitcham Road. It was great to have the opportunity to speak with their incredible team of staff and volunteers, as well as meet local residents receiving their coronavirus vaccines. In partnership with NHS England, to date Pearl Chemist have administered over 30,000 doses of the vaccines. This is an incredible achievement and a real credit to our community. For local residents aged 40+ who have not yet had their first vaccination, the AstraZeneca vaccine is available at the Pearl Chemist clinic on Mitcham Road. You can also receive your second dose (eight weeks after your first dose) if you are in cohorts 1-9. Simply bring along your card! All other age groups can book their doses via the NHS website here. As a reminder, before you receive your vaccine, it is important to have eaten and be hydrated. With coronavirus cases in Wandsworth rising, it has never been more important to ensure you are fully vaccinated as soon as possible. By getting vaccinated, you are not only protecting yourself, but your community too. This May marks Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) Month. BPD, also known as Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD), is a serious and complicated mental illness that around 1 in 100 people live with. A type of ‘personality disorder’, BPD affects how individuals cope with life, manage relationships, and feel emotions. Those with BPD can experience deep distress, which is often caused by previous trauma. If you would like to find out more information on BPD, Mind and Rethink - two leading mental health charities - have dedicated pages on their websites. Mind’s can be viewed here and Rethink’s here. If you are experiencing BPD, BPD World also provides information and support to those affected by personality disorders. To find out more about the support they offer, see here. It is vital that we raise awareness of BPD to ensure that people receive the support they need and deserve without feeling stigmatised. As a new mum, it can be vital to talk and share your experiences with those in the same situation as you. No new mother should have to suffer in silence if they are struggling with their mental health. To mark Maternal Mental Health Week, I would like to share some brilliant charities and support services available for women and birthing people: Family Action offers specialist support services for parents with mental health difficulties. This includes services during pregnancy and after birth. Further information on Perinatal Support Services Family Lives can be found here. The Association for Postnatal Illness offers information and support for those experiencing postnatal depression. The APNI are available between 10am and 2pm, Monday to Friday on 0207 386 0868. Alternatively, an online chat box on the bottom left of their website can be found here. Family Lives offers confidential support, information and advice for parents. Support is available via email [email protected] or via there helpline on 0808 800 2222. PaNDAS - Postnatal Awareness and Support is a community organisation offering peer-to-peer support. PaNDAS has a free helpline, open 7 days a week, 11am to 10pm on 0808 1961 776. Alternatively, they can be contacted via email on [email protected] and a trained volunteer will aim to get back to you within 72 hours. If you are at crisis point, the Samaritans can be contacted 24/7 on 116 123. As the backdrop for the BAFTA winning series 24 Hours in A&E, St Georges is now opening their doors to the Fetal Medicine Unit in Channel 4’s new series ‘Baby Surgeons: Delivering Miracles’. The documentary follows obstetrician Professor Basky Thilaganathan and his team as they work to save the lives of unborn babies with complex medical conditions. In one moving episode, Professor Thilaganathan was seen helping parents Becky and Richard, who were told that their baby had no chance of surviving. At Becky’s nineteen week scan, baby Annie was showing signs of congenital heart failure due to pressures from a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung. In simpler terms, this meant that Annie had a tumour on her lung the size of a malteaser. Owing to developments in medicine, Professor Thilaganathan was able to complete a non-invasive operation immediately on Becky and Annie by placing a tube near the mass, and feeding a laser through it, to zap and kill a rogue blood vessel. Remarkably, despite the parents being told that Annie’s heart could stop at any time, the procedure was successful and Becky gave birth to Annie several months later, with no signs of the surgery she had undergone before she was born. This is, yet again, proof of what amazing talent and humanity we have here in Tooting. Several cases of the South African variant of Covid-19 has been found in Wandsworth, and the Council is encouraging everyone over the age of 11 who lives, works in, or travels through Wandsworth to book a PCR test – including those of us who have had the vaccine, even if you are not showing any symptoms.\nPCR testing sites have opened across Wandsworth, including one at Tooting Leisure Centre by appointment only. Tests can also be ordered online, or collected without an appointment at Wandsworth Town Hall. Tests are also available on a strictly appointment-only basis at many local pharmacies. It is necessary to book a PCR test because although the widely available rapid lateral flow test can determine positivity for Covid-19, only the PCR test is able to detect specific variants. It is important that we are all tested because one-in-three people who have Covid-19 are asymptomatic, and could be spreading the virus without knowing it. Let’s all do our part to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 variant. Click here to order a home testing kit, or to book an appointment at a testing centre or local pharmacy. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Indeed, back in 2019 I provided Wandsworth Council with a number of solutions to this issue, which were not acknowledged or enacted upon. I have recently been inundated with complaints from residents who have received Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs). As you may know, FPNs cannot be appealed, and I am concerned about the lack of oversight and accountability this procedure affords. It is clear from the litter on our streets that fining residents for putting out their household waste is not defeating the issue of fly-tipping. Fly-tipping fines need to be issued to the right people, for the right reasons – to deter genuine incidences of fly-tipping. Instead of being a deterrent, I am concerned that these fly-tipping fines are being misused as a Council cash-grab – making money from hardworking residents under the guise of keeping our streets clean. I have written to Paul Martin, Chief Executive at Wandsworth Council, and Paul Chadwick, Director of Environment and Community Services, to ask what action they will take to address these concerns. Keep an eye out for updates here. Local residents living or passing through Rackham Mews in Furzedown may have seen the large fly-tip that occurred earlier in the week. Understandably, this is very unpleasant for those who live near this area and I have therefore written to Paul Chadwick, Director of Environment and Community Services at Wandsworth Council, as well as notifying the local councillors of the issue in the hope that this can be rectified as soon as possible. Please be assured that I will keep local resident updated of the progress on this. Furzedown Police are currently appealing for witnesses, so if you have any information about this fly-tip, please do email [email protected] or message them via Twitter. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_situation-in-israel-and-gaza/content_203.html": "|\nThe Hamas attacks on Israel in recent days were horrific. The brutal murder of innocent civilians in their own homes, killing innocent festivalgoers, raping women and taking children hostage must be condemned in the strongest possible terms - nothing can justify it. Those who planned and carried out the attacks must face justice.\nWe have not been close to peace in the region, but there is no doubt that these attacks, and the response from Israel, will set us back many years. This will be devastating for the many innocent people in Israel and Palestine who just want peace. I fear it will be innocent men, women and children from Gaza who are going to pay the price for Hamas' attacks. I have been very critical of Netanyahu throughout the years, and I really do worry about what the next few days and weeks will bring. The cutting off of water, gas and electricity supplies breaches a whole host of internationally recognised laws. Refusing to allow aid in and stopping food supplies will hit the most vulnerable the hardest. Countless innocent lives will be lost and the international community must work on a resolution that de-escalates the conflict as soon as possible. The discourse I've seen on Twitter has appalled me in recent days, which is why I have decided to post this on my website, instead of there. I have worked as a humanitarian doctor in the region, spanning a period of over a decade. I've always sought the recognition of a sovereign Palestinian state, and my views have not changed, I believe it is the only way to achieve peace in the region. But I will also call out barbaric attacks when they occur. The rape and murder of innocent civilians should be called out and I'm sure the vast majority of people will share my disgust.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_brexit-might-be-done-but-the-fight-against-boris-johnsons-destruction-must-continue/content_516.html": "|\nBrexit Might Be Done But The Fight Against Boris Johnson's Destruction Must ContinueAlthough the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback.\nWhen the UK leaves the EU this Friday, 31 January 2020, after 47 years of membership, it will be a sombre day for many of us. For others, it will be a day of celebration. For most people, I suspect they will simply hope we can now move on from talking about Brexit at the expense of everything else. As someone who campaigned with all my heart to stay in the EU, and as the first person on Labour’s front bench to publicly call for a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal, I am desperately sad to see us leaving our friends and allies in Europe. But we are leaving. The disastrous result of the General Election has settled that. This is no longer an argument about Leave or Remain, it’s about what kind of future we want for our country and for our children. That’s where the new fight begins. Boris Johnson wants to pretend he’s now “Got Brexit Done”, and we no longer need to worry about the details. He wants us to simply trust him to sort it all out. Well, I don’t trust him. Neither should you. He talks about “Global Britain” whilst turning his back on vulnerable child refugees. He talks about “Taking Back Control” while reducing parliament’s ability to scrutinise his decisions. He talks about attracting “Global Talent” to the UK while creating huge distress and uncertainty for EU citizens, many of whom have been here for years and who have made their lives in this country. The fight for our internationalist values starts now. It will be long, and it will be difficult, because Boris Johnson has a large majority – but that’s why it’s so important. When it feels like hope is lost, that’s when those of us who believe in progressive values and internationalism need to stand up and fight. If we don’t, no-one else is going to do it for us. We need to stand up and fight for our hard-won workers’ rights. We need to stand up and fight for our environmental protections. Most importantly, we need to stand up and fight for the rights of EU citizens living in this country. They are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues, our family. I work side-by-side with many of them in the NHS, when I work shifts as a doctor in my local A&E department. Under the draconian new immigration laws being bandied around by this government, my own Polish mother might not have been able to move to this country and make a life for herself. Although the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback. That’s one of the main reasons I am running to become the next Deputy Leader. We have huge organisational strength through our membership, through our links with the trade unions and through our MPs and councillors embedded in their local communities. Now is the time to deploy those strengths to maximum effect, to hold the Government to account and ensure that we fight back against every attempt to undercut our rights and freedoms at work, every attempt to weaken our environmental safeguards, every attempt to inject privatisation into our National Health Service. The slogan “Get Brexit Done” might have helped win the election for Boris Johnson, but for those of us who stand against his destructive vision for the future of our country, this fight isn’t done. It’s just getting started. Comments are closed.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Our beloved Tooting Bec Athletics Track will be saved and get the investment it so desperately needs and deserves. To lose such a valuable asset in our community would be a devastating blow to so many of our young people. Having this track will be useful for encouraging young people to be physically active and lead a healthy lifestyle. Thank you to everyone who joined the efforts to save our track! Rites for Girls is a local group which aims aims to prepare girls for that all-important transition from primary to secondary school, focusing on their wellbeing and self-esteem. Girls in Year 6 and 7 are being offered the opportunity to participate in monthly sessions over the course of the year, in which they will be taught about puberty, and learn strategies to take charge of their emotional, social, and physical wellbeing. As we look to the end of Government lockdown measures, during which time many girls have reported feeling disconnected from family and friends, the support Rites for Girls offers girls is more important than ever. Sessions will be held at the Woodfield Pavilion, Tooting Bec Common. For more information see here, or to book a place for your daughter contact [email protected]. The ongoing pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we live our lives, and it is understandable that this will have an impact on our mental health.\nAs we enter a national lockdown, it is vital that we all take care of our mental health. There are many brilliant services available to offer advice and support, and there is never any shame in asking for help. If you are facing a mental health crisis, you can call the Samaritans on 116 123, any time, day or night. If you are not comfortable speaking over the phone, you can also text SHOUT to 85258. They also have an advice page offering tips on how to take care of your mental health during the pandemic. If you are aged between 13-25, you can call The Mix on 0808 808 4994, with any question. They will connect you with experts and peers who will give you the support and advice you need. You can also phone Childline on 0800 1111, or speak directly to a counsellor here. For the LGBT+ community, you can call Switchboard on 0300 330 0630 or email [email protected]. All phone operators identify as LGBT+. Stonewall are also available on 08000 50 2020 for advice on a range of issues. If you are facing domestic abuse, you can call Refuge on 0808 2000 247, or access their online chat feature here. Women’s Aid live chat feature is also open here. Both of these websites have an option to quickly exit their sites and wipe them from your browser history. I am aware that many local residents are concerned about the proposed Tooting Triangle development. Plans to upgrade the site’s facilities and amenities – replacing the artificial football pitch with a modern surface, and building new changing rooms, public toilets, a children’s play area, and a café – are welcome. However, the proposal to fund the improvements via a 25-year lease of the new facilities to TFL Leisure – a private company – is more controversial.\nThe fence set to be constructed around the new football pitch, and the lack of clarity as to whether the upgraded children’s Stay & Play facility will remain free to use, have prompted concerns that the development will put public land behind a literal paywall. I am sure you will agree that if the recent lockdowns have taught us anything, it is that there is a need for more publicly accessible green spaces – not less. As it stands, the proposed development would see a reduction in the area available to the Balham Boxing Club compared with their current provision. Issues have also been raised regarding the smaller size of the female changing rooms compared to the men's, and the impact floodlighting could have on the Triangle’s resident bat population, among other things. I understand that discussions on the proposed development are ongoing. Please be assured that I am keeping a close eye on this evolving situation - we all want what's best for our local community. The latest NHS data shows that from July to September this year the number of urgent referrals for children and young people suffering with eating disorders has almost doubled from the same period in 2019.\nOn 9 December, Alex Norris MP and I spoke with Dr Agnes Ayton, Chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists Eating Disorder Faculty, mental health campaigner Hope Virgo, the Centre for Mental Health, Beat and Young Minds UK to discuss eating disorders and explore ways to alleviate them. We urgently need a public mental health strategy which supports people with eating disorders. Christmas can be an especially difficult period, and it is vital that we remain sensitive to the fact that the focus on food and indulgence can cause individuals suffering with eating disorders real distress. Young people struggling with their mental health need urgent support. Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government for it. I look forward to the New Year, where I will be looking to engage further with the sector as well as individuals with lived experience of eating disorders. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

The policy is an inhumane, unworkable gimmick - now they have blocked plans to protect victims of human trafficking and individuals who have supported our armed forces.\nIt's all done to appease the right of the party.\nWe have heard lots about the Government's heartless Rwanda scheme. This circus is the latest saga in the Tory melodrama, but it is the most vulnerable people whose lives they're playing with. Britain is better than this cruel, cynical Tory Government. I have worked with refugees for more than a decade. I have heard their experiences of war, violence and terror. Nobody leaves their homes, communities and livelihoods unless they must. That is why I will always stand against the inhumane Rwanda Bill.\nOver recent weeks, I have been appalled at the Tory's unworkable, unethical plans to house asylum seekers on a barge in Dorset.\nThe Government failed to listen to well-founded concerns or even carry out basic checks of the water supply, which was contaminated with Legionella bacteria, putting both asylum-seekers and staff at-risk. The Tories have serious questions to answer about the safety of this project and should stop wasting taxpayer's money pursuing headlines and instead fix this broken asylum system.\nThe story of a Ukrainian family who wants to come to live in Furzedown recently made national news! Oksana and her young son Dmytro have a sponsor ready and willing to welcome them into their home in the local area, however Home Office delays have stopped them travelling to safety in the United Kingdom.\nIt is inspiring and heartwarming to see the generosity shown by the British public in welcoming Ukrainian refugees into their lives, however Oksana and Dmytro have been let down badly by the Home Office. They applied to come to the UK in September last year and, so far, the Home Office have refused to provide a timeframe for a decision to both myself and their sponsor's solicitors. This is simply not good enough and the Government must get a grip. Such an incredible honour to have volunteered with the Care4Calais team in Calais and Dunkirk. Their compassion and work ethic is second to none and they do so much to help and support those who have lost everything, in the most difficult of circumstances. Care4Calais is a refugee crisis charity that helps with delivering essential aid and support, such as food and medical supplies, to refugees living in the UK, France, and Belgium. So glad that I could be a part of this experience to help with the crisis in Calais. Our Tooting community always comes together in the face of adversity, and I know many local residents will want to help those impacted by the current situation in Afghanistan in any way they can. That is why I have compiled a list of organisations and charities currently working to support Afghan refugees:\nTo provide refugee accommodation: Refugees at Home: UK charity which connects those with a spare room with refugees and asylum seekers in need of somewhere to stay. Apply to be a host here. Room for Refugees: Community hosting network that offers safe, temporary homes and emotional support for insecurely-housed refugees, asylum seekers and vulnerable groups - families, the sick, the elderly and unaccompanied asylum seeking children with no recourse to public funds. Apply to offer accommodation here. Wandsworth Borough Council: Residents, businesses, or other landlords who could offer a property for new arrivals are being asked to register their details - they are particularly keen to hear from those with 3 to 4 bedroom properties available. To offer accommodation, contact Wandsworth Borough Council via email at [email protected]k or by phone on 020 8871 7333. Local Organisations: Care4Calais: Asking for volunteers, financial donations and donations clothes, shoes, phones or other essentials at drop off points:\nNational Organisations: Choose Love: Supporting projects providing vital aid and services to Afghan people who have fled the country: clothes, shelter, support for children and groups protecting women and children’s rights.\nBritish Red Cross: Calling for donations to help staff and volunteers provide emotional support and essential items, including warm clothes, blankets, soap, toothbrushes and nappies.\nSave the Children: Calling for donations to an emergency fund.\nAction Aid: Calling for emergency donations to help charity provide emergency humanitarian assistance including food, water, and essential items such as hygiene kits, cash, tarpaulins, tents, cooking utensils, clothing, and bedding.\nAfghanaid: Afghanaid is a British humanitarian and development organisation, currently asking for donations to assist response to the Afghan crisis\nUNICEF: Raising money to support children in Afghanistan\nUNHCR: Calling for donations to help the organisation in the distribution of family tents, hygiene kits, core relief items like blankets, sleeping mats and kitchen sets.\nThe Big Give: Delivering emergency support to families whose lives have been destroyed or uprooted by the conflict.\nMuslim Aid: Calling for donations to Afghanistan Emergency Appeal.\nIslamic Relief: Calling for donations to aid Afghan’s on the ground in Afghanistan, and when they come to the UK.\nDoctors Without Borders: The MSF teams are responding to the crisis in Afghanistan, providing medical aid, expertise and life-saving supplies during the escalating crisis. Donate here. Paiwand: Established an Afghan Resettlement Emergency Fund, supporting displaced Afghans in need of assistance.\nRefugee Council: Providing aid, including mental health support, for refugees arriving in the UK.\nThe situation which has unfolded in Afghanistan is shocking and terribly regrettable. It is simply not good enough for world leaders to say the speed of the Taliban advance took them by surprise, when many have been warning of this for months. There has either been a monumental failing of our intelligence services or an unacceptable lack of transparency. Either way the Government has reacted too late. In 2010, I worked (pictured) as a Humanitarian Aid Doctor in the North West Frontier Province, on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan, following the flood crisis. I met many people who had suffered unimaginable pain at the hands of the Taliban. I am continuing to receive a high volume of emails from local residents concerned about loved ones in Afghanistan. Myself and my team are working to respond as quickly as possible. If you are worried about someone, please do not hesitate to get in touch by emailing their details to [email protected]. Please include the following information so I can take action quickly:\nWe must not allow history to repeat itself. Careless leadership from the Prime Minister enabled this tragedy to happen on his watch, while he had taken his eye off the ball. The world must not turn its back on the Afghan people. Following the recall of Parliament on Wednesday, I remain in close contact with my colleagues in the Shadow Foreign Team and will continue to be on hand to support local residents through this. Today, I voted against the Nationality and Borders Bill, a piece of legislation that risks breaking international law and turns our backs on unaccompanied children fleeing war and persecution. The Conservatives just voted to make it harder to give a safe haven to children fleeing violence and war. They should be ashamed. The cruel irony of this Government’s approach is that it’s weak on taking action against criminal gangs and brutal when it comes to orphaned children from war zones. As someone who has held the hands of frightened children and terrified parents working as a doctor in war torn areas such as the Rohingya and Palestine, I am appalled at the Government’s approach to protecting those in need of safety. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

The only concerns I have received from local residents (which authorities were copied into) were about social distancing, for which an operation of this size seems excessive. However, the police say it was 'a road safety policing operation'. The Home Office say it was in relation to 'suspected immigration offences'. This looks like racial profiling - and under the Equalities Act 2010, this may amount to indirect discrimination due to its disproportionate impact on ethnic minority groups. If it's not unlawful, then it's definitely immoral and I cannot defend it. Our community here in Tooting is inclusive, diverse and welcoming. The celebratory nature of the police’s response to any arrests is not in line with our local values. I have met with the police since and encouraged them to focus their time on fighting crime – not targeting people at work. This May marks Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) Month. BPD, also known as Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD), is a serious and complicated mental illness that around 1 in 100 people live with. A type of ‘personality disorder’, BPD affects how individuals cope with life, manage relationships, and feel emotions. Those with BPD can experience deep distress, which is often caused by previous trauma. If you would like to find out more information on BPD, Mind and Rethink - two leading mental health charities - have dedicated pages on their websites. Mind’s can be viewed here and Rethink’s here. If you are experiencing BPD, BPD World also provides information and support to those affected by personality disorders. To find out more about the support they offer, see here. It is vital that we raise awareness of BPD to ensure that people receive the support they need and deserve without feeling stigmatised. I would like to congratulate Sadiq Khan on his return to City Hall, where he will be serving as Mayor of London for a second term. As a fellow Tooting-ite, having grown up on the Henry Prince Estate, I know our community has a sense of collective pride seeing Sadiq returned as Mayor of our incredible city. I would also like to congratulate Leonie Cooper on her re-election as Assembly Member for Merton and Wandsworth. Thank you to every single person in Tooting and across London who put their trust in the Labour Party, and thank you to all of the volunteers who hit the ground running, knocking on doors, delivering leaflets, and making phone calls. We will leave no stone unturned to get our city back on its feet. A brighter future is possible, and we’ll deliver it together. Rites for Girls is a local group which aims aims to prepare girls for that all-important transition from primary to secondary school, focusing on their wellbeing and self-esteem. Girls in Year 6 and 7 are being offered the opportunity to participate in monthly sessions over the course of the year, in which they will be taught about puberty, and learn strategies to take charge of their emotional, social, and physical wellbeing. As we look to the end of Government lockdown measures, during which time many girls have reported feeling disconnected from family and friends, the support Rites for Girls offers girls is more important than ever. Sessions will be held at the Woodfield Pavilion, Tooting Bec Common. For more information see here, or to book a place for your daughter contact [email protected]. As a new mum, it can be vital to talk and share your experiences with those in the same situation as you. No new mother should have to suffer in silence if they are struggling with their mental health. To mark Maternal Mental Health Week, I would like to share some brilliant charities and support services available for women and birthing people: Family Action offers specialist support services for parents with mental health difficulties. This includes services during pregnancy and after birth. Further information on Perinatal Support Services Family Lives can be found here. The Association for Postnatal Illness offers information and support for those experiencing postnatal depression. The APNI are available between 10am and 2pm, Monday to Friday on 0207 386 0868. Alternatively, an online chat box on the bottom left of their website can be found here. Family Lives offers confidential support, information and advice for parents. Support is available via email [email protected] or via there helpline on 0808 800 2222. PaNDAS - Postnatal Awareness and Support is a community organisation offering peer-to-peer support. PaNDAS has a free helpline, open 7 days a week, 11am to 10pm on 0808 1961 776. Alternatively, they can be contacted via email on [email protected] and a trained volunteer will aim to get back to you within 72 hours. If you are at crisis point, the Samaritans can be contacted 24/7 on 116 123. As the backdrop for the BAFTA winning series 24 Hours in A&E, St Georges is now opening their doors to the Fetal Medicine Unit in Channel 4’s new series ‘Baby Surgeons: Delivering Miracles’. The documentary follows obstetrician Professor Basky Thilaganathan and his team as they work to save the lives of unborn babies with complex medical conditions. In one moving episode, Professor Thilaganathan was seen helping parents Becky and Richard, who were told that their baby had no chance of surviving. At Becky’s nineteen week scan, baby Annie was showing signs of congenital heart failure due to pressures from a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung. In simpler terms, this meant that Annie had a tumour on her lung the size of a malteaser. Owing to developments in medicine, Professor Thilaganathan was able to complete a non-invasive operation immediately on Becky and Annie by placing a tube near the mass, and feeding a laser through it, to zap and kill a rogue blood vessel. Remarkably, despite the parents being told that Annie’s heart could stop at any time, the procedure was successful and Becky gave birth to Annie several months later, with no signs of the surgery she had undergone before she was born. This is, yet again, proof of what amazing talent and humanity we have here in Tooting. It was a pleasure to get out on the doorstep with our Greater London Authority candidate for South London, Candice Atterton, today! Alongside Candice and Ruth Cadbury MP for Brentford and Isleworth, it was a privilege to visit Hounslow Youth Counselling Service. The post-pandemic recovery must have young people at its heart, so it was fantastic to spend the morning hearing about the great work taking place in Hounslow to support and champion young people’s mental health. With her background in youth work and youth justice, Candice is determined to focus on support and opportunities for young people. I have no doubt that she will be a great addition to Mayor Sadiq Khan’s Labour Team in City Hall! The Bike Project - a wonderful local charity which supplies refugees with old, unloved, and abandoned bicycles – is looking for someone to provide a new Tooting drop-off point. A drop-off point is a place where local residents can leave their unwanted bikes to be collected by the charity, who repairs them before they are donated to refugees and asylum seekers. With just £37.75 a week to live on, these bikes can make an enormous difference to the lives of refugees. If you are able to volunteer a space to act as a new drop-off point in our area, or to arrange a time to donate a bike, email Julia from The Bike Project at [email protected]. We have been blessed with wonderful sunshine throughout this week, which has undoubtedly brought out the best of our surroundings here in Tooting. Working in St George’s Hospital, I know what a real difference the green spaces in the grounds make to patients, visitors and staff alike. I would therefore like to express my sincere thanks to the hospital gardening team, in particular their Head of Gardening, John Greco, who have put their all into this wonderful display of spring blooms for us all to enjoy. The bright array of tulips and blossom trees will no doubt be a great comfort to what is an often anxious time for patients and visitors to the hospital. Thank you team! Several cases of the South African variant of Covid-19 has been found in Wandsworth, and the Council is encouraging everyone over the age of 11 who lives, works in, or travels through Wandsworth to book a PCR test – including those of us who have had the vaccine, even if you are not showing any symptoms.\nPCR testing sites have opened across Wandsworth, including one at Tooting Leisure Centre by appointment only. Tests can also be ordered online, or collected without an appointment at Wandsworth Town Hall. Tests are also available on a strictly appointment-only basis at many local pharmacies. It is necessary to book a PCR test because although the widely available rapid lateral flow test can determine positivity for Covid-19, only the PCR test is able to detect specific variants. It is important that we are all tested because one-in-three people who have Covid-19 are asymptomatic, and could be spreading the virus without knowing it. Let’s all do our part to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 variant. Click here to order a home testing kit, or to book an appointment at a testing centre or local pharmacy. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_local_17/content_708.html": "Wandsworth Council is currently consulting local residents on its ‘Local Plan’ document on developments for the borough across the next 15 years. This plan identifies Tooting as a potential area for regeneration, where proposals include new sustainable transport, improvements to public realm, and contributions to the health and wellbeing of residents.\n3. 56 Tooting High Street on the west corner of the Garratt Lane and Tooting High Street junction: The Council are considering using this site for a development of sustainable architecture and urban design, as well as considering the planting of street trees on Garratt Lane.\nFurther information on these proposals can be found here. Whilst I hold no authority over Wandsworth Council, it is important to me that residents, businesses and organisations have their say on these proposals. If you would like to submit comments on the ‘Pre-Publication’ Draft Local Plan, you must do so before 11.59pm on Monday 1 March 2021 using the following link: https://www.wandsworth.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy/local-plan/draft-local-plan-pre-publication/\nA number of local residents have raised their concerns about people rough sleeping during this exceptionally cold spell, and of course amidst the pandemic.\nLike many, I believe the Government’s delay in housing rough sleepers during this third lockdown was completely irresponsible and lacked basic human compassion. In London alone, the Office for National Statistics estimates that 1 in 30 people have coronavirus, and we know that sleeping rough - without adequate shelter or access to basic hygiene facilities - leaves people more exposed to the virus. Today, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick MP announced that councils will collectively receive an additional £10 million in funding to house those currently sleeping rough, as well as an extension to the ban on bailiff evictions. Whilst I welcome this much-needed funding, this money will not help get everyone off the streets, and the ban on bailiffs fails to sufficiently protect renters. Many residents have contacted me with concerns for those who are sleeping rough outside Tooting Broadway tube station, Buzz Bingo and Sainsbury's. I want to reassure residents that I have recently written to the Head of Wandsworth Neighbourhood Policing Team to ensure these people are supported in the best way possible. Beyond the coronavirus emergency, there can be no return to business as usual. It is paramount that Ministers end rough sleeping for good. In a country as well-off as ours, we need to ensure that everyone has the right to a safe place to live. Throughout the ongoing pandemic I have been inundated with emails from parents, school staff, students, and residents alike who have taken the time to outline their views on school closures. Some are concerned about safety, with many teachers and students facing the very real and grave possibility of bringing the virus home to vulnerable family members. Some are concerned about the impact a further lockdown could have on children's wellbeing and their education. And some are concerned about the challenges school closures will cause for working families.\nAs I am sure you will agree, the current situation is incredibly serious. This virus is spreading exponentially across the country, many people are in hospital, and too many people are tragically losing their loved ones. We know how difficult another lockdown will be, but I believe that national measures are necessary. As the Shadow Minister for Mental Health and a working mother, it is safe to say the impact of extended school closures on children’s well-being and working families cannot be overstated. This is why Labour called on Government to do everything possible to avoid it. Boris Johnson must immediately set out clear plans for every child to return safely to school as soon as possible - and be honest with parents about the timetable for this. It is also critical that young people’s education is safeguarded throughout this period of remote learning, and every student must have access to the devices they need to learn. Schools and families can request free mobile data increases for students without broadband or who cannot afford extra data for devices. More information on this scheme can be found here: get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/about-increasing-mobile-data. It is vital the Government prevent disadvantaged families being priced out of education. As many families will agree, working parents face huge challenges in balancing work, childcare, and supporting their child’s education. They must have the support they need to do this. Nobody should have to choose between their job and supporting their children, so the Government - and employers - must clearly promote the use of the job retention scheme for those unable to work due to family commitments. Please rest assured that myself and Labour Party colleagues will continue to hold the Government to account on these issues as we all navigate the ongoing pandemic. Stay safe, Rosena. With the Officer for National Statistics estimating that 1 in 30 Londoners now have coronavirus, and the Mayor of London declaring a major incident across all London hospitals, the ongoing situation could not be more serious. NHS services in the capital are at risk of becoming overwhelmed in just a matter of days.\nWorking as a doctor in St George’s A&E department, I understand how emotionally drained healthcare workers are feeling. Indeed, ‘overwhelmed’ was the word used by nurses, consultants and registrars at our local hospital in Tooting when they were interviewed for a special report by the BBC, with one senior staff nurse saying she has “never felt so demoralised in her life.” The report conducted by BBC London's Political Correspondent, Karl Mercer, showed the heartbreaking situation in high dependency units at St George’s. The hospital has now had to increase intensive care capacity from 60 to 120, the vast majority of which are for coronavirus patients. Wandsworth alone recorded a further 2394 cases this week – the 13th highest in London. Whilst better times are on the horizon with the recent announcement of the approved Moderna vaccine, I can only implore residents to continue to follow latest public health advice on the virus to ensure we can protect as many lives as possible. On behalf of all my colleagues working on the frontline, please stay at home. The ongoing pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we live our lives, and it is understandable that this will have an impact on our mental health.\nAs we enter a national lockdown, it is vital that we all take care of our mental health. There are many brilliant services available to offer advice and support, and there is never any shame in asking for help. If you are facing a mental health crisis, you can call the Samaritans on 116 123, any time, day or night. If you are not comfortable speaking over the phone, you can also text SHOUT to 85258. They also have an advice page offering tips on how to take care of your mental health during the pandemic. If you are aged between 13-25, you can call The Mix on 0808 808 4994, with any question. They will connect you with experts and peers who will give you the support and advice you need. You can also phone Childline on 0800 1111, or speak directly to a counsellor here. For the LGBT+ community, you can call Switchboard on 0300 330 0630 or email [email protected]. All phone operators identify as LGBT+. Stonewall are also available on 08000 50 2020 for advice on a range of issues. If you are facing domestic abuse, you can call Refuge on 0808 2000 247, or access their online chat feature here. Women’s Aid live chat feature is also open here. Both of these websites have an option to quickly exit their sites and wipe them from your browser history. I am aware that many local residents are concerned about the proposed Tooting Triangle development. Plans to upgrade the site’s facilities and amenities – replacing the artificial football pitch with a modern surface, and building new changing rooms, public toilets, a children’s play area, and a café – are welcome. However, the proposal to fund the improvements via a 25-year lease of the new facilities to TFL Leisure – a private company – is more controversial.\nThe fence set to be constructed around the new football pitch, and the lack of clarity as to whether the upgraded children’s Stay & Play facility will remain free to use, have prompted concerns that the development will put public land behind a literal paywall. I am sure you will agree that if the recent lockdowns have taught us anything, it is that there is a need for more publicly accessible green spaces – not less. As it stands, the proposed development would see a reduction in the area available to the Balham Boxing Club compared with their current provision. Issues have also been raised regarding the smaller size of the female changing rooms compared to the men's, and the impact floodlighting could have on the Triangle’s resident bat population, among other things. I understand that discussions on the proposed development are ongoing. Please be assured that I am keeping a close eye on this evolving situation - we all want what's best for our local community. I have written to the Housing Secretary to outline residents concerns about EWS1 forms and cladding.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

This simply can’t go on - the Govt must get a grip on the crisis in our prisons. When I look at myself in the mirror, I want to be proud of the person looking back. We have a moral responsibility to stop more innocent people being killed. That is why I am voting for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. See my speech in full here: Every year in Westminster, there is a debate on Children's Mental Health Awareness Week. Every year, politicians agree the children's mental health crisis must end. But nothing changes and children continue to be let down by inaction. Today, I led calls in Parliament for this to change. It was great to speak at the King's Fund Circles Series focusing on women in leadership, where I shared my experience as a women working in healthcare and politics.\nIt's vital that we get more women in leadership roles across society. It's important that we meet our net zero obligations - it'll save lives here and around the world. With 65 million people living on vulnerable, low-lying island nations, susceptible to flooding and extreme weather, we need climate action now.\nChildren eating weeds, 1000 children already losing their legs and enduring amputations without anaesthesia. This is the daily living hell for the children of Gaza.\nToday in Prime Minister Questions, I implored the Prime Minister to act to end this bloodshed.\nToday, I asked Dr Ghada Al Jabda, Chief of Health in Gaza for UNRWA about the dire situation facing hospitals in Gaza.\nAccording to the latest reports, 64% of hospitals in Gaza are non-operational and many are struggling to provide effective care.\nIn Parliament, I renewed my calls to the Foreign Secretary for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nPalestinian parents in Gaza love their children as much as we love ours, but theirs are buried under rubble. Millions are facing starvation. How many more need to die before the Government call for a ceasefire?\nWe have heard lots about the Government's heartless Rwanda scheme. This circus is the latest saga in the Tory melodrama, but it is the most vulnerable people whose lives they're playing with. Britain is better than this cruel, cynical Tory Government. I have worked with refugees for more than a decade. I have heard their experiences of war, violence and terror. Nobody leaves their homes, communities and livelihoods unless they must. That is why I will always stand against the inhumane Rwanda Bill. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

This great new initiative allows commuters to significantly reduce their exposure to air pollution while also enjoying the beauty of our local green spaces. Working with St. George’s hospital, the Cross River Partnership (CRP) has developed a route from Tooting Broadway Station to St George's which will offer a cleaner alternative for staff, patients, and visitors alike. For more information about this clean air routes, as well as others across London, see here. I recognise that having a vaccine might be unfamiliar for some people and that many have questions about what it's like. Working as an A&E doctor at St George’s Hospital throughout the pandemic, I was lucky enough to receive the first dose of the vaccine in January. Receiving my second dose this week, I want to show you exactly what happens when you go for your vaccine. The sooner the vaccine is rolled out, the sooner we can begin to rebuild - together. While we cannot celebrate in person this year, this International Women's Day I'm celebrating the women who make Tooting such an incredible place to live. I am beyond proud to represent an area with an array of admirable, determined and strong women from so many different backgrounds. Please join me in thanking those mentioned below, and all the women who play an important role in your life. In 1912, Tooting dressmaker and suffragette Lillian Ball was arrested and sentenced for two months hard labour for her involvement in a window-smashing campaign in March 1912, with around 150 other women in London’s west-end. Being a working-class mother of three, it is said that Lillian received a harsher sentence than other suffragettes from wealthier backgrounds. During her time in prison completing the hard labour sentence, she recounted that she was blackmailed and coerced by senior police officers to give evidence against some of the key leaders of the suffragette movement. To think of everything Lillian sacrificed for women like myself to put a cross in the ballot box, makes me exceptionally proud to think of all we have achieved in Wandsworth since then. All MPs in Wandsworth are women and we have 10 female councillors in Tooting alone. I am also exceptionally proud to work for our NHS, where 77% of the workforce is made up of women. It was only in 1892 that The British Medical Association formally accepted female doctors into their register, and in 1948, under Attlee’s NHS reforms, it was required by law that a ‘reasonable proportion’ of medical students were women. My colleagues in St George’s, and beyond, are a true testament to what our health service embodies. And within our local community, I am proud of the women who have gone above and beyond to aid those in need. In 2016, the first Little Village baby bank was founded in Balham to provide families in need with baby clothes and equipment, such as cots, bottles and sterilisers. In 2020, they helped an estimated 6590 children and have now set up banks across Wandsworth, Camden and Southwark. Founder Sophia is a busy mum-of-three herself and has inspired many across the country, including royalty! Since 2020, the Duchess of Cambridge has supported the aims of Little Village and recently spoke to service users at the fifth anniversary of the organisation. I am also proud of the efforts of Tooting Community Kitchen to support those in need of a hot meal or drink. Sahar Beg founded the Tooting Community Kitchen in 2018, inspired by her mum’s love for cooking, and has been providing hot food and drink to those in need ever since. The community owes a great deal to Sahar’s commitment to helping others and I for one am proud to know her and support her efforts. Finally, I would like to pay tribute to two amazing young women in the constituency, whose campaigns have helped many others. Hope Virgo is the founder of the #DumpTheScales campaign, which calls on the Government to review eating disorder guidance delivered by clinicians. She is open about her journey with anorexia and now supports young people, parents and educational staff understand eating disorders in more detail. Tooting’s own Kate Isaacs founded the ‘Not Your Porn’ campaign after her friend was a victim of revenge porn, and has been fighting against companies profiteering from revenge porn since. For those who do not know what revenge porn is, it is the sharing of private sexual materials with intent to cause distress, typically without consent. Indeed, in 2020, the UK’s specialist revenge porn helpline recorded its busiest ever year with 2700 calls. Last of all, I would like to send a message to all the women in Tooting. No matter what your background, race, gender or identity, you have the power to be a force for change. Look up to the outstanding role models we have in Tooting and most importantly, be proud of who you are.\nFor months, Labour have been calling on the Government to make the £20 uplift to Universal Credit permanent This increase has been a lifeline for many at a time where families across the country are struggling to make ends meet.

I am aware of residents’ concerns regarding the planning application at 56 Glenburnie Road, which on granting would see the existing house demolished to make way for nine flats. Whilst not a conservation area, I know many are worried about the occupancy increase and a potential increase in traffic congestion, as well as the removal of the existing family home. So far, 51 residents have objected to these applications, which were approved by Wandsworth Council on December 4th 2020 with conditions. On behalf of those Glenburnie Road residents who have expressed their concerns with these proposals, I have written to the Planning Technical Support Team at Wandsworth Council to make clear the strength of feeling on this issue locally. It is important to me that concerns are properly recognised at this time. Please be assured that I remain in close communication with the local Councillor Annamarie Critchard and will continue to monitor developments on this closely. Beyond all doubt, the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated existing issues within the private renting sector. I know that many have fallen behind on household bills and rent due to financial pressures caused by many factors such as unemployment and furlough. Studies show one in four private renters have seen their earnings fall since the start of the pandemic and half a million private tenants are in rent arrears and at risk of eviction. I want to say that my thoughts are with those experiencing uncertainty. I strongly believe it is important that Ministers drop their proposals to cut UC, end the five-week wait for housing benefit, and suspend the benefit cap.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_costofliving-crisis/content_28.html": "|\nIt is incredible to see the work being done in Wandsworth Town Hall by the new Labour council. Recently, it was announced that free school meals would be available during school holidays for eligible children, while parents of pupils on free school meals will also have access to uniform vouchers to help cover this expense. With the Tory cost-of-living crisis, this is a hugely beneficial scheme for hard-working families across the borough.\nThis is the difference that Labour makes in power and I look forward to continued close cooperation with the new council administration in order to make our communities even better places to live. For further details, see here. Today, Justin Madders MP and I met with the Retail trade union Usdaw and a group of retail workers in Westminster to talk about how the cost-of-living crisis, rising violence and abuse in stores, and the impact of Christmas holiday trade is affecting the mental health of customers and colleagues.\nFar too many people are facing this Christmas period worried about how to provide for their families. With so many Usdaw members having their mental health impacted as a result of the cost-of-living crisis and increased levels of abuse in the workplace, it is deeply important that we, as politicians, take the time to listen. Recently, I visited the fantastic team at Love Triangle, a brilliant pizza restaurant situated between Balham and Tooting Bec.\nThey’ve been selling pizza to the community for two and a half years now, but things are getting increasingly difficult. The cost-of-living crisis is hitting small businesses hard, with customers having less money to spend to things such as meals out, and the cost of energy and supplies rising astronomically. Will, who owns Love Triangle, told me that despite trying many different creative ways to stay afloat, things are only getting more difficult. Love Triangle have tried different opening times, and an array of different promotions and deals to help combat the challenges, but it is still far from easy, just to keep their head above water. The rising cost of food and energy, coupled with the reduction in disposable income for many is proving a difficult picture to navigate. Speaking to Will, and other business owners in our community, one message stands out. It is crucial to support local businesses where you can, or we risk losing more of our fantastic local businesses from Tooting, and across the country. Watch my visit to Love Triangle here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1599084624847642624?s=20&t=xq-atIy2mtAe0cDqI51dLw It was great to bring together local charities, faith leaders, and leader of Wandsworth Council, Simon Hogg who are all working tirelessly to support local families through the cost-of-living crisis.\nI have already been contacted by countless Tooting residents who are concerned about how they are going to pay their bills and put food on the table this winter, and I fear this will only get worse as we move further into the winter months. With so many households already feeling the squeeze, it’s crucial that we work together to tackle poverty. Representatives from Earlsfield and Wandsworth foodbanks as well as Dons Local Action Group and Little Village Tooting told me that they are seeing unprecedented demand at present, as more and more of those who were just-about-managing become unable to afford the basics. All the organisations represented spoke of the added difficulties the rise in energy prices have brought. The hike in energy prices has meant that even the local charities who are there to address the crisis are struggling to pay their bills, and this means they are less able to help those in need. This comes at the worst possible time, when demand is at it’s highest level for decades. Everyone at the event had numerous stories of people facing hardship, people in overcrowded accommodation, people not being able to put food on the table or buy school uniforms for their children. Many people are also concerned about how they will meet the additional cost of christmas. Despite heartbreaking stories, it was uplifting to see so many people who donate their time, energy and money into making things better for people in our community. I am always amazed by the generosity of people in Tooting. However, in Britain in 2022 these organisations and charitable schemes shouldn’t have to exist. It is imperative that the Government take action immediately to support people through the months ahead. The Prime Minister has been forced to abandon her unfunded tax cut for the 1% of highest earners.\nThis Government U-turn is too late for the families who will pay higher mortgages for years to come. It will also do nothing to help or to reassure the people in Tooting and beyond. The Tories have destroyed their economic credibility and damaged trust in the British economy. Twelve years of Tory government have left the economy in chaos, and the new Prime Minister continues to make it up as she goes along. Today’s U-turn does not mark a move away from disastrous Tory economics, it’s just some districation. The Government needs to reverse their trickle down strategy. It just doesn’t work. Instead, they need to offer a programme of measures that will offer real support to those struggling with rises in food and energy bills, and increases in rent and mortgage payments. Too many people will struggle to pay their bills and put food on the table this winter, and the Government must step in now. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

It is a stain on our society. It must be combatted and those who perpetrate it must face the full force of the law.\nMany people in Gaza were already living in appalling conditions before this latest conflict. If the Israeli bombardment continues and aid doesn't get through, I really fear for the consequences. Today, I appeared on Peston to reiterate calls for an immediate ceasefire in Israel and Gaza.

See my question here:\nTonight, I held a peace vigil at Tooting Broadway station to bring our community together to remember all those who have died in Israel and Gaza recently. I want to pay a huge thanks to the representatives from our local religious groups who said a prayer for peace.\nDuring some of our darkest hours, Tooting reminds us that there is always hope.\nToday, I was on BBC Politics Live ahead of Prime Minister Questions, to discuss the conflict in Israel and Gaza, free speech and the drinking culture in Westminster.\nPalestinians must not pay the collective price for the acts of terror carried out by Hamas. World leaders have a duty to ensure Israel doesn’t deliberately indiscriminately target civilians.\nIn Parliament today, I sought assurances from the Prime Minister regarding Gaza: - Incendiary weapons won't be used in civilian areas. - Hospitals/medics won't be targeted. - Food, water and electricity immediately restored. - No occupation of Gaza.\nThe Hamas attacks on Israel in recent days were horrific. The brutal murder of innocent civilians in their own homes, killing innocent festivalgoers, raping women and taking children hostage must be condemned in the strongest possible terms - nothing can justify it. Those who planned and carried out the attacks must face justice.\nWe have not been close to peace in the region, but there is no doubt that these attacks, and the response from Israel, will set us back many years. This will be devastating for the many innocent people in Israel and Palestine who just want peace. I fear it will be innocent men, women and children from Gaza who are going to pay the price for Hamas' attacks. I have been very critical of Netanyahu throughout the years, and I really do worry about what the next few days and weeks will bring. The cutting off of water, gas and electricity supplies breaches a whole host of internationally recognised laws. Refusing to allow aid in and stopping food supplies will hit the most vulnerable the hardest. Countless innocent lives will be lost and the international community must work on a resolution that de-escalates the conflict as soon as possible. The discourse I've seen on Twitter has appalled me in recent days, which is why I have decided to post this on my website, instead of there. I have worked as a humanitarian doctor in the region, spanning a period of over a decade. I've always sought the recognition of a sovereign Palestinian state, and my views have not changed, I believe it is the only way to achieve peace in the region. But I will also call out barbaric attacks when they occur. The rape and murder of innocent civilians should be called out and I'm sure the vast majority of people will share my disgust. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_nhs_4/content_622.html": "|\nIt was a pleasure to join Basildon Councillor Gavin Callaghan as well as local Basildon organisations to talk about mental health this week. Coronavirus has had a profound impact on our mental health support services and it is always great to see a local authority listen to and work with local organisations on the front line providing help where it is most needed. We need to take inspiration from Basildon Council and create an environment at a national level where community organisations and peer support groups work in tandem with local authorities and local health services. A huge thank you to Kim Bailey of Purple Genie Life Coaching, Karen Pullen of Craig Tyler Trust, Jonathan Barrow of Sociability, and Alison Cunningham of The Listening Post, for taking part. Even before the pandemic hit, the case for investing in this kind of support was clear. Coronavirus has exacerbated the existing crisis in mental health. Many NHS and social care staff have been scared of going to work, and they have lost patients and colleagues. It has been heartbreaking to witness the toll this virus has taken on staff mental health. Current support is not good enough, and without a tailored, fast-tracked service for staff who have faced death and despair every day for over three months, our frontline heroes will continue to be failed. We need to care for our carers. It is time for the Government to give back to those who have sacrificed so much to keep our loved ones safe. Unless our staff are protected, they cannot continue their vital work of keeping us all safe. The consequences of not having adequate personal protective equipment for NHS staff are devastatingBarely a day goes by without pictures online of frontline staff fashioning protection out of clinical waste bags. We need to ensure NHS staff are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients.\nThe challenge that coronavirus poses to our society is unprecedented. It is a scary and worrying time, especially for our NHS. Having worked as a frontline A&E doctor this weekend, in my local hospital, I am increasingly concerned that our health service may buckle under the increased strain that Covid-19 has brought. Our only priority must be to protect lives. Every possible resource we have should be dedicated to that single objective. Crucially, our NHS and healthcare workers on the frontlines must be given whatever resources they need to tackle this and to save lives. It’s disheartening then, that basic resources are in short supply. Full personal protective equipment (PPE) is vital to not only protect frontline staff, but also to limit the spread of infection to our loved ones and to our patients. The Government have known this crisis was coming for weeks, and yet they still have not been fully prepared for it. A country like the UK should not be having to ask manufacturing companies to switch production to provide emergency ventilators, or for NHS workers to have to go without PPE. The first part of my shift this weekend was spent looking for the correct masks and aprons - this is happening to frontline workers ahead of every shift, across the country. While we would all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. The consequences of this for NHS staff are devastating. There’s a feeling amongst many frontline staff that protective equipment is already being rationed. A few weeks ago, the guidance for healthcare staff treating people with confirmed cases of Covid-19 was to wear a full FFP3 mask as well as gloves and a full apron - now, that guidance has changed and we are told to only wear gloves and a basic surgical mask. Barely a day goes by without pictures online of frontline staff fashioning protection out of clinical waste bags. We need full transparency on decisions and changes to guidance, otherwise concerns will only grow. As this virus spreads, and as more and more people are forced into hospital, NHS workers are going to have to start making very difficult choices because of the limited resources they have available. They are going to have to start deciding who can access the most urgent care, including who is given priority for the last available ventilator - they’ll be making impossible choices about whose lives can be saved. We have already seen this happening in Italy, and it is an unimaginable tragedy for medics who are dedicated to saving lives above all else. The best way to help frontline staff who go to work to save lives, is for everyone else to stay home. We will get through this, together. The Government must take responsibility for providing all the resources and equipment the NHS needs, including vital PPE, for communicating the message on social distancing clearly to the public, and for enforcing it robustly. I welcome the new, more stringent measures announced yesterday – however, as Mike Ashley has shown, there’s still room for people to exploit it. As a country, we must do what will save the most lives. That’s true of the Government, people across the country, and medics on the frontline. The faster we get on top of this disease, the faster our society will be able to tackle this virus, and fewer lives will be lost. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can and we will save lives. Sports Direct has shown exactly what not to do during this pandemic. If we’re to beat coronavirus, we have to be selflessThere seems to be a view amongst some under-70s, that coronavirus doesn’t really affect them and they don’t need to worry too much about it. I’ve listened to 69-year-olds tell me that because they themselves are fit and healthy, that it couldn’t possibly happen to them. Having just done a shift as a doctor in A&E over the weekend, I want to take this opportunity to warn people that this virus does not discriminate by age.\nIt was deeply, deeply eye-opening. Previously healthy people in their thirties and forties were seriously ill, some of them on ventilators. Being young does not grant you immunity to this disease. The symptoms of Covid-19 at its worst, are horrific. There can be no room for complacency. Our health service is facing an unprecedented crisis. There is a limited amount of vital equipment, including personal protective equipment for healthcare workers and precious ventilators. Every extra person in hospital requiring treatment means there are fewer resources available for others. London Covid-19 doctor says soon staff will be forced to choose whose life to saveRosena Allin-Khan, a Labour MP and A&E doctor, reveals ‘heart-wrenching’ decisions facing hospital workers\nRosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting and an A&E doctor, is still working regular shifts. On Sunday she worked at St George’s hospital in her south London constituency. She explains how the coronavirus pandemic has affected staff: I’ve been an A&E doctor for 15 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this before. The departments are quieter because people are staying away from hospital, but the patients are sicker. We’re seeing a distinct rise in the numbers coming in with respiratory symptoms, who are testing Covid-19 positive. On Sunday, very early in the morning, the entire resuscitation department, where the absolute sickest patients go, was full to capacity with patients with breathing difficulties. We had to move other very ill patients to the paediatric resuscitation area to keep them safe. This is only set to get worse. We’re seeing patients now who would have only contracted the virus two weeks ago. In the coming 10 days we expect the entire A&E department will be taken up with suspected Covid-19 patients. Doctors and nurses are brave, and the A&E department is known for being on the frontline and high risk, but there’s a palpable fear among staff for three reasons. Firstly, they’re frightened for their own health and those of the people they love. When I finished my shift yesterday, which was Mother’s Day, I came back to the house and I couldn’t touch or hug my two little girls until I put all my clothes in the wash and had a shower. The second reason is that staff expect, very soon, potentially to have to make heart-wrenching choices about whose life can be saved if we don’t have enough ventilators. That goes counter to everything you’ve ever learned as a doctor or nurse – to make life-and-death decisions, where we could possibly have saved every one of those people, is unimaginable. This is what our colleagues in Italy are living through now. Third, the patterns described thus far for symptoms of coronavirus are not what we’re now seeing in the emergency department. We’re seeing young, previously very healthy people, who are ill in hospital. Some are in their 30s, and they need ventilators to stay alive. Some patients are presenting with abdominal pain, which we hadn’t heard of before. A person can come in and say they have a stomach pain, and they’re put in the “green” area of the department – but then they mention they also have a cough. Everybody should be assumed to be Covid-positive until proven otherwise at this point. There’s also a real concern among staff around the country about personal protective equipment. They either don’t have any, or if they do many feel it’s being rationed. It’s very hard to listen to some colleagues say that as a result of there not being enough equipment to go round, they’re resigned to catching the virus – it’s just a matter of when. On social distancing, the messaging from the government hasn’t been clear enough. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has banned public gatherings of more than two people. It’s clear and easy to understand. There has to be no ambiguity in the language because people’s lives depend on it. Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives. The MP for Tooting has been working in her local hospital where doctors and nurses are already dealing with cases of covid-19. She warns that many of those being treated are in their 30s and 40s.\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan is the MP for Tooting but she is also a practising doctor in A&E. She regularly goes in to do shifts in her local hospital St George's and has been in contact with her colleagues. This Sunday she took a record down for Mirror readers about the situation faced by nurses, doctors and others on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus. She said her latest shift had been a \"deeply, deeply eye-opening\" experience with previously fit and healthy people in their 30s and 40s \"attached to machines, fighting for their lives\". And she has been deeply critical of the approach taken by the government in tackling the spread of the deadly virus. \"The Prime Minister has been blase about this from the start, waiting for others to make decisions so he doesn't have to. It is costing lives,\" she said. Mirror Diary - Sunday 22 March6.30am – Leaving the HouseOn the way to work in A&E, to help out the real heroes of the frontline – the NHS staff who work day-in, day-out to keep us all safe. I am a bit apprehensive after seeing the stories that are being reported about Covid-19 and having spoken to colleagues across the country, but we need to come together at times like these for our communities. 7am – Reporting for DutyJust finished handover, which is when the day shift gets given notes on the patients who have come in overnight. There’s a very real sense that the number of cases are growing extremely quickly, something that will present a real challenge in the coming days and weeks. Some of the sickest patients that have been admitted have been young – they’re in their 30s and 40s, previously fit and well, but now fighting for their lives in Intensive Care (ICU). There was a lot of talk in January that this was a virus just like the flu that only affects older people – that simply isn’t the case. There’s a real sense of apprehension ahead of the shift – we’re all expecting a rocky road ahead in the coming days. 8am- Protective EquipmentThe first part of the shift was spent looking for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – these are masks and aprons that keep those working on the frontlines safe. While we’d all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. Frontline staff across the country are scared. We’re scared that we’re going to lose patients – we have spent years training to save every life that we can. We are scared of passing this deadly virus onto our loved ones because we don’t always have the PPE that we so desperately need. We’re scared that that if we aren’t properly protected, that we run the risk of spreading the virus between patients. It’s vital that people practice social distancing measures properly – crowded areas will only add to the number of cases, and the number of people being admitted into hospitals across the country. In the coming days and weeks, difficult decisions will be made by my colleagues in ICU about who gets a ventilator – it’s that serious. Midday – Resus overwhelmedThe whole of resus is full of patients with respiratory problems – this is the part of A&E where the sickest patients go. Patients are arriving breathless, with crackles so fine in their lungs, you can hardly hear them. Their X-rays show white lungs where normally, they would look clear and black, full of air. Major trauma, such as heart attacks and victims of car crashes, are now being moved into paediatric A&E. The situation around Covid-19 is clearly getting worse by the day. The talk amongst the team is that we feel that we will be overwhelmed in the coming days. I’m going for a refresher course on ventilators for staff – they’re also training new staff on how to use ventilators. The talk is, of course, feeling quite bleak as the day goes on – but this is what we’ve all been trained for. 4pm – Leaving A&EJust leaving A&E now – it’s been a difficult shift and a difficult Mother’s Day. At times like these, we must think about our loved ones - if we want to protect those dearest to us, we must stay indoors. I’ve just called my husband and asked him to let our daughters know that they won’t be able to cuddle me and give me their handmade presents when I get home. Instead, I’ll be getting straight in the shower and throwing my clothes in the washing machine – it is our duty to protect the ones we love. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can, and we will, save lives. NHS workers battling coronavirus are facing a “national shortage” of protective clothing, HuffPost UK has been told.Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan, a working doctor who still works shifts in A&E, said scientists had told her that there were not enough body suits in the right sizes, while some doctors were only now starting to receive protective clothing.\nIt came amid new official estimates suggesting 5,000 to 10,000 people in the UK have coronavirus, leaving many doctors, nurses and other health workers at risk of infection. Last month, the World Health Organisation also warned that there was a global shortage of protective masks and body suits. One NHS source who worked at a hospital where coronavirus patients were being treated told HuffPost UK: “There were staff forced to wear oversized suits because that’s all they had. “All we have left is XL. “There is a national shortage of suits but this was raised with the government at least three weeks ago so something should have been done.” Appearing on HuffPost UK’s Commons People podcast, Allin-Khan repeated the concerns. “I held a meeting today with some people from the scientific community and they said their concern was though they had been testing out various modes of protective clothing, it turns out that there is a lack of the clothing they need available, the sizes aren’t available,” she said. “Just yesterday - because people still contact me because I’m a doctor still, to let me know what’s going on - someone said they were a GP and had only started receiving the necessary protective clothing yesterday and this has been going on for a month now. The Labour deputy leadership candidate criticised the government for moving too slowly to tackle from coronavirus. In a departure from Labour’s broad support for the government, Allin-Khan called for tougher measures to tackle the outbreak, including testing those with symptoms for the virus as a matter of course. Allin-Khan said the government’s testing programme could be “more robust”, reporting that “friends in the NHS” said people were being given “really unclear messaging”. She gave an example of two people who returned from northern Italy who phoned NHS 111 and were told to wait for a call back which did not come for five days, during which time they self isolated. When they eventually spoke again to NHS staff, they had to give their details again and had to self-isolate for eight days before finally being tested for coronavirus. Test results are also taking three to five days to materialise. Allin-Khan said: “We need to be moving quicker, people need to have a better idea of how to access testing, what it means for their daily lives. “The messaging needs to be clearer and the testing needs to be more robust.” She added: “We should have moved into the delay phase sooner than now and I don’t think we should measure our performance compared to what other countries are doing. “I think we should be looking at what’s best for us and when you look at the fact that China had the same number of cases that we already have surpassed before implementing measures we do need to be listening to what the other scientific community, for example some eminent epidemiologists, listen to what they’re saying. “Because ultimately we can’t leave the scientific community to be scapegoated for the government making bad decisions if they are proven to be wrong.” Allin-Khan meanwhile sidestepped questions on whether she wants to be shadow health secretary under the next Labour leader. “I like to focus on one thing at a time, genuinely, and I don’t think you should ever have a plan B because that’s implying you’ve accepted that your plan A won’t work out,” she said. “So I am genuinely, steely focused on winning this deputy leadership bid.” Put to her that she would be a good fit for the job, she replied: “Well I am a practising NHS doctor and I have got a master’s degree in public health and I care about our party so that’s honestly for whoever is the leader to decide.” Front-line workers in the NHS have felt ignored by the Government - and now the Tories look set to give up the NHS for profit.\nThis Christmas I’ve been proud to support my hard-working colleagues on the front line by doing shifts in my local A&E. We’re all touched by the NHS at some point in our lives. For over 70 years it has been our lifeline, the glue holding our society together, often forgotten about, but there in our times of greatest need. The NHS is there to bring life, to offer care and dignity when we leave the world, and to support our loved ones when tragedy hits. But front-line workers in the NHS have felt ignored and that the Government does not recognise the day-to-day pressures they face. It didn’t start with claims on the side of a bus during the European referendum campaign in 2016 but, since then, using the NHS for political gain certainly picked up pace. Throughout the election, Boris Johnson repeatedly denied that the NHS would be up for sale. Just two weeks after the election, it was revealed that NHS cancer care and children’s treatments are up for grabs in a stealth Tory sell-off. Cardiology, gynaecology, paediatrics and oncology are among the services being offered to companies. As an A&E doctor, when someone is rushed into A&E having a heart attack, we work to patch someone up before sending them off to heart specialists. How will it feel knowing that those services are now being provided by a private company? Where is the trust? Allowing hospital trusts to outsource treatment to private companies could lead to a postcode lottery of health care, further widening the health divide. We need to be bringing the UK together, not tearing it apart, turning communities against each other. On top of this, discussions are taking place with tech giants on how to make money from patient data. While we must do everything possible to look for cures and ensure a better patient journey, we need to know how our own data is being used. The last decade has shown us that we must exercise caution with tech giants. The Government does not have the money or expertise needed to create an anonymised patient database, which is exactly why Amazon and Microsoft have been approached. Trust in our NHS cannot be destroyed because without trust, everything else could be up for grabs. I was stunned and heartbroken after the election result and bereft at what it would mean for our NHS. Our hospitals, treatments and dedicated staff cannot simply be sold off to the highest bidder. These aren’t the principles our NHS was founded and built on and I will continue fighting, standing side by side with our hospital workers, to protect our NHS from those who wish to destroy it. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_as-labours-deputy-leader-i-would-rebuild-trust-with-the-nation/content_302.html": "|\nMany former Labour voters feel unrepresented. That has to change\nThe Labour party has shaped who I am today. It has helped provide me with the opportunity to train as a doctor and has given me and my family life chances we otherwise would not have had. I want everyone to experience these opportunities. It deeply saddens me to see a lost generation for whom the door closed on their dreams and ambitions on 12 December. Growing up poor and cold while my single mum worked three jobs to support me and my brother taught me the reality of day-to-day life for many people in the UK. My mother always told me, even through our darkest moments, that there were people worse off than us – and I have never forgotten that. The Labour party changed my life. Despite failing my A-levels due to difficult circumstances at home, I was finally able to go to Cambridge University at the age of 24 to study medicine because of reforms the Labour party made in government. People did not know what we stood for – the Tories had three simple words Working on the A&E frontline has shown me the best and worst of society. A&E is a microcosm of real life. I hold parents as they say goodbye to their children who have died through senseless violence. I talk to nurses who tell me they can’t afford to feed their children and are having to use foodbanks. I treat older people who just want the dignity of accessing social care in their homes. But I also see hope. The UK is full of people pushing through barriers to serve their communities. Our NHS provided me with the skills to give back to society – it spurred me on to work as a humanitarian aid doctor in disaster zones across the world, something that I have been proud to continue during my time as an MP. I am proud of the internationalist views of the Labour party – we must never turn our backs on the world’s most vulnerable. On the border of Myanmar, it was shocking to listen to the stories of Rohingya refugees speaking of having to make the impossible decision of whether to save their child who was thrown alive on to a burning fire, or escape with their surviving child. We must not turn our backs on those who are living through the absolute worst of human atrocities. In Palestine, I was heartbroken to meet children who were undergoing cancer treatment utterly alone because their parents were unable to obtain permits to accompany them. Humanity should have no borders. Only with a Labour government can the UK have a truly outward, internationalist approach, ensuring that we are there for people in their times of greatest need. In order to be in government, we must get our house in order, and as deputy leader this would be my priority. We cannot look to champion equality abroad, while turning a blind eye to racism in our party. This needs to end. As deputy leader, my first major meeting would be with the Jewish Labour Movement – they are our official Jewish affiliate; we must listen. I want JLM to be at the forefront of this fight against antisemitism, especially when it comes to education at the grassroots level. I will separate the complaints process from HQ, making it independent and asking the new team to immediately review all cases, acting swiftly and expelling antisemites. There must also be a strict time limit by which cases need to be resolved. I commit to adopt every recommendation proposed by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, without hesitation. Enough is enough. Only then will we be able to start rebuilding trust. Communities across the country have turned away from Labour, thinking that we do not represent them. We must listen with humility to people across our country and across our movement to assess why we’ve lost the last four elections, and how we can win people back. From speaking to people in seats that we lost in December, I have been told that trust in us has gone. People did not know what we stood for – there appeared to be new policies announced every day and voters did not trust that we had a plan for how to deliver them. The Tories had three simple words. To win, we need to be able to communicate our messages, not just internally, but with the public. I will focus on grassroots campaigners being armed with the information and messaging that they need to talk to voters on the doorstep. I will equip candidates and their local Labour parties with the resources that they so desperately need. I will introduce reduced membership rates to our emergency service workers so they can have a say within Labour on the NHS at this vital time. We need to build our movement into one people can vote for. A party people can trust. Under this government, which has chosen to block child refugees from reunification with their families, I worry for the future of our children. I worry for the future of tolerance. I worry for the future of compassion. We have a wonderful society, which has welcomed so many people from across the world, but the hostile environment this government is imposing on our country is restricting the ability to hope. Hope for a brighter future. Hope for a tolerant society. The door may have closed on 12 December for a generation’s hopes and ambitions, but with the right leadership team in place in the Labour party, it will not be closed for good. We need to win the next general election, and we must start rebuilding trust ahead of local elections in May. As deputy leader, it will be my responsibility to rebuild trust, not just with the grassroots of our party, but with voters. Together, we can take Labour forward.

I have long believed the UK should lead the world with high animal welfare standards. I was pleased to see the Labour Party pledge to ban exports of foie gras early on in the election campaign.\nI know that many people are concerned specifically about cruelty to our greatest companions; cats, dogs and other pets. Rest assured, I will always stand against cruelty. At this election, I am standing on a manifesto to improve animal welfare. Labour has pledged to ban trail hunting and the import of hunting trophies. We will end the scourge of puppy smuggling and farming, along with the use of snare traps. Most of all, we will partner with scientists, industry, and civil society as we work towards the phasing out of animal testing. Many people have got in touch with me recently about the Government’s proposed ban on electric shock collars for dogs. As an animal lover myself, it is my firm belief that the UK should lead the world in animal welfare standards which would mean no animal would be made to endure unnecessary suffering.\nAll pets deserve the utmost protection, and I’m pleased that the legislation introduced has been approved by the House of Lords. However, I’m also pleased that there will be an exemption for those with protected characteristics who have a legitimate need to use collars that produce sounds, vibrations, and other non-shock signals.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_balham-station-update/content_595.html": "|\nI was deeply concerned - as I know many local residents were - to hear of plans to close Balham station to outward passengers from next Monday until December 2021. While I recognise the scheduled repairs to the escalator are essential works, it is important to me that residents are not inconvenienced by the planned updates. Indeed, I also appreciate that it was alarming for many to learn that the closure was to begin in less than a week, lasting for such an extended period of time. It is my understanding that the decision to close Balham station to outward travelling passengers was taken after a trial closure of the downward escalator indicated that use of the staircase at peak travel times was resulting in over-crowding and therefore social distancing was difficult. I called a meeting with Transport for London to outline my concerns and discuss alternatives, such as more staff at the station to support social distancing at peak travel times. I am pleased to announce that as a result of this meeting, TfL have agreed to undertake a week-long trial at Balham Station, which will see the staircase open for use throughout the day and outward travel therefore possible from the station. The trial will commence on Monday 28th June and last 3-4 days. Following the trial, TfL will assess whether outward travel from Balham during the planned escalator repairs is viable. During this time - and beyond should the trial prove successful - I would recommend additional time is allowed for travel through Balham Station. By doing so, we increase the likelihood of a successful trial. More importantly, we can all play our part to ensure all residents can travel safely. Please check back for further updates on this situation. Comments are closed.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_previous_2/content_30.html": "|\nEvery year, over 12 million passengers travel to and from Tooting Broadway, yet if you have difficulties getting around, have a buggy or are carrying lots of luggage, it remains inaccessible to many.\nTfL is currently looking at making Tooting Broadway step-free. Support my campaign to make this a reality and sign the petition below: The Government are right that expanding Heathrow will boost growth. However, the damaging impact that expansion will have on noise and air quality of people living under the flightpath cannot be ignored.\nMy position has always been the same and I remain opposed to the expansion of Heathrow airport. While I do not support a third runway at Heathrow, I do agree with the expansion of Gatwick. It can expand faster and with a less negative impact on people living under the flightpaths. Today, on Holocaust Memorial Day, I am at Auschwitz commemorating 80 years since its liberation.\nThis day serves as a stark reminder of the sheer evil that led to the murder of 6 million Jews. We remember them and promise to never forget the horrors they faced. It's finally Friday and what better way to prepare for the weekend than by reading my latest column in the South London Press.\nRead my article on the steps Labour are taking, both nationally and locally, to tackle the housing crisis here. Since the beginning of this terrible violence in October 2023, I have been unrelenting and unequivocal in my calls for an immediate, unconditional ceasefire in Gaza. I have equally been clear that the October 7 attacks by Hamas were completely abhorrent, and hostages must be released.\nTens of thousands of innocent lives have been lost, with each story as heartwrenching and tragic as the last. There are no words for the pain, suffering and anguish that millions have experienced as a result of this awful war. This ceasefire deal, therefore, is a welcome and significant step towards peace. We must remain cautiously optimistic that this fragile peace will hold. Ahead of the ceasefire taking effect on Sunday 19 January, we have seen the escalation of strikes on Gaza by the Israeli Defense Forces and the international community must do everything to ensure that the terms of the ceasefire are met in full and on schedule. Only by ending the violence and bloodshed, as well as releasing the hostages, can reconstruction of the devastated Gaza Strip begin. The influx and distribution of urgent humanitarian aid must be a priority, as hundreds of thousands of Gazan civilians are starving and on the brink of famine. Over 2 million people on both sides of the border have been displaced from their homes, with many of them now having nothing to which they can return. Regardless of the events of the next few weeks and months, I will continue to be a vocal proponent of peace, reconciliation and a sustainable two-state solution. As 2024 draws to a close, I wanted to take this opportunity to look back on the events of the past year. It has been a year of change and renewal - full of ups and downs - but as I enter into my ninth year as your Member of Parliament for Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting, it remains the greatest honour of my life to represent the community in which I was born and raised. Entering the new year, I would like to pay tribute to the incredible frontline workers working around the clock to keep the country going through the festive period. From our NHS services to local hospitality staff to food bank volunteers - you all have my heartfelt gratitude for your tireless work this Christmas and throughout the year. A year for democracyWhat a year it has been for elections, both locally and across the country. We began the year with a fantastic win in the Tooting Broadway by-election, increasing the Labour vote share by nearly 7% to a whopping 58% majority. Then came the Mayoral elections in May, when we kept London red by electing my Tooting predecessor Sadiq Khan to a historic third term as Mayor of London. Finally - and most importantly - we finally elected a new Labour Government after 14 long years, with areas up and down the country voting Labour for the very first time. It was humbling to receive the most votes of any Labour MP and thanks must go to everyone who voted for me - your support means the world. £100m to fix Wandsworth PrisonAfter years of campaigning - and countless stories of mismanagement and scandal - the Ministry of Justice announced a £100 million funding package for HMP Wandsworth. This will go a long way to reduce the impact of overcrowding, repair crumbling cell blocks and facilities, and ensure that prison guards can work in a safe environment. Delivering for everyone in TootingThousands of local people have contacted me this year regarding a variety of issues, I have dealt with 15,000 cases. I reclaimed tens of thousands in unpaid pensions or benefits for local people, got decisions on hundreds of delayed passport or visa applications, and helped countless local residents get repairs to their homes. My door is always open and please get in touch if there is anything I can help with. On the NHS frontline\nSpeaking up for Gaza It has now been over a year since the horrific 7th October attacks and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza. The humanitarian disaster we have seen unfold there in the time since, has been truly heartwrenching. This year, I've raised the issue numerous times in Parliament, visited the region in the spring, and held evidence sessions with humanitarian experts. Revitalising Tooting town centre\nThis Morning and Loose Women Using my background as an NHS doctor, I have enjoyed trying my hand at being a TV medic this year! The lovely people at This Morning and Loose Women have had me on many times to talk about a range of topics from mental health to medical emergencies and even gave me space to open up about my own childhood challenges with speech, in a bid to end stigma and help others. Work in Parliament\nKeeping our streets safe in 2024, I successfully campaigned for a tripling of the Tooting neighbourhood policing team, putting more bobbies on our streets. In the summer, Operation Kenny run by the Metropolitan Police resulted in a 70% reduction in crime in Tooting town centre. This work will continue with the new Government's plans to recruit 13,000 new officers and return policing to communities. Cleaning up the local area I have never stopped campaigning for cleaner streets. This year saw a 15% reduction in fly-tipping in Wandsworth, with thousands of fines issued to people dumping their bulky rubbish on our streets. Meanwhile, Wandsworth Labour introduced food recycling for the first time ever in the borough. Free School Meals roll-out\nMental health reform Mental health is incredibly important to me and, for far too long, much-needed reforms were swept under the rug by a Conservative Government that simply wasn't interested. After much hard work, it was fantastic to see reform of the Mental Health Act announced in the King's Speech in July - this was long overdue.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

If you are able to donate, please do visit the Medical Aid for Palestinians website here.\nMany people in Gaza were already living in appalling conditions before this latest conflict. If the Israeli bombardment continues and aid doesn't get through, I really fear for the consequences. Today, I appeared on Peston to reiterate calls for an immediate ceasefire in Israel and Gaza. Every effort needs to be made to work towards a peaceful solution. See my clip here:\nI arrived back home safely from Ukraine yesterday. I went on a humanitarian mission with MedGlobalOrg, who are helping support hospitals to prepare for the darkest days of this conflict. We worked with the most amazing people and met patients with the most heart-breaking stories. I was honoured to be able to help Ukrainian victims in the midst of the heart breaking turmoil they are experiencing. Let’s do all that we can to help support Ukraine. Such an incredible honour to have volunteered with the Care4Calais team in Calais and Dunkirk. Their compassion and work ethic is second to none and they do so much to help and support those who have lost everything, in the most difficult of circumstances. Care4Calais is a refugee crisis charity that helps with delivering essential aid and support, such as food and medical supplies, to refugees living in the UK, France, and Belgium. So glad that I could be a part of this experience to help with the crisis in Calais. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_labour-party/content_430.html": "|\nEight years ago today, I was selected as the Tooting Labour candidate for the by-election caused by Sadiq becoming a candidate for Mayor of London.\nIt has been a huge honour and privilege to serve as the representative for the community in which I was born and raised. My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has supported me on this incredible journey. History was made last Thursday as my friend and predecessor as MP for Tooting, Sadiq Khan, was re-elected for an unprecedented third term as Mayor of London.\nAfter weeks of hard graft, the result was a decisive victory for Sadiq and Labour with our wonderful capital rejecting the divisive, toxic politics of the Tory candidate. I look forward to continuing to work with Sadiq to make Tooting and our wider city a greener, cleaner, safer and more prosperous place to live. Wandsworth Labour are freezing council tax for another year to help families through the cost-of-living crisis.\nAt the same time, we're improving services and building a better Wandsworth. Lovely to spend a sunny Sunday afternoon with local Labour members playing rounders and enjoying a picnic.\nOn polling day, I joined Labour Party candidates standing for council seats in Dover, Medway and Gravesham. Across the country, Labour won more than 600 local council seats in Stoke-on-Trent, Plymouth, Dover, Medway, and many other areas that we will need to win, if we are to form a Labour majority at the next General Election.\nTalking to voters in these seats, it's clear that people right across the country have turned their back on the Conservatives, looking to Labour to deal with the cost-of-living crisis, tackle NHS waiting lists, and improving safety in our communities. The road to Labour in Government runs through our local councils, and I am hopeful this local victory will be the springboard to Labour’s general election victory. Labour will revolutionise mental health treatment – putting prevention front and centre.\nIf ever there was an argument that prevention is better than cure, it is with mental health. We know that the longer mental illnesses are left untreated, the harder and more costly they are to treat. This mental health crisis is wrecking the British economy. Last year, 18 million work days were lost to mental illness - more than industrial disputes, more than injuries. It costs the UK economy at least £117 billion a year. And who does the cost-of-living crisis hit the hardest? Those already living with mental illnesses. The next Labour Government will guarantee treatment within a month, recruit 8,500 new staff, put a specialist in every school and a hub in every community. Labour will transform our mental health services: New staff. New services. Faster treatment. Prevention as our watchword. Better mental health for all. Watch my full speech here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1575177559943581696?s=20&t=wn3hxvRyskYM3JmyFl3dlg It is an honour to have been unanimously re-selected by all the local party branches and affiliated organisations to stand as Labour’s candidate for Tooting in the next general election.\nI want to say a huge thank you to all the members and affiliates who took part, and who continue to put their trust in me to represent our community. Serving as the Member of Parliament for the community I grew up in is an honour. From helping local residents with casework, playing a part in winning the council, defending our NHS and serving as the shadow Minister to Mental Health - I have the best job in the world. My job is made even greater by the fantastic support local members show me all year round, so I want to take this opportunity to say a big thank you to them all! The next election is make-or-break for our party, we simply must win. I’m looking forward to working hard to make this happen. The NHS is being dismantled, I see it every time I work a shift. More people than ever are relying on foodbanks, and the cost-of-living crisis is having a devastating impact on people locally and across the country. I will be absolutely committed to doing everything I can to put Labour into Government and make the changes this country so desperately needs. Thank you again to everyone who voted. Fresh off the back of our trip to South Wales yesterday, Luke Pollard MP and I continued to take the fight to the Tories today, this time in Reading.\nWe kicked off the day with a doorknocking session in Reading West, another Tory-held marginal seat where it is essential Labour wins at the next general election. We were delighted to be joined by my colleague, Matt Rodda, MP for Reading East, who took us to a community-run cafe to show the empowering work that local people are doing on a daily basis. Reading is a great example of what Labour can do in power - the town's carbon emissions have been reduced by 70% in the last 12 years and the Council is currently investing £88 million in over 300 new social housing homes across Reading. Today, my friend Luke Pollard MP and I visited the lush landscape of South Wales in order to continue our fight to put Keir Starmer in 10 Downing Street.\nWe visited Barry Island (cue many Gavin and Stacey references!) in the Vale of Glamorgan seat and Chepstow in Monmouth - two vitally important areas that Labour needs to win to form a government. Labour took control of both Vale of Glamorgan & Monmouthshire Councils after the May elections and I greatly enjoyed campaigning with local members, building on that momentum in order to elect two new Labour MPs at the next election. Of course, a trip to Barry Island would not be complete without a wander down the beautiful seafront, complete with ice cream. Lloniannau!\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

There’s one latrine for every 500 people and only 4 trucks of aid per day.\nAt the International Development Select Committee, we heard evidence about the appalling humanitarian situation from experts working on the ground. The Committee published our report on the ongoing crisis. You can read more about it here\nIt's important that we meet our net zero obligations - it'll save lives here and around the world. With 65 million people living on vulnerable, low-lying island nations, susceptible to flooding and extreme weather, we need climate action now.\nToday, I asked Dr Ghada Al Jabda, Chief of Health in Gaza for UNRWA about the dire situation facing hospitals in Gaza.\nAccording to the latest reports, 64% of hospitals in Gaza are non-operational and many are struggling to provide effective care.\nRosena Allin-Khan kicks off Labour deputy leader campaign in Putney with ‘fire in her belly’\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan launched her deputy Labour leadership campaign in Putney last night. The campaign, held in the ballroom of the Star & Garter pub, brought together an eclectic crowd, including some young first-time voters. Tooting MP Dr Allin-Khan, who is running with the slogan ‘Taking Labour Forward’, is a qualified A&E front-line doctor and has provided humanitarian aid to refugees in Syria. Describing her determination to be the next deputy leader, she said: “Expertise in building trust in communities and shared life experience has put fire in my belly to achieve for others.” She set out her ‘internationalist’ vision of Britain’s future after Brexit and brought attention to the importance of social care reform, the significance of a grassroots revival and updating technology within the Labour Party. Labour’s Putney MP Fleur Anderson said that Dr Allin-Khan would be a ‘campaigner-in-chief’ and not a ‘leader-in-waiting’ if elected as deputy leader in a PoliticsHome article last week. The Musician’s Union has given their endorsement to Dr Allin-Khan and to Sir Keir Starmer for leader. Voting takes place from February 24 to April 2 and results will be announced on the April 4. Labour Campaign for International Development endorses Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan for Deputy Leader30/1/2020\nI am hugely proud and honoured to be nominated for Deputy Leader by the Labour Campaign for International Development.\nAs someone who has worked as an humanitarian doctor in conflict zones across the world, their progressive approach to international development and promotion of global justice is an inspiration. My priority will always be to put human rights and international solidarity at the core of everything I do. Human life should have equal value, no matter where someone comes from. These principles shouldn't just apply to our international development policies, they should be applied to everything we do as the Labour Party. I want to thank the Labour Campaign for International Development for their support and their endorsement. Let's take Labour forward, together. Thank you Doctor Rosena |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_previous_32/content_727.html": "|\nLast week the Balham and Tooting Community Association (BATCA) celebrated its 15th anniversary.\nBATCA is a network of diverse individuals and organisations committed to creating a cohesive, thriving community in Balham and Tooting. Their annual events – the Fun Day on Broadwater Road, the Tooting Broadway Peace Ceremony, and the Community Heroes Awards – are local institutions. BATCA have continued their good works throughout the pandemic, moving events online and acting as a platform for groups to share news and information. BATCA are always looking to welcome new members to help them further the organisation’s aims. Click here to find out more, and to join this wonderful collective. It was a pleasure to join Basildon Councillor Gavin Callaghan as well as local Basildon organisations to talk about mental health this week. Coronavirus has had a profound impact on our mental health support services and it is always great to see a local authority listen to and work with local organisations on the front line providing help where it is most needed. We need to take inspiration from Basildon Council and create an environment at a national level where community organisations and peer support groups work in tandem with local authorities and local health services. A huge thank you to Kim Bailey of Purple Genie Life Coaching, Karen Pullen of Craig Tyler Trust, Jonathan Barrow of Sociability, and Alison Cunningham of The Listening Post, for taking part. The recent vigil on Clapham Common was our chance to come together and grieve the loss of Sarah Everard's life. Our chance to mourn the lives of the women lost to violence. And it was a chance to mourn our own lived experiences. I share the frustrations and disappointment felt over police action taken that day. In light of events at Clapham Common, I know many are concerned about the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, and what this divisive law would mean for the right to protest. I want to be clear: Tonight, I will be voting against this Bill. I believe that the Government has undermined this Bill through draconian measures that impose disproportionate controls on free expression and the right to protest. I believe these measures will have an unfair impact on Black, Asian, and ethnic minority people. I also believe 10 year sentences for crimes against statues – significantly longer than the sentences for crimes which disproportionately impact women – is a worrying priority. Under this Government, rape convictions have fallen to an all-time low, delays in the Crown Courts are at an all-time high, and justice is not being served for thousands of women and girls. This is now the time for the Government to correct their woeful record and commit to putting in place long overdue protections for women. In light of the recent tragic events, many residents have been in touch to share their concerns about the lighting in Tooting and Wandsworth Commons. Indeed, many women feel unable to use the Commons in the evening due to the poor lighting, whereby many of the paths are unlit. All our local residents, including women, should feel safe to access these vital green spaces, which is why I have written to Paul Chadwick, Director Environment and Community Services at Wandsworth Council, and Neil Blackley, Head of Parks at Enable, who manage Wandsworth’s green spaces on the Council’s behalf, calling for action to improve the lighting across both sites as quickly as possible. Please check back here for updates on the Council’s response. Our hearts go out to Sarah Everard's friends and family at this unspeakably difficult time. My statement on this and the #ReclaimTheseStreets vigil here: As we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel, many of our Tooting community are looking forward to spending time with our loved ones once again. However – for a variety of reasons – not all of us have this opportunity.\nOnly one in five children spend time with their grandparents, whilst half a million people aged 65+ go at least five days without seeing or speaking to anyone, this is a fantastic organisation. The Wiser Collective – a local intergenerational community initiative that connects older people with younger families who can benefit from their skills and experience – was formed in 2018. Before the pandemic, The Wiser Collective hosted a variety of local events to combat loneliness across the generations, including the monthly ‘Skill Share Saturdays’, where neighbours of different generations meet to make new local friends, share talents, hobbies, passions, and chat over tea and cake. During the lockdown, the group helped the elderly with shopping deliveries, the collection of prescriptions, and stopped by for doorstep chats. To find out more and get involved with this wonderful organisation, visit their website: thewisercollective.com/ Many residents are concerned about air quality, both locally and nationwide, so I know it will likely be of interest to know that clean air routes are coming to Tooting.\nClean air routes provide an alternative to the busier, more polluted commuter routes for those travelling by foot or by bike. This great new initiative allows commuters to significantly reduce their exposure to air pollution while also enjoying the beauty of our local green spaces. Working with St. George’s hospital, the Cross River Partnership (CRP) has developed a route from Tooting Broadway Station to St George's which will offer a cleaner alternative for staff, patients, and visitors alike. For more information about this clean air routes, as well as others across London, see here. I recognise that having a vaccine might be unfamiliar for some people and that many have questions about what it's like. Working as an A&E doctor at St George’s Hospital throughout the pandemic, I was lucky enough to receive the first dose of the vaccine in January. Receiving my second dose this week, I want to show you exactly what happens when you go for your vaccine. The sooner the vaccine is rolled out, the sooner we can begin to rebuild - together. While we cannot celebrate in person this year, this International Women's Day I'm celebrating the women who make Tooting such an incredible place to live. I am beyond proud to represent an area with an array of admirable, determined and strong women from so many different backgrounds. Please join me in thanking those mentioned below, and all the women who play an important role in your life. In 1912, Tooting dressmaker and suffragette Lillian Ball was arrested and sentenced for two months hard labour for her involvement in a window-smashing campaign in March 1912, with around 150 other women in London’s west-end. Being a working-class mother of three, it is said that Lillian received a harsher sentence than other suffragettes from wealthier backgrounds. During her time in prison completing the hard labour sentence, she recounted that she was blackmailed and coerced by senior police officers to give evidence against some of the key leaders of the suffragette movement. To think of everything Lillian sacrificed for women like myself to put a cross in the ballot box, makes me exceptionally proud to think of all we have achieved in Wandsworth since then. All MPs in Wandsworth are women and we have 10 female councillors in Tooting alone. I am also exceptionally proud to work for our NHS, where 77% of the workforce is made up of women. It was only in 1892 that The British Medical Association formally accepted female doctors into their register, and in 1948, under Attlee’s NHS reforms, it was required by law that a ‘reasonable proportion’ of medical students were women. My colleagues in St George’s, and beyond, are a true testament to what our health service embodies. And within our local community, I am proud of the women who have gone above and beyond to aid those in need. In 2016, the first Little Village baby bank was founded in Balham to provide families in need with baby clothes and equipment, such as cots, bottles and sterilisers. In 2020, they helped an estimated 6590 children and have now set up banks across Wandsworth, Camden and Southwark. Founder Sophia is a busy mum-of-three herself and has inspired many across the country, including royalty! Since 2020, the Duchess of Cambridge has supported the aims of Little Village and recently spoke to service users at the fifth anniversary of the organisation. I am also proud of the efforts of Tooting Community Kitchen to support those in need of a hot meal or drink. Sahar Beg founded the Tooting Community Kitchen in 2018, inspired by her mum’s love for cooking, and has been providing hot food and drink to those in need ever since. The community owes a great deal to Sahar’s commitment to helping others and I for one am proud to know her and support her efforts. Finally, I would like to pay tribute to two amazing young women in the constituency, whose campaigns have helped many others. Hope Virgo is the founder of the #DumpTheScales campaign, which calls on the Government to review eating disorder guidance delivered by clinicians. She is open about her journey with anorexia and now supports young people, parents and educational staff understand eating disorders in more detail. Tooting’s own Kate Isaacs founded the ‘Not Your Porn’ campaign after her friend was a victim of revenge porn, and has been fighting against companies profiteering from revenge porn since. For those who do not know what revenge porn is, it is the sharing of private sexual materials with intent to cause distress, typically without consent. Indeed, in 2020, the UK’s specialist revenge porn helpline recorded its busiest ever year with 2700 calls. Last of all, I would like to send a message to all the women in Tooting. No matter what your background, race, gender or identity, you have the power to be a force for change. Look up to the outstanding role models we have in Tooting and most importantly, be proud of who you are.\nFor months, Labour have been calling on the Government to make the £20 uplift to Universal Credit permanent This increase has been a lifeline for many at a time where families across the country are struggling to make ends meet. In many cases, this extra money is the difference between being able to pay for the gas, electricity, or internet bill. Indeed, a report by the Resolution Foundation think-tank has warned that any cut would see a further 1.2 million people, including 400,000 children, fall into relative poverty.\nWhile the Government never turned up to vote on Labour’s motion at the February Opposition Day debate, it is generally convention that the Government implements successful opposition day votes. We are therefore pleased that the Chancellor decided to extend the £20 uplift for another six months. While disappointing that this is not a permanent measure, I know this will bring much needed reassurance to many. Given the number of families I know are struggling at the moment, I have included some links below which I hope will be of use:\nFor mental health issues and support, you can always phone Samaritans on 116 123 or email [email protected] I hope this information is useful and, please remember, if you are struggling at the moment - you are not alone. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_communities_12/content_687.html": "Teachers and school teams are doing a phenomenal job, and I know that digital poverty is a real worry for them, as well as for families across Tooting. Early on in the pandemic, Labour called for a set of measures that would see a mass roll-out of devices and internet access to students currently struggling to learn online, alongside steps such as ‘zero-rating’ of educational websites to ensure data charges are not putting barriers on access to education during lockdown.\nThe digital divide risks failing a generation. I am so pleased to have been able to help close this gap. As puppy prices soar across the UK, I am aware of concerns with the recent rise of dog thefts in our community, with incidents taking place particularly on and around Tooting Common. Perpetrators have been using a number of tactics, including snatching leads from dog owners’ hands, using dog whistles to attract dogs roaming off-lead, and impersonating RSPCA employees to gain access to dogs. One strategy involves approaching people walking their dogs and informing them that their dog resembles an animal that has been reported lost, before asking to scan the dog’s microchip in their van. Once near the van, dogs are being separated from their unsuspecting owners before driving away. The RSPCA reminds that their officers will always be wearing uniforms bearing the charity’s logo and will be carrying identification, and asks that any member of the public who believes someone is impersonating an officer report the incident to the RSPCA and to local police. Suspicious activity – including being approached with questions about your dog, asking for photographs to be taken of your dog – should also be reported. I have written to Inspector Barrie Capper, Head of Wandsworth Neighbourhood Policing Team, asking them to take action to protect our pets and tackle this awful crime. In the meantime, Blue Cross have provided a helpful list of actions you can take to help keep your dog safe.\nClick here for more information. Local residents living or passing through Rackham Mews in Furzedown may have seen the large fly-tip that occurred earlier in the week. Understandably, this is very unpleasant for those who live near this area and I have therefore written to Paul Chadwick, Director of Environment and Community Services at Wandsworth Council, as well as notifying the local councillors of the issue in the hope that this can be rectified as soon as possible. Please be assured that I will keep local resident updated of the progress on this. Furzedown Police are currently appealing for witnesses, so if you have any information about this fly-tip, please do email [email protected] or message them via Twitter. As you will know, a South African variant of Covid-19 has arrived in the UK. This new Covid variant has now been detected in CR4 (Merton). Residents in CR4 are no different to us in neighbouring Tooting (SW16 and SW17). We use the same shops, the same hospital, and the same parks, so if it’s there, it could very easily be here. This will be the same across all affected areas. As a matter of urgency, the Government needs to launch widespread testing in neighbouring postcodes. This is the only way to see how widespread these new variants are. I have written to the Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock MP, the Director of Public Health at Wandsworth Council, Shannon Katiyo, and the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Council, Paul Martin, to ask about plans to launch testing in neighbouring postcodes. While I press for action on this, we need to make sure we’re all doing everything we can to keep ourselves and each other safe. It’s absolutely vital that we minimise our social contact to prevent the spread of this new variant within our community. Please think twice before leaving home, and when you do leave, please continue to adhere to social distancing. Together, we will get through this. Earlier this week I met with local small business owners to hear the issues affecting them.\nFrom the insufficient support available to businesses that are non-direct ratepayers, to a lack of flexibility from landlords regarding rental payments, it is clear that the challenges Tooting small business owners are experiencing are considerable. Their resilience in the face of adversity is a credit to our community. The concerns shared will inform my actions to ensure that small businesses remain the beating heart of Tooting. Please check back here for updates, and keep an eye on my Facebook and Twitter pages for announcements of further events. I recently raised residents' concerns about damage to our beloved Tooting Common with Mr Neil Blackley, Head of Parks at Enable Leisure and Culture and have since received a response on this important issue I am told comprehensive is in plan to return the Common to its pre-pandemic state, while keeping as much as possible open for public use. Initial works will target the worst affected areas, and will see the soil replenished and grass seeds planted. While these works are scheduled to commence in the spring, it will be a number of years before this much-loved part of Tooting is restored.\nWandsworth Council is currently consulting local residents on its ‘Local Plan’ document on developments for the borough across the next 15 years. This plan identifies Tooting as a potential area for regeneration, where proposals include new sustainable transport, improvements to public realm, and contributions to the health and wellbeing of residents.\n3. 56 Tooting High Street on the west corner of the Garratt Lane and Tooting High Street junction: The Council are considering using this site for a development of sustainable architecture and urban design, as well as considering the planting of street trees on Garratt Lane.\nFurther information on these proposals can be found here. Whilst I hold no authority over Wandsworth Council, it is important to me that residents, businesses and organisations have their say on these proposals. If you would like to submit comments on the ‘Pre-Publication’ Draft Local Plan, you must do so before 11.59pm on Monday 1 March 2021 using the following link: https://www.wandsworth.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy/local-plan/draft-local-plan-pre-publication/ I am aware that many local residents are concerned about the proposed Tooting Triangle development. Plans to upgrade the site’s facilities and amenities – replacing the artificial football pitch with a modern surface, and building new changing rooms, public toilets, a children’s play area, and a café – are welcome. However, the proposal to fund the improvements via a 25-year lease of the new facilities to TFL Leisure – a private company – is more controversial.\nThe fence set to be constructed around the new football pitch, and the lack of clarity as to whether the upgraded children’s Stay & Play facility will remain free to use, have prompted concerns that the development will put public land behind a literal paywall. I am sure you will agree that if the recent lockdowns have taught us anything, it is that there is a need for more publicly accessible green spaces – not less. As it stands, the proposed development would see a reduction in the area available to the Balham Boxing Club compared with their current provision. Issues have also been raised regarding the smaller size of the female changing rooms compared to the men's, and the impact floodlighting could have on the Triangle’s resident bat population, among other things. I understand that discussions on the proposed development are ongoing. Please be assured that I am keeping a close eye on this evolving situation - we all want what's best for our local community.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_roads/content_5.html": "|\nAs an A&E doctor and mother, I am incredibly concerned about the impact of poor air quality in our local area. I see many people attending hospital with breathing difficulties directly linked to toxic air, which contributes to thousands of premature deaths every year. It is my belief that it is the right thing to do to adopt enforceable targets and bring in preventative measures to tackle air pollution. As such, I am supportive of the ULEZ expansion coming to Tooting.\nHowever, I also acknowledge its impact on people’s budgets. I called on Sadiq to expand the scrappage scheme support – which he delivered on without Government support despite money being provided for similar schemes in other cities. Furthermore, I am pleased that he has further expanded the scheme, and information about the scrappage scheme can be found here. Wandsworth Council have also announced support through the Wandsworth Sustainable Travel Fund, details of which can be found here. The expansion of ULEZ was also mandated by the Government as part of the TfL bailout deal during the height of the pandemic – so they wanted the expansion to go ahead as well. Following reports from local residents of increased levels of speeding on Blackshaw Road, I am pleased that the police agreed to my suggestion of increased speed watches around the local area. Given that there is a nursery and St George's Hospital along this road, it is vital that speed levels are stringently enforced to ensure everyone's safety.\nI will continue to work with the police, Wandsworth Council and local councillors to keep our streets safe and accessible. To this end, I am very pleased to hear that the council is currently considering implementing a zebra crossing outside the nursery to protect both children and parents. Today Wandsworth Council has announced that it is suspending the Low Traffic Neighbourhoods that it implemented across our community. Wandsworth Council failed from the start to communicate the implementation of LTNs to local residents, and instead of listening and reviewing they have now decided to pull them out because do not want the fuss.\nAs I have said before, I was not consulted and nor were local residents on these changes. They were brought in overnight and pitted neighbour against neighbour, causing fierce rows and division. The Council should be ashamed. When the going got tough, they tried to pass the buck, and now Wandsworth Council is wasting tens of thousands of pounds by scrapping the LTNs entirely. The Conservative Cabinet Member for Transport's position is untenable. Attention will now turn to the TfL Streetspace scheme on Upper Tooting Road, Balham High Road and Tooting High Street. I know that this is a scheme that has its issues and needs reviewing. However, I am confident that TfL want to make it work for our local environment. Contrast TfL's response with that of Wandsworth Council. TfL is taking feedback on board, they are hosting a virtual public meeting next week to gather feedback from local people and I am meeting with a TfL representative next week to discuss the scheme. I will be taking him to meet some of the affected businesses and discussing the issues emergency services have had. TfL evidently want the scheme to work and they deserve credit for trying. I have been clear from the start that I am supportive of schemes which encourage cycling and make our streets safer. We do that by engaging in polite and respectful discussion to bring about changes collectively. I have received lots of correspondence from local residents regarding the changes that have been made to our roads as part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood and the Streetspace schemes on the A24 (Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road). As part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood schemes, many streets have had filters put in to close the road to all vehicles except cycles and some now have turning restrictions. As part of the Streetspace scheme, a number of changes have been made to Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road including the installation of wands to segregate cycle lanes, a number of turning restrictions as well as changes to bus stops.\nThese changes have come about as a result of statutory guidance that the Government issued in May, stating that local authorities were expected to make significant changes to their road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians “as swiftly as possible”. (If you would like to read more about this statutory guidance you can read it in full here.) As a result, TfL made £55m of funding available to the 33 councils in London as part of its “Streetspace for London” programme to urgently create new segregated cycle lanes, extend pavements and close roads to traffic. Wandsworth Council was given £1,923,500 by TfL and used this money to implement the LTNs. TfL has, in consultation with Wandsworth Council but acting separately, implemented changes to the A24. I am supportive of initiatives which reduce car usage, make our streets safer, encourage cycling and create a better local environment. But we must make it work for everyone in Tooting and Balham. I know that lots of local residents have concerns and comments about how the changes have affected our community. The only way to have your voice heard is to feed into the consultations that Wandsworth Council is running and to let TfL know what you think by emailing them. To respond to Wandsworth Council's consultation, click here. To provide feedback to TfL please email: [email protected] It is important to note that I was not consulted prior to the implementation of these changes to our roads and I have no control over the decisions that have been made. As the local MP, I can lobby the Government and the relevant Ministers, but I cannot make decisions for the Conservative Council. I am listening and engaging with local residents on this but I cannot make alterations to these changes. If you have already provided your feedback to Wandsworth Council's consultation and/or emailed TfL, and you want to raise your concerns with other officials, you may also wish to contact Wandsworth Council's Transport spokesperson Councillor John Locker via email at [email protected], or the Government's Minister of State with responsibility for cycling and walking Chris Heaton-Harris MP via email at [email protected] |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

I am delighted that more than 100 local businesses have already signed up to become a Safe Space.\nFor more details, head to the Safe Space here\nWith the nights getting longer and recent rise in crime, some people feel uncomfortable walking in public alone. I’ve launched my Safe Space campaign, where local businesses can sign up to offer a place of safety.\nFor businesses that would like to sign-up, head to drrosena.co.uk/safespace\nA great time had by all at my local coffee morning, today. Pleasure to invite local residents to share a cuppa and hear about their local issues. Thanks to local organisations and the police for coming along and listening to residents. One of the most important jobs I do as your local Member of Parliament is ensuring that our wonderful communities in Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown, Tooting and Wandsworth Common remain safe and welcoming places to live.\nTo this end, I have recently hosted public meetings with local police leadership in Balham and Furzedown, conducted a walkaround with the Borough Superintendent around the local area, and written to the police on behalf of local residents on a wide range of issues. Please do let me know if you have any concerns regarding crime issues in the local area - my door is always open.\nAs part of National Care Home Week. I recently met some of the incredible staff and residents at Nightingale House in Balham to see first-hand the fantastic work being done in the local community.\nThe annual BATCA Fun Day is always good fun - and this year was no exception. I was delighted to celebrate the helpers, heroes and happy Tooting residents at this wonderful community event.\nOur local NHS board have announced that Trinity Medical Centre will close on 31st July. The decision to close the surgery is deeply disappointing and I am concerned that it will leave thousands of local residents scrambling to find another GP, including vulnerable patients.\nAt a time when local residents are already waiting weeks to see a GP, this decision is a shocking, short-sighted solution for users of the surgery. People will find themselves trying to squeeze onto the books of existing practices, travelling further to see a GP, losing the strong and trusted relationships with their GPs they've built over time. The blame for this decision lies squarely with this Conservative Government who have imposed 13 years of underfunding and neglect on our local NHS services. I have already called on the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, to meet with the community to see the impact of this decision first-hand and to reverse this disastrous decision. Today, I wrote to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, calling on him to listen to concerns expressed by local residents about the proposed closure of Trinity Medical Centre.\nAt a time when waiting times are at record levels, these plans by the NHS and Government will make it harder for local residents to access a local GP. That's why, alongside our local Labour Councillors, I'm campaigning to keep GP services at this site. Please add your name to the petition here Read my letter below: Trinity Medical Centre serves thousands of local people but is under threat of closure. For so many local residents this is a vital service. The closure would cause real difficulties for people accessing their local GP. Many local residents already have to wait weeks for a GP appointment and waiting lists for treatment are at record highs. This closure is a result of 13 years of government underfunding of our NHS. The local Integrated Care Board for South West London has been forced into making huge cuts to their budget and the impact of these cuts is now being felt by our community. In recent weeks, I've been contacted by numerous local residents extremely concerned about the impact of this closure. That's why I am urging the Health Secretary to intervene, listen to patients and staff alike, and keep a GP surgery open at Trinity Medical Centre. Sign my petition here Today, I asked Wandsworth Police officers to join me on a walk about in Tooting Bec.\nWe spoke to local residents and discussed tackling anti-social behaviour in the area. I know local residents have raised a number of concerns - about incidents targeting children and public safety in the area. I addressed these matters with the police, along with strategies already put in place aimed specifically at reducing worrying incidents of this kind and crime. Over recent months, I have taken the following action on anti-social behaviour and crime on the Heaver Estate:\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

If you are able to donate, please do visit the Medical Aid for Palestinians website here.\nThis morning, I invited residents from Tooting to share a cup of tea and a biscuit at my local coffee morning. As the local MP, I am here to help and my door is always open.\nI was thrilled to join Dermot O'Leary and Josie Gibson for the health segment on This Morning today to talk about working as an emergency doctor in the NHS and when to seek help.\nYes, A&E departments are under huge strain and pressure, but always remember - if you need help, we are here.\nAfter more than a year of waiting, the Government has finally responded to the Joint Committee report on the draft Mental Health Bill.\nIn that time, they kicked mental health into the long grass while patients continued to suffer. The Government response is poor - rejecting vital calls for a Mental Health Commissioner, refusing to ban discriminatory Community Treatment Orders and ignoring a right to culturally appropriate advocacy. Why make us wait so long and not provide any meaningful change? With waiting lists higher than ever, we need bold action on mental health. It is clear the Tories are simply not up to the job. A Labour Government must bring forward mental health reform with the recommendations of the committee at its core.\nToday, I joined Politics Live to discuss the Tories' botched Rwanda plan. The policy is an inhumane, unworkable gimmick - now they have blocked plans to protect victims of human trafficking and individuals who have supported our armed forces.\nIt's all done to appease the right of the party.\nToday's announcement by NHS England that children's cancer services will be moved away from the world-class unit at St George's Hospital is profoundly disappointing.\nAs a doctor, I am clear that this decision has not been made in the interests of patients or their families and we're losing more than 25 years of expertise in the field of children's cancer care. I'm calling on the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Victoria Atkins to immediately review this decision.\nThere was a huge turnout today for the Oxfam Lobby Day event calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. I was proud to join other MPs and charities calling for an unconditional, immediate ceasefire.\nThank you to the charities who helped support it and to all attendees, who brought a powerful energy to the room.\nTonight, I joined Robert Peston on ITV alongside Conservative MP, Paul Scully, Government Minister, Kevin Hollinrake and environmental campaigner, Fergal Sharkey to discuss the hot topics of the day. We chatted about the appalling comments made by a Tory donor about Diane Abbott and extremism in the UK.\nEvery corner of Wandsworth thrives with culture and creativity. Our art, food and history are what makes our community great.\nThat's why I'm so proud that Wandsworth has been selected as London's Borough of Culture in 2025. Thanks to everyone who has worked to make this happen.\nSending my best wishes to everyone in Tooting and around the world. I hope you have a blessed Ramadan.\nSpecial thoughts and prayers going to Palestinians and all Muslims around the world enduring hardship and suffering at this time. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_parliament_3/content_627.html": "|\nThe Tories have scrapped the Mental Health Act - failing thousands of patients.\nLabour must seize the opportunity to modernise mental health legislation, with the Joint Committee's recommendations in mind. Read my piece in New Statesman here.\nTonight, I voted on an amendment to the King's Speech to support a ceasefire in Gaza.\nRead my full statement here:\nToday, the Government have scrapped their pledge to reform the Mental Health Act.\nMore than six years of reports, campaigning and hard work has gone down the drain. Last year, I sat on the Joint Committee on the Draft Mental Health Bill. There was overwhelming cross-party support for reforming the Act. To this day, the Government has failed to respond to the committee's recommendations. Earlier this year, the Conservatives scrapped their own 10-year mental health plan. Dither, delay and failure is on form with the Tories' approach to tackling the crisis in mental health services. Black people are five times more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act. The Tories have scrapped a once in a generation opportunity to tackle this burning injustice. Last month, I challenged the Health Minister to commit to reforming the Mental Health Act, her response was less than insightful. It is disappointing that the Tories continue to bury their heads in the sand and neglect mental health services. They are out of ideas and it's costing patients their lives. Only Labour can provide the transformation needed to improve services.\nToday in Parliament, I challenged the Foreign Secretary to call on his Israeli counterpart to demand an immediate ceasefire to the escalating crisis in Gaza. While rightly calling out Hamas’ horrific attacks, we also have a duty to speak on behalf of those innocent Palestinians who are being collectively punished, starved and bombed in their own homes by Israeli forces. See my question here:\nToday, I was on BBC Politics Live ahead of Prime Minister Questions, to discuss the conflict in Israel and Gaza, free speech and the drinking culture in Westminster.\nAll too often, children are stuck on long waiting lists for mental health treatment and thousands of people are having their referrals closed before an appointment.\nThis Tory Government caused the crisis in mental health services - when will they fix it?\nI've always been a proud supporter of Palestinian rights, which is why it was great to sit down and catch-up with the Palestinian Ambassador to the UK, Husam Zumot, in Parliament today.\nToday, I proudly led Labour's opposition debate on mental health and put forward our plan to transform mental health services across the country. It includes more staff, specialists in schools, hubs in communities, treatment within a month. Patients experiencing a mental health crisis often find themselves stuck in A&E.\nThe Health Secretary should be ashamed. Today, I asked the Health Secretary when will he finally get his act together and back Labour's plans to recruit thousands of additional staff to bring down waiting times? See my question here The Prime Minister has been forced to abandon her unfunded tax cut for the 1% of highest earners.\nThis Government U-turn is too late for the families who will pay higher mortgages for years to come. It will also do nothing to help or to reassure the people in Tooting and beyond. The Tories have destroyed their economic credibility and damaged trust in the British economy. Twelve years of Tory government have left the economy in chaos, and the new Prime Minister continues to make it up as she goes along. Today’s U-turn does not mark a move away from disastrous Tory economics, it’s just some districation. The Government needs to reverse their trickle down strategy. It just doesn’t work. Instead, they need to offer a programme of measures that will offer real support to those struggling with rises in food and energy bills, and increases in rent and mortgage payments. Too many people will struggle to pay their bills and put food on the table this winter, and the Government must step in now. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_all_18/content_704.html": "|\nTrinity Medical Centre serves thousands of local people but is under threat of closure. For so many local residents this is a vital service. The closure would cause real difficulties for people accessing their local GP. Many local residents already have to wait weeks for a GP appointment and waiting lists for treatment are at record highs. This closure is a result of 13 years of government underfunding of our NHS. The local Integrated Care Board for South West London has been forced into making huge cuts to their budget and the impact of these cuts is now being felt by our community. In recent weeks, I've been contacted by numerous local residents extremely concerned about the impact of this closure. That's why I am urging the Health Secretary to intervene, listen to patients and staff alike, and keep a GP surgery open at Trinity Medical Centre. Sign my petition here As Mental Health Awareness Week comes to a close, I’ve been highlighting Labour’s bold plan for improving services across England, with prevention and early intervention at its heart.\nOn my visit to Maudsley Hospital, I spoke to the incredible Aji Lewis, who has tirelessly campaigned for Seni's Law to transform patient safety across the country. I spoke at a Parliamentary reception for Mental Health Foundation and joined Baton of Hope in Parliament, for a meeting with the Speaker to discuss their work on suicide prevention. And finally, speaking to students South Thames College, I spoke about my role as Shadow Cabinet Minister for Mental Health, holding the Government to account for failure in Mental Health services across England. Today, I asked Wandsworth Police officers to join me on a walk about in Tooting Bec.\nWe spoke to local residents and discussed tackling anti-social behaviour in the area. I know local residents have raised a number of concerns - about incidents targeting children and public safety in the area. I addressed these matters with the police, along with strategies already put in place aimed specifically at reducing worrying incidents of this kind and crime. Over recent months, I have taken the following action on anti-social behaviour and crime on the Heaver Estate:\nOn polling day, I joined Labour Party candidates standing for council seats in Dover, Medway and Gravesham. Across the country, Labour won more than 600 local council seats in Stoke-on-Trent, Plymouth, Dover, Medway, and many other areas that we will need to win, if we are to form a Labour majority at the next General Election.\nTalking to voters in these seats, it's clear that people right across the country have turned their back on the Conservatives, looking to Labour to deal with the cost-of-living crisis, tackle NHS waiting lists, and improving safety in our communities. The road to Labour in Government runs through our local councils, and I am hopeful this local victory will be the springboard to Labour’s general election victory. Patients experiencing a mental health crisis often find themselves stuck in A&E.\nThe Health Secretary should be ashamed. Today, I asked the Health Secretary when will he finally get his act together and back Labour's plans to recruit thousands of additional staff to bring down waiting times? See my question here Tooting has so much to offer as a community and I was delighted to visit my friends in Tooting Market yesterday to talk about their businesses. From food to clothes to art, crafts and activities, there is a wonderful array of businesses in the market Next time you're in the area, make sure to pop in and sample the market's delights, whether you need freshly squeezed juice3 or freshly stitched jeans. To hear from the traders themselves (and to see me in a funky hat!). It was fantastic to be out in the gorgeous Peak District to support my friend and High Peak's next Labour MP, Jon Pearce. We first visited the Glossop Arts Project to see the amazing work they do, using art to support young people's mental health - of course, we had to indulge in the offer of a free toastie and cuppa too!\nOn the doorstep afterwards, we spoke to so many people fed up with the Tories, both locally and in Westminster. There are council elections coming up in May and Labour has every chance to take full control of the council here! The views were incredible, the people lovely, and I can't wait to be back! Today marks World Bipolar Day, which raises awareness and reduces the stigma surrounding bipolar disorder. One-in-fifty people in the UK live with bipolar disorder yet many struggle to access the services they need to get a proper diagnosis. Living with bipolar disorder can have a devastating impact on the people struggling with the illness as well as an impact on their loved ones, which is why it is vital that people are able to get a diagnosis early. We need a Government that will get serious on bipolar disorder. Labour will put prevention and early intervention at the forefront of our approach to mental health. The next Labour Government will recruit 8,500 new staff to ensure mental health treatment within a month for all who need it.\nBaroness Casey's independent findings of racist, misogynistic, and homophobic abuses of power within the Met Police are deeply shocking and will leave many residents in Tooting concerned that the trust between the police and our community has been shattered.\nIt is clear that there is a failure of leadership from the Home Office and today's report lays bare the scale of the challenge needed to reform the Met Police. The rot runs right through the force, so no stone can be left unturned in the push for change. I welcome the work that Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has already begun with the new Commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, in addressing these deep-rooted issues and regaining the trust of residents and victims of crime in Tooting. However, under this Home Secretary and this Conservative Government, the Met Police are lacking the leadership, ambition and resources needed to grasp the scale of this challenge. Over the last 13 years, neighbourhood policing has been decimated, whilst prosecutions for violent and sexual crimes have hit the lowest levels on record, and victims of crime are now unsure that if they report a crime, the police will even turn up. It is clear we need a Government with a plan to overhaul policing in London which will deliver cultural and systematic change. Under a Labour Government, we will overhaul policing and raise standards, with strengthened training and mandatory vetting, and the restoration of neighbourhood policing. I would like to thank our hardworking neighbourhood police officers who have always worked constructively with me and for their continuing efforts to keep our local community safe. Today, I am marking International Women's Day 2023 by celebrating some of the inspiring women who make Tooting the best place to work and live.\nHere are just some of Tooting's amazing women: Sahar Beg - Sahar, and her amazing team of volunteers, run the Tooting Community Kitchen, which has provided hot meals, toiletries, and care packages to those in need since 2018. Sophie Livingstone - Sophie, and the team at Little Village, are hardworking local activists providing vital support at their baby bank in Tooting. Kate Allan - Kate is a leading member of the Balham and Tooting Community Association (BATCA). BATCA works to organise community events, celebreate the local heroes in our area and bring people of all backgrounds together. Cllr Sarmila Varatharaj - Sarmila was elected to serve our community as a councillor last May and is now Wandsworth's Deputy Mayor. She is a volunteer for Global Human Rights Defence and has been the spokesperson to the United Nations Human Rights Council. Cllr Lizzy Dobres - Lizzy has been a dedicated councillor since being elected last May and has led on fighting inequality and violence against women. Charlotte White - Charlotte is part of the fantastic team at Earlsfield Foodbank. During the most difficult of times, she has worked tirelessly to support those in need of our community. Natasha Best - Natasha, and the team at Tooting Works, provide fantastic community and work space for many local businesses and start ups. To all the countless other amazing women who do so much for our community, thank you. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

It’s a time to celebrate all the brilliant women who make our community, the incredible place it is.\nToday, I brought together a group of fantastic leading women in business and community organisations. Their stories were inspiring and shows what women can do when we support each other. There is a disused council site on Swaffield Road which I want to see converted into a pocket park for local families. I was overwhelmed by the support that this plan has received. The petition has now been submitted to the council and will be reviewed.\nWas great to be at the BATCA Community Awards celebrating the heroes who strive to make our area better.\nUp to 86,000 people could die in Gaza in the next 6 months due to war, disease and starvation. There’s one latrine for every 500 people and only 4 trucks of aid per day.\nAt the International Development Select Committee, we heard evidence about the appalling humanitarian situation from experts working on the ground. The Committee published our report on the ongoing crisis. You can read more about it here\nToday I met with the Prison Officers Assocation from Wandsworth Prison and Battersea and Wandsworth TUC to discuss the brutal conditions officers face.\nThey told me about appalling conditions with three assaults on staff every day. This simply can’t go on - the Govt must get a grip on the crisis in our prisons. When I look at myself in the mirror, I want to be proud of the person looking back. We have a moral responsibility to stop more innocent people being killed. That is why I am voting for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. See my speech in full here: Wandsworth Labour are freezing council tax for another year to help families through the cost-of-living crisis.\nAt the same time, we're improving services and building a better Wandsworth. My South London Press column is out today! As it was Valentine's Day this week, I wrote a love letter to my local area.\nAcross Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting, there is such an amazing range of people and culture locally. Read my article here👇 https://londonnewsonline.co.uk/ Sunak pledged to grow the economy but instead we entered recession.\nHe can no longer credibly claim that his plan is working.

It was a sheer joy to see the pillars of our communities together in one place and I look forward to continuing to collaborate and support the inspiring people who do so much for the local area.\nI presented the following organisations and individuals with trophies for truly exceptional services in the community: Councillor Andy Gibbons, for his dedicated public service over the last three decades.

I would like to thank all those who attended - I cannot overstate how proud I am of our community. Each and every one of you is a true Tooting Hero. The Government recently released their “Plan for Health and Social Care”, in which they pledge to help the NHS recover from the coronavirus pandemic and reform the adult social care system - funded by a 1.25% increase in National Insurance payments.\nLow-paid families will now be hit with a double whammy of a Universal Credit cut and a hike in tax. In fact, some key workers will end up more than £1,000 worse off. While I have long called for investment in social care, this is not the appropriate way to fund it. Once again the Tories have put the very wealthiest above working people. I am proud to have voted against this National Insurance increase, which will be a damaging blow to so many working people in Tooting. The situation which has unfolded in Afghanistan is shocking and terribly regrettable. It is simply not good enough for world leaders to say the speed of the Taliban advance took them by surprise, when many have been warning of this for months. There has either been a monumental failing of our intelligence services or an unacceptable lack of transparency. Either way the Government has reacted too late. In 2010, I worked (pictured) as a Humanitarian Aid Doctor in the North West Frontier Province, on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan, following the flood crisis. I met many people who had suffered unimaginable pain at the hands of the Taliban. I am continuing to receive a high volume of emails from local residents concerned about loved ones in Afghanistan. Myself and my team are working to respond as quickly as possible. If you are worried about someone, please do not hesitate to get in touch by emailing their details to [email protected]. Please include the following information so I can take action quickly:\nWe must not allow history to repeat itself. Careless leadership from the Prime Minister enabled this tragedy to happen on his watch, while he had taken his eye off the ball. The world must not turn its back on the Afghan people. Following the recall of Parliament on Wednesday, I remain in close contact with my colleagues in the Shadow Foreign Team and will continue to be on hand to support local residents through this. Today, I voted against the Nationality and Borders Bill, a piece of legislation that risks breaking international law and turns our backs on unaccompanied children fleeing war and persecution. The Conservatives just voted to make it harder to give a safe haven to children fleeing violence and war. They should be ashamed. The cruel irony of this Government’s approach is that it’s weak on taking action against criminal gangs and brutal when it comes to orphaned children from war zones. As someone who has held the hands of frightened children and terrified parents working as a doctor in war torn areas such as the Rohingya and Palestine, I am appalled at the Government’s approach to protecting those in need of safety. “Prior to 2017, no Government invested in or prioritised mental health services.”\nI couldn’t have put it better myself - and I didn’t need to, for these are not my words. They are the words of Nadine Dorries, the Mental Health Minister. The devastation left behind by the cuts to mental health services is staggering. And who was the architect of these cuts? No one other than the new Health Secretary during his time as a Treasury Minister. This matter cannot go unaddressed. That is why in Parliament today I asked the new Health Secretary to explain why a quarter of mental health beds have been cut since 2010, why 140,000 children were turned away from mental health services last year, and, finally, if he is ashamed of his track record. See here to view the video. The recent vigil on Clapham Common was our chance to come together and grieve the loss of Sarah Everard's life. Our chance to mourn the lives of the women lost to violence. And it was a chance to mourn our own lived experiences. I share the frustrations and disappointment felt over police action taken that day. In light of events at Clapham Common, I know many are concerned about the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, and what this divisive law would mean for the right to protest. I want to be clear: Tonight, I will be voting against this Bill. I believe that the Government has undermined this Bill through draconian measures that impose disproportionate controls on free expression and the right to protest. I believe these measures will have an unfair impact on Black, Asian, and ethnic minority people. I also believe 10 year sentences for crimes against statues – significantly longer than the sentences for crimes which disproportionately impact women – is a worrying priority. Under this Government, rape convictions have fallen to an all-time low, delays in the Crown Courts are at an all-time high, and justice is not being served for thousands of women and girls. This is now the time for the Government to correct their woeful record and commit to putting in place long overdue protections for women. Our hearts go out to Sarah Everard's friends and family at this unspeakably difficult time. My statement on this and the #ReclaimTheseStreets vigil here: I know that the Climate and Ecological Emergency (CEE) Bill is one of interest to many people here in Tooting. On 9th February, the CEE Bill was debated in a thirty-minute adjournment debate. Adjournment debates are spaces at the end of the Parliamentary day when MPs can debate a specific topic. As you may know, the CEE Bill is a Private Members Bill (Presentation Bill), meaning that it does not involve a debate or a vote in Parliament, but rather it is a way of drawing attention to an issue. I support the principles of this Bill and will therefore continue to support Parliamentary measures that seek to implement many of the principles laid out in the Bill. Indeed, I have already supported several amendments to the Environment Bill in order to improve it, such as Clause 2 for environmental targets on particulate matter and Clause 7 for Environmental Improvement Plans. I will absolutely continue to support strong and effective amendments to the Environment Bill when it returns to the House of Commons in due course. The climate crisis is an imminent threat to current and future generations. Please know that I am committed to holding the Government to account on their approach to climate change. In light of the upcoming Fire Safety Bill, I would to thank every resident who has written to me with their concerns on this and for continuing to keep me updated on the cladding issues affecting their property. I recognise what an exceptionally difficult time this is and appreciate how much anxiety the cladding proposals are causing to many leaseholders.\nOn more than fifteen occasions, Ministers promised that leaseholders would not be landed with the costs of remedial works. Yet, people are still being put at risk, trapped in flammable buildings for a third lockdown, with leaseholders placed in an impossible position and promises broken. It is evident that the Government’s handling of the cladding crisis has lacked any sense of grip or urgency. For this reason, the Labour Party have tabled an Opposition Day Debate on cladding for Monday, which will subsequently bring forward a vote that will call for leaseholders to be protected from the costs of remediating their blocks with dangerous cladding. The party will also be tabling a number of amendments to the Fire Safety Bill that will aim to protect leaseholders from unfair costs through the power of the law. I am aware that many residents have been in touch to request that I support the McPartland and Smith amendment, which provides welcome clarity on the specific costs that would be prevented from being passed on to leaseholders. Labour has sought to go further on this. As currently drafted, the McPartland and Smith amendment would not have covered blocks like Grenfell - where flammable cladding has been added at some stage following the building of the block. It only applies to defects in the original design of buildings. The Labour Party’s amendment would ensure that the cost of fire safety problems from refurbishment jobs, like the cladding on Grenfell Tower, cannot be passed on to leaseholders. Labour’s amendments also include new clauses so that the Bill protects leaseholders from the day it comes into law, instead of an unknown date in the future. I would like to thank my colleagues in the Labour Party, Sarah Jones MP, Nick Thomas-Symonds MP, Thangam Debbonaire MP and Mike Amesbury MP for their hard work and commitment to addressing this large injustice on a national scale. If any residents have any further queries on this issue, please do not hesitate to get in touch to discuss this further. In the meantime, I hope this post assures you of the steps myself and the Labour Party are taking to protect tenants and leaseholders during this cladding crisis.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

People of all ages are invited to enjoy this wonderful green space with their friends and family. Forever Fishponds have a range of activities planned for you to enjoy, including pop-up garden and nature walks, a bake sale and competition, bat and ball games, races, cricket, football, and much more. Head down to Fishponds Playing Fields between 10am and 12pm to be part of the fun! Children and young people have suffered immensely during the pandemic. But the mental health crisis facing Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) is nothing new. CAMHS services are at breaking point. They were before the pandemic. Tens of thousands of children are being turned away from mental health services – support they vitally need. Parents have raised this issue. Doctors have raised this issue. The stats provide the evidence. When will the Government admit that CAMHS services need to be better resourced? On the eve of Tokyo 2020, Tooting is preparing to celebrate a hero of the Antwerp Games a century earlier - champion middle-distance runner Albert Hill. Hill, who took gold at the 1920 Olympics, was born and raised in Tooting. A blue plaque commemorating his outstanding achievements is now set to be erected outside his former home. The plaque was funded through community donations, and is the result of the tireless efforts of the students of Fircroft Primary School, who campaigned for its creation. Local historian Geoff Simmons said, “It’s great that Great Britain’s Olympic past is being honoured, but its future is under threat. Tooting Bec Athletics Track, home to the historic athletics club Herne Hill Harriers, and used by 80,000 young people every year, has been ruled unfit for competition and is in need of repair.” Click here to sign the petition calling on Wandsworth Tories to fund vital repairs to Tooting Track. Balham has a long and proud history, and its architecture is of real importance to the local community; and Balham Railway Bridge is a prominent and important feature of this historical architecture. Unfortunately in recent years, the bridge’s grandeur has sadly faded beyond all recognition. I recently spoke with the local community group Beautify Balham who have made suggestions, such as painting the bridge an attractive colour, re-painting the metal columns, and installing up-lighting to showcase the bridge. I am wholly supportive of these suggestions. As such, I wrote to Network Rail, asking them to consider incorporating these simple yet impactful improvements as part of the £2.6 million investment they have committed to restore Balham Station. Swift action was taken and I was delighted to hear that the Bridge has had its first coat of paint! It has been a pleasure to support the wonderful Beautify Balham volunteers with this campaign and I would like to especially thank Councillor Clare Fraser, who works so hard to support local residents. Today, I voted against the Nationality and Borders Bill, a piece of legislation that risks breaking international law and turns our backs on unaccompanied children fleeing war and persecution. The Conservatives just voted to make it harder to give a safe haven to children fleeing violence and war. They should be ashamed.

As someone who has held the hands of frightened children and terrified parents working as a doctor in war torn areas such as the Rohingya and Palestine, I am appalled at the Government’s approach to protecting those in need of safety. On Sunday I had the great honour of presenting the medals and winners’ trophy to the Sinjun Grammarians under 12s cricket team - 2021 champions of the Surrey Tier Three League. Masterfully managed by Mukesh Dev, and captained with distinction by Rufus Ford, the team’s achievement is all the more remarkable on account of the club’s small size – with a membership of just over 50 junior players, Sinjun Grammarians rarely have enough players in the same age group to enter into league competitions. Their success is also astounding for the fact that the playing group, who were experiencing league competition for the first time, marched to the title unbeaten in all their 10 games. I could not be more proud of this group of talented young athletes, not only for overcoming the odds and taking the title so convincingly, but for the focus, determination, sportsmanship, and teamwork they showed along the way. This is what Tooting is all about: the players are truly a credit to themselves, their families, their club, and our community. I was absolutely bowled over by the Club’s decision to award me the title of Honorary President of Sinjun Grammarians Cricket Club. This success is undoubtedly the first of many such achievements for this passionate group of young cricketers, and I look forward to celebrating with them again in coming seasons. Well done, team! “Prior to 2017, no Government invested in or prioritised mental health services.”\nI couldn’t have put it better myself - and I didn’t need to, for these are not my words.

While, unfortunately, it did not come home, it was great to spend time with hard-working colleagues at St Georges. With infections and hospitalisations increasing, it’s still incredibly important for us all to look out for one another and play our part in stopping the spread of the virus. Earlier this week, the Prime Minister gave an update on moving to stage four of the coronavirus easing roadmap. This means that from 19 July, the following will apply:\nUnderstandably, many are worried about the repercussions of these eased restrictions. Indeed, many residents have been in touch regarding the use of face coverings on public transport and their anxieties surrounding this. On Wednesday, Sadiq Khan announced that face coverings will remain mandatory for all, unless exempt, when travelling on the TfL network. This will, no doubt, be a relief to many in the local area, and I pay tribute to the Mayor of London in taking a firm stand against the Government’s recklessness. Labour is calling for a controlled approach that keeps in place baseline measures that can push down infections, like mandatory face masks on public transport – which we know protect people, reduce the spread of the virus, and don’t harm the economy. By removing mask requirements - the Johnson Variant is being fast-tracked. Cases will soar, as will hospitalisations. Everyone in Tooting has been fantastic in reducing the spread of coronavirus. With one of the highest vaccination rates in London, I can only ask residents to continue looking out for one another. The future of Tooting Bec Athletics Track is still yet to be secured, with vital repairs still needing to be undertaken. Tooting Bec Athletics Track is a much-loved and well-utilised facility, both by local residents and the wider London community. The track is a home to schools, clubs such as Herne Hill Harriers, as well as aspiring athletes. To lose such a valuable asset would be a devastating blow to so many of our young people in our local area. Top British athletes are made at Tooting Bec Athletics Track - Jade Johnson, who represented Great Britain at two Olympics, trained at the track since childhood, as has Katie Snowden, who will represent Great Britain in Tokyo next month. By allowing the track to fall into disrepair, Wandsworth Tories are destroying the legacy of London 2012, and seriously damaging the chances of our next generation of Olympic hopefuls in the process. The deadline for the petition to save Tooting Bec Athletics Track has been extended until 1 August – click here to sign and show Wandsworth Tories how much our community cares about the future of our young people. This week, I was honoured to present Dons Local Action Group with the cheque of money raised through my Euro 2020 raffle. I’m so proud that our community has, once again, come together. The response was truly overwhelming, and in only four days we were able to raise £1,270 in much-needed funds for the Dons Local Action Group They’re an incredible local charity and I know they’ll be able to do a lot of good for so many families and young people with the money raised.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_communities_8/content_649.html": "|\nToday, I spoke with GMB and Royal College of Nursing frontline NHS staff at St George’s Hospital to hear their views on the Government’s latest pay offer. The last 18 months has impacted our beloved NHS immeasurably, and staff have made significant sacrifices in order to save lives. I stand in solidarity with my NHS colleagues. They deserve far more than just claps. They need a proper pay rise. It was a pleasure to, once again, attend the annual Nicholas Stewart Project Community Day on the Henry Prince Estate in Earlsfield. It was a real honour to have been asked to lay flowers in memory of Nicholas, who tragically lost his life seven years ago. The Nicholas Stewart Project was founded in the wake of Nicholas Stewart’s murder and encourages young people to reject negative influences in their life and turn away from knife crime. It is always so inspiring to hear the work of the NSP in supporting young people and be part of our community standing together in hope. Tooting Community Kitchen is a wonderful organisation that serves hot food to those vulnerable in our community. And they need volunteers! If you have a few hours to spare, please consider lending a hand to help out this brilliant local organisation. You can find out more about how to get involved here. There was significant concern locally about Wandsworth Council’s decision to extend Controlled Parking Zone restrictions in areas of Earlsfield and Tooting from 9:30am to 9:30pm each day. Over 1400 local residents completed my consultation on the change. I am pleased that, following our pressure, Wandsworth Council have U-turned on their plans to extend CPZ restrictions. Instead, Event Day only restrictions are planned from 1 October - a far more sensible solution, and something which other councils with stadiums do. I received more than double the number of responses to Wandsworth Council’s rushed, ill-thought out consultation. In fact, over 93% of respondents were not happy with the council’s plans. This should never have happened. But I am pleased the Council finally listened and have U-turned on their attempt to rush through restrictions that would simply act as another cash-grab on hardworking local residents. It is so important that those living with sight loss in our community are supported when using public transport. That is why I recently wrote to South Western Rail and Southern Rail to enquire as to when warning tactile - a vital safety and accessibility tool for those travelling by train - will be installed at Earlsfield and Wandsworth Stations. I am happy to say that Southern Rail have now confirmed that warning tactile has been installed on surface platforms at Wandsworth Common Station. And, although tactile is yet to be installed at Earlsfield Station, South West Railway have stated that Network Rail is working hard to deliver these accessibility improvements. Rest assured I will continue to press for accessibility for local residents living with sight loss.

Although it wasn't the result we wanted, our fantastic team can hold their heads high in pride for their performances and spirit. A World Cup final following on from a European championship win last year is an incredible record and I am sure we will be right up there again in four years. My family were firmly glued to the sofa all tournament and many spirited debates were had about England's best player. My eldest and I were firmly Team Lauren James, while my youngest maintained throughout thaT Russo is our star. Either way, very well done once again to the Lionesses and congratulations must go to Spain too for a well-played final.\nCongratulations to all the students who have received their A level results – and to the teachers, staff and schools that have helped get them there.\nWhether our students are going on to university, apprenticeships, further training, or joining the workforce, they have all made us proud with their hard work, dedication and resilience. This year was particularly challenging. For many pupils, this was their first experience of exams in a formal sense, after GCSEs were suspended during the pandemic. Grade boundaries were also raised to return to 2019 levels. However, our students and schools excelled, with a number of Tooting schools exceeding the London average of 30% A*-A grades – itself a pass rate that is the highest in the country. London schools are still benefitting from the London Challenge investment of the last Labour government. Our Tooting students and our Tooting schools and staff are something to celebrate. We are so proud of you.\nPolice forces across England are set to stop attending many incidents concerning mental health under a new National Partnership Agreement: Right Care, Right Person.\nThe Government's announcement leaves far too many questions unanswered and fails to tackle the root problem of lengthy NHS waiting lists in mental health services. I have written to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, asking him to come clean on what action he is taking to tackle mental health waiting lists. Read my full letter here:\nOver recent weeks, I have been appalled at the Tory's unworkable, unethical plans to house asylum seekers on a barge in Dorset.\nThe Government failed to listen to well-founded concerns or even carry out basic checks of the water supply, which was contaminated with Legionella bacteria, putting both asylum-seekers and staff at-risk. The Tories have serious questions to answer about the safety of this project and should stop wasting taxpayer's money pursuing headlines and instead fix this broken asylum system.\nRecently, I have received many emails about the climate emergency and how a potential Labour government would respond to it. We are facing a climate crisis and urgent action needs to be taken to avoid it. UN reports have shown that existing policies are not doing enough to avert cataclysmic climate related events, and we are already seeing historic weather activities causing floods, wildfires and droughts around the world.\nA Labour government would put climate change at the heart of our agenda to help build a better Britain. Labour would deliver zero-carbon power by 2030, insulate 19 million homes and establish a National Wealth Fund to help create over a million jobs in green industry. Labour will make the UK a clean energy superpower to cut energy bills and improve national energy security. As an A&E doctor and mother, I am incredibly concerned about the impact of poor air quality in our local area. I see many people attending hospital with breathing difficulties directly linked to toxic air, which contributes to thousands of premature deaths every year. It is my belief that it is the right thing to do to adopt enforceable targets and bring in preventative measures to tackle air pollution. As such, I am supportive of the ULEZ expansion coming to Tooting.\nHowever, I also acknowledge its impact on people’s budgets. I called on Sadiq to expand the scrappage scheme support – which he delivered on without Government support despite money being provided for similar schemes in other cities. Furthermore, I am pleased that he has further expanded the scheme, and information about the scrappage scheme can be found here. Wandsworth Council have also announced support through the Wandsworth Sustainable Travel Fund, details of which can be found here. The expansion of ULEZ was also mandated by the Government as part of the TfL bailout deal during the height of the pandemic – so they wanted the expansion to go ahead as well. The current housing market is incredibly difficult to get into as a first-time buyer. In our local area especially, house and rent prices are daunting, and sadly the Tories are not doing enough to provide support for people or help increase the housing supply.\nLabour have set out an ambitious plan for housebuilding targets to help supply the need for housing and provide security to people and their families. This would include relaxing planning restrictions to let local authorities and examining green Belt areas that could be used to build on. I fully support Labour’s ambition to have 70% of people owning their own home. Many people have got in touch with me recently about the Government’s proposed ban on electric shock collars for dogs. As an animal lover myself, it is my firm belief that the UK should lead the world in animal welfare standards which would mean no animal would be made to endure unnecessary suffering.\nAll pets deserve the utmost protection, and I’m pleased that the legislation introduced has been approved by the House of Lords. However, I’m also pleased that there will be an exemption for those with protected characteristics who have a legitimate need to use collars that produce sounds, vibrations, and other non-shock signals. At the start of August I hosted GMB Southern in Parliament.\nUnions play such a crucial role in supporting workers and ensuring our workplaces maintain the highest standards for safety, pay and conditions. I really enjoyed talking to the staff about the work they do: representing individuals and groups, helping people through disputes, and pushing for legislative change that keeps the UK’s workplaces reflective of our values and aspirations. If you haven’t already: join a union – they are there for you. It is incredible to see the work being done in Wandsworth Town Hall by the new Labour council. Recently, it was announced that free school meals would be available during school holidays for eligible children, while parents of pupils on free school meals will also have access to uniform vouchers to help cover this expense. With the Tory cost-of-living crisis, this is a hugely beneficial scheme for hard-working families across the borough.\nThis is the difference that Labour makes in power and I look forward to continued close cooperation with the new council administration in order to make our communities even better places to live.

The verdict from the judges that matter: the Red Velvet cake with beetroot was a hit.\nCongratulations to all the students who have received their A level results – and to the teachers, staff and schools that have helped get them there.\nWhether our students are going on to university, apprenticeships, further training, or joining the workforce, they have all made us proud with their hard work, dedication and resilience.

London schools are still benefitting from the London Challenge investment of the last Labour government. Our Tooting students and our Tooting schools and staff are something to celebrate. We are so proud of you. There is a crisis in our universities up and down the country, with record numbers of students now seeking mental health support, according to our latest research. Through Freedom of Information requests, we found that over 200,000 students sought support for their mental health across the UK in 2020-2021 – a threefold increase, since 2010. The lack of mental health support for our young people is not only affecting their health, but it also having a knock-on impact on their future prospects.\nUniversities are struggling to cope with the rising demand for access to the mental health treatment students need. Every five days, a student takes their own life. That is why Labour has put forward a comprehensive plan, that will put prevention of the heart of mental health services. Under Labour’s plan, we will recruit 8,500 new mental health professionals by the end of our first term in office, to see an addition one million patients per year. See more about the crisis in mental health at universities, here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1579388728153604098?s=20&t=CcG6Wxm1iHr6xo0Cfsjyww\nTeachers and school teams are doing a phenomenal job, and I know that digital poverty is a real worry for them, as well as for families across Tooting. Early on in the pandemic, Labour called for a set of measures that would see a mass roll-out of devices and internet access to students currently struggling to learn online, alongside steps such as ‘zero-rating’ of educational websites to ensure data charges are not putting barriers on access to education during lockdown.\nThe digital divide risks failing a generation. I am so pleased to have been able to help close this gap. Throughout the ongoing pandemic I have been inundated with emails from parents, school staff, students, and residents alike who have taken the time to outline their views on school closures. Some are concerned about safety, with many teachers and students facing the very real and grave possibility of bringing the virus home to vulnerable family members. Some are concerned about the impact a further lockdown could have on children's wellbeing and their education. And some are concerned about the challenges school closures will cause for working families.\nAs I am sure you will agree, the current situation is incredibly serious. This virus is spreading exponentially across the country, many people are in hospital, and too many people are tragically losing their loved ones. We know how difficult another lockdown will be, but I believe that national measures are necessary. As the Shadow Minister for Mental Health and a working mother, it is safe to say the impact of extended school closures on children’s well-being and working families cannot be overstated. This is why Labour called on Government to do everything possible to avoid it. Boris Johnson must immediately set out clear plans for every child to return safely to school as soon as possible - and be honest with parents about the timetable for this. It is also critical that young people’s education is safeguarded throughout this period of remote learning, and every student must have access to the devices they need to learn. Schools and families can request free mobile data increases for students without broadband or who cannot afford extra data for devices. More information on this scheme can be found here: get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/about-increasing-mobile-data. It is vital the Government prevent disadvantaged families being priced out of education. As many families will agree, working parents face huge challenges in balancing work, childcare, and supporting their child’s education. They must have the support they need to do this. Nobody should have to choose between their job and supporting their children, so the Government - and employers - must clearly promote the use of the job retention scheme for those unable to work due to family commitments. Please rest assured that myself and Labour Party colleagues will continue to hold the Government to account on these issues as we all navigate the ongoing pandemic. Stay safe, Rosena. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Perpetrators have been using a number of tactics, including snatching leads from dog owners’ hands, using dog whistles to attract dogs roaming off-lead, and impersonating RSPCA employees to gain access to dogs. One strategy involves approaching people walking their dogs and informing them that their dog resembles an animal that has been reported lost, before asking to scan the dog’s microchip in their van. Once near the van, dogs are being separated from their unsuspecting owners before driving away. The RSPCA reminds that their officers will always be wearing uniforms bearing the charity’s logo and will be carrying identification, and asks that any member of the public who believes someone is impersonating an officer report the incident to the RSPCA and to local police. Suspicious activity – including being approached with questions about your dog, asking for photographs to be taken of your dog – should also be reported. I have written to Inspector Barrie Capper, Head of Wandsworth Neighbourhood Policing Team, asking them to take action to protect our pets and tackle this awful crime. In the meantime, Blue Cross have provided a helpful list of actions you can take to help keep your dog safe.\nClick here for more information.

Although it wasn't the result we wanted, our fantastic team can hold their heads high in pride for their performances and spirit. A World Cup final following on from a European championship win last year is an incredible record and I am sure we will be right up there again in four years. My family were firmly glued to the sofa all tournament and many spirited debates were had about England's best player. My eldest and I were firmly Team Lauren James, while my youngest maintained throughout thaT Russo is our star. Either way, very well done once again to the Lionesses and congratulations must go to Spain too for a well-played final.\nCongratulations to all the students who have received their A level results – and to the teachers, staff and schools that have helped get them there.\nWhether our students are going on to university, apprenticeships, further training, or joining the workforce, they have all made us proud with their hard work, dedication and resilience. This year was particularly challenging. For many pupils, this was their first experience of exams in a formal sense, after GCSEs were suspended during the pandemic. Grade boundaries were also raised to return to 2019 levels. However, our students and schools excelled, with a number of Tooting schools exceeding the London average of 30% A*-A grades – itself a pass rate that is the highest in the country. London schools are still benefitting from the London Challenge investment of the last Labour government. Our Tooting students and our Tooting schools and staff are something to celebrate. We are so proud of you.\nPolice forces across England are set to stop attending many incidents concerning mental health under a new National Partnership Agreement: Right Care, Right Person.\nThe Government's announcement leaves far too many questions unanswered and fails to tackle the root problem of lengthy NHS waiting lists in mental health services. I have written to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, asking him to come clean on what action he is taking to tackle mental health waiting lists. Read my full letter here:\nOver recent weeks, I have been appalled at the Tory's unworkable, unethical plans to house asylum seekers on a barge in Dorset.\nThe Government failed to listen to well-founded concerns or even carry out basic checks of the water supply, which was contaminated with Legionella bacteria, putting both asylum-seekers and staff at-risk. The Tories have serious questions to answer about the safety of this project and should stop wasting taxpayer's money pursuing headlines and instead fix this broken asylum system.\nRecently, I have received many emails about the climate emergency and how a potential Labour government would respond to it. We are facing a climate crisis and urgent action needs to be taken to avoid it. UN reports have shown that existing policies are not doing enough to avert cataclysmic climate related events, and we are already seeing historic weather activities causing floods, wildfires and droughts around the world.\nA Labour government would put climate change at the heart of our agenda to help build a better Britain. Labour would deliver zero-carbon power by 2030, insulate 19 million homes and establish a National Wealth Fund to help create over a million jobs in green industry. Labour will make the UK a clean energy superpower to cut energy bills and improve national energy security. As an A&E doctor and mother, I am incredibly concerned about the impact of poor air quality in our local area. I see many people attending hospital with breathing difficulties directly linked to toxic air, which contributes to thousands of premature deaths every year. It is my belief that it is the right thing to do to adopt enforceable targets and bring in preventative measures to tackle air pollution. As such, I am supportive of the ULEZ expansion coming to Tooting.\nHowever, I also acknowledge its impact on people’s budgets. I called on Sadiq to expand the scrappage scheme support – which he delivered on without Government support despite money being provided for similar schemes in other cities. Furthermore, I am pleased that he has further expanded the scheme, and information about the scrappage scheme can be found here. Wandsworth Council have also announced support through the Wandsworth Sustainable Travel Fund, details of which can be found here. The expansion of ULEZ was also mandated by the Government as part of the TfL bailout deal during the height of the pandemic – so they wanted the expansion to go ahead as well. The current housing market is incredibly difficult to get into as a first-time buyer. In our local area especially, house and rent prices are daunting, and sadly the Tories are not doing enough to provide support for people or help increase the housing supply.\nLabour have set out an ambitious plan for housebuilding targets to help supply the need for housing and provide security to people and their families. This would include relaxing planning restrictions to let local authorities and examining green Belt areas that could be used to build on. I fully support Labour’s ambition to have 70% of people owning their own home. Many people have got in touch with me recently about the Government’s proposed ban on electric shock collars for dogs. As an animal lover myself, it is my firm belief that the UK should lead the world in animal welfare standards which would mean no animal would be made to endure unnecessary suffering.\nAll pets deserve the utmost protection, and I’m pleased that the legislation introduced has been approved by the House of Lords. However, I’m also pleased that there will be an exemption for those with protected characteristics who have a legitimate need to use collars that produce sounds, vibrations, and other non-shock signals. At the start of August I hosted GMB Southern in Parliament.\nUnions play such a crucial role in supporting workers and ensuring our workplaces maintain the highest standards for safety, pay and conditions. I really enjoyed talking to the staff about the work they do: representing individuals and groups, helping people through disputes, and pushing for legislative change that keeps the UK’s workplaces reflective of our values and aspirations. If you haven’t already: join a union – they are there for you. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_previous_37/content_738.html": "|\nWhen I first met Rosena, she was Labour’s candidate in the 2016 Tooting by-election.\nAs a by-election candidate myself in Heywood and Middleton in 2014, I know how difficult and uniquely pressured by-elections can be and I wanted to help Rosena win the seat after the amazing Sadiq Khan left to become London mayor. As soon as I met Rosena, I knew that Tooting would soon have another fantastic Labour MP. Her boundless energy and enthusiasm inspired her whole team. I also knew that Rosena wouldn’t be just a backbench MP but that she would bring her skills and experience to the parliamentary Labour party and she’s certainly done that in her role as shadow sports minister and with her background as a practising A&E doctor in our NHS. The choice of who to support in the deputy leadership contest has been a difficult one for me. I know all the candidates and they’re all people I am proud to call friends. But it’s Rosena who has most impressed me in this campaign and I think she has the qualities that we need in our new deputy leader. After the disastrous election result in December 2019, where I lost my seat to the Tories – the first time that they have ever taken Heywood & Middleton – Rosena was one of the first people to contact me, to commiserate but also to talk about what went wrong and how we rebuild from here. She came up to my constituency to talk with key activists about the campaign and we explored every aspect, from Brexit through to our manifesto and the Labour leadership. We talked about Heywood and Middleton being a 62% Leave voting constituency and how I had tried to represent the views of all my constituents in trying to get a deal that worked for 100%. Rosena understands the issues that we face here in the North and I know that she is going to be a great campaigning deputy leader who will reach out across the country to win back those lost Labour seats in the North, the Midlands, Scotland and Wales. I see the role of deputy leader as being a campaigner, an organiser, an advisor and also a critical friend. I think that Rosena is more than capable of doing this job, and doing it extremely well. I am wary of any offer of leader/deputy leader ‘dream tickets’ suggesting a cosy, already formed relationship. The deputy leader has to be able to stand back and assess situations critically and I know that Rosena has the independence and strength of character to do this. I know how hard Rosena has worked to become a qualified doctor, and she’s not only continued to work shifts at St George’s Hospital, keeping her grounded and in touch with our NHS but she’s also done great humanitarian work reaching out internationally. I’ll never forget her impassioned speech in parliament when she returned from the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh where she’d been providing medical care to people who have nothing – no citizenship, no home, in many cases no family and no prospect of their situation improving. Rosena has the strength, knowledge, intelligence and empathy needed to unite our party and also to take our message out to the wider public. And whoever becomes leader, she will be a unique complement to them. I’m proud to call Rosena a friend, and I’m proud to support her to be the next deputy leader of the Labour Party. Rosena Allin-Khan kicks off Labour deputy leader campaign in Putney with ‘fire in her belly’\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan launched her deputy Labour leadership campaign in Putney last night. The campaign, held in the ballroom of the Star & Garter pub, brought together an eclectic crowd, including some young first-time voters. Tooting MP Dr Allin-Khan, who is running with the slogan ‘Taking Labour Forward’, is a qualified A&E front-line doctor and has provided humanitarian aid to refugees in Syria. Describing her determination to be the next deputy leader, she said: “Expertise in building trust in communities and shared life experience has put fire in my belly to achieve for others.” She set out her ‘internationalist’ vision of Britain’s future after Brexit and brought attention to the importance of social care reform, the significance of a grassroots revival and updating technology within the Labour Party. Labour’s Putney MP Fleur Anderson said that Dr Allin-Khan would be a ‘campaigner-in-chief’ and not a ‘leader-in-waiting’ if elected as deputy leader in a PoliticsHome article last week. The Musician’s Union has given their endorsement to Dr Allin-Khan and to Sir Keir Starmer for leader. Voting takes place from February 24 to April 2 and results will be announced on the April 4. Labour needs to become a party of progressive internationalism once againLast Tuesday, a boat capsized and sank in the Bay of Bengal. There were 138 Rohingya refugees crammed on the boat, fleeing from camps in Bangladesh. At least 15 bodies were found, including four children, with 50 more missing.\nI’ve been campaigning for the rights of the Rohingya since the recent crisis unfolded in 2017. I’ve been involved in humanitarian matters long before entering politics and standing to be Labour deputy leader. Stories such as those of the Rohingya do not often have a light shined upon them here in the UK. They happen far away and it feels as if they’re outside of our control. The UK has a proud history of humanitarian assistance and we must ensure that this continues. We must never allow ourselves to turn a blind eye. Every single human life has equal value, no matter where that person was born, what language they speak or what they look like. Humanity has no borders. This isn’t just something I believe in principle — I act on it. My work as a humanitarian doctor has taken me to the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, where grieving mothers told me accounts of their babies being ripped from their arms and murdered before their eyes. The guilt of coming home to my own three- and five-year-olds left me unable to sleep at night. Why should their lives be of more value to the world than those of the Rohingya children who are slaughtered without a dignified burial? I have seen how human life is not valued equally around the world. It lit a fire in my belly to continue fighting such injustice, no matter where it takes place. At the very heart of my Labour principles is internationalism. I believe this spirit of internationalism must drive everything we do as a party. We must always stand in unwavering opposition to any effort to restrict freedoms, whether here or globally. We’ve seen where this mentality leads — whether it is the tragedy of Windrush, the cruelty of detention centres like Yarl’s Wood, or the inhumanity of a government that votes against protection for vulnerable child refugees. Now is the time for all of us who believe in progressive, internationalist values to fight back. It is our duty to ensure that the Rohingya and other victims are not forgotten by the world. One of the reasons I decided to stand to become the next deputy leader of Labour is because I believe our party has a unique chance to become a global beacon of internationalism, as it has been before. We have arguably the largest grassroots membership of any political party in Europe. If we are able to unite behind a truly internationalist vision for our party and our country, we could be a force for change on a global scale. We have a wonderful society, which has welcomed so many people from across the world, but this government’s hostile environment is diminishing hope — hope for a brighter future, hope for a tolerant society. I first entered politics in order to shed light on humanitarian efforts around the world and give a voice to the voiceless. I still believe we can, and I want to help rebuild the Labour Party so that it becomes a powerful force for good. As a party we need to rebuild trust with our communities, with the British people and the international community. Let’s do this together. Rosena Allin-Khan is Labour MP for Tooting and candidate for the deputy leadership The Musicians’ Union has nominated Keir Starmer to be the next leader of the Labour Party, and Rosena Allin-Khan to be the next deputy.\nThe party-affiliated organisation has become the fourth trade union to back Starmer, and the first to back Allin-Khan. In 2015, the union nominated Andy Burnham for leader and Caroline Flint for deputy, and in 2016 it backed leadership challenger Owen Smith. Commenting on their nomination on Twitter, the Musicians’ Union said Starmer had been “a strong supporter of musicians”. “He understands the challenges musicians working in the EU are facing and what we need to do to meet them”. The organisation also revealed in a tweet that Allin-Khan was a “former Musicians’ Union member” and said they were “proud to see her rise so far” and “to support her as she continues fighting for young people to have a free musical education.” Starmer has already secured his place on the final ballot through both the support of affiliates, including large trade union UNISON, and the backing of local Labour parties. To reach the ballot paper, each candidate must be nominated by 5% of local parties or three affiliates, two of which must be trade unions, amounting to more than 5% of the total affiliate membership. Starmer has been nominated by a total of 159 constituency parties so far, as well as UNISON, Usdaw, SERA, Community, Labour Movement for Europe, Labour Business and the Socialist Health Association. Allin-Khan has yet to secure a place on the final ballot, having so far only secured the support of 17 CLPs and the Labour Campaign for International Development. Rosena Allin-Khan is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in5/2/2020\nFleur Anderson MP: As Deputy Leader, Rosena Allin-Khan would be a campaigner-in-chief, not a leader-in-waitingRosena Allin-Khan is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in, writes Putney's new MP, Fleur Anderson.\nThe night of the General Election result was a deeply distressing moment for all of us who love the Labour Party and who love our country. It was an horrific experience to watch the door close on a whole generation as the Tories won a huge majority to continue their destructive and damaging agenda. But I was also hugely proud and honoured to produce the only Labour gain of the night, as I became the new MP for Putney. It was, I hope, a rare bright light in an otherwise long, dark night for all those Labour activists, members and volunteers who worked tirelessly during the election. Rosena’s help and support was vital to that win. She is my friend and colleague, as we were councillors together and she is the MP for the neighbouring constituency of Tooting. It’s sometimes forgotten how difficult it can be for prospective parliamentary candidates, especially ones who’ve never stood to be an MP before. Of course, it’s a huge honour to be given the chance to represent your local community, and to make their voices heard in the corridors of power – but you also have to put your life on hold for months, spending hardly any time with your friends and family, working and campaigning relentlessly, whatever the weather, rain or shine. And at the end of it all, there’s absolutely no guarantee you’ll get the job, especially in a marginal seat like Putney. It’s incredibly rewarding, but it’s hard work too. Rosena was there for me every step of the way, helping me, guiding me, giving me advice and encouragement and very practical support too. I cannot thank her enough. She is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in, and every single voter who meets her comes away with a positive impression and a smile on their face. I should know - we stood to be Councillors together in the same ward in 2014 - fighting a seat that had been Tory for 24 years - and we won, through sheer hard work and positive conversations. Rosena is a relentless optimist – she always finds the positives in every situation and she never gives up, no matter what. Her life-story is a true demonstration of our Labour values – she comes from an impoverished background, failed her A-levels first time around but persevered, and because of reforms introduced by a Labour government, she was able to study at Cambridge and become a doctor before becoming an MP - it shows the difference a Labour Government can make to the lives of people across our country. Rosena is now running to become the next Deputy Leader of Labour. There’s no doubt she’s the underdog in the race, but that’s never stopped her before, and I know it won’t stop her now. She would be a phenomenal Deputy Leader of our Party, and that’s why she’s got my total support. She’s got the most interesting and substantive ideas of any of the candidates, and she’s already published a fantastic Grassroots Revival manifesto of how the Labour Party can improve our campaigning practices to get back to winning ways ahead of the local elections in May. As Deputy Leader, she would be a campaigner-in-chief, not a leader-in-waiting. In Putney, I saw the real difference she made with her energy, her optimism and her campaigning skill. Thanks to Rosena’s help, we turned blue seats into red ones, and if she’s elected as the next Deputy Leader, we can start doing that across the whole country - at both a local and a national level. Let’s take Labour forward. Fleur Anderson is Labour MP for Putney. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan: As a doctor and as a daughter I know social care is broken.\nThe deputy leadership candidate has spoken about the horror of finding her dad - who has dementia- injured and not knowing what happened. She wants to make sure no other family has to suffer that way. Nothing prepares you for finding your loved one bruised and blooded. Nothing prepares you for never finding answers. This is the reality that every day, so many people are living through, across the UK, because of the nature of the social care system. Nothing prepared me for being one of the statistics. My father has fronto-temporal dementia – he cannot communicate his thoughts but he is fully aware of what is happening. My brother and I found him bloodied and bruised on more than one occasion, we have sought answers but we know that we will never find them. He is safe now, but his health has deteriorated massively and has affected his life expectancy. This is not just my reality. This is the reality for so many others across the country. I am lucky. I was able to call a debate last year and get The Mirror to cover my family’s journey. Most people don’t have that luxury. Instead, they’re left fighting the social care system. I’ve been on both sides. As an aggrieved family member and a local politician with a responsibility for social care, I’ve seen the strife that goes into placements on both sides. The system is failing our most vulnerable residents. As it stands, the social care system is not fit for purpose. The Tories promised in their manifesto that they would tackle social care. It’s been three years – and yet still no Green Paper, despite countless promises. Last week, in Parliament, I asked the Health Secretary how many more families will suffer before the Government looks to reform the social care system. There was no answer. As an A&E doctor, who regularly sees vulnerable older people stranded in hospital because they don’t have access to adequate social care, and as a daughter, who’s had to go through this process, I have the following recommendations: - A truly independent complaints process – formal complaints should not have to go through the care provider or local authority who the complaint is against. - A reformed process for awarding care contracts – to ensure that failing companies cannot simply change their name and continue providing inadequate care. - An Independent Advocate for Older People – to protect and promote the rights of older people. - Mandatory CCTV with an opt-out – CCTV in communal areas within care homes should be mandatory to provide evidence of any unacceptable behaviour in a care setting. - A fully funded social care system, integrated into our NHS, with a ban on outsourcing to private companies. Increased funding alone won’t solve the problems being faced by our most vulnerable – only enacting the above changes will. At some point in our lives, we all have an experience with the social care system – as a daughter, I know how difficult it is when this system fails you. As Labour Deputy Leader, I would continue putting pressure on this Tory Government and their poor record on social care. As a society, we must protect our most vulnerable – sadly, nothing prepares you for confronting the worst. As your Deputy Leader, I would work with the Leader of the Labour Party to put the NHS and social care front and centre of our policy going forward. We need to protect our most vulnerable. We need a Labour Government. Labour Campaign for International Development endorses Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan for Deputy Leader30/1/2020\nI am hugely proud and honoured to be nominated for Deputy Leader by the Labour Campaign for International Development.\nAs someone who has worked as an humanitarian doctor in conflict zones across the world, their progressive approach to international development and promotion of global justice is an inspiration. My priority will always be to put human rights and international solidarity at the core of everything I do. Human life should have equal value, no matter where someone comes from. These principles shouldn't just apply to our international development policies, they should be applied to everything we do as the Labour Party. I want to thank the Labour Campaign for International Development for their support and their endorsement. Let's take Labour forward, together. Thank you Doctor Rosena Brexit Might Be Done But The Fight Against Boris Johnson's Destruction Must ContinueAlthough the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback.\nWhen the UK leaves the EU this Friday, 31 January 2020, after 47 years of membership, it will be a sombre day for many of us. For others, it will be a day of celebration. For most people, I suspect they will simply hope we can now move on from talking about Brexit at the expense of everything else. As someone who campaigned with all my heart to stay in the EU, and as the first person on Labour’s front bench to publicly call for a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal, I am desperately sad to see us leaving our friends and allies in Europe. But we are leaving. The disastrous result of the General Election has settled that. This is no longer an argument about Leave or Remain, it’s about what kind of future we want for our country and for our children. That’s where the new fight begins. Boris Johnson wants to pretend he’s now “Got Brexit Done”, and we no longer need to worry about the details. He wants us to simply trust him to sort it all out. Well, I don’t trust him. Neither should you. He talks about “Global Britain” whilst turning his back on vulnerable child refugees. He talks about “Taking Back Control” while reducing parliament’s ability to scrutinise his decisions. He talks about attracting “Global Talent” to the UK while creating huge distress and uncertainty for EU citizens, many of whom have been here for years and who have made their lives in this country. The fight for our internationalist values starts now. It will be long, and it will be difficult, because Boris Johnson has a large majority – but that’s why it’s so important. When it feels like hope is lost, that’s when those of us who believe in progressive values and internationalism need to stand up and fight. If we don’t, no-one else is going to do it for us. We need to stand up and fight for our hard-won workers’ rights. We need to stand up and fight for our environmental protections. Most importantly, we need to stand up and fight for the rights of EU citizens living in this country. They are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues, our family. I work side-by-side with many of them in the NHS, when I work shifts as a doctor in my local A&E department. Under the draconian new immigration laws being bandied around by this government, my own Polish mother might not have been able to move to this country and make a life for herself. Although the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback. That’s one of the main reasons I am running to become the next Deputy Leader. We have huge organisational strength through our membership, through our links with the trade unions and through our MPs and councillors embedded in their local communities. Now is the time to deploy those strengths to maximum effect, to hold the Government to account and ensure that we fight back against every attempt to undercut our rights and freedoms at work, every attempt to weaken our environmental safeguards, every attempt to inject privatisation into our National Health Service. The slogan “Get Brexit Done” might have helped win the election for Boris Johnson, but for those of us who stand against his destructive vision for the future of our country, this fight isn’t done. It’s just getting started. My responses to the questions provided by the Labour Campaign for Free Movement 1. Defend and extend free movement: opposing any reduction in the freedoms of UK and EU citizens to live, work, and access social security in each others’ countries, and any immigration system based on incomes, migrants’ utility to business, and number caps or targets.I am the very embodiment of the benefits free movement has brought – my mother is Polish and was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Under the draconian new immigration policies being discussed by this Tory government, she might never have been able to do that. Protecting and extending free movement is at the very heart of my internationalist Labour principles. I believe our country is stronger and better because of free movement. When I work shifts as an A&E doctor in my local hospital, I work with NHS staff from across Europe and it breaks my heart to see many of them feeling unwanted or undervalued because of Brexit. As Deputy Leader, I pledge to do everything in my power to promote the core Labour values of internationalism and solidarity across borders, because I believe human life has the same value no matter where someone comes from. That means defending and extending free movement, and it means fighting to protect the human rights of migrants from this hostile Tory government. 2. Close every detention centreHolding migrants in detention centres, often in substandard conditions, is incredibly cruel and degrading. These are often vulnerable people, fleeing from a variety of horrific circumstances such as war, trafficking and poverty. They have the right to be treated with dignity, as human beings, as we would want ourselves or our family to be treated in such horrendous circumstances. When working abroad as a humanitarian doctor, I’ve seen first-hand some of the terrible conditions people are forced to endure in detention centres and it horrified me. We must fight back against the hostile environment the Tories have created for migrants – the Labour Party has always stood for international solidarity and openness to the world – we need a Labour government to bring those principles back into the core of our approach to immigration. I would want to listen to expert opinion on how to do this in a responsible way, but I certainly would want to close as many detention centres as possible and make sure we have an overall approach to immigration that means a concept as cruel as detention centres are not required in the first place. 3. Unconditional rights to family reunionYes, I fully support this. The unconditional right to family reunion is a fundamental element of treating migrants as human beings with dignity and equal value, rather than the Tory approach of seeing migrants as a problem to be managed. When I’ve worked as a humanitarian doctor in conflict zones across the world, it was always horrendous to see so many families ripped apart or prevented from seeing each other again. When I visited Palestine on a humanitarian mission, I saw sick children alone in hospital because the permit system meant their parents weren’t allowed to visit them. I immediately began working on ways to resolve this. It’s not enough to just talk about this – we need to be working every day to deliver a Labour government so we can fix these kinds of injustices. That’s what I’d do as Deputy Leader. 4. End “no recourse to public funds” policiesI support ending such policies, yes. This is another case of a Tory government treating migrants not as human beings with human dignity and equal value, but instead as a problem to be managed through cruelty. I want to deliver a Labour government with internationalism at its core, which would allow us to change our entire approach to migration, and begin seeing human life as equally valuable and equally dignified no matter where that person was born or where they’ve come from. 5. Oppose all Hostile Environment measures, use of landlords and public service providers as border guards, and restrictions on migrants’ NHS accessThe Tory Hostile Environment approach to immigration is a stain on the soul of their party, and they should be ashamed of it. Tragedies such as the Windrush scandal are a horrendous demonstration of where this approach leads, and I worry a similar scandal could occur with EU citizens who’ve made their lives in this country. I want a Labour government so we can end the Hostile Environment immediately and start treating migrants with the human dignity and respect they deserve. 6. Equal voting rights for all UK residents I am certainly interested in all ideas for how to revitalise our democracy and increase the level of engagement with our political process. Indeed, prior to the General Election in 2019, I publicly called for EU citizens to get the right to vote. Our Labour values of openness and internationalism must be at the core of everything we do. 7. Please share your thoughts on these wider issues that our supporters also feel strongly about:Even after Brexit, the UK government looks set to participate in Frontex (the European border agency) and its “Fortress Europe” policies. Will you challenge these policies? I certainly think the EU has often failed dismally to strike the right balance between border security and solidarity with people fleeing from war, poverty and the effects of global climate change. I am a proud pro-European, but that doesn’t mean my view of the EU is uncritical and I’ve never been afraid to say so. My values of international solidarity and openness don’t stop at the borders of Europe – they extend across the whole world. Human life always has equal value, no matter where that person comes from. Will you support an amnesty for undocumented migrants resident in the UK? We should always treat people with compassion and dignity, and we must place those values at the heart of everything we do when it comes to immigration. People in this country without documentation are often asylum seekers fleeing from horrific conditions and I want to see them treated with the human dignity they deserve. I would want to listen in more detail to expert opinion and feedback on the specific question of whether an amnesty is the right approach, but the principles of human dignity and compassion must always guide everything we do. Anything else you’d like Labour members, supporters and affiliates to know about what your leadership/deputy leadership would mean for migrants and migration policy? I am the living, breathing proof that free movement is a wonderful benefit to our country. My Polish mother was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Working on the frontlines of the NHS as an A&E doctor, I work alongside colleagues from across Europe and the rest of the world, and they are a credit to our country. It makes me proud to be British. But years of Tory government has created a literal Hostile Environment for migrants in this country. The drawbridge is being pulled up, and the rights of a whole generation of people to travel freely and live, love and work across Europe is being taken away. That is a tragedy, but it also means those of us who are proud of our outward-looking, progressive, internationalist values must fight even harder to protect and extend them. The fight starts now, and as your Deputy Leader (or even if I’m not!), I promise I will always be there fighting alongside you for those values with everything I’ve got. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

We’re all touched by the NHS at some point in our lives. For over 70 years it has been our lifeline, the glue holding our society together, often forgotten about, but there in our times of greatest need. The NHS is there to bring life, to offer care and dignity when we leave the world, and to support our loved ones when tragedy hits. But front-line workers in the NHS have felt ignored and that the Government does not recognise the day-to-day pressures they face. It didn’t start with claims on the side of a bus during the European referendum campaign in 2016 but, since then, using the NHS for political gain certainly picked up pace. Throughout the election, Boris Johnson repeatedly denied that the NHS would be up for sale. Just two weeks after the election, it was revealed that NHS cancer care and children’s treatments are up for grabs in a stealth Tory sell-off. Cardiology, gynaecology, paediatrics and oncology are among the services being offered to companies. As an A&E doctor, when someone is rushed into A&E having a heart attack, we work to patch someone up before sending them off to heart specialists. How will it feel knowing that those services are now being provided by a private company? Where is the trust? Allowing hospital trusts to outsource treatment to private companies could lead to a postcode lottery of health care, further widening the health divide. We need to be bringing the UK together, not tearing it apart, turning communities against each other. On top of this, discussions are taking place with tech giants on how to make money from patient data. While we must do everything possible to look for cures and ensure a better patient journey, we need to know how our own data is being used. The last decade has shown us that we must exercise caution with tech giants. The Government does not have the money or expertise needed to create an anonymised patient database, which is exactly why Amazon and Microsoft have been approached. Trust in our NHS cannot be destroyed because without trust, everything else could be up for grabs. I was stunned and heartbroken after the election result and bereft at what it would mean for our NHS. Our hospitals, treatments and dedicated staff cannot simply be sold off to the highest bidder. These aren’t the principles our NHS was founded and built on and I will continue fighting, standing side by side with our hospital workers, to protect our NHS from those who wish to destroy it.

The Scheme helps schools install heat pumps, solar panels and other technologies to assist with schools hitting environmental targets.\nSustainability and green initiatives are absolutely vital in tackling climate change, and I am very pleased that local schools have been selected to help lead the way. With the ceasefire in Gaza in tatters, the devastation and human suffering there will only continue. In Parliament, I pushed the Foreign Secretary, David Lammy MP, to confirm whether his department holds any evidence that international law has been violated. I joined Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper MP at St George's Hospital to see the impact of their new knife amnesty bin.\nSince December, 47 weapons have already been handed in. It is great to see so many dangerous weapons being taken off our streets. Over the past months, I have heard from many local people who have been experiencing shocking delays to their post. Today, I went down to the local sorting office to meet with Royal Mail directors and pushed them to urgently rectify this issue. I am pleased to say that they have agreed to turn it around in 4 weeks. If you've been affected, please share your experience here: http://drrosena.co.uk/postdelays During these troubling times, we have never needed our EU friends and allies more.\nTogether, we can face down the threat of Putin and stand united to protect democracy. This week, I was in Brussels meeting MEPs to learn how we can work together in our shared defence interests. Today marks the fifth anniversary of the World Health Organisation declaring COVID-19 a pandemic. Our lives would change monumentally in the weeks and months that followed and, sadly, many of us would lose loved ones. Now is the time to remember all who lost their lives and celebrate the NHS heroes who did everything they could. The Environment Agency has provided another update following the weekend's work on the River Wandle to clean up last week's oil spill.\nI am pleased to hear that the majority of the pollution appears to have been cleared. The specialist contractors managing the clean-up report that the river is looking much better today, with very little visible oil sheen remaining and no further oil being washed from vegetation along the riverbanks. The Environment Agency tells me that, due to the swift response of multiple agencies, including the emergency services, local authorities, and charities, the impact on the environment around the Wandle appears to be minimal. Thankfully, the number of affected wildlife remains low. The few wild birds that have been impacted are being cared for by the RSPCA. No fish mortalities have been reported, and the fish populations in the Wandle appear to remain healthy. Investigations into this incident are ongoing, and options for enforcement are being considered by the Environment Agency and its partners. People are still urged to be cautious and keep pets away from the water and angling is not recommended for the time being. If you see any further signs of diesel around the Wandle, please contact the Environment Agency on its 24/7 incident number: 0800 807060 or via email at [email protected]. The Environment Agency continue to keep me updated about the recent oil spill into the River Wandle. The Environment Agency, along with emergency services, Thames Water, the RSPB, and local authorities, are actively working on containment and clean-up efforts.\nKey Points:\nMy office will continue to monitor the situation and I will provide any updates as they come in. Yesterday, I became aware that an incident had occurred on the River Wandle where diesel oil had spilled from a bus depot in Thornton Heath into the river.\nThe Wandle is a vital ecosystem, and is home to a range of wildbirds, fish, frogs and toads. It is critical to protect this pocket of wildlife and to ensure the progress made in bringing the river back to life is not allowed to slide backwards. I have been in contact with the Environment Agency who tell me that they are working to assess the impact of the oil on water quality and wildlife along the course of the river, as well as putting in place plans to extract the oil from the river. This remedial work will continue over the coming days. The Environment Agency advises local residents to report any oil spotted in the river to the Environment Agency's emergency hotline by phone 0800 807060 or email [email protected] Today, in Parliament, I launched the All Party Parliamentary Group on Emergency Care. As a doctor at the A&E in St George's, I know my colleagues up and down the country work tirelessly to provide the highest standards of care for their patients in some of the most difficult of circumstances.\nOur group of Parliamentarians is committed to fighting to improve emergency care at every level. We will be hearing from experts, publishing reports and making sure that the importance of emergency care is highlighted in Government policy. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

It was great to have the opportunity to speak with their incredible team of staff and volunteers, as well as meet local residents receiving their coronavirus vaccines. In partnership with NHS England, to date Pearl Chemist have administered over 30,000 doses of the vaccines. This is an incredible achievement and a real credit to our community. For local residents aged 40+ who have not yet had their first vaccination, the AstraZeneca vaccine is available at the Pearl Chemist clinic on Mitcham Road. You can also receive your second dose (eight weeks after your first dose) if you are in cohorts 1-9. Simply bring along your card! All other age groups can book their doses via the NHS website here. As a reminder, before you receive your vaccine, it is important to have eaten and be hydrated. With coronavirus cases in Wandsworth rising, it has never been more important to ensure you are fully vaccinated as soon as possible. By getting vaccinated, you are not only protecting yourself, but your community too. Last week, along with Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney, I was fortunate to visit Heathmere School - a local primary supported by the fantastic mental health charity, Place2Be. It was a wonderful opportunity to hear how Heathmere is promoting positive mental wellbeing for pupils, as well as learn more about the range of support Place2Be provides for schools across Wandsworth and the rest of the UK. During the visit, we heard first-hand from pupils who have benefitted from Heathmere’s whole school approach to mental health and Place2Be’s support. In addition, we were able to meet with Heathmere’s Headteacher, Emma Lewis, Place2Be’s Area Manager for South West London, Khalad Musse, and Place2Be’s Chief Executive Catherine Roche to discuss children’s mental health. It is so important that we shine a spotlight on the incredible work organisations, such as Place2Be, are doing to support children and young people. As we move beyond the pandemic, it is vital that we dedicate our care and attention to listening to young people to understand how we can best support them. Local favourite Mixed Blessings - our very own West Indian bakery on Mitcham Road - will soon be blessed with its very own blue plaque! The plaque will mark and celebrate TMC Studios (Tooting Music Centre), the recording studio that was once based above the bakery and frequented by glam rockers and reggae artists - local legend has it that Bob Marley scrawled his signature on a wall. It is so important that we shine a spotlight on Tooting’s rich musical roots and diverse cultural heritage. I will certainly be there later this summer when the plaque is revealed to share the love. A number of dogs have been reportedly infected with canine parvovirus on Tooting Common in recent times. Dog owners may be well aware that parvovirus is a highly infectious condition spread through contaminated faeces of affected dogs, and it can remain active in the environment for up to nine months. The virus causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea, leading to a dog or puppy becoming very weak and dehydrated. Sadly, many little pups do not recover. Thankfully, there are a number of steps that dog owners can take to protect their furry friends: Prevent your dog from meeting with other dogs to stop the spread of infection Ensure your dog’s vaccinations are up-to-date Notify your vet immediately if your dog displays any worrying symptoms. Click here to learn more about canine parvovirus. Good news - the Food Bus is coming to Tooting! The Food Bus – a converted bus stocked with affordable, healthy food – aims to improve Wandsworth residents’ access to fresh produce, while reducing the burden on household budgets. Much of its stock is obtained from retailers’ surpluses, and an ordinary shopping basket of goods will be available at a fraction of the normal price. The bus also features an on-board café. Head on down to All Saints Church on Brudenell Road on Thursday 10 June between 10:30am to 2:30pm to experience this wonderful initiative for yourself. Effective from Monday June 7th, St George’s new visiting policy will allow one visitor per patient for the first time since the pandemic began. Every patient will now be allowed to have one visitor for one hour – at a pre-arranged time – between 1pm and 6pm each day. This applies on weekdays and weekends. Visitors should ideally be someone from the same household or support bubble. Where this is not possible, St George’s ask that the visitor be a close family member or friend. Each ward has implemented an appointment booking system to record visitors names and contact details. Appointments can be made by calling the ward clerk on shift between 8am and 4pm, Monday to Friday. To find out the contact details for each ward, please see here. Tooting Bec Athletics Track needs to be resurfaced.\nThe track surface – which is already 35 years old – failed a track inspection last summer, meaning that it can no longer be used for competitions. Athletes are permitted to train at the facility until the end of 2021. However, the future of the track beyond this time is yet to be secured. The track is much-loved and well utilised by a collective of local residents as diverse as Tooting itself. The Herne Hill Harriers have called the track home since the 1930’s. Their membership is comprised of people of all ages and backgrounds, including elite and Olympic athletes, while countless schools and community groups also make use of the facility. I am calling on Wandsworth Council to commit to funding the resurfacing of this vital community asset without further delay. Click here to add your name to a petition to the Council to refurbish the track. Continue to check back here, and on my Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for further updates. Today marks the beginning of Pride, a month where we celebrate our wonderful and diverse LGBT+ community. Pride is a time for joy, laughter and love. It is also a time to reaffirm our allyship with the LGBT+ communities. Unfortunately, the struggle for equality is not over. To this end, it is vital that the true meaning of Pride doesn’t get lost with corporations wanting to get involved with the ‘fun’. Indeed, we must remember all those who have and continue to suffer attacks on their basic human freedoms that so many of us simply take for granted. I am so proud to be an ally. But we must not rest until everyone feels comfortable to be open about who they are without fear, stigma or judgement. A big congratulations to our local football team Tooting and Mitcham FC, who beat AFC Wimbledon to win the London Senior Cup. On a hot and sunny bank holiday Monday, goals by Jake Rose and Dontai Stewart led to a 2-1 win against a strong Wimbledon side. It was also a great performance from Billy Brown, Ahkeem Belford, Daniel Williams and goalkeeper Gary Ross. As Adam Best wrote in his post-match commentary, “Jake Rose, as we’ve come to expect, finished it like James Bond dispatching a foe; calmly, suavely - a tailored assassin in his craft.” This was undoubtedly a time of celebration, as could be heard from pub gardens across Tooting and Mitcham! Tooting and Mitcham FC continue to be an inspiration to young players in the local community and a source of much needed celebration at this time. Since the outset of the pandemic, we have lost close to 500 Wandsworth residents to the virus (ONS). That’s 500 families grieving a lost one, 500 people with their own stories to tell, and a community collectively grieving those no longer with us. To remember those who died, I recently visited the National Covid Memorial Wall outside St Thomas’s Hospital, stretching across the south bank of the River Thames. The National Covid Memorial Wall was set up by the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, who I had the pleasure of meeting with in November last year. Hearing the evidence confirming what we knew and feared, of how severe failures caused countless avoidable deaths, results in a devastating combination of anger and heartbreak. All those bereaved are in my thoughts and will continue to be as we build back from this pandemic. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Before deciding how to vote, I have carefully considered the provisions of the legislation, taken into account the views of those in Tooting, as well as discussing this at length with experts.\nThere are deeply felt personal, spiritual, philosophical and moral opinions held by individuals on both sides of this debate. Death is always a difficult subject. Our own death and the loss of those we love is a sad fact of life that each and every one of us will deal with at some point. As a doctor, death is something that my colleagues and I must confront every day. As a daughter, the death of my father from a terminal illness was a very eye-opening and traumatic experience, one which I’d wish on no-one. After much thought, reflection and engagement with the community I represent, I have decided to vote against the Bill at its Second Reading. The concerns I hold with the current proposals are multifaceted. I have spoken to key organisations and charities who have detailed their concerns that this legislation will have a disproportionate impact on disabled and BAME individuals. I am further worried that the current legislation does not go far enough to eliminate risks of coercion. Currently neither of the two doctors that would sign off on the process need to know the patient or their family. Nor are they mandated to seek a specialist clinical assessment. It is also important to me that we ensure people considering ending their own lives have access to good quality, well-resourced end-of-life care. This is currently not the reality for much of the country owing to a lack of resources. As such, moving forward, I will continue to advocate for improvements to palliative care, which can empower many individuals at the end of their lives, to enjoy their last moments with loved ones in as much comfort as possible and with peace of mind. There is no doubt that my colleagues have decided their vote, regardless of which side, with the very best of intentions. It is right that this Bill is being considered under a free vote, where every MP can vote with their conscience, and I am pleased that this has been a largely respectful, measured debate. I would like to thank everyone who has contacted me regarding this deeply personal issue - I have really listened. If the legislation passes today, there will remain opportunities to amend the Bill. I will look at any potential changes to the legislation closely. While I cannot support the Bill at this stage, this debate was needed and the issue is very important to the public. Regardless of the outcome of the vote, I hope we can all continue to be as respectful and understanding towards one another as possible.\nToday marks one year since the horrific Hamas terrorist attacks of 7th October. We must remember those killed, demand the release of remaining hostages and push for a lasting ceasefire.\nThe murder and destruction that has followed in Gaza and beyond, is morally reprehensible and sickening. Hundreds of thousands of civilians in Gaza have been forcibly displaced and countless murdered. As evidence of crimes against humanity mounts, we must suspend all arms sales to Israel and hold those responsible to account. Following the fire at the waste centre on Weir Road, I have written to the Commissioner of the London Fire Brigade, the Chief Executive of the Environment Agency, as well as the Chief Executives of Merton and Wandsworth Councils to voice the concerns of local residents who were affected.\nThis letter can be found below: Today, my team has been out in the area affected by the recycling plant fire, knocking on doors and speaking to local residents. We have also been to visit the site of the fire and met with the Fire Brigade Commander who is leading at the scene.\nFurther, our team has met with Council Officers who have been proactively taking measurements of the air quality at local schools and on streets affected by smoke. Remember, keep your doors and windows closed. I would advise staying indoors. Local people will be aware that the fire at the Recycling plant on Weir Road is continuing to produce high volumes of smoke in the area. I have spoken to London Fire Brigade who has assured me that the fire remains in control and efforts are continuing to dampen out the remnants of the fire.\nI know many people will be concerned with the effects of the smoke on the air quality in the surrounding area. I am proactively engaging with Wandsworth Council to ensure steps are being taken to monitor the air quality. I understand that current advice is to keep doors and windows closed. I understand that a fire broke out at the Recycling Plant on Weir Road, just inside Merton yesterday evening. The Fire Brigade states that the fire is now under control, but efforts are now being taken to begin dampening out the fire.\nRest assured, I will continue to maintain contact with the Fire Brigade and monitor any developments closely. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_rail/content_124.html": "|\nFollowing my letter to Network Rail regarding step-free access at Wandsworth Common Station, I was very pleased to receive confirmation that the station will be nominated for funding in the next round of the \"Access for All\" programme.\nThis programme has funded step-free access and other accessibility measures in stations across the country, including just down the line at Balham. This is a very encouraging first step in ensuring that public transport is available and convenient for everyone in the local community. Today, I have written to the Managing Director of the Southern Region of Network Rail calling for an investigation looking into improving accessibility and step-free access at Wandsworth Common Station.\nCurrently, there is step free access on Platform 1, but those wishing to travel on Platform 2 must cross an elevated footbridge, which is not accessible for wheelchair users, parents with young children, and the elderly. I have called for a feasibility study to be conducted, given the signifcant proportion of the local community that falls around the station. Read my full letter here: After cutting services through Earlsfield station for commuters since the pandemic, South Western Railway have announced that no services will run through Earlsfield from 19 December until 2 January, ostensibly due to industrial action. SWR is keeping 28 stations open in London through this period, of which 21 have lower passenger usage than Earlsfield. Only big hubs, such as Clapham Junction, Wimbledon and Waterloo, have higher passenger numbers than Earlsfield - this is simply not good enough! Add your name to my open letter calling for an immediate reconsideration of the decision not to run services through Earlsfield and a full explanation of why this decision was taken in the first place. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Trains in the morning evening peaks, to and from Central London, have all seen a worsening of their \"on-time percentage\" in the last six months compared to the same period of 2023. The full breakdown of delays at each station is below. It is shocking to see that, not only are trains late at some stations late half the time, but that there has been a steady decline from an already-unacceptable level of lateness last year. Particularly concerning are the figures at Tooting station, where over half of services were late despite there being only two services per hour on that line.\nSome of the worst performing services include: 8:05 from Balham (8:07 from Wandsworth Common) to Victoria - 88% late (Southern) 18:12 from Waterloo to Earlsfield - 81% late (South Western) 8:21 from Balham to Victoria - 79% late (Southern) 8:40 from Balham (8:42 from Wandsworth Common) to Victoria - 76% late (Southern) 8:13 from Tooting to London Blackfriars - 70% late (Thameslink) Local commuters deserve better than the shoddy service they are currently receiving from Southern, South Western and Thameslink. I look forward to the Government's plans to bring our local rail services back into public control, so that our trains are always run with the interests of the people who use them at heart. Eight years ago today, I was selected as the Tooting Labour candidate for the by-election caused by Sadiq becoming a candidate for Mayor of London.\nIt has been a huge honour and privilege to serve as the representative for the community in which I was born and raised. My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has supported me on this incredible journey.\nThis morning, I invited residents from Tooting to share a cup of tea and a biscuit at my local coffee morning. As the local MP, I am here to help and my door is always open.\nEvery corner of Wandsworth thrives with culture and creativity.

It's amazing that all catering is now in-house, with chefs cooking food that has been grown by the students themselves. The children were so enthusiastic about their freshly cooked and nutritious lunches. I believe that the work we’re doing with Chefs in Schools will go a long way to promote positive attitudes and relationships with food and mealtimes for our young people. It was great to be able to support!\nI arrived back home safely from Ukraine yesterday. I went on a humanitarian mission with MedGlobalOrg, who are helping support hospitals to prepare for the darkest days of this conflict. We worked with the most amazing people and met patients with the most heart-breaking stories. I was honoured to be able to help Ukrainian victims in the midst of the heart breaking turmoil they are experiencing. Let’s do all that we can to help support Ukraine. This week, we celebrated our fantastic women business owners in Tooting. Over the last two years, many women have felt a disproportionate economic hit. Women hold the key to supercharging our economy as we recover from the pandemic. Today I was delighted to welcome Anneliese Dodds MP to Tooting and meet with women business owners. I believe it is essential that we recognise the significant contribution women make and commit to tackling the challenges that they still face today. Also, we welcomed some of our community's many impressive business women and community leaders to Parliament. Tooting is home to so many - it's only right we back women in business.

The decision to close the surgery is deeply disappointing and I am concerned that it will leave thousands of local residents scrambling to find another GP, including vulnerable patients.\nAt a time when local residents are already waiting weeks to see a GP, this decision is a shocking, short-sighted solution for users of the surgery. People will find themselves trying to squeeze onto the books of existing practices, travelling further to see a GP, losing the strong and trusted relationships with their GPs they've built over time. The blame for this decision lies squarely with this Conservative Government who have imposed 13 years of underfunding and neglect on our local NHS services. I have already called on the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, to meet with the community to see the impact of this decision first-hand and to reverse this disastrous decision.

Read the full story here In today’s Guardian, I reveal the scandal of new mothers being turned away from mental health services.\nFor some time, I’ve been concerned that new mothers are being left to suffer in silence. My figures show that last year, nearly 20,000 new mothers were turned away from mental health services. Maternal mental health services are being rationed.

Read my piece in New Statesman here.\nToday, the Government have scrapped their pledge to reform the Mental Health Act.\nMore than six years of reports, campaigning and hard work has gone down the drain. Last year, I sat on the Joint Committee on the Draft Mental Health Bill. There was overwhelming cross-party support for reforming the Act. To this day, the Government has failed to respond to the committee's recommendations. Earlier this year, the Conservatives scrapped their own 10-year mental health plan. Dither, delay and failure is on form with the Tories' approach to tackling the crisis in mental health services. Black people are five times more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act. The Tories have scrapped a once in a generation opportunity to tackle this burning injustice. Last month, I challenged the Health Minister to commit to reforming the Mental Health Act, her response was less than insightful. It is disappointing that the Tories continue to bury their heads in the sand and neglect mental health services. They are out of ideas and it's costing patients their lives.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_my-commitment-to-mending-ties-with-the-jewish-community/content_123.html": "|\nNothing prepares you for seeing a colleague in tears over antisemitism.\nLabour deputy leadership hopeful, Rosena Allin-Khan, speaks about her heritage informing her fight against Jew-hate, and her commitment to mending ties with the community. “There is nothing that prepares you for seeing a colleague in tears,” says Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, one of five hopefuls standing for Labour’s deputy-leadership. Committed to winning back the trust of the community – and standing up for MPs such as Luciana Berger and Ruth Smeeth who are no longer in Westminster – Allin-Khan, currently the MP for Tooting, seems sincere in her battle against hate. She grew up as the daughter of immigrants – her father hailing from Pakistan, her mother from Poland, herself the descendent of resistance fighters killed by the Nazis. But she’s aware that hate and prejudice won’t be solved over a chat with tea and biscuits. Before her career in politics, she was a humanitarian doctor, working on the ground with Palestinians, while her mother’s family from Poland were killed by the Nazis. It’s these experiences which allow her to reconcile speaking out against Israeli policies, while committing herself to the fight against antisemitism, drawing praise from the community in carefully balancing these issues. The first of her pledges is to meet with the Jewish Labour Movement, should she get elected. It would be “essential to the restructuring” of relations, and “how we rebuild trust.” She is also keen on an education program, saying “people use antisemitic tropes and they don’t even realise what they’re doing and they repeatedly do so.” While indicating she would speak with “any group that was looking to acknowledge there was a problem, and work towards coming up with a solution to fix it” she adds that she is the “only deputy leader candidate who hasn’t nominated a leader”. She’s willing to “work with whomever the leader is” on rebuilding trust. Calling the demise in relations between the community and the party “sad” and “terrible”, she opens up about “people I know that I am very close to, who have been really brave and speaking out antisemitism in the party.” “They have received torrents of abuse and nothing’s been done about it”. “Any leader seeing something like this unfolding needs to be all over it”, she says. But was Corbyn’s team responsible? She says they were not the “cause of the antisemitic problem in Labour, I think they didn’t deal with the problem, well enough”. Yet, she’s under no illusions as to the extent of the problem, saying it must be tackled “from a grassroots membership level first and take it all the way to MPs themselves”. “The complaints process wasn’t dealt with properly”, Allin-Khan says, adding: “As people began to show antisemitic abuse .. the more they saw it wasn’t being dealt with the more they felt able to do so.” On mending ties, she wants an “independent” process for tackling complaints with “outstanding cases to be dealt with within a particular time”, and “automatic expulsion” for antisemitism, though she wouldn’t be drawn on whether she would intervene, like Tom Watson, who she is trying to succeed. Her drive to fight antisemitism is in part inspired by her heritage. “My mum’s Polish and I lost lots of family during the war. They were not Jewish, but they fought alongside Jewish friends and my great uncle died during that time, my grandma was pregnant in the Warsaw ghetto with my uncle.” “That whole experience is a very real part of my history, and it is a shared history that I understand deeply and I’m very saddened about with the Jewish community. She was embroiled in a dispute with the Israeli Deputy Ambassador in 2016, following a radio discussion about Palestinians’ access to medical aid. After revealing the two had met in person to discuss the issue, she was accused of being “bought by Zionists”, facing significant online abuse. Her response drew praise, with Dave Rich from the Community Security Trust saying it “illustrated the difference between pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist”. She says: “I am a doctor, and have been a humanitarian doctor for my whole professional life.” “It is possible, and fair, to identify areas where there could be improvement to somebody’s life and health and not to conflate that with a whole antisemitic issue. “ I will always be proud to stand up for people’s basic human rights, and I’m also very aware of my history and my shared history with the Jewish community. I feel it’s perfectly possible to manage the two.” Comments are closed.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_international-womens-day/content_611.html": "|\nWhile we cannot celebrate in person this year, this International Women's Day I'm celebrating the women who make Tooting such an incredible place to live. I am beyond proud to represent an area with an array of admirable, determined and strong women from so many different backgrounds. Please join me in thanking those mentioned below, and all the women who play an important role in your life. In 1912, Tooting dressmaker and suffragette Lillian Ball was arrested and sentenced for two months hard labour for her involvement in a window-smashing campaign in March 1912, with around 150 other women in London’s west-end. Being a working-class mother of three, it is said that Lillian received a harsher sentence than other suffragettes from wealthier backgrounds. During her time in prison completing the hard labour sentence, she recounted that she was blackmailed and coerced by senior police officers to give evidence against some of the key leaders of the suffragette movement. To think of everything Lillian sacrificed for women like myself to put a cross in the ballot box, makes me exceptionally proud to think of all we have achieved in Wandsworth since then. All MPs in Wandsworth are women and we have 10 female councillors in Tooting alone. I am also exceptionally proud to work for our NHS, where 77% of the workforce is made up of women. It was only in 1892 that The British Medical Association formally accepted female doctors into their register, and in 1948, under Attlee’s NHS reforms, it was required by law that a ‘reasonable proportion’ of medical students were women. My colleagues in St George’s, and beyond, are a true testament to what our health service embodies. And within our local community, I am proud of the women who have gone above and beyond to aid those in need. In 2016, the first Little Village baby bank was founded in Balham to provide families in need with baby clothes and equipment, such as cots, bottles and sterilisers. In 2020, they helped an estimated 6590 children and have now set up banks across Wandsworth, Camden and Southwark. Founder Sophia is a busy mum-of-three herself and has inspired many across the country, including royalty! Since 2020, the Duchess of Cambridge has supported the aims of Little Village and recently spoke to service users at the fifth anniversary of the organisation. I am also proud of the efforts of Tooting Community Kitchen to support those in need of a hot meal or drink. Sahar Beg founded the Tooting Community Kitchen in 2018, inspired by her mum’s love for cooking, and has been providing hot food and drink to those in need ever since. The community owes a great deal to Sahar’s commitment to helping others and I for one am proud to know her and support her efforts. Finally, I would like to pay tribute to two amazing young women in the constituency, whose campaigns have helped many others. Hope Virgo is the founder of the #DumpTheScales campaign, which calls on the Government to review eating disorder guidance delivered by clinicians. She is open about her journey with anorexia and now supports young people, parents and educational staff understand eating disorders in more detail. Tooting’s own Kate Isaacs founded the ‘Not Your Porn’ campaign after her friend was a victim of revenge porn, and has been fighting against companies profiteering from revenge porn since. For those who do not know what revenge porn is, it is the sharing of private sexual materials with intent to cause distress, typically without consent. Indeed, in 2020, the UK’s specialist revenge porn helpline recorded its busiest ever year with 2700 calls. Last of all, I would like to send a message to all the women in Tooting. No matter what your background, race, gender or identity, you have the power to be a force for change. Look up to the outstanding role models we have in Tooting and most importantly, be proud of who you are.\nComments are closed.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_opposing-the-deportation-flight/content_208.html": "|\nA number of local residents have reached out to ask me why my name was not included in a letter signed by 61 out of 650 MPs about the very concerning deportation flight to Jamaica. I wanted to explain how the process works.\nFirstly, let me say that this was an incredibly serious matter, which is why I was pleased to see my colleague, Holly Lynch MP, the Shadow Immigration Minister, send an urgent letter to the Government raising concerns. I added my voice to her letter by writing to Priti Patel myself - requesting that the points Holly Lynch raised were answered urgently. A copy of that letter is below:\nAs a member of the Labour Shadow Cabinet, my role is to intervene in matters related to mental health (because I am the Shadow Minister for Mental Health). Members of the Shadow Cabinet do not speak in debates, sign letters, sign EDMs or intervene in matters which are not related to their role. This rule has been in place for as long as I know, it was the same when Jeremy Corbyn was leader.\nI have noticed that my name was put on a list along with 12 colleagues, suggesting we were the only people not to sign this letter. No member of the Labour Shadow Cabinet signed the letter, indeed, almost three quarters of Labour MPs didn't sign the letter. Does that mean that they don't care? No, of course not. Sometimes they miss the deadline to sign, sometimes they can't sign, sometimes they make representations in different ways. It's very disappointing that some would single out me and 12 other colleagues, suggesting we were the only ones not to sign - simply to fit their political agenda. My background has seen me work in war torn countries, disaster zones and refugee camps helping the world's most marginalised and vulnerable people. I always care deeply about these issues and to suggest otherwise is incorrect. I'll continue to liaise with my colleagues in the Home Affairs team with regards to this, and other important issues.

One-in-fifty people in the UK live with bipolar disorder yet many struggle to access the services they need to get a proper diagnosis. Living with bipolar disorder can have a devastating impact on the people struggling with the illness as well as an impact on their loved ones, which is why it is vital that people are able to get a diagnosis early. We need a Government that will get serious on bipolar disorder. Labour will put prevention and early intervention at the forefront of our approach to mental health. The next Labour Government will recruit 8,500 new staff to ensure mental health treatment within a month for all who need it.\nBaroness Casey's independent findings of racist, misogynistic, and homophobic abuses of power within the Met Police are deeply shocking and will leave many residents in Tooting concerned that the trust between the police and our community has been shattered.\nIt is clear that there is a failure of leadership from the Home Office and today's report lays bare the scale of the challenge needed to reform the Met Police. The rot runs right through the force, so no stone can be left unturned in the push for change. I welcome the work that Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has already begun with the new Commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, in addressing these deep-rooted issues and regaining the trust of residents and victims of crime in Tooting. However, under this Home Secretary and this Conservative Government, the Met Police are lacking the leadership, ambition and resources needed to grasp the scale of this challenge. Over the last 13 years, neighbourhood policing has been decimated, whilst prosecutions for violent and sexual crimes have hit the lowest levels on record, and victims of crime are now unsure that if they report a crime, the police will even turn up. It is clear we need a Government with a plan to overhaul policing in London which will deliver cultural and systematic change. Under a Labour Government, we will overhaul policing and raise standards, with strengthened training and mandatory vetting, and the restoration of neighbourhood policing. I would like to thank our hardworking neighbourhood police officers who have always worked constructively with me and for their continuing efforts to keep our local community safe. Today, I am marking International Women's Day 2023 by celebrating some of the inspiring women who make Tooting the best place to work and live.\nHere are just some of Tooting's amazing women: Sahar Beg - Sahar, and her amazing team of volunteers, run the Tooting Community Kitchen, which has provided hot meals, toiletries, and care packages to those in need since 2018. Sophie Livingstone - Sophie, and the team at Little Village, are hardworking local activists providing vital support at their baby bank in Tooting. Kate Allan - Kate is a leading member of the Balham and Tooting Community Association (BATCA). BATCA works to organise community events, celebreate the local heroes in our area and bring people of all backgrounds together. Cllr Sarmila Varatharaj - Sarmila was elected to serve our community as a councillor last May and is now Wandsworth's Deputy Mayor. She is a volunteer for Global Human Rights Defence and has been the spokesperson to the United Nations Human Rights Council. Cllr Lizzy Dobres - Lizzy has been a dedicated councillor since being elected last May and has led on fighting inequality and violence against women. Charlotte White - Charlotte is part of the fantastic team at Earlsfield Foodbank. During the most difficult of times, she has worked tirelessly to support those in need of our community. Natasha Best - Natasha, and the team at Tooting Works, provide fantastic community and work space for many local businesses and start ups. To all the countless other amazing women who do so much for our community, thank you. Following my letter to Network Rail regarding step-free access at Wandsworth Common Station, I was very pleased to receive confirmation that the station will be nominated for funding in the next round of the \"Access for All\" programme.\nThis programme has funded step-free access and other accessibility measures in stations across the country, including just down the line at Balham. This is a very encouraging first step in ensuring that public transport is available and convenient for everyone in the local community. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

While, unfortunately, it did not come home, it was great to spend time with hard-working colleagues at St Georges. With infections and hospitalisations increasing, it’s still incredibly important for us all to look out for one another and play our part in stopping the spread of the virus. Earlier this week, the Prime Minister gave an update on moving to stage four of the coronavirus easing roadmap. This means that from 19 July, the following will apply:\nUnderstandably, many are worried about the repercussions of these eased restrictions. Indeed, many residents have been in touch regarding the use of face coverings on public transport and their anxieties surrounding this. On Wednesday, Sadiq Khan announced that face coverings will remain mandatory for all, unless exempt, when travelling on the TfL network. This will, no doubt, be a relief to many in the local area, and I pay tribute to the Mayor of London in taking a firm stand against the Government’s recklessness. Labour is calling for a controlled approach that keeps in place baseline measures that can push down infections, like mandatory face masks on public transport – which we know protect people, reduce the spread of the virus, and don’t harm the economy. By removing mask requirements - the Johnson Variant is being fast-tracked. Cases will soar, as will hospitalisations. Everyone in Tooting has been fantastic in reducing the spread of coronavirus. With one of the highest vaccination rates in London, I can only ask residents to continue looking out for one another. Comments are closed.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

The policy is an inhumane, unworkable gimmick - now they have blocked plans to protect victims of human trafficking and individuals who have supported our armed forces.\nIt's all done to appease the right of the party.\nWe have heard lots about the Government's heartless Rwanda scheme. This circus is the latest saga in the Tory melodrama, but it is the most vulnerable people whose lives they're playing with. Britain is better than this cruel, cynical Tory Government. I have worked with refugees for more than a decade. I have heard their experiences of war, violence and terror. Nobody leaves their homes, communities and livelihoods unless they must. That is why I will always stand against the inhumane Rwanda Bill.\nOver recent weeks, I have been appalled at the Tory's unworkable, unethical plans to house asylum seekers on a barge in Dorset.\nThe Government failed to listen to well-founded concerns or even carry out basic checks of the water supply, which was contaminated with Legionella bacteria, putting both asylum-seekers and staff at-risk. The Tories have serious questions to answer about the safety of this project and should stop wasting taxpayer's money pursuing headlines and instead fix this broken asylum system.\nToday, I appeared on BBC Question Time, where I held the Government to account on the shameful Rwanda policy, their neglect of the NHS, and the issues surrounding Thames Water.\nToday, I voted against the Nationality and Borders Bill, a piece of legislation that risks breaking international law and turns our backs on unaccompanied children fleeing war and persecution. The Conservatives just voted to make it harder to give a safe haven to children fleeing violence and war. They should be ashamed. The cruel irony of this Government’s approach is that it’s weak on taking action against criminal gangs and brutal when it comes to orphaned children from war zones. As someone who has held the hands of frightened children and terrified parents working as a doctor in war torn areas such as the Rohingya and Palestine, I am appalled at the Government’s approach to protecting those in need of safety. On Tuesday, I was alerted to a team of Met Police officers stopping fast food delivery drivers and carrying out immigration checks on Mitcham Road. The only concerns I have received from local residents (which authorities were copied into) were about social distancing, for which an operation of this size seems excessive. However, the police say it was 'a road safety policing operation'. The Home Office say it was in relation to 'suspected immigration offences'. This looks like racial profiling - and under the Equalities Act 2010, this may amount to indirect discrimination due to its disproportionate impact on ethnic minority groups. If it's not unlawful, then it's definitely immoral and I cannot defend it. Our community here in Tooting is inclusive, diverse and welcoming. The celebratory nature of the police’s response to any arrests is not in line with our local values. I have met with the police since and encouraged them to focus their time on fighting crime – not targeting people at work. My responses to the questions provided by the Labour Campaign for Free Movement 1. Defend and extend free movement: opposing any reduction in the freedoms of UK and EU citizens to live, work, and access social security in each others’ countries, and any immigration system based on incomes, migrants’ utility to business, and number caps or targets.I am the very embodiment of the benefits free movement has brought – my mother is Polish and was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Under the draconian new immigration policies being discussed by this Tory government, she might never have been able to do that. Protecting and extending free movement is at the very heart of my internationalist Labour principles. I believe our country is stronger and better because of free movement. When I work shifts as an A&E doctor in my local hospital, I work with NHS staff from across Europe and it breaks my heart to see many of them feeling unwanted or undervalued because of Brexit. As Deputy Leader, I pledge to do everything in my power to promote the core Labour values of internationalism and solidarity across borders, because I believe human life has the same value no matter where someone comes from. That means defending and extending free movement, and it means fighting to protect the human rights of migrants from this hostile Tory government. 2. Close every detention centreHolding migrants in detention centres, often in substandard conditions, is incredibly cruel and degrading. These are often vulnerable people, fleeing from a variety of horrific circumstances such as war, trafficking and poverty. They have the right to be treated with dignity, as human beings, as we would want ourselves or our family to be treated in such horrendous circumstances. When working abroad as a humanitarian doctor, I’ve seen first-hand some of the terrible conditions people are forced to endure in detention centres and it horrified me. We must fight back against the hostile environment the Tories have created for migrants – the Labour Party has always stood for international solidarity and openness to the world – we need a Labour government to bring those principles back into the core of our approach to immigration. I would want to listen to expert opinion on how to do this in a responsible way, but I certainly would want to close as many detention centres as possible and make sure we have an overall approach to immigration that means a concept as cruel as detention centres are not required in the first place. 3. Unconditional rights to family reunionYes, I fully support this. The unconditional right to family reunion is a fundamental element of treating migrants as human beings with dignity and equal value, rather than the Tory approach of seeing migrants as a problem to be managed. When I’ve worked as a humanitarian doctor in conflict zones across the world, it was always horrendous to see so many families ripped apart or prevented from seeing each other again. When I visited Palestine on a humanitarian mission, I saw sick children alone in hospital because the permit system meant their parents weren’t allowed to visit them. I immediately began working on ways to resolve this. It’s not enough to just talk about this – we need to be working every day to deliver a Labour government so we can fix these kinds of injustices. That’s what I’d do as Deputy Leader. 4. End “no recourse to public funds” policiesI support ending such policies, yes. This is another case of a Tory government treating migrants not as human beings with human dignity and equal value, but instead as a problem to be managed through cruelty. I want to deliver a Labour government with internationalism at its core, which would allow us to change our entire approach to migration, and begin seeing human life as equally valuable and equally dignified no matter where that person was born or where they’ve come from. 5. Oppose all Hostile Environment measures, use of landlords and public service providers as border guards, and restrictions on migrants’ NHS accessThe Tory Hostile Environment approach to immigration is a stain on the soul of their party, and they should be ashamed of it. Tragedies such as the Windrush scandal are a horrendous demonstration of where this approach leads, and I worry a similar scandal could occur with EU citizens who’ve made their lives in this country. I want a Labour government so we can end the Hostile Environment immediately and start treating migrants with the human dignity and respect they deserve. 6. Equal voting rights for all UK residents I am certainly interested in all ideas for how to revitalise our democracy and increase the level of engagement with our political process. Indeed, prior to the General Election in 2019, I publicly called for EU citizens to get the right to vote. Our Labour values of openness and internationalism must be at the core of everything we do. 7. Please share your thoughts on these wider issues that our supporters also feel strongly about:Even after Brexit, the UK government looks set to participate in Frontex (the European border agency) and its “Fortress Europe” policies. Will you challenge these policies? I certainly think the EU has often failed dismally to strike the right balance between border security and solidarity with people fleeing from war, poverty and the effects of global climate change. I am a proud pro-European, but that doesn’t mean my view of the EU is uncritical and I’ve never been afraid to say so. My values of international solidarity and openness don’t stop at the borders of Europe – they extend across the whole world. Human life always has equal value, no matter where that person comes from. Will you support an amnesty for undocumented migrants resident in the UK? We should always treat people with compassion and dignity, and we must place those values at the heart of everything we do when it comes to immigration. People in this country without documentation are often asylum seekers fleeing from horrific conditions and I want to see them treated with the human dignity they deserve. I would want to listen in more detail to expert opinion and feedback on the specific question of whether an amnesty is the right approach, but the principles of human dignity and compassion must always guide everything we do. Anything else you’d like Labour members, supporters and affiliates to know about what your leadership/deputy leadership would mean for migrants and migration policy? I am the living, breathing proof that free movement is a wonderful benefit to our country. My Polish mother was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Working on the frontlines of the NHS as an A&E doctor, I work alongside colleagues from across Europe and the rest of the world, and they are a credit to our country. It makes me proud to be British. But years of Tory government has created a literal Hostile Environment for migrants in this country. The drawbridge is being pulled up, and the rights of a whole generation of people to travel freely and live, love and work across Europe is being taken away. That is a tragedy, but it also means those of us who are proud of our outward-looking, progressive, internationalist values must fight even harder to protect and extend them. The fight starts now, and as your Deputy Leader (or even if I’m not!), I promise I will always be there fighting alongside you for those values with everything I’ve got. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Through Freedom of Information requests, we found that over 200,000 students sought support for their mental health across the UK in 2020-2021 – a threefold increase, since 2010. The lack of mental health support for our young people is not only affecting their health, but it also having a knock-on impact on their future prospects.\nUniversities are struggling to cope with the rising demand for access to the mental health treatment students need. Every five days, a student takes their own life. That is why Labour has put forward a comprehensive plan, that will put prevention of the heart of mental health services. Under Labour’s plan, we will recruit 8,500 new mental health professionals by the end of our first term in office, to see an addition one million patients per year. See more about the crisis in mental health at universities, here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1579388728153604098?s=20&t=CcG6Wxm1iHr6xo0Cfsjyww Working with the MP for Bury South, we brought an Urgent Question to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care demanding a statement in response to BBC Panorama’s alarming reports of abuse, excessive restraint, segregation and seclusion at the Edenfield Centre in Prestwich. The episode aired on BBC over two weeks ago yet there has not been a single statement or response from the Secretary of State.\nToday in Parliament, I demanded that the Secretary of State provide patients, and their families, the much-needed answers they deserve into these alarming allegations. I also challenged the Secretary of State on this Government’s commitment to reducing the need for restraint and restrictive intervention as it had pledged to do in 2019. See my statement in Parliament here https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1580509847417917440?s=20&t=Gj2YhL3GB3Os4nSrRoGK7Q Parents arriving in A&E with ashen faces holding their children, whose bodies are skeletal and covered in cuts. Families are on suicide watch. Frontline NHS workers are at breaking point. This is the reality of Tory Britain in 2022.\nOur latest research has shown that more than a million patients referred to mental health services were turned away over the last 12 months, whilst the cost of mental illness to the British economy is £117 billion a year. This is the direct result of 12 years of Conservative mismanagement of our economy and public services. We need a growing economy to pay for modern, preventative sustainable healthcare, but we can only do this with a Labour Government that will put our public services back on track. The next Labour Government will transform our mental health services: new staff, new services, faster treatment, and prevention as our watchword. Better mental health for all. Read my latest piece in the Daily Mirror here. https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1579113927438663681?s=20&t=FTZA6bYs6BUjLJ-vVYAmzg The Prime Minister has been forced to abandon her unfunded tax cut for the 1% of highest earners.\nThis Government U-turn is too late for the families who will pay higher mortgages for years to come. It will also do nothing to help or to reassure the people in Tooting and beyond. The Tories have destroyed their economic credibility and damaged trust in the British economy. Twelve years of Tory government have left the economy in chaos, and the new Prime Minister continues to make it up as she goes along. Today’s U-turn does not mark a move away from disastrous Tory economics, it’s just some districation. The Government needs to reverse their trickle down strategy. It just doesn’t work. Instead, they need to offer a programme of measures that will offer real support to those struggling with rises in food and energy bills, and increases in rent and mortgage payments. Too many people will struggle to pay their bills and put food on the table this winter, and the Government must step in now. Labour will revolutionise mental health treatment – putting prevention front and centre.\nIf ever there was an argument that prevention is better than cure, it is with mental health. We know that the longer mental illnesses are left untreated, the harder and more costly they are to treat. This mental health crisis is wrecking the British economy. Last year, 18 million work days were lost to mental illness - more than industrial disputes, more than injuries. It costs the UK economy at least £117 billion a year. And who does the cost-of-living crisis hit the hardest? Those already living with mental illnesses. The next Labour Government will guarantee treatment within a month, recruit 8,500 new staff, put a specialist in every school and a hub in every community. Labour will transform our mental health services: New staff. New services. Faster treatment. Prevention as our watchword. Better mental health for all. Watch my full speech here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1575177559943581696?s=20&t=wn3hxvRyskYM3JmyFl3dlg It is an honour to have been unanimously re-selected by all the local party branches and affiliated organisations to stand as Labour’s candidate for Tooting in the next general election.\nI want to say a huge thank you to all the members and affiliates who took part, and who continue to put their trust in me to represent our community. Serving as the Member of Parliament for the community I grew up in is an honour. From helping local residents with casework, playing a part in winning the council, defending our NHS and serving as the shadow Minister to Mental Health - I have the best job in the world. My job is made even greater by the fantastic support local members show me all year round, so I want to take this opportunity to say a big thank you to them all! The next election is make-or-break for our party, we simply must win. I’m looking forward to working hard to make this happen. The NHS is being dismantled, I see it every time I work a shift. More people than ever are relying on foodbanks, and the cost-of-living crisis is having a devastating impact on people locally and across the country. I will be absolutely committed to doing everything I can to put Labour into Government and make the changes this country so desperately needs. Thank you again to everyone who voted. Recently I visited the fantastic Balham Ballers holiday club, based at Ravensbourne Primary school.\nBalham Ballers provide a sports programme for young people aged five to twelve over the school holidays, focusing mainly on football but also giving young people a chance to enjoy a wide range of other sporting activities. I have loved working with the Balham Ballers team over the last few years and it has been fantastic to see them go from strength to strength. Balham Ballers are passionate about promoting a love of sports amongst both boys and girls. This is something that I am particularly supportive of. Following the Lionesses' fantastic win at the Euros earlier this month, the England football team have said \"every girl should be given the chance to play football at school.\" However, currently only 63% of schools offer equal access to football, a number that falls to just 44% at secondary schools. It was great to see so many young people in our community enjoying football, and I even took a penalty myself! To find out more about the Balham Ballers, click here. Fresh off the back of our trip to South Wales yesterday, Luke Pollard MP and I continued to take the fight to the Tories today, this time in Reading.\nWe kicked off the day with a doorknocking session in Reading West, another Tory-held marginal seat where it is essential Labour wins at the next general election. We were delighted to be joined by my colleague, Matt Rodda, MP for Reading East, who took us to a community-run cafe to show the empowering work that local people are doing on a daily basis. Reading is a great example of what Labour can do in power - the town's carbon emissions have been reduced by 70% in the last 12 years and the Council is currently investing £88 million in over 300 new social housing homes across Reading. Today, my friend Luke Pollard MP and I visited the lush landscape of South Wales in order to continue our fight to put Keir Starmer in 10 Downing Street.\nWe visited Barry Island (cue many Gavin and Stacey references!) in the Vale of Glamorgan seat and Chepstow in Monmouth - two vitally important areas that Labour needs to win to form a government. Labour took control of both Vale of Glamorgan & Monmouthshire Councils after the May elections and I greatly enjoyed campaigning with local members, building on that momentum in order to elect two new Labour MPs at the next election. Of course, a trip to Barry Island would not be complete without a wander down the beautiful seafront, complete with ice cream. Lloniannau! It was great to visit the wonderful volunteers at the White Eagle Club in Balham recently. The Tooting and Balham Community has rallied together to support the appeal for Ukraine since the Russian invasion in March. Since the appeal was launched, the White Eagle Club has sent 74 trucks, 112 vans, and a massive 1,800 tonnes of goods to Ukraine as part of their humanitarian aid mission. They have also provided many Ukrainian nationals who have recently fled to the UK with clothes, shoes, toiletries, and supplies for babies and infants. It’s always amazing to see the community come together to help those in need. There is however, still much more that the White Eagle Club needs, both for Ukrainian nationals arriving in the UK and to be sent to those still living in Ukraine. Items that are most in need include; medical supplies, toiletries, sanitary products and baby powder, as well as clothes for those who have recently arrived in the UK. You can donate items to 211 Balham High Street at the following times: Tuesdays: 11.00 - 20.00 Wednesday: 10.00 - 17.00 Thursday: 11.00-20.00 Friday: 10.00-17.00 Saturday 10.00-17.00 |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

I recently met some of the incredible staff and residents at Nightingale House in Balham to see first-hand the fantastic work being done in the local community.\nThe Government recently released their “Plan for Health and Social Care”, in which they pledge to help the NHS recover from the coronavirus pandemic and reform the adult social care system - funded by a 1.25% increase in National Insurance payments.\nLow-paid families will now be hit with a double whammy of a Universal Credit cut and a hike in tax. In fact, some key workers will end up more than £1,000 worse off. While I have long called for investment in social care, this is not the appropriate way to fund it. Once again the Tories have put the very wealthiest above working people. I am proud to have voted against this National Insurance increase, which will be a damaging blow to so many working people in Tooting. Even before the pandemic hit, the case for investing in this kind of support was clear. Coronavirus has exacerbated the existing crisis in mental health. Many NHS and social care staff have been scared of going to work, and they have lost patients and colleagues. It has been heartbreaking to witness the toll this virus has taken on staff mental health. Current support is not good enough, and without a tailored, fast-tracked service for staff who have faced death and despair every day for over three months, our frontline heroes will continue to be failed. We need to care for our carers. It is time for the Government to give back to those who have sacrificed so much to keep our loved ones safe. Unless our staff are protected, they cannot continue their vital work of keeping us all safe. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan: As a doctor and as a daughter I know social care is broken.\nThe deputy leadership candidate has spoken about the horror of finding her dad - who has dementia- injured and not knowing what happened. She wants to make sure no other family has to suffer that way. Nothing prepares you for finding your loved one bruised and blooded. Nothing prepares you for never finding answers. This is the reality that every day, so many people are living through, across the UK, because of the nature of the social care system. Nothing prepared me for being one of the statistics. My father has fronto-temporal dementia – he cannot communicate his thoughts but he is fully aware of what is happening. My brother and I found him bloodied and bruised on more than one occasion, we have sought answers but we know that we will never find them. He is safe now, but his health has deteriorated massively and has affected his life expectancy. This is not just my reality. This is the reality for so many others across the country. I am lucky. I was able to call a debate last year and get The Mirror to cover my family’s journey. Most people don’t have that luxury. Instead, they’re left fighting the social care system. I’ve been on both sides. As an aggrieved family member and a local politician with a responsibility for social care, I’ve seen the strife that goes into placements on both sides. The system is failing our most vulnerable residents. As it stands, the social care system is not fit for purpose. The Tories promised in their manifesto that they would tackle social care. It’s been three years – and yet still no Green Paper, despite countless promises. Last week, in Parliament, I asked the Health Secretary how many more families will suffer before the Government looks to reform the social care system. There was no answer. As an A&E doctor, who regularly sees vulnerable older people stranded in hospital because they don’t have access to adequate social care, and as a daughter, who’s had to go through this process, I have the following recommendations: - A truly independent complaints process – formal complaints should not have to go through the care provider or local authority who the complaint is against. - A reformed process for awarding care contracts – to ensure that failing companies cannot simply change their name and continue providing inadequate care. - An Independent Advocate for Older People – to protect and promote the rights of older people. - Mandatory CCTV with an opt-out – CCTV in communal areas within care homes should be mandatory to provide evidence of any unacceptable behaviour in a care setting. - A fully funded social care system, integrated into our NHS, with a ban on outsourcing to private companies. Increased funding alone won’t solve the problems being faced by our most vulnerable – only enacting the above changes will. At some point in our lives, we all have an experience with the social care system – as a daughter, I know how difficult it is when this system fails you. As Labour Deputy Leader, I would continue putting pressure on this Tory Government and their poor record on social care. As a society, we must protect our most vulnerable – sadly, nothing prepares you for confronting the worst. As your Deputy Leader, I would work with the Leader of the Labour Party to put the NHS and social care front and centre of our policy going forward. We need to protect our most vulnerable. We need a Labour Government. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Last year, I sat on the Joint Committee on the Draft Mental Health Bill. There was overwhelming cross-party support for reforming the Act. To this day, the Government has failed to respond to the committee's recommendations. Earlier this year, the Conservatives scrapped their own 10-year mental health plan. Dither, delay and failure is on form with the Tories' approach to tackling the crisis in mental health services. Black people are five times more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act. The Tories have scrapped a once in a generation opportunity to tackle this burning injustice. Last month, I challenged the Health Minister to commit to reforming the Mental Health Act, her response was less than insightful. It is disappointing that the Tories continue to bury their heads in the sand and neglect mental health services. They are out of ideas and it's costing patients their lives. Only Labour can provide the transformation needed to improve services.\nThere were so many fantastic events across Tooting to celebrate Black History Month, which is celebrated in October.\nIt was great to see Wandsworth Council celebrate the contributions of black business owners, and other influential members of the blakc community make to our borough. Many of our local libraries were host to brilliant events where black authors could share their stories with the community. A series of videos published online celebrated the brilliant contributions to local creative industries. I know that many residents particularly enjoyed the pop up street food event celebrating some of the best cuisine from across Africa and the Caribbean. My personal highlight was attending the Roots and Culture event in Tooting, where dancers, musicians, poetry, comedy, and fantastic street food stalls showed some of the best of African and Caribbean culture. It was great to see how well attended all these events were, and great to see our community coming together to celebrate the cultures of the black communities here in Tooting. Thank you to everyone who attended and helped to organise these events! Rosena Allin-Khan MP: \"I want to inspire Asians to own their identity”A CANDIDATE in the race for Labour’s deputy leadership has admitted the party “lost trust with voters” following its crushing defeat in the December general election.\nTooting MP Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is up against fellow MPs Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler, Ian Murray and Angela Rayner in the race, triggered by Labour’s huge loss last year. Suffering one of its worst results since 1935, Labour lost dozens of seats which they had held for decades, including a number of constituencies in the Midlands and northern England, which historically tended to support the party. The loss was down to a lack of trust, Allin- Khan believes. “People, quite frankly, didn’t trust us to govern,” the MP told Eastern Eye. “We had a manifesto which I believe was full of good things, but voters didn’t trust us to deliver it.” The party’s stance on Brexit was an additional factor – “we didn’t seem decisive enough” – and the level of anti-Semitism in the party and the way it was subsequently handled “closed a lot of doors”. “I’ve been up and down the country talking to individuals, wondering why Labour lost, and I’ve been told by activists that people didn’t think we had our own house in order,” she said. Today, she said, the most common concern of voters is the NHS, the level of safety on the streets and housing. “We need to show that the hopes and dreams that people have for themselves are the ones that we (Labour) have for them,” the mother-of-two said. Next month’s contest will also see the unveiling of a new Labour leader, after Jeremy Corbyn announced he would be stepping down following the general election last year. Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey are in the running to lead the opposition party. Allin-Khan, however, will not be voicing her support for any of the candidates as she believes the party needs to “heal all divisions (and) unite” after it fared so badly in the election. “When I’m working in A&E and I see kids coming in with lung infections because of mouldy housing or I see kids who have to go to food banks (…) they don’t care if Labour is left, right or centre,” she explained. “So, the most important thing to move forward is to unite and I can show that by not nominating someone for leader.” On her role in the deputy leadership race, Allin-Khan said she was determined to use it as an opportunity to help “ethnic minorities own their identity and be proud of it”. “That is what I want people to feel I embody when they look at me,” she explained. “For me, being in this race, if that is the one thing I get out of this…that other young British Asians can look at me and say, ‘if she can do it, I can do it too’, then that is my job done.” Allin-Khan admitted she had faced prejudice due to her mixed Pakistani-Polish heritage and has received criticism that she “isn’t fully Asian”. In response to the comments, the MP is keen to highlight her mixed heritage does not make her Asian background any less “important, valuable or special.” “I identify with being an Asian woman, in the same way that I am proud to be Polish,” she said. “Some people in the Asian community wonder how Asian I feel because I’m mixed race, but I’m proud to wear my sari and embrace my heritage.” Some have even suggested that she change her forename to Rosie and take her husband’s surname to downplay her ethnicity. However, Allin-Khan is proud of her roots and is keen to emphasise it. “I went double barrelled because I didn’t want to lose the Asian part of my surname and that for me, is very important,” she said. “I am proud to say that this is who I am – a Polish and Pakistani, proudly British Muslim woman who loves the Labour party.” Born and brought up in Tooting in a working-class household, Allin-Khan described her young life as “tough”. Her mother worked three jobs to keep the family financially afloat, and Allin-Khan recalled there only being one heater in the house that they had to move from room to room to keep themselves warm. Allin-Khan failed her A-Levels, citing the difficulties at home as a factor. Despite the setbacks, she still had a desire to study medicine. However, she was told “it wasn’t for girls like (her)”, as it was financially prohibitive, and she didn’t come from the “right background”. Allin-Khan, who still works part-time as a doctor, knew she had to keep fighting if she wanted to pursue her dream career. “I think my upbringing led me to believe I had no choice but to sink or swim,” she said. After resitting her A-Levels, the then-24-year-old accepted a place to study medicine at Lucy Cavendish College, University of Cambridge, which was funded by scholarships. “I really believe that where you start off in life doesn’t need to dictate where you end up,” the A&E doctor said. Although she credited her own resilience for her success, Allin-Khan believes the Labour government gave her an opportunity to fulfil her potential when things looked bleak. “The Labour government turned my life around,” the 43-year-old claimed. “I redid my A-Levels, did a degree and went to Cambridge to study medicine and I’m afraid those possibilities aren’t going to be there for a new generation of kids under this Tory government.” Allin-Khan, the MP for Tooting since 2016, admitted the biggest challenge of her involvement in politics is racism. She often faces abuse on social media and is mostly targeted for her Muslim beliefs. “When I look at the order in which my abuse comes, it is Muslim first, then my Asian heritage comes second,” she admitted. “My gender is third. Without a doubt, the amount of abuse is a huge challenge.” It is a concern that young BAME women may be deterred from entering politics due to the abuse other politicians have faced, she said. In response, Allin-Khan regularly engages with schools and community groups to encourage young people to “keep going and not to lose faith”. There is also a level of racism in the House of Commons, she said, highlighting that she is the first Muslim person ever to make it on to the deputy leadership ballot. Although it is encouraging to see more women and ethnic minority politicians in parliament, Allin-Khan believes there is “still a ceiling on what we can achieve”. Recently, Allin-Khan approached a “prominent BAME politician” to ask them to consider nominating her in the deputy leadership contest. However, the politician responded: “I’m only in the game of backing winners and you don’t look like you’ve got any chance of winning.” “We can’t have that attitude towards people, and I’ve said in my grassroots revival plan that our BAME communities can’t be an afterthought when it comes to supporting people to hold public office,” she said. “We need to be seeing ethnic minorities at the top of our party, on the front benches. “I’ve smashed that ceiling, but I plan to throw the ladder down and say people ‘come up behind, you can do this.’ But I know it isn’t easy.” |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

However, the damaging impact that expansion will have on noise and air quality of people living under the flightpath cannot be ignored.\nMy position has always been the same and I remain opposed to the expansion of Heathrow airport. While I do not support a third runway at Heathrow, I do agree with the expansion of Gatwick. It can expand faster and with a less negative impact on people living under the flightpaths. Today, on Holocaust Memorial Day, I am at Auschwitz commemorating 80 years since its liberation.\nThis day serves as a stark reminder of the sheer evil that led to the murder of 6 million Jews. We remember them and promise to never forget the horrors they faced. It's finally Friday and what better way to prepare for the weekend than by reading my latest column in the South London Press.\nRead my article on the steps Labour are taking, both nationally and locally, to tackle the housing crisis here. Since the beginning of this terrible violence in October 2023, I have been unrelenting and unequivocal in my calls for an immediate, unconditional ceasefire in Gaza. I have equally been clear that the October 7 attacks by Hamas were completely abhorrent, and hostages must be released.\nTens of thousands of innocent lives have been lost, with each story as heartwrenching and tragic as the last. There are no words for the pain, suffering and anguish that millions have experienced as a result of this awful war. This ceasefire deal, therefore, is a welcome and significant step towards peace. We must remain cautiously optimistic that this fragile peace will hold. Ahead of the ceasefire taking effect on Sunday 19 January, we have seen the escalation of strikes on Gaza by the Israeli Defense Forces and the international community must do everything to ensure that the terms of the ceasefire are met in full and on schedule. Only by ending the violence and bloodshed, as well as releasing the hostages, can reconstruction of the devastated Gaza Strip begin. The influx and distribution of urgent humanitarian aid must be a priority, as hundreds of thousands of Gazan civilians are starving and on the brink of famine. Over 2 million people on both sides of the border have been displaced from their homes, with many of them now having nothing to which they can return. Regardless of the events of the next few weeks and months, I will continue to be a vocal proponent of peace, reconciliation and a sustainable two-state solution. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

The documentary follows obstetrician Professor Basky Thilaganathan and his team as they work to save the lives of unborn babies with complex medical conditions. In one moving episode, Professor Thilaganathan was seen helping parents Becky and Richard, who were told that their baby had no chance of surviving. At Becky’s nineteen week scan, baby Annie was showing signs of congenital heart failure due to pressures from a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung. In simpler terms, this meant that Annie had a tumour on her lung the size of a malteaser. Owing to developments in medicine, Professor Thilaganathan was able to complete a non-invasive operation immediately on Becky and Annie by placing a tube near the mass, and feeding a laser through it, to zap and kill a rogue blood vessel. Remarkably, despite the parents being told that Annie’s heart could stop at any time, the procedure was successful and Becky gave birth to Annie several months later, with no signs of the surgery she had undergone before she was born. This is, yet again, proof of what amazing talent and humanity we have here in Tooting. It was a pleasure to get out on the doorstep with our Greater London Authority candidate for South London, Candice Atterton, today! Alongside Candice and Ruth Cadbury MP for Brentford and Isleworth, it was a privilege to visit Hounslow Youth Counselling Service. The post-pandemic recovery must have young people at its heart, so it was fantastic to spend the morning hearing about the great work taking place in Hounslow to support and champion young people’s mental health. With her background in youth work and youth justice, Candice is determined to focus on support and opportunities for young people. I have no doubt that she will be a great addition to Mayor Sadiq Khan’s Labour Team in City Hall! The Bike Project - a wonderful local charity which supplies refugees with old, unloved, and abandoned bicycles – is looking for someone to provide a new Tooting drop-off point. A drop-off point is a place where local residents can leave their unwanted bikes to be collected by the charity, who repairs them before they are donated to refugees and asylum seekers. With just £37.75 a week to live on, these bikes can make an enormous difference to the lives of refugees. If you are able to volunteer a space to act as a new drop-off point in our area, or to arrange a time to donate a bike, email Julia from The Bike Project at [email protected]. We have been blessed with wonderful sunshine throughout this week, which has undoubtedly brought out the best of our surroundings here in Tooting. Working in St George’s Hospital, I know what a real difference the green spaces in the grounds make to patients, visitors and staff alike. I would therefore like to express my sincere thanks to the hospital gardening team, in particular their Head of Gardening, John Greco, who have put their all into this wonderful display of spring blooms for us all to enjoy. The bright array of tulips and blossom trees will no doubt be a great comfort to what is an often anxious time for patients and visitors to the hospital. Thank you team! Several cases of the South African variant of Covid-19 has been found in Wandsworth, and the Council is encouraging everyone over the age of 11 who lives, works in, or travels through Wandsworth to book a PCR test – including those of us who have had the vaccine, even if you are not showing any symptoms.\nPCR testing sites have opened across Wandsworth, including one at Tooting Leisure Centre by appointment only. Tests can also be ordered online, or collected without an appointment at Wandsworth Town Hall. Tests are also available on a strictly appointment-only basis at many local pharmacies. It is necessary to book a PCR test because although the widely available rapid lateral flow test can determine positivity for Covid-19, only the PCR test is able to detect specific variants. It is important that we are all tested because one-in-three people who have Covid-19 are asymptomatic, and could be spreading the virus without knowing it. Let’s all do our part to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 variant. Click here to order a home testing kit, or to book an appointment at a testing centre or local pharmacy. Following on from the BBC’s successful documentary in March last year, ‘Stacey Dooley: On The Psych Ward’, Stacey Dooley returned to Springfield in a moving programme aired on Tuesday (13th April 2021). Stacey Dooley: Back On The Psych Ward follows the dedicated mental health professionals working on the frontline at Springfield, as well as a number of brave patients who came forward to share their experiences of life at Springfield during lockdown. I am always exceptionally proud of everyone working in mental health across the country. As both the Shadow Minister for Mental Health and Member of Parliament for Tooting, I remain committed to ensuring that local mental health services receive the funding they deserve. Today Muslims across the UK and around the world mark the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan. As a proud Muslim, the period of reflection, prayer, and fasting is incredibly important to our Muslim community. Traditionally, Ramadan is a time for gathering and sharing Iftar with family and friends. Although, like last year, we are unable to come together and celebrate as we normally would, the spirit of Ramadan remains. To every Muslim nurse and doctor who have saved countless lives throughout this pandemic, to every volunteer and community leader in our Mosques and community centres who continue to support those most vulnerable, and to every Muslim in Tooting and across the country, I wish you all Ramadan Mubarak. With the easing of Government restrictions, The Share Community are seeking volunteer befrienders to help local residents with learning disabilities get back out into the community. Share is a registered charity with a site in Tooting providing support to adults with learning disabilities and/or autism. Their befriending project matches people with similar interests to go for walks, bike rides, or coffee. Befriending is incredibly rewarding, providing companionship to those who are socially isolated and regular contact with a friendly face outside their usual circle. I am told that reliability and being a good listener are the only prerequisites to be a volunteer befriender. If this sounds like you, Share would love to hear from you! Click here to find out more. Here in South West London, over half a million residents have received their first vaccine dose so far! Although this is a pivotal milestone, the percentage of vaccinated persons still remains lower among all ethnic minority groups compared with the White British population. I recognise that many within the BAME community may be unfamiliar with vaccines and feel unsure. However, I can assure you that the vaccines have all been rigorously tested and declared safe by doctors around the world. I continue to urge everyone eligible to book their vaccine appointment as soon as possible. The sooner the vaccine is rolled out, the sooner we can begin to rebuild. Together we can do this. Tooting Women’s Institute is looking for new members of all ages and backgrounds to join them in their monthly activities and events. Meeting on the second Wednesday of each month, this wonderful organisation provides a place for members to learn new skills, meet others in the community, discuss topical issues, and share interests. Previous sessions have involved everything from career mentoring and coding, to craftivism and calligraphy, while a variety of smaller groups meet to engage in more niche interests, including a supper club, which visits a new restaurant in Tooting each month, a book club, and a craft club, to name a few.

I have written to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, asking him to come clean on what action he is taking to tackle mental health waiting lists. Read my full letter here:\nIn September, I’ll be taking on the London to Brighton cycle along with Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney. We’re fundraising as part of the Time for a Change appeal to help support St George’s Hospital Charity in their work to provide assistance to patients, their families, and the staff who care for them across St George’s Hospital, Queen Mary’s Hospital, and community sites.\nIt’s a 55-mile route from Clapham to Brighton, and we’ll be joined by other fantastic #TeamGeorges participants. Neither of us have done this before and it’s a big challenge for us. The Time for a Change Appeal is supporting children’s services at St George’s Hospital. We know that St George's Trust provides absolutely outstanding care for patients and incredible support for families, but sadly the facilities often don’t reflect this level of care. If you want to support us, our JustGiving link is here: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/fleurandrosenal2b\nAll too often, children are stuck on long waiting lists for mental health treatment and thousands of people are having their referrals closed before an appointment.\nThis Tory Government caused the crisis in mental health services - when will they fix it?\nOn the 75th birthday of the NHS, I joined the amazing team at St George’s Hospital, to say, a big thank you for the incredible care and compassion they show every day. I'm proud to work side-by-side with the team.\nToday, I appeared on BBC Question Time, where I held the Government to account on the shameful Rwanda policy, their neglect of the NHS, and the issues surrounding Thames Water.\nOur local NHS board have announced that Trinity Medical Centre will close on 31st July. The decision to close the surgery is deeply disappointing and I am concerned that it will leave thousands of local residents scrambling to find another GP, including vulnerable patients.\nAt a time when local residents are already waiting weeks to see a GP, this decision is a shocking, short-sighted solution for users of the surgery. People will find themselves trying to squeeze onto the books of existing practices, travelling further to see a GP, losing the strong and trusted relationships with their GPs they've built over time. The blame for this decision lies squarely with this Conservative Government who have imposed 13 years of underfunding and neglect on our local NHS services. I have already called on the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, to meet with the community to see the impact of this decision first-hand and to reverse this disastrous decision. Today, I called on the Health Secretary to get his act together on our failing mental health services. Across mental health services, children are being failed, police are spending hours waiting with children in crisis in A&E, staff are overworked are under-resourced. It's time for the Health Secretary to get a grip or get out of the way. Today, I wrote to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, calling on him to listen to concerns expressed by local residents about the proposed closure of Trinity Medical Centre.\nAt a time when waiting times are at record levels, these plans by the NHS and Government will make it harder for local residents to access a local GP. That's why, alongside our local Labour Councillors, I'm campaigning to keep GP services at this site. Please add your name to the petition here Read my letter below: The children's cancer centre at St George's Hospital is at risk of closure.\nThis is deeply concerning. The St George's children's cancer centre has more than 25 years of expertise delivering the highest quality care for patients, which will be lost if the services are moved away from Tooting. Under these plans, patients will be forced to travel to a site in central London. Parents have made it very clear that it is easier, cheaper, safer, and more comfortable to take their children to St George's. There is also a huge added cost. The plans to relocate services will cost an estimated £90 million, more than three times the cost to redevelop facilities at St George's Hospital. Today, I've launched a petition calling on the Government and NHS England to keep the children’s cancer service at St George's Hospital. Add your name and share the petition with friends and family here Trinity Medical Centre serves thousands of local people but is under threat of closure. For so many local residents this is a vital service. The closure would cause real difficulties for people accessing their local GP. Many local residents already have to wait weeks for a GP appointment and waiting lists for treatment are at record highs. This closure is a result of 13 years of government underfunding of our NHS. The local Integrated Care Board for South West London has been forced into making huge cuts to their budget and the impact of these cuts is now being felt by our community. In recent weeks, I've been contacted by numerous local residents extremely concerned about the impact of this closure. That's why I am urging the Health Secretary to intervene, listen to patients and staff alike, and keep a GP surgery open at Trinity Medical Centre.

I have equally been clear that the October 7 attacks by Hamas were completely abhorrent, and hostages must be released.\nTens of thousands of innocent lives have been lost, with each story as heartwrenching and tragic as the last. There are no words for the pain, suffering and anguish that millions have experienced as a result of this awful war. This ceasefire deal, therefore, is a welcome and significant step towards peace. We must remain cautiously optimistic that this fragile peace will hold. Ahead of the ceasefire taking effect on Sunday 19 January, we have seen the escalation of strikes on Gaza by the Israeli Defense Forces and the international community must do everything to ensure that the terms of the ceasefire are met in full and on schedule. Only by ending the violence and bloodshed, as well as releasing the hostages, can reconstruction of the devastated Gaza Strip begin. The influx and distribution of urgent humanitarian aid must be a priority, as hundreds of thousands of Gazan civilians are starving and on the brink of famine. Over 2 million people on both sides of the border have been displaced from their homes, with many of them now having nothing to which they can return. Regardless of the events of the next few weeks and months, I will continue to be a vocal proponent of peace, reconciliation and a sustainable two-state solution. As 2024 draws to a close, I wanted to take this opportunity to look back on the events of the past year. It has been a year of change and renewal - full of ups and downs - but as I enter into my ninth year as your Member of Parliament for Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting, it remains the greatest honour of my life to represent the community in which I was born and raised. Entering the new year, I would like to pay tribute to the incredible frontline workers working around the clock to keep the country going through the festive period. From our NHS services to local hospitality staff to food bank volunteers - you all have my heartfelt gratitude for your tireless work this Christmas and throughout the year. A year for democracyWhat a year it has been for elections, both locally and across the country. We began the year with a fantastic win in the Tooting Broadway by-election, increasing the Labour vote share by nearly 7% to a whopping 58% majority. Then came the Mayoral elections in May, when we kept London red by electing my Tooting predecessor Sadiq Khan to a historic third term as Mayor of London. Finally - and most importantly - we finally elected a new Labour Government after 14 long years, with areas up and down the country voting Labour for the very first time. It was humbling to receive the most votes of any Labour MP and thanks must go to everyone who voted for me - your support means the world. £100m to fix Wandsworth PrisonAfter years of campaigning - and countless stories of mismanagement and scandal - the Ministry of Justice announced a £100 million funding package for HMP Wandsworth. This will go a long way to reduce the impact of overcrowding, repair crumbling cell blocks and facilities, and ensure that prison guards can work in a safe environment. Delivering for everyone in TootingThousands of local people have contacted me this year regarding a variety of issues, I have dealt with 15,000 cases. I reclaimed tens of thousands in unpaid pensions or benefits for local people, got decisions on hundreds of delayed passport or visa applications, and helped countless local residents get repairs to their homes. My door is always open and please get in touch if there is anything I can help with. On the NHS frontline\nSpeaking up for Gaza It has now been over a year since the horrific 7th October attacks and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza. The humanitarian disaster we have seen unfold there in the time since, has been truly heartwrenching. This year, I've raised the issue numerous times in Parliament, visited the region in the spring, and held evidence sessions with humanitarian experts. Revitalising Tooting town centre\nThis Morning and Loose Women Using my background as an NHS doctor, I have enjoyed trying my hand at being a TV medic this year! The lovely people at This Morning and Loose Women have had me on many times to talk about a range of topics from mental health to medical emergencies and even gave me space to open up about my own childhood challenges with speech, in a bid to end stigma and help others. Work in Parliament\nKeeping our streets safe in 2024, I successfully campaigned for a tripling of the Tooting neighbourhood policing team, putting more bobbies on our streets. In the summer, Operation Kenny run by the Metropolitan Police resulted in a 70% reduction in crime in Tooting town centre. This work will continue with the new Government's plans to recruit 13,000 new officers and return policing to communities. Cleaning up the local area I have never stopped campaigning for cleaner streets. This year saw a 15% reduction in fly-tipping in Wandsworth, with thousands of fines issued to people dumping their bulky rubbish on our streets. Meanwhile, Wandsworth Labour introduced food recycling for the first time ever in the borough. Free School Meals roll-out\nMental health reform Mental health is incredibly important to me and, for far too long, much-needed reforms were swept under the rug by a Conservative Government that simply wasn't interested. After much hard work, it was fantastic to see reform of the Mental Health Act announced in the King's Speech in July - this was long overdue.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_health/content_220.html": "|\nFollowing the decision to relocate children's cancer services in South East England away from St George's Hospital, I met with the Health Secretary with a cross-party group of MPs to raise our concerns.\nWhen I visited the Pinckney Ward where this care is conducted, I met with Jackson, a former patient there, and his parents, who told me that such a move would be detrimental for parents, children and the hospital alike. I have urged the Secretary to review and reconsider NHS England's decision as soon as possible. The beginning of Mental Health Awareness week was marked by grim tidings that, for the first time in recorded history, the number of people on an waiting list for mental health treatment has hit 2 million.\nThis is more than the combined population of four major British cities and is a shocking indictment of the Tories' failed record on mental health.\nAs part of my previous work as Shadow Minister for Mental Health and in my capacity as an A&E doctor at St George's, I know firsthand the toll that working on the NHS frontline can take.\nToday, I asked the Government whether they will continue to fund mental health support services past the 12 months they've committed to. Shamefully, the Minister refused to commit to funding. This is just further proof that this Tory Government couldn't care less about our NHS heroes.\nIt was fantastic to join Dermot and Alison on the This Morning medical segment again; this time to talk about rashes and what to look out for.\nRashes can be difficult to see on darker skin tones and this can lead to delayed treatment and poorer outcomes, which is why it's especially important to be aware of the different symptoms and nuances.\nToday's announcement by NHS England that children's cancer services will be moved away from the world-class unit at St George's Hospital is profoundly disappointing.\nAs a doctor, I am clear that this decision has not been made in the interests of patients or their families and we're losing more than 25 years of expertise in the field of children's cancer care. I'm calling on the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Victoria Atkins to immediately review this decision. It was great to speak at the King's Fund Circles Series focusing on women in leadership, where I shared my experience as a women working in healthcare and politics.\nIt's vital that we get more women in leadership roles across society. This morning, I joined pupils at Garratt Park School in Earslfield to plant the 500,000th tree of Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan's Trees for London scheme.\nIt's vital that we make London a green city for the future, where everyone has access to healthy outdoor space. Today marks International Stammer Awareness Day. I know from my own experience, the impact the stigma of stammering has on those affected. We must not create a narrative of trying to fix people with speech disfluency. Instead we need to work to create a more inclusive society.\nIn recent weeks, thousands of people across south London and south-east England have signed my petition calling on NHS England to keep children's cancer services at St George's Hospital, including many parents who have told me how worried they are about this proposed closure.\nLast week, NHS England launched its consultation on the future of services at St George’s Hospital and I want to make sure that we have every chance to defend and protect our local services. Keeping services at St George's is best for our patients and best for the NHS, but this can only happen with the support of people in the community who will be affected by this decision. Please spare a few minutes to complete to consultation questionnaire and share your views with the NHS. The consultation is running until Monday 18 December. See full details of the consultation here and please share this as widely as possible with friends and family here.\nNot many people know this about me: when I was young, due to significant childhood trauma, I had a stammer. All too often it made me too afraid to speak, for fear of being ridiculed.\nPeople that have stammers aren't victims. Stammers are a normal part of life. Today I had such an amazing time with the ladies on Loose Women, opening up publicly about it for the first time. With greater awareness and better representation of people with stammers, we can become a society where people who are disfluent are not stigmatised. Great as always to catch up with my friend Denise Welch. And shout out to Adam Alexander in Tooting for my new, fresh hair colour.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_all_37/content_744.html": "|\nWhen I first met Rosena, she was Labour’s candidate in the 2016 Tooting by-election.\nAs a by-election candidate myself in Heywood and Middleton in 2014, I know how difficult and uniquely pressured by-elections can be and I wanted to help Rosena win the seat after the amazing Sadiq Khan left to become London mayor. As soon as I met Rosena, I knew that Tooting would soon have another fantastic Labour MP. Her boundless energy and enthusiasm inspired her whole team. I also knew that Rosena wouldn’t be just a backbench MP but that she would bring her skills and experience to the parliamentary Labour party and she’s certainly done that in her role as shadow sports minister and with her background as a practising A&E doctor in our NHS. The choice of who to support in the deputy leadership contest has been a difficult one for me. I know all the candidates and they’re all people I am proud to call friends. But it’s Rosena who has most impressed me in this campaign and I think she has the qualities that we need in our new deputy leader. After the disastrous election result in December 2019, where I lost my seat to the Tories – the first time that they have ever taken Heywood & Middleton – Rosena was one of the first people to contact me, to commiserate but also to talk about what went wrong and how we rebuild from here. She came up to my constituency to talk with key activists about the campaign and we explored every aspect, from Brexit through to our manifesto and the Labour leadership. We talked about Heywood and Middleton being a 62% Leave voting constituency and how I had tried to represent the views of all my constituents in trying to get a deal that worked for 100%. Rosena understands the issues that we face here in the North and I know that she is going to be a great campaigning deputy leader who will reach out across the country to win back those lost Labour seats in the North, the Midlands, Scotland and Wales. I see the role of deputy leader as being a campaigner, an organiser, an advisor and also a critical friend. I think that Rosena is more than capable of doing this job, and doing it extremely well. I am wary of any offer of leader/deputy leader ‘dream tickets’ suggesting a cosy, already formed relationship. The deputy leader has to be able to stand back and assess situations critically and I know that Rosena has the independence and strength of character to do this. I know how hard Rosena has worked to become a qualified doctor, and she’s not only continued to work shifts at St George’s Hospital, keeping her grounded and in touch with our NHS but she’s also done great humanitarian work reaching out internationally. I’ll never forget her impassioned speech in parliament when she returned from the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh where she’d been providing medical care to people who have nothing – no citizenship, no home, in many cases no family and no prospect of their situation improving. Rosena has the strength, knowledge, intelligence and empathy needed to unite our party and also to take our message out to the wider public. And whoever becomes leader, she will be a unique complement to them. I’m proud to call Rosena a friend, and I’m proud to support her to be the next deputy leader of the Labour Party. Rosena Allin-Khan kicks off Labour deputy leader campaign in Putney with ‘fire in her belly’\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan launched her deputy Labour leadership campaign in Putney last night. The campaign, held in the ballroom of the Star & Garter pub, brought together an eclectic crowd, including some young first-time voters. Tooting MP Dr Allin-Khan, who is running with the slogan ‘Taking Labour Forward’, is a qualified A&E front-line doctor and has provided humanitarian aid to refugees in Syria. Describing her determination to be the next deputy leader, she said: “Expertise in building trust in communities and shared life experience has put fire in my belly to achieve for others.” She set out her ‘internationalist’ vision of Britain’s future after Brexit and brought attention to the importance of social care reform, the significance of a grassroots revival and updating technology within the Labour Party. Labour’s Putney MP Fleur Anderson said that Dr Allin-Khan would be a ‘campaigner-in-chief’ and not a ‘leader-in-waiting’ if elected as deputy leader in a PoliticsHome article last week. The Musician’s Union has given their endorsement to Dr Allin-Khan and to Sir Keir Starmer for leader. Voting takes place from February 24 to April 2 and results will be announced on the April 4. Labour needs to become a party of progressive internationalism once againLast Tuesday, a boat capsized and sank in the Bay of Bengal. There were 138 Rohingya refugees crammed on the boat, fleeing from camps in Bangladesh. At least 15 bodies were found, including four children, with 50 more missing.\nI’ve been campaigning for the rights of the Rohingya since the recent crisis unfolded in 2017. I’ve been involved in humanitarian matters long before entering politics and standing to be Labour deputy leader. Stories such as those of the Rohingya do not often have a light shined upon them here in the UK. They happen far away and it feels as if they’re outside of our control. The UK has a proud history of humanitarian assistance and we must ensure that this continues. We must never allow ourselves to turn a blind eye. Every single human life has equal value, no matter where that person was born, what language they speak or what they look like. Humanity has no borders. This isn’t just something I believe in principle — I act on it. My work as a humanitarian doctor has taken me to the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, where grieving mothers told me accounts of their babies being ripped from their arms and murdered before their eyes. The guilt of coming home to my own three- and five-year-olds left me unable to sleep at night. Why should their lives be of more value to the world than those of the Rohingya children who are slaughtered without a dignified burial? I have seen how human life is not valued equally around the world. It lit a fire in my belly to continue fighting such injustice, no matter where it takes place. At the very heart of my Labour principles is internationalism. I believe this spirit of internationalism must drive everything we do as a party. We must always stand in unwavering opposition to any effort to restrict freedoms, whether here or globally. We’ve seen where this mentality leads — whether it is the tragedy of Windrush, the cruelty of detention centres like Yarl’s Wood, or the inhumanity of a government that votes against protection for vulnerable child refugees. Now is the time for all of us who believe in progressive, internationalist values to fight back. It is our duty to ensure that the Rohingya and other victims are not forgotten by the world. One of the reasons I decided to stand to become the next deputy leader of Labour is because I believe our party has a unique chance to become a global beacon of internationalism, as it has been before. We have arguably the largest grassroots membership of any political party in Europe. If we are able to unite behind a truly internationalist vision for our party and our country, we could be a force for change on a global scale. We have a wonderful society, which has welcomed so many people from across the world, but this government’s hostile environment is diminishing hope — hope for a brighter future, hope for a tolerant society. I first entered politics in order to shed light on humanitarian efforts around the world and give a voice to the voiceless. I still believe we can, and I want to help rebuild the Labour Party so that it becomes a powerful force for good. As a party we need to rebuild trust with our communities, with the British people and the international community. Let’s do this together. Rosena Allin-Khan is Labour MP for Tooting and candidate for the deputy leadership The Musicians’ Union has nominated Keir Starmer to be the next leader of the Labour Party, and Rosena Allin-Khan to be the next deputy.\nThe party-affiliated organisation has become the fourth trade union to back Starmer, and the first to back Allin-Khan. In 2015, the union nominated Andy Burnham for leader and Caroline Flint for deputy, and in 2016 it backed leadership challenger Owen Smith. Commenting on their nomination on Twitter, the Musicians’ Union said Starmer had been “a strong supporter of musicians”. “He understands the challenges musicians working in the EU are facing and what we need to do to meet them”. The organisation also revealed in a tweet that Allin-Khan was a “former Musicians’ Union member” and said they were “proud to see her rise so far” and “to support her as she continues fighting for young people to have a free musical education.” Starmer has already secured his place on the final ballot through both the support of affiliates, including large trade union UNISON, and the backing of local Labour parties. To reach the ballot paper, each candidate must be nominated by 5% of local parties or three affiliates, two of which must be trade unions, amounting to more than 5% of the total affiliate membership. Starmer has been nominated by a total of 159 constituency parties so far, as well as UNISON, Usdaw, SERA, Community, Labour Movement for Europe, Labour Business and the Socialist Health Association. Allin-Khan has yet to secure a place on the final ballot, having so far only secured the support of 17 CLPs and the Labour Campaign for International Development. Rosena Allin-Khan is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in5/2/2020\nFleur Anderson MP: As Deputy Leader, Rosena Allin-Khan would be a campaigner-in-chief, not a leader-in-waitingRosena Allin-Khan is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in, writes Putney's new MP, Fleur Anderson.\nThe night of the General Election result was a deeply distressing moment for all of us who love the Labour Party and who love our country. It was an horrific experience to watch the door close on a whole generation as the Tories won a huge majority to continue their destructive and damaging agenda. But I was also hugely proud and honoured to produce the only Labour gain of the night, as I became the new MP for Putney. It was, I hope, a rare bright light in an otherwise long, dark night for all those Labour activists, members and volunteers who worked tirelessly during the election. Rosena’s help and support was vital to that win. She is my friend and colleague, as we were councillors together and she is the MP for the neighbouring constituency of Tooting. It’s sometimes forgotten how difficult it can be for prospective parliamentary candidates, especially ones who’ve never stood to be an MP before. Of course, it’s a huge honour to be given the chance to represent your local community, and to make their voices heard in the corridors of power – but you also have to put your life on hold for months, spending hardly any time with your friends and family, working and campaigning relentlessly, whatever the weather, rain or shine. And at the end of it all, there’s absolutely no guarantee you’ll get the job, especially in a marginal seat like Putney. It’s incredibly rewarding, but it’s hard work too. Rosena was there for me every step of the way, helping me, guiding me, giving me advice and encouragement and very practical support too. I cannot thank her enough. She is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in, and every single voter who meets her comes away with a positive impression and a smile on their face. I should know - we stood to be Councillors together in the same ward in 2014 - fighting a seat that had been Tory for 24 years - and we won, through sheer hard work and positive conversations. Rosena is a relentless optimist – she always finds the positives in every situation and she never gives up, no matter what. Her life-story is a true demonstration of our Labour values – she comes from an impoverished background, failed her A-levels first time around but persevered, and because of reforms introduced by a Labour government, she was able to study at Cambridge and become a doctor before becoming an MP - it shows the difference a Labour Government can make to the lives of people across our country. Rosena is now running to become the next Deputy Leader of Labour. There’s no doubt she’s the underdog in the race, but that’s never stopped her before, and I know it won’t stop her now. She would be a phenomenal Deputy Leader of our Party, and that’s why she’s got my total support. She’s got the most interesting and substantive ideas of any of the candidates, and she’s already published a fantastic Grassroots Revival manifesto of how the Labour Party can improve our campaigning practices to get back to winning ways ahead of the local elections in May. As Deputy Leader, she would be a campaigner-in-chief, not a leader-in-waiting. In Putney, I saw the real difference she made with her energy, her optimism and her campaigning skill. Thanks to Rosena’s help, we turned blue seats into red ones, and if she’s elected as the next Deputy Leader, we can start doing that across the whole country - at both a local and a national level. Let’s take Labour forward. Fleur Anderson is Labour MP for Putney. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan: As a doctor and as a daughter I know social care is broken.\nThe deputy leadership candidate has spoken about the horror of finding her dad - who has dementia- injured and not knowing what happened. She wants to make sure no other family has to suffer that way. Nothing prepares you for finding your loved one bruised and blooded. Nothing prepares you for never finding answers. This is the reality that every day, so many people are living through, across the UK, because of the nature of the social care system. Nothing prepared me for being one of the statistics. My father has fronto-temporal dementia – he cannot communicate his thoughts but he is fully aware of what is happening. My brother and I found him bloodied and bruised on more than one occasion, we have sought answers but we know that we will never find them. He is safe now, but his health has deteriorated massively and has affected his life expectancy. This is not just my reality. This is the reality for so many others across the country. I am lucky. I was able to call a debate last year and get The Mirror to cover my family’s journey. Most people don’t have that luxury. Instead, they’re left fighting the social care system. I’ve been on both sides. As an aggrieved family member and a local politician with a responsibility for social care, I’ve seen the strife that goes into placements on both sides. The system is failing our most vulnerable residents. As it stands, the social care system is not fit for purpose. The Tories promised in their manifesto that they would tackle social care. It’s been three years – and yet still no Green Paper, despite countless promises. Last week, in Parliament, I asked the Health Secretary how many more families will suffer before the Government looks to reform the social care system. There was no answer. As an A&E doctor, who regularly sees vulnerable older people stranded in hospital because they don’t have access to adequate social care, and as a daughter, who’s had to go through this process, I have the following recommendations: - A truly independent complaints process – formal complaints should not have to go through the care provider or local authority who the complaint is against. - A reformed process for awarding care contracts – to ensure that failing companies cannot simply change their name and continue providing inadequate care. - An Independent Advocate for Older People – to protect and promote the rights of older people. - Mandatory CCTV with an opt-out – CCTV in communal areas within care homes should be mandatory to provide evidence of any unacceptable behaviour in a care setting. - A fully funded social care system, integrated into our NHS, with a ban on outsourcing to private companies. Increased funding alone won’t solve the problems being faced by our most vulnerable – only enacting the above changes will. At some point in our lives, we all have an experience with the social care system – as a daughter, I know how difficult it is when this system fails you. As Labour Deputy Leader, I would continue putting pressure on this Tory Government and their poor record on social care. As a society, we must protect our most vulnerable – sadly, nothing prepares you for confronting the worst. As your Deputy Leader, I would work with the Leader of the Labour Party to put the NHS and social care front and centre of our policy going forward. We need to protect our most vulnerable. We need a Labour Government. Labour Campaign for International Development endorses Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan for Deputy Leader30/1/2020\nI am hugely proud and honoured to be nominated for Deputy Leader by the Labour Campaign for International Development.\nAs someone who has worked as an humanitarian doctor in conflict zones across the world, their progressive approach to international development and promotion of global justice is an inspiration. My priority will always be to put human rights and international solidarity at the core of everything I do. Human life should have equal value, no matter where someone comes from. These principles shouldn't just apply to our international development policies, they should be applied to everything we do as the Labour Party. I want to thank the Labour Campaign for International Development for their support and their endorsement. Let's take Labour forward, together. Thank you Doctor Rosena Brexit Might Be Done But The Fight Against Boris Johnson's Destruction Must ContinueAlthough the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback.\nWhen the UK leaves the EU this Friday, 31 January 2020, after 47 years of membership, it will be a sombre day for many of us. For others, it will be a day of celebration. For most people, I suspect they will simply hope we can now move on from talking about Brexit at the expense of everything else. As someone who campaigned with all my heart to stay in the EU, and as the first person on Labour’s front bench to publicly call for a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal, I am desperately sad to see us leaving our friends and allies in Europe. But we are leaving. The disastrous result of the General Election has settled that. This is no longer an argument about Leave or Remain, it’s about what kind of future we want for our country and for our children. That’s where the new fight begins. Boris Johnson wants to pretend he’s now “Got Brexit Done”, and we no longer need to worry about the details. He wants us to simply trust him to sort it all out. Well, I don’t trust him. Neither should you. He talks about “Global Britain” whilst turning his back on vulnerable child refugees. He talks about “Taking Back Control” while reducing parliament’s ability to scrutinise his decisions. He talks about attracting “Global Talent” to the UK while creating huge distress and uncertainty for EU citizens, many of whom have been here for years and who have made their lives in this country. The fight for our internationalist values starts now. It will be long, and it will be difficult, because Boris Johnson has a large majority – but that’s why it’s so important. When it feels like hope is lost, that’s when those of us who believe in progressive values and internationalism need to stand up and fight. If we don’t, no-one else is going to do it for us. We need to stand up and fight for our hard-won workers’ rights. We need to stand up and fight for our environmental protections. Most importantly, we need to stand up and fight for the rights of EU citizens living in this country. They are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues, our family. I work side-by-side with many of them in the NHS, when I work shifts as a doctor in my local A&E department. Under the draconian new immigration laws being bandied around by this government, my own Polish mother might not have been able to move to this country and make a life for herself. Although the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback. That’s one of the main reasons I am running to become the next Deputy Leader. We have huge organisational strength through our membership, through our links with the trade unions and through our MPs and councillors embedded in their local communities. Now is the time to deploy those strengths to maximum effect, to hold the Government to account and ensure that we fight back against every attempt to undercut our rights and freedoms at work, every attempt to weaken our environmental safeguards, every attempt to inject privatisation into our National Health Service. The slogan “Get Brexit Done” might have helped win the election for Boris Johnson, but for those of us who stand against his destructive vision for the future of our country, this fight isn’t done. It’s just getting started. My responses to the questions provided by the Labour Campaign for Free Movement 1. Defend and extend free movement: opposing any reduction in the freedoms of UK and EU citizens to live, work, and access social security in each others’ countries, and any immigration system based on incomes, migrants’ utility to business, and number caps or targets.I am the very embodiment of the benefits free movement has brought – my mother is Polish and was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Under the draconian new immigration policies being discussed by this Tory government, she might never have been able to do that. Protecting and extending free movement is at the very heart of my internationalist Labour principles. I believe our country is stronger and better because of free movement. When I work shifts as an A&E doctor in my local hospital, I work with NHS staff from across Europe and it breaks my heart to see many of them feeling unwanted or undervalued because of Brexit. As Deputy Leader, I pledge to do everything in my power to promote the core Labour values of internationalism and solidarity across borders, because I believe human life has the same value no matter where someone comes from. That means defending and extending free movement, and it means fighting to protect the human rights of migrants from this hostile Tory government. 2. Close every detention centreHolding migrants in detention centres, often in substandard conditions, is incredibly cruel and degrading. These are often vulnerable people, fleeing from a variety of horrific circumstances such as war, trafficking and poverty. They have the right to be treated with dignity, as human beings, as we would want ourselves or our family to be treated in such horrendous circumstances. When working abroad as a humanitarian doctor, I’ve seen first-hand some of the terrible conditions people are forced to endure in detention centres and it horrified me. We must fight back against the hostile environment the Tories have created for migrants – the Labour Party has always stood for international solidarity and openness to the world – we need a Labour government to bring those principles back into the core of our approach to immigration. I would want to listen to expert opinion on how to do this in a responsible way, but I certainly would want to close as many detention centres as possible and make sure we have an overall approach to immigration that means a concept as cruel as detention centres are not required in the first place. 3. Unconditional rights to family reunionYes, I fully support this. The unconditional right to family reunion is a fundamental element of treating migrants as human beings with dignity and equal value, rather than the Tory approach of seeing migrants as a problem to be managed. When I’ve worked as a humanitarian doctor in conflict zones across the world, it was always horrendous to see so many families ripped apart or prevented from seeing each other again. When I visited Palestine on a humanitarian mission, I saw sick children alone in hospital because the permit system meant their parents weren’t allowed to visit them. I immediately began working on ways to resolve this. It’s not enough to just talk about this – we need to be working every day to deliver a Labour government so we can fix these kinds of injustices. That’s what I’d do as Deputy Leader. 4. End “no recourse to public funds” policiesI support ending such policies, yes. This is another case of a Tory government treating migrants not as human beings with human dignity and equal value, but instead as a problem to be managed through cruelty. I want to deliver a Labour government with internationalism at its core, which would allow us to change our entire approach to migration, and begin seeing human life as equally valuable and equally dignified no matter where that person was born or where they’ve come from. 5. Oppose all Hostile Environment measures, use of landlords and public service providers as border guards, and restrictions on migrants’ NHS accessThe Tory Hostile Environment approach to immigration is a stain on the soul of their party, and they should be ashamed of it. Tragedies such as the Windrush scandal are a horrendous demonstration of where this approach leads, and I worry a similar scandal could occur with EU citizens who’ve made their lives in this country. I want a Labour government so we can end the Hostile Environment immediately and start treating migrants with the human dignity and respect they deserve. 6. Equal voting rights for all UK residents I am certainly interested in all ideas for how to revitalise our democracy and increase the level of engagement with our political process. Indeed, prior to the General Election in 2019, I publicly called for EU citizens to get the right to vote. Our Labour values of openness and internationalism must be at the core of everything we do. 7. Please share your thoughts on these wider issues that our supporters also feel strongly about:Even after Brexit, the UK government looks set to participate in Frontex (the European border agency) and its “Fortress Europe” policies. Will you challenge these policies? I certainly think the EU has often failed dismally to strike the right balance between border security and solidarity with people fleeing from war, poverty and the effects of global climate change. I am a proud pro-European, but that doesn’t mean my view of the EU is uncritical and I’ve never been afraid to say so. My values of international solidarity and openness don’t stop at the borders of Europe – they extend across the whole world. Human life always has equal value, no matter where that person comes from. Will you support an amnesty for undocumented migrants resident in the UK? We should always treat people with compassion and dignity, and we must place those values at the heart of everything we do when it comes to immigration. People in this country without documentation are often asylum seekers fleeing from horrific conditions and I want to see them treated with the human dignity they deserve. I would want to listen in more detail to expert opinion and feedback on the specific question of whether an amnesty is the right approach, but the principles of human dignity and compassion must always guide everything we do. Anything else you’d like Labour members, supporters and affiliates to know about what your leadership/deputy leadership would mean for migrants and migration policy? I am the living, breathing proof that free movement is a wonderful benefit to our country. My Polish mother was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Working on the frontlines of the NHS as an A&E doctor, I work alongside colleagues from across Europe and the rest of the world, and they are a credit to our country. It makes me proud to be British. But years of Tory government has created a literal Hostile Environment for migrants in this country. The drawbridge is being pulled up, and the rights of a whole generation of people to travel freely and live, love and work across Europe is being taken away. That is a tragedy, but it also means those of us who are proud of our outward-looking, progressive, internationalist values must fight even harder to protect and extend them. The fight starts now, and as your Deputy Leader (or even if I’m not!), I promise I will always be there fighting alongside you for those values with everything I’ve got. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

We’re fundraising as part of the Time for a Change appeal to help support St George’s Hospital Charity in their work to provide assistance to patients, their families, and the staff who care for them across St George’s Hospital, Queen Mary’s Hospital, and community sites.\nIt’s a 55-mile route from Clapham to Brighton, and we’ll be joined by other fantastic #TeamGeorges participants. Neither of us have done this before and it’s a big challenge for us. The Time for a Change Appeal is supporting children’s services at St George’s Hospital. We know that St George's Trust provides absolutely outstanding care for patients and incredible support for families, but sadly the facilities often don’t reflect this level of care. If you want to support us, our JustGiving link is here: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/fleurandrosenal2b\nAll too often, children are stuck on long waiting lists for mental health treatment and thousands of people are having their referrals closed before an appointment.\nThis Tory Government caused the crisis in mental health services - when will they fix it?\nOn the 75th birthday of the NHS, I joined the amazing team at St George’s Hospital, to say, a big thank you for the incredible care and compassion they show every day. I'm proud to work side-by-side with the team.\nOne of the most important jobs I do as your local Member of Parliament is ensuring that our wonderful communities in Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown, Tooting and Wandsworth Common remain safe and welcoming places to live.\nTo this end, I have recently hosted public meetings with local police leadership in Balham and Furzedown, conducted a walkaround with the Borough Superintendent around the local area, and written to the police on behalf of local residents on a wide range of issues. Please do let me know if you have any concerns regarding crime issues in the local area - my door is always open.\nToday, I appeared on BBC Question Time, where I held the Government to account on the shameful Rwanda policy, their neglect of the NHS, and the issues surrounding Thames Water.\nFor Pride month, Anneliese Dodds MP, Shadow Women and Equalities Secretary, and I brought together mental health and LGBT+ organisations to discuss the challenges facing the mental health of LGBT+ people.\nAs part of National Care Home Week. I recently met some of the incredible staff and residents at Nightingale House in Balham to see first-hand the fantastic work being done in the local community.\nJoining Billy Bragg’s ‘Left Field’ stage at Glastonbury, I spoke about the importance of protecting our NHS. It’s crucial that NHS staff are supported in their work and that patients can access timely treatment.\nIt was great to join Nish Kumar and Coco Khan on Pod Save the UK. We spoke about working on the frontline during the pandemic, Labour’s bold mental health plan, and pitying Matt Hancock.\nSee a clip of the Podcast here:\nThe annual BATCA Fun Day is always good fun - and this year was no exception.

The rot runs right through the force, so no stone can be left unturned in the push for change. I welcome the work that Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has already begun with the new Commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, in addressing these deep-rooted issues and regaining the trust of residents and victims of crime in Tooting. However, under this Home Secretary and this Conservative Government, the Met Police are lacking the leadership, ambition and resources needed to grasp the scale of this challenge. Over the last 13 years, neighbourhood policing has been decimated, whilst prosecutions for violent and sexual crimes have hit the lowest levels on record, and victims of crime are now unsure that if they report a crime, the police will even turn up. It is clear we need a Government with a plan to overhaul policing in London which will deliver cultural and systematic change. Under a Labour Government, we will overhaul policing and raise standards, with strengthened training and mandatory vetting, and the restoration of neighbourhood policing. I would like to thank our hardworking neighbourhood police officers who have always worked constructively with me and for their continuing efforts to keep our local community safe.

It has been a year of change and renewal - full of ups and downs - but as I enter into my ninth year as your Member of Parliament for Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting, it remains the greatest honour of my life to represent the community in which I was born and raised. Entering the new year, I would like to pay tribute to the incredible frontline workers working around the clock to keep the country going through the festive period. From our NHS services to local hospitality staff to food bank volunteers - you all have my heartfelt gratitude for your tireless work this Christmas and throughout the year. A year for democracyWhat a year it has been for elections, both locally and across the country. We began the year with a fantastic win in the Tooting Broadway by-election, increasing the Labour vote share by nearly 7% to a whopping 58% majority. Then came the Mayoral elections in May, when we kept London red by electing my Tooting predecessor Sadiq Khan to a historic third term as Mayor of London. Finally - and most importantly - we finally elected a new Labour Government after 14 long years, with areas up and down the country voting Labour for the very first time. It was humbling to receive the most votes of any Labour MP and thanks must go to everyone who voted for me - your support means the world. £100m to fix Wandsworth PrisonAfter years of campaigning - and countless stories of mismanagement and scandal - the Ministry of Justice announced a £100 million funding package for HMP Wandsworth. This will go a long way to reduce the impact of overcrowding, repair crumbling cell blocks and facilities, and ensure that prison guards can work in a safe environment. Delivering for everyone in TootingThousands of local people have contacted me this year regarding a variety of issues, I have dealt with 15,000 cases. I reclaimed tens of thousands in unpaid pensions or benefits for local people, got decisions on hundreds of delayed passport or visa applications, and helped countless local residents get repairs to their homes. My door is always open and please get in touch if there is anything I can help with. On the NHS frontline\nSpeaking up for Gaza It has now been over a year since the horrific 7th October attacks and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza. The humanitarian disaster we have seen unfold there in the time since, has been truly heartwrenching. This year, I've raised the issue numerous times in Parliament, visited the region in the spring, and held evidence sessions with humanitarian experts. Revitalising Tooting town centre\nThis Morning and Loose Women Using my background as an NHS doctor, I have enjoyed trying my hand at being a TV medic this year! The lovely people at This Morning and Loose Women have had me on many times to talk about a range of topics from mental health to medical emergencies and even gave me space to open up about my own childhood challenges with speech, in a bid to end stigma and help others. Work in Parliament\nKeeping our streets safe in 2024, I successfully campaigned for a tripling of the Tooting neighbourhood policing team, putting more bobbies on our streets. In the summer, Operation Kenny run by the Metropolitan Police resulted in a 70% reduction in crime in Tooting town centre. This work will continue with the new Government's plans to recruit 13,000 new officers and return policing to communities. Cleaning up the local area I have never stopped campaigning for cleaner streets. This year saw a 15% reduction in fly-tipping in Wandsworth, with thousands of fines issued to people dumping their bulky rubbish on our streets. Meanwhile, Wandsworth Labour introduced food recycling for the first time ever in the borough. Free School Meals roll-out\nMental health reform Mental health is incredibly important to me and, for far too long, much-needed reforms were swept under the rug by a Conservative Government that simply wasn't interested. After much hard work, it was fantastic to see reform of the Mental Health Act announced in the King's Speech in July - this was long overdue.\nData from National Rail and the Rail Delivery Group has revealed a shocking rise in the number of late trains at Balham, Earlsfield, Tooting and Wandsworth Common stations. Trains in the morning evening peaks, to and from Central London, have all seen a worsening of their \"on-time percentage\" in the last six months compared to the same period of 2023. The full breakdown of delays at each station is below. It is shocking to see that, not only are trains late at some stations late half the time, but that there has been a steady decline from an already-unacceptable level of lateness last year. Particularly concerning are the figures at Tooting station, where over half of services were late despite there being only two services per hour on that line.\nSome of the worst performing services include: 8:05 from Balham (8:07 from Wandsworth Common) to Victoria - 88% late (Southern) 18:12 from Waterloo to Earlsfield - 81% late (South Western) 8:21 from Balham to Victoria - 79% late (Southern) 8:40 from Balham (8:42 from Wandsworth Common) to Victoria - 76% late (Southern) 8:13 from Tooting to London Blackfriars - 70% late (Thameslink) Local commuters deserve better than the shoddy service they are currently receiving from Southern, South Western and Thameslink. I look forward to the Government's plans to bring our local rail services back into public control, so that our trains are always run with the interests of the people who use them at heart. Following the decision to relocate children's cancer services in South East England away from St George's Hospital, I met with the Health Secretary with a cross-party group of MPs to raise our concerns.\nWhen I visited the Pinckney Ward where this care is conducted, I met with Jackson, a former patient there, and his parents, who told me that such a move would be detrimental for parents, children and the hospital alike. I have urged the Secretary to review and reconsider NHS England's decision as soon as possible. Eight years ago today, I was selected as the Tooting Labour candidate for the by-election caused by Sadiq becoming a candidate for Mayor of London.\nIt has been a huge honour and privilege to serve as the representative for the community in which I was born and raised. My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has supported me on this incredible journey. New data published by the Environment Agency recently revealed that sewage was pumped in our local rivers, the Graveney and Wandle, for over 700 hours last year. This is equivalent to the entire month of February and demonstrates this Tory Government's complete disregard for our natural environment.\nOnly Labour has a plan to clean up our waterways and hold water companies to account by fines for illegal discharges, blocking bonuses for bosses of companies that violate the rules and holding these bosses personally criminally liable for any violations. Yesterday, I was delighted to join CEN for their Healing our Broken Village Black Mental Health Conference at the New Testament Assembly church in Tooting.\nWith continued racial disparities in sectioning and the use of community treatment orders, more must be done to bring about much-needed change. One of the most fulfilling parts of my role as your MP is helping local people solve problems and, in this case, save money.\nA Furzedown pensioner had been denied over £12,000 in backdated pension payments and Pension Credit, however following my intervention with the Department for Work and Pensions, this money was recouped. If you have a problem with your state benefits or pension, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me and I'd be happy to help. I wish everyone in Tooting and beyond a peaceful and blessed Eid. My thoughts and prayers are especially with all those facing hardship and suffering at this time.\nThis morning, I invited residents from Tooting to share a cup of tea and a biscuit at my local coffee morning. As the local MP, I am here to help and my door is always open.\nToday's announcement by NHS England that children's cancer services will be moved away from the world-class unit at St George's Hospital is profoundly disappointing.\nAs a doctor, I am clear that this decision has not been made in the interests of patients or their families and we're losing more than 25 years of expertise in the field of children's cancer care. I'm calling on the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Victoria Atkins to immediately review this decision. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

We chatted about the appalling comments made by a Tory donor about Diane Abbott and extremism in the UK.\nWe have heard lots about the Government's heartless Rwanda scheme. This circus is the latest saga in the Tory melodrama, but it is the most vulnerable people whose lives they're playing with. Britain is better than this cruel, cynical Tory Government. I have worked with refugees for more than a decade. I have heard their experiences of war, violence and terror. Nobody leaves their homes, communities and livelihoods unless they must. That is why I will always stand against the inhumane Rwanda Bill.\nOver recent weeks, I have been appalled at the Tory's unworkable, unethical plans to house asylum seekers on a barge in Dorset.\nThe Government failed to listen to well-founded concerns or even carry out basic checks of the water supply, which was contaminated with Legionella bacteria, putting both asylum-seekers and staff at-risk. The Tories have serious questions to answer about the safety of this project and should stop wasting taxpayer's money pursuing headlines and instead fix this broken asylum system.\nBaroness Casey's independent findings of racist, misogynistic, and homophobic abuses of power within the Met Police are deeply shocking and will leave many residents in Tooting concerned that the trust between the police and our community has been shattered.\nIt is clear that there is a failure of leadership from the Home Office and today's report lays bare the scale of the challenge needed to reform the Met Police. The rot runs right through the force, so no stone can be left unturned in the push for change. I welcome the work that Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has already begun with the new Commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, in addressing these deep-rooted issues and regaining the trust of residents and victims of crime in Tooting.

It is clear we need a Government with a plan to overhaul policing in London which will deliver cultural and systematic change. Under a Labour Government, we will overhaul policing and raise standards, with strengthened training and mandatory vetting, and the restoration of neighbourhood policing. I would like to thank our hardworking neighbourhood police officers who have always worked constructively with me and for their continuing efforts to keep our local community safe. The story of a Ukrainian family who wants to come to live in Furzedown recently made national news! Oksana and her young son Dmytro have a sponsor ready and willing to welcome them into their home in the local area, however Home Office delays have stopped them travelling to safety in the United Kingdom.\nIt is inspiring and heartwarming to see the generosity shown by the British public in welcoming Ukrainian refugees into their lives, however Oksana and Dmytro have been let down badly by the Home Office. They applied to come to the UK in September last year and, so far, the Home Office have refused to provide a timeframe for a decision to both myself and their sponsor's solicitors. This is simply not good enough and the Government must get a grip. Our latest research, shows that in 2021/22, the total number of days lost to poor mental health has doubled to more than 730,000 over the last decade. This comes at the same time that there has been a drop in the number of neighbourhood police officers by 6,000 and of Police Community Support Officers by 8,500.\nThese absences equate to over 2,000 police officers being off sick each day, last year alone, due to poor mental health. It is clear that this Conservative Government has presided over 13 years of neglect and staff shortages that have left our public services at breaking point. The next Labour Government will recruit 8,500 more mental health professionals, ensuring a million more patients get treated each year; and we will rebuild neighbourhood policing, delivering a package of 13,000 extra neighbourhood officers and PCSOs, putting police back on the beat. Read the full story here Last week, I asked the Government how many enquiries to the Home Office from MPs are outstanding and how many older than six months are awaiting a reply.\nIt was incredibly disheartening, although not surprising, to learn that over 10,000 case enquiries have not been answered by the Home Office with nearly 1,000 of those waiting longer than six months. These enquiries cover urgent and compassionate cases and it is simply unacceptable that the Government have allowed such a huge backlog to accumulate. These are people’s lives, with their family lives and jobs often dependent on Home Office decisions – the Government simply has to get a grip. To see these questions, follow the links here and here. Such an incredible honour to have volunteered with the Care4Calais team in Calais and Dunkirk. Their compassion and work ethic is second to none and they do so much to help and support those who have lost everything, in the most difficult of circumstances. Care4Calais is a refugee crisis charity that helps with delivering essential aid and support, such as food and medical supplies, to refugees living in the UK, France, and Belgium. So glad that I could be a part of this experience to help with the crisis in Calais. Our Tooting community always comes together in the face of adversity, and I know many local residents will want to help those impacted by the current situation in Afghanistan in any way they can. That is why I have compiled a list of organisations and charities currently working to support Afghan refugees:\nTo provide refugee accommodation: Refugees at Home: UK charity which connects those with a spare room with refugees and asylum seekers in need of somewhere to stay. Apply to be a host here. Room for Refugees: Community hosting network that offers safe, temporary homes and emotional support for insecurely-housed refugees, asylum seekers and vulnerable groups - families, the sick, the elderly and unaccompanied asylum seeking children with no recourse to public funds. Apply to offer accommodation here. Wandsworth Borough Council: Residents, businesses, or other landlords who could offer a property for new arrivals are being asked to register their details - they are particularly keen to hear from those with 3 to 4 bedroom properties available. To offer accommodation, contact Wandsworth Borough Council via email at [email protected]k or by phone on 020 8871 7333. Local Organisations: Care4Calais: Asking for volunteers, financial donations and donations clothes, shoes, phones or other essentials at drop off points:\nNational Organisations: Choose Love: Supporting projects providing vital aid and services to Afghan people who have fled the country: clothes, shelter, support for children and groups protecting women and children’s rights.\nBritish Red Cross: Calling for donations to help staff and volunteers provide emotional support and essential items, including warm clothes, blankets, soap, toothbrushes and nappies.\nSave the Children: Calling for donations to an emergency fund.\nAction Aid: Calling for emergency donations to help charity provide emergency humanitarian assistance including food, water, and essential items such as hygiene kits, cash, tarpaulins, tents, cooking utensils, clothing, and bedding.\nAfghanaid: Afghanaid is a British humanitarian and development organisation, currently asking for donations to assist response to the Afghan crisis\nUNICEF: Raising money to support children in Afghanistan\nUNHCR: Calling for donations to help the organisation in the distribution of family tents, hygiene kits, core relief items like blankets, sleeping mats and kitchen sets.\nThe Big Give: Delivering emergency support to families whose lives have been destroyed or uprooted by the conflict.\nMuslim Aid: Calling for donations to Afghanistan Emergency Appeal.\nIslamic Relief: Calling for donations to aid Afghan’s on the ground in Afghanistan, and when they come to the UK.\nDoctors Without Borders: The MSF teams are responding to the crisis in Afghanistan, providing medical aid, expertise and life-saving supplies during the escalating crisis. Donate here.

With so many households already feeling the squeeze, it’s crucial that we work together to tackle poverty. Representatives from Earlsfield and Wandsworth foodbanks as well as Dons Local Action Group and Little Village Tooting told me that they are seeing unprecedented demand at present, as more and more of those who were just-about-managing become unable to afford the basics. All the organisations represented spoke of the added difficulties the rise in energy prices have brought. The hike in energy prices has meant that even the local charities who are there to address the crisis are struggling to pay their bills, and this means they are less able to help those in need. This comes at the worst possible time, when demand is at it’s highest level for decades. Everyone at the event had numerous stories of people facing hardship, people in overcrowded accommodation, people not being able to put food on the table or buy school uniforms for their children. Many people are also concerned about how they will meet the additional cost of christmas. Despite heartbreaking stories, it was uplifting to see so many people who donate their time, energy and money into making things better for people in our community. I am always amazed by the generosity of people in Tooting. However, in Britain in 2022 these organisations and charitable schemes shouldn’t have to exist. It is imperative that the Government take action immediately to support people through the months ahead. It was great to attend and speak at the annual Balham and Tooting Community Association’s multi-faith peace ceremony in Tooting Broadway.\nLocal people of all faiths and none gathered to celebrate all that unites us. We heard prayers and moving speeches from leaders of six different faiths and school students. I love representing a community where so many faiths are represented. People of all faiths and none live and work alongside each other in our community and I was honoured to be part of such a joyous occasion that celebrates our diversity and our commitment to common values of tolerance and understanding. Leaders from Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh communities spoke and prayed in their own traditions. Senior school pupils from Al Risalah Girls Secondary School spoke of what their faith means to them and their hopes for peace. This event has taken place in Tooting for many years now and it’s always an inspiring and uplifting event that I look forward to attending. It’s always fantastic to see our community come together. Thank you to all who attending and to those who worked so hard to make this event a success. There were so many fantastic events across Tooting to celebrate Black History Month, which is celebrated in October.\nIt was great to see Wandsworth Council celebrate the contributions of black business owners, and other influential members of the blakc community make to our borough. Many of our local libraries were host to brilliant events where black authors could share their stories with the community. A series of videos published online celebrated the brilliant contributions to local creative industries. I know that many residents particularly enjoyed the pop up street food event celebrating some of the best cuisine from across Africa and the Caribbean. My personal highlight was attending the Roots and Culture event in Tooting, where dancers, musicians, poetry, comedy, and fantastic street food stalls showed some of the best of African and Caribbean culture. It was great to see how well attended all these events were, and great to see our community coming together to celebrate the cultures of the black communities here in Tooting. Thank you to everyone who attended and helped to organise these events! It is an honour to have been unanimously re-selected by all the local party branches and affiliated organisations to stand as Labour’s candidate for Tooting in the next general election.\nI want to say a huge thank you to all the members and affiliates who took part, and who continue to put their trust in me to represent our community. Serving as the Member of Parliament for the community I grew up in is an honour. From helping local residents with casework, playing a part in winning the council, defending our NHS and serving as the shadow Minister to Mental Health - I have the best job in the world. My job is made even greater by the fantastic support local members show me all year round, so I want to take this opportunity to say a big thank you to them all! The next election is make-or-break for our party, we simply must win. I’m looking forward to working hard to make this happen. The NHS is being dismantled, I see it every time I work a shift. More people than ever are relying on foodbanks, and the cost-of-living crisis is having a devastating impact on people locally and across the country. I will be absolutely committed to doing everything I can to put Labour into Government and make the changes this country so desperately needs. Thank you again to everyone who voted. Tooting Bec Athletics Track reopened this summer after a successful community campaign against its closure. It was great to be at their official reopening along with local Councillor Judi Gasser.\nIt was great to meet some young athletes and see the wide range of facilities that they offer, including a seven-a-side football pitch, an eight lane track, and a state of the art fitness centre. I am so grateful we have this brilliant resource on our doorstep in Tooting. The fantastic facilities at Tooting Bec Athletics Track will be vital in helping Tooting’s children become the Olympians of tomorrow. I have no doubt that future Team GB medalists are already training here and I look forward to seeing what they all go on to achieve. Yesterday, my friend Rex Osborn was elected to Wandsworth Council for Tooting Broadway with a whopping 62% of the vote!\nRex has been a constant in my political life – he was the Labour leader on the council when I was elected in 2014 and I served as his deputy. Rex was the one who urged me to run for selection as an MP and has been with me every step of the way since. Tooting has gained a fantastic voice on the council, who will prioritise our town centres, ensure a fairer deal for renters and push for increased cost-of-living support. This election took place under tragic circumstances, following the sad passing of Councillor Andy Gibbons, who served this area faithfully for 28 years. However, I could not think of a better person to represent Tooting in the Town Hall in Andy’s stead and I look forward to working closely with Rex to honour Andy’s legacy. It was a pleasure to invite Royal Mahal, led by Adil Javid, to the Tooting Heroes Awards in Parliament on Monday.\nAdil, and his team, have provided exemplary services to our community, delivering free food parcels to the homeless; supported soup kitchens in Tooting, Balham, Croydon, Norbury, and Purley; provided free school meals to children unable to afford a hot meal and emergency public services, namely the NHS, Police and Fire Services. I would like to send my personal thanks to the Royal Mahal team for being a shining example of a successful local business and key community hub. On behalf of the Tooting community, I wish them the best of luck in continuing to do so. On Monday 13 June, I was delighted to welcome organisations and individuals from across Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting to Parliament, in order to recognise their fantastic contributions to society in the face of adversity in the last few years. It was a sheer joy to see the pillars of our communities together in one place and I look forward to continuing to collaborate and support the inspiring people who do so much for the local area.\nI presented the following organisations and individuals with trophies for truly exceptional services in the community: Councillor Andy Gibbons, for his dedicated public service over the last three decades.

I would like to thank all those who attended - I cannot overstate how proud I am of our community. Each and every one of you is a true Tooting Hero. 44 years of Tory rule in Wandsworth came to an end with Labour taking control of the Council after the local elections. Labour won 35 seats, whilst the Tories won 22. I was thrilled to play a part along with our fantastic Councillors, candidates, and activists in putting Labour into power locally.\nLabour’s historic victory here represents a new start for our borough, and it’s great to see Wandsworth’s group of Labour Councillors already taking action to help residents through the cost-of-living crisis. Talking to residents right across the borough, it was obvious to see that people in Wandsworth have rejected Conservative neglect both locally and nationally. The cost of living crisis is hitting residents hard, and it’s clear the Tories aren’t doing enough to address it. Wandsworth residents simply do not trust the Tories. The road to Labour in Government runs through our local councils, and I am hopeful this local victory will be the springboard to Labour’s general election victory. The Local Elections are hastily approaching on 5th May. After 44 long years of Tory rule, Wandsworth needs a breath of fresh air and a Labour council.\nOver the next four weeks, I will be out on the campaign trail - knocking on doors, delivering leaflets and working to help our fantastic Labour candidates. I would like to thank all the local residents for their support and warm welcome on the doorstep. Together we can turn Labour red this May! |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_local_12/content_696.html": "|\nOn the eve of Tokyo 2020, Tooting is preparing to celebrate a hero of the Antwerp Games a century earlier - champion middle-distance runner Albert Hill. Hill, who took gold at the 1920 Olympics, was born and raised in Tooting. A blue plaque commemorating his outstanding achievements is now set to be erected outside his former home. The plaque was funded through community donations, and is the result of the tireless efforts of the students of Fircroft Primary School, who campaigned for its creation. Local historian Geoff Simmons said, “It’s great that Great Britain’s Olympic past is being honoured, but its future is under threat. Tooting Bec Athletics Track, home to the historic athletics club Herne Hill Harriers, and used by 80,000 young people every year, has been ruled unfit for competition and is in need of repair.” Click here to sign the petition calling on Wandsworth Tories to fund vital repairs to Tooting Track. Balham has a long and proud history, and its architecture is of real importance to the local community; and Balham Railway Bridge is a prominent and important feature of this historical architecture. Unfortunately in recent years, the bridge’s grandeur has sadly faded beyond all recognition. I recently spoke with the local community group Beautify Balham who have made suggestions, such as painting the bridge an attractive colour, re-painting the metal columns, and installing up-lighting to showcase the bridge. I am wholly supportive of these suggestions. As such, I wrote to Network Rail, asking them to consider incorporating these simple yet impactful improvements as part of the £2.6 million investment they have committed to restore Balham Station. Swift action was taken and I was delighted to hear that the Bridge has had its first coat of paint! It has been a pleasure to support the wonderful Beautify Balham volunteers with this campaign and I would like to especially thank Councillor Clare Fraser, who works so hard to support local residents. On Sunday I had the great honour of presenting the medals and winners’ trophy to the Sinjun Grammarians under 12s cricket team - 2021 champions of the Surrey Tier Three League. Masterfully managed by Mukesh Dev, and captained with distinction by Rufus Ford, the team’s achievement is all the more remarkable on account of the club’s small size – with a membership of just over 50 junior players, Sinjun Grammarians rarely have enough players in the same age group to enter into league competitions. Their success is also astounding for the fact that the playing group, who were experiencing league competition for the first time, marched to the title unbeaten in all their 10 games. I could not be more proud of this group of talented young athletes, not only for overcoming the odds and taking the title so convincingly, but for the focus, determination, sportsmanship, and teamwork they showed along the way. This is what Tooting is all about: the players are truly a credit to themselves, their families, their club, and our community. I was absolutely bowled over by the Club’s decision to award me the title of Honorary President of Sinjun Grammarians Cricket Club. This success is undoubtedly the first of many such achievements for this passionate group of young cricketers, and I look forward to celebrating with them again in coming seasons. Well done, team! On Sunday, I was back in A&E working in the run up to the England v Italy match. While, unfortunately, it did not come home, it was great to spend time with hard-working colleagues at St Georges. With infections and hospitalisations increasing, it’s still incredibly important for us all to look out for one another and play our part in stopping the spread of the virus. Earlier this week, the Prime Minister gave an update on moving to stage four of the coronavirus easing roadmap. This means that from 19 July, the following will apply:\nUnderstandably, many are worried about the repercussions of these eased restrictions. Indeed, many residents have been in touch regarding the use of face coverings on public transport and their anxieties surrounding this. On Wednesday, Sadiq Khan announced that face coverings will remain mandatory for all, unless exempt, when travelling on the TfL network. This will, no doubt, be a relief to many in the local area, and I pay tribute to the Mayor of London in taking a firm stand against the Government’s recklessness. Labour is calling for a controlled approach that keeps in place baseline measures that can push down infections, like mandatory face masks on public transport – which we know protect people, reduce the spread of the virus, and don’t harm the economy. By removing mask requirements - the Johnson Variant is being fast-tracked. Cases will soar, as will hospitalisations. Everyone in Tooting has been fantastic in reducing the spread of coronavirus. With one of the highest vaccination rates in London, I can only ask residents to continue looking out for one another. The future of Tooting Bec Athletics Track is still yet to be secured, with vital repairs still needing to be undertaken. Tooting Bec Athletics Track is a much-loved and well-utilised facility, both by local residents and the wider London community. The track is a home to schools, clubs such as Herne Hill Harriers, as well as aspiring athletes. To lose such a valuable asset would be a devastating blow to so many of our young people in our local area. Top British athletes are made at Tooting Bec Athletics Track - Jade Johnson, who represented Great Britain at two Olympics, trained at the track since childhood, as has Katie Snowden, who will represent Great Britain in Tokyo next month. By allowing the track to fall into disrepair, Wandsworth Tories are destroying the legacy of London 2012, and seriously damaging the chances of our next generation of Olympic hopefuls in the process. The deadline for the petition to save Tooting Bec Athletics Track has been extended until 1 August – click here to sign and show Wandsworth Tories how much our community cares about the future of our young people. This week, I was honoured to present Dons Local Action Group with the cheque of money raised through my Euro 2020 raffle. I’m so proud that our community has, once again, come together. The response was truly overwhelming, and in only four days we were able to raise £1,270 in much-needed funds for the Dons Local Action Group They’re an incredible local charity and I know they’ll be able to do a lot of good for so many families and young people with the money raised. A huge thank you to everyone who bought a ticket! Worryingly, coronavirus rates are soaring once again across London. The vaccine is our best defence. If you are yet to receive either your first or second dose, please do so as soon as possible. To help get Tooting vaccinated, the Pearl Chemist Vaccination Centre is now offering a walk-in clinic for those aged 18+ at St Boniface Church on Mitcham Road (Monday to Saturday 9-5pm). Appointments are available for first doses as well as second doses. Second doses can be given eight weeks after the first. Any questions can be directed to Pearl Chemist on 0208 049 6640. With the re-opening of non-essential retail, I took the opportunity to shine a spotlight on the local businesses/business owners that make our vibrant community such a fantastic place to live and work. The easing of national Government restrictions marks an important point in our recovery - our community and high street have so much to offer, so for six weeks I showcased the stores, restaurants, cafes, and other small businesses that make Tooting what it is! A huge thank you to every single business, business owner, employee, and customer who got behind the campaign. The past year has been challenging, so to see our community come together to support the local economy has been truly heartwarming. While this week marks the final instalment (for now) of Spotlight Saturdays, I will continue to find new ways to shine a bright light on Tooting and our wonderful community. Wandsworth is in the top 5 for vaccination rates across London! This is a great step forward and I am proud of everyone here in Tooting who has taken the steps to protect themselves and others by receiving their jab. However, we still have a way to go before everyone is protected against coronavirus. We need to keep pushing to ensure that those who can do so, are vaccinated as soon as possible. Information on how to book your vaccination appointment can be found here. It is also vital that if, for any reason, you have to change or cancel your vaccine appointment that you let the GP surgery or vaccination centre that you appointment is booked with know. You can manage your vaccination appointment here. If you are still unsure about having the jab or have any questions, more information can be found on the vaccine and answers to many common concerns on Wandsworth Council’s website here. I was deeply concerned - as I know many local residents were - to hear of plans to close Balham station to outward passengers from next Monday until December 2021. While I recognise the scheduled repairs to the escalator are essential works, it is important to me that residents are not inconvenienced by the planned updates. Indeed, I also appreciate that it was alarming for many to learn that the closure was to begin in less than a week, lasting for such an extended period of time. It is my understanding that the decision to close Balham station to outward travelling passengers was taken after a trial closure of the downward escalator indicated that use of the staircase at peak travel times was resulting in over-crowding and therefore social distancing was difficult. I called a meeting with Transport for London to outline my concerns and discuss alternatives, such as more staff at the station to support social distancing at peak travel times. I am pleased to announce that as a result of this meeting, TfL have agreed to undertake a week-long trial at Balham Station, which will see the staircase open for use throughout the day and outward travel therefore possible from the station. The trial will commence on Monday 28th June and last 3-4 days. Following the trial, TfL will assess whether outward travel from Balham during the planned escalator repairs is viable. During this time - and beyond should the trial prove successful - I would recommend additional time is allowed for travel through Balham Station. By doing so, we increase the likelihood of a successful trial. More importantly, we can all play our part to ensure all residents can travel safely. Please check back for further updates on this situation. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_all_32/content_737.html": "|\nLast week the Balham and Tooting Community Association (BATCA) celebrated its 15th anniversary.\nBATCA is a network of diverse individuals and organisations committed to creating a cohesive, thriving community in Balham and Tooting. Their annual events – the Fun Day on Broadwater Road, the Tooting Broadway Peace Ceremony, and the Community Heroes Awards – are local institutions. BATCA have continued their good works throughout the pandemic, moving events online and acting as a platform for groups to share news and information. BATCA are always looking to welcome new members to help them further the organisation’s aims. Click here to find out more, and to join this wonderful collective. It was a pleasure to join Basildon Councillor Gavin Callaghan as well as local Basildon organisations to talk about mental health this week. Coronavirus has had a profound impact on our mental health support services and it is always great to see a local authority listen to and work with local organisations on the front line providing help where it is most needed. We need to take inspiration from Basildon Council and create an environment at a national level where community organisations and peer support groups work in tandem with local authorities and local health services. A huge thank you to Kim Bailey of Purple Genie Life Coaching, Karen Pullen of Craig Tyler Trust, Jonathan Barrow of Sociability, and Alison Cunningham of The Listening Post, for taking part. The recent vigil on Clapham Common was our chance to come together and grieve the loss of Sarah Everard's life. Our chance to mourn the lives of the women lost to violence. And it was a chance to mourn our own lived experiences. I share the frustrations and disappointment felt over police action taken that day. In light of events at Clapham Common, I know many are concerned about the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, and what this divisive law would mean for the right to protest. I want to be clear: Tonight, I will be voting against this Bill. I believe that the Government has undermined this Bill through draconian measures that impose disproportionate controls on free expression and the right to protest. I believe these measures will have an unfair impact on Black, Asian, and ethnic minority people. I also believe 10 year sentences for crimes against statues – significantly longer than the sentences for crimes which disproportionately impact women – is a worrying priority. Under this Government, rape convictions have fallen to an all-time low, delays in the Crown Courts are at an all-time high, and justice is not being served for thousands of women and girls. This is now the time for the Government to correct their woeful record and commit to putting in place long overdue protections for women. In light of the recent tragic events, many residents have been in touch to share their concerns about the lighting in Tooting and Wandsworth Commons. Indeed, many women feel unable to use the Commons in the evening due to the poor lighting, whereby many of the paths are unlit. All our local residents, including women, should feel safe to access these vital green spaces, which is why I have written to Paul Chadwick, Director Environment and Community Services at Wandsworth Council, and Neil Blackley, Head of Parks at Enable, who manage Wandsworth’s green spaces on the Council’s behalf, calling for action to improve the lighting across both sites as quickly as possible. Please check back here for updates on the Council’s response. Our hearts go out to Sarah Everard's friends and family at this unspeakably difficult time. My statement on this and the #ReclaimTheseStreets vigil here: As we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel, many of our Tooting community are looking forward to spending time with our loved ones once again. However – for a variety of reasons – not all of us have this opportunity.\nOnly one in five children spend time with their grandparents, whilst half a million people aged 65+ go at least five days without seeing or speaking to anyone, this is a fantastic organisation. The Wiser Collective – a local intergenerational community initiative that connects older people with younger families who can benefit from their skills and experience – was formed in 2018. Before the pandemic, The Wiser Collective hosted a variety of local events to combat loneliness across the generations, including the monthly ‘Skill Share Saturdays’, where neighbours of different generations meet to make new local friends, share talents, hobbies, passions, and chat over tea and cake. During the lockdown, the group helped the elderly with shopping deliveries, the collection of prescriptions, and stopped by for doorstep chats. To find out more and get involved with this wonderful organisation, visit their website: thewisercollective.com/ Many residents are concerned about air quality, both locally and nationwide, so I know it will likely be of interest to know that clean air routes are coming to Tooting.\nClean air routes provide an alternative to the busier, more polluted commuter routes for those travelling by foot or by bike. This great new initiative allows commuters to significantly reduce their exposure to air pollution while also enjoying the beauty of our local green spaces. Working with St. George’s hospital, the Cross River Partnership (CRP) has developed a route from Tooting Broadway Station to St George's which will offer a cleaner alternative for staff, patients, and visitors alike. For more information about this clean air routes, as well as others across London, see here. I recognise that having a vaccine might be unfamiliar for some people and that many have questions about what it's like. Working as an A&E doctor at St George’s Hospital throughout the pandemic, I was lucky enough to receive the first dose of the vaccine in January. Receiving my second dose this week, I want to show you exactly what happens when you go for your vaccine. The sooner the vaccine is rolled out, the sooner we can begin to rebuild - together. While we cannot celebrate in person this year, this International Women's Day I'm celebrating the women who make Tooting such an incredible place to live. I am beyond proud to represent an area with an array of admirable, determined and strong women from so many different backgrounds. Please join me in thanking those mentioned below, and all the women who play an important role in your life. In 1912, Tooting dressmaker and suffragette Lillian Ball was arrested and sentenced for two months hard labour for her involvement in a window-smashing campaign in March 1912, with around 150 other women in London’s west-end. Being a working-class mother of three, it is said that Lillian received a harsher sentence than other suffragettes from wealthier backgrounds. During her time in prison completing the hard labour sentence, she recounted that she was blackmailed and coerced by senior police officers to give evidence against some of the key leaders of the suffragette movement. To think of everything Lillian sacrificed for women like myself to put a cross in the ballot box, makes me exceptionally proud to think of all we have achieved in Wandsworth since then. All MPs in Wandsworth are women and we have 10 female councillors in Tooting alone. I am also exceptionally proud to work for our NHS, where 77% of the workforce is made up of women. It was only in 1892 that The British Medical Association formally accepted female doctors into their register, and in 1948, under Attlee’s NHS reforms, it was required by law that a ‘reasonable proportion’ of medical students were women. My colleagues in St George’s, and beyond, are a true testament to what our health service embodies. And within our local community, I am proud of the women who have gone above and beyond to aid those in need. In 2016, the first Little Village baby bank was founded in Balham to provide families in need with baby clothes and equipment, such as cots, bottles and sterilisers. In 2020, they helped an estimated 6590 children and have now set up banks across Wandsworth, Camden and Southwark. Founder Sophia is a busy mum-of-three herself and has inspired many across the country, including royalty! Since 2020, the Duchess of Cambridge has supported the aims of Little Village and recently spoke to service users at the fifth anniversary of the organisation. I am also proud of the efforts of Tooting Community Kitchen to support those in need of a hot meal or drink. Sahar Beg founded the Tooting Community Kitchen in 2018, inspired by her mum’s love for cooking, and has been providing hot food and drink to those in need ever since. The community owes a great deal to Sahar’s commitment to helping others and I for one am proud to know her and support her efforts. Finally, I would like to pay tribute to two amazing young women in the constituency, whose campaigns have helped many others. Hope Virgo is the founder of the #DumpTheScales campaign, which calls on the Government to review eating disorder guidance delivered by clinicians. She is open about her journey with anorexia and now supports young people, parents and educational staff understand eating disorders in more detail. Tooting’s own Kate Isaacs founded the ‘Not Your Porn’ campaign after her friend was a victim of revenge porn, and has been fighting against companies profiteering from revenge porn since. For those who do not know what revenge porn is, it is the sharing of private sexual materials with intent to cause distress, typically without consent. Indeed, in 2020, the UK’s specialist revenge porn helpline recorded its busiest ever year with 2700 calls. Last of all, I would like to send a message to all the women in Tooting. No matter what your background, race, gender or identity, you have the power to be a force for change. Look up to the outstanding role models we have in Tooting and most importantly, be proud of who you are.\nFor months, Labour have been calling on the Government to make the £20 uplift to Universal Credit permanent This increase has been a lifeline for many at a time where families across the country are struggling to make ends meet. In many cases, this extra money is the difference between being able to pay for the gas, electricity, or internet bill. Indeed, a report by the Resolution Foundation think-tank has warned that any cut would see a further 1.2 million people, including 400,000 children, fall into relative poverty.\nWhile the Government never turned up to vote on Labour’s motion at the February Opposition Day debate, it is generally convention that the Government implements successful opposition day votes. We are therefore pleased that the Chancellor decided to extend the £20 uplift for another six months. While disappointing that this is not a permanent measure, I know this will bring much needed reassurance to many. Given the number of families I know are struggling at the moment, I have included some links below which I hope will be of use:\nFor mental health issues and support, you can always phone Samaritans on 116 123 or email [email protected] I hope this information is useful and, please remember, if you are struggling at the moment - you are not alone. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

The specialist contractors managing the clean-up report that the river is looking much better today, with very little visible oil sheen remaining and no further oil being washed from vegetation along the riverbanks. The Environment Agency tells me that, due to the swift response of multiple agencies, including the emergency services, local authorities, and charities, the impact on the environment around the Wandle appears to be minimal. Thankfully, the number of affected wildlife remains low. The few wild birds that have been impacted are being cared for by the RSPCA. No fish mortalities have been reported, and the fish populations in the Wandle appear to remain healthy. Investigations into this incident are ongoing, and options for enforcement are being considered by the Environment Agency and its partners. People are still urged to be cautious and keep pets away from the water and angling is not recommended for the time being. If you see any further signs of diesel around the Wandle, please contact the Environment Agency on its 24/7 incident number: 0800 807060 or via email at [email protected]. The Environment Agency continue to keep me updated about the recent oil spill into the River Wandle. The Environment Agency, along with emergency services, Thames Water, the RSPB, and local authorities, are actively working on containment and clean-up efforts.\nKey Points:\nMy office will continue to monitor the situation and I will provide any updates as they come in. Yesterday, I became aware that an incident had occurred on the River Wandle where diesel oil had spilled from a bus depot in Thornton Heath into the river.\nThe Wandle is a vital ecosystem, and is home to a range of wildbirds, fish, frogs and toads. It is critical to protect this pocket of wildlife and to ensure the progress made in bringing the river back to life is not allowed to slide backwards. I have been in contact with the Environment Agency who tell me that they are working to assess the impact of the oil on water quality and wildlife along the course of the river, as well as putting in place plans to extract the oil from the river. This remedial work will continue over the coming days. The Environment Agency advises local residents to report any oil spotted in the river to the Environment Agency's emergency hotline by phone 0800 807060 or email [email protected] Today, in Parliament, I launched the All Party Parliamentary Group on Emergency Care. As a doctor at the A&E in St George's, I know my colleagues up and down the country work tirelessly to provide the highest standards of care for their patients in some of the most difficult of circumstances.\nOur group of Parliamentarians is committed to fighting to improve emergency care at every level. We will be hearing from experts, publishing reports and making sure that the importance of emergency care is highlighted in Government policy. Every year, over 12 million passengers travel to and from Tooting Broadway, yet if you have difficulties getting around, have a buggy or are carrying lots of luggage, it remains inaccessible to many.\nTfL is currently looking at making Tooting Broadway step-free.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_deputy-leadership-campaign_2/content_259.html": "|\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan: As a doctor and as a daughter I know social care is broken.\nThe deputy leadership candidate has spoken about the horror of finding her dad - who has dementia- injured and not knowing what happened. She wants to make sure no other family has to suffer that way. Nothing prepares you for finding your loved one bruised and blooded. Nothing prepares you for never finding answers. This is the reality that every day, so many people are living through, across the UK, because of the nature of the social care system. Nothing prepared me for being one of the statistics. My father has fronto-temporal dementia – he cannot communicate his thoughts but he is fully aware of what is happening. My brother and I found him bloodied and bruised on more than one occasion, we have sought answers but we know that we will never find them. He is safe now, but his health has deteriorated massively and has affected his life expectancy. This is not just my reality. This is the reality for so many others across the country. I am lucky. I was able to call a debate last year and get The Mirror to cover my family’s journey. Most people don’t have that luxury. Instead, they’re left fighting the social care system. I’ve been on both sides. As an aggrieved family member and a local politician with a responsibility for social care, I’ve seen the strife that goes into placements on both sides. The system is failing our most vulnerable residents. As it stands, the social care system is not fit for purpose. The Tories promised in their manifesto that they would tackle social care. It’s been three years – and yet still no Green Paper, despite countless promises. Last week, in Parliament, I asked the Health Secretary how many more families will suffer before the Government looks to reform the social care system. There was no answer. As an A&E doctor, who regularly sees vulnerable older people stranded in hospital because they don’t have access to adequate social care, and as a daughter, who’s had to go through this process, I have the following recommendations: - A truly independent complaints process – formal complaints should not have to go through the care provider or local authority who the complaint is against. - A reformed process for awarding care contracts – to ensure that failing companies cannot simply change their name and continue providing inadequate care. - An Independent Advocate for Older People – to protect and promote the rights of older people. - Mandatory CCTV with an opt-out – CCTV in communal areas within care homes should be mandatory to provide evidence of any unacceptable behaviour in a care setting. - A fully funded social care system, integrated into our NHS, with a ban on outsourcing to private companies. Increased funding alone won’t solve the problems being faced by our most vulnerable – only enacting the above changes will. At some point in our lives, we all have an experience with the social care system – as a daughter, I know how difficult it is when this system fails you. As Labour Deputy Leader, I would continue putting pressure on this Tory Government and their poor record on social care. As a society, we must protect our most vulnerable – sadly, nothing prepares you for confronting the worst. As your Deputy Leader, I would work with the Leader of the Labour Party to put the NHS and social care front and centre of our policy going forward. We need to protect our most vulnerable. We need a Labour Government. Labour Campaign for International Development endorses Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan for Deputy Leader30/1/2020\nI am hugely proud and honoured to be nominated for Deputy Leader by the Labour Campaign for International Development.\nAs someone who has worked as an humanitarian doctor in conflict zones across the world, their progressive approach to international development and promotion of global justice is an inspiration. My priority will always be to put human rights and international solidarity at the core of everything I do. Human life should have equal value, no matter where someone comes from. These principles shouldn't just apply to our international development policies, they should be applied to everything we do as the Labour Party. I want to thank the Labour Campaign for International Development for their support and their endorsement. Let's take Labour forward, together. Thank you Doctor Rosena Brexit Might Be Done But The Fight Against Boris Johnson's Destruction Must ContinueAlthough the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback.\nWhen the UK leaves the EU this Friday, 31 January 2020, after 47 years of membership, it will be a sombre day for many of us. For others, it will be a day of celebration. For most people, I suspect they will simply hope we can now move on from talking about Brexit at the expense of everything else. As someone who campaigned with all my heart to stay in the EU, and as the first person on Labour’s front bench to publicly call for a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal, I am desperately sad to see us leaving our friends and allies in Europe. But we are leaving. The disastrous result of the General Election has settled that. This is no longer an argument about Leave or Remain, it’s about what kind of future we want for our country and for our children. That’s where the new fight begins. Boris Johnson wants to pretend he’s now “Got Brexit Done”, and we no longer need to worry about the details. He wants us to simply trust him to sort it all out. Well, I don’t trust him. Neither should you. He talks about “Global Britain” whilst turning his back on vulnerable child refugees. He talks about “Taking Back Control” while reducing parliament’s ability to scrutinise his decisions. He talks about attracting “Global Talent” to the UK while creating huge distress and uncertainty for EU citizens, many of whom have been here for years and who have made their lives in this country. The fight for our internationalist values starts now. It will be long, and it will be difficult, because Boris Johnson has a large majority – but that’s why it’s so important. When it feels like hope is lost, that’s when those of us who believe in progressive values and internationalism need to stand up and fight. If we don’t, no-one else is going to do it for us. We need to stand up and fight for our hard-won workers’ rights. We need to stand up and fight for our environmental protections. Most importantly, we need to stand up and fight for the rights of EU citizens living in this country. They are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues, our family. I work side-by-side with many of them in the NHS, when I work shifts as a doctor in my local A&E department. Under the draconian new immigration laws being bandied around by this government, my own Polish mother might not have been able to move to this country and make a life for herself. Although the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback. That’s one of the main reasons I am running to become the next Deputy Leader. We have huge organisational strength through our membership, through our links with the trade unions and through our MPs and councillors embedded in their local communities. Now is the time to deploy those strengths to maximum effect, to hold the Government to account and ensure that we fight back against every attempt to undercut our rights and freedoms at work, every attempt to weaken our environmental safeguards, every attempt to inject privatisation into our National Health Service. The slogan “Get Brexit Done” might have helped win the election for Boris Johnson, but for those of us who stand against his destructive vision for the future of our country, this fight isn’t done. It’s just getting started. My responses to the questions provided by the Labour Campaign for Free Movement 1. Defend and extend free movement: opposing any reduction in the freedoms of UK and EU citizens to live, work, and access social security in each others’ countries, and any immigration system based on incomes, migrants’ utility to business, and number caps or targets.I am the very embodiment of the benefits free movement has brought – my mother is Polish and was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Under the draconian new immigration policies being discussed by this Tory government, she might never have been able to do that. Protecting and extending free movement is at the very heart of my internationalist Labour principles. I believe our country is stronger and better because of free movement. When I work shifts as an A&E doctor in my local hospital, I work with NHS staff from across Europe and it breaks my heart to see many of them feeling unwanted or undervalued because of Brexit. As Deputy Leader, I pledge to do everything in my power to promote the core Labour values of internationalism and solidarity across borders, because I believe human life has the same value no matter where someone comes from. That means defending and extending free movement, and it means fighting to protect the human rights of migrants from this hostile Tory government. 2. Close every detention centreHolding migrants in detention centres, often in substandard conditions, is incredibly cruel and degrading. These are often vulnerable people, fleeing from a variety of horrific circumstances such as war, trafficking and poverty. They have the right to be treated with dignity, as human beings, as we would want ourselves or our family to be treated in such horrendous circumstances. When working abroad as a humanitarian doctor, I’ve seen first-hand some of the terrible conditions people are forced to endure in detention centres and it horrified me. We must fight back against the hostile environment the Tories have created for migrants – the Labour Party has always stood for international solidarity and openness to the world – we need a Labour government to bring those principles back into the core of our approach to immigration. I would want to listen to expert opinion on how to do this in a responsible way, but I certainly would want to close as many detention centres as possible and make sure we have an overall approach to immigration that means a concept as cruel as detention centres are not required in the first place. 3. Unconditional rights to family reunionYes, I fully support this. The unconditional right to family reunion is a fundamental element of treating migrants as human beings with dignity and equal value, rather than the Tory approach of seeing migrants as a problem to be managed. When I’ve worked as a humanitarian doctor in conflict zones across the world, it was always horrendous to see so many families ripped apart or prevented from seeing each other again. When I visited Palestine on a humanitarian mission, I saw sick children alone in hospital because the permit system meant their parents weren’t allowed to visit them. I immediately began working on ways to resolve this. It’s not enough to just talk about this – we need to be working every day to deliver a Labour government so we can fix these kinds of injustices. That’s what I’d do as Deputy Leader. 4. End “no recourse to public funds” policiesI support ending such policies, yes. This is another case of a Tory government treating migrants not as human beings with human dignity and equal value, but instead as a problem to be managed through cruelty. I want to deliver a Labour government with internationalism at its core, which would allow us to change our entire approach to migration, and begin seeing human life as equally valuable and equally dignified no matter where that person was born or where they’ve come from. 5. Oppose all Hostile Environment measures, use of landlords and public service providers as border guards, and restrictions on migrants’ NHS accessThe Tory Hostile Environment approach to immigration is a stain on the soul of their party, and they should be ashamed of it. Tragedies such as the Windrush scandal are a horrendous demonstration of where this approach leads, and I worry a similar scandal could occur with EU citizens who’ve made their lives in this country. I want a Labour government so we can end the Hostile Environment immediately and start treating migrants with the human dignity and respect they deserve. 6. Equal voting rights for all UK residents I am certainly interested in all ideas for how to revitalise our democracy and increase the level of engagement with our political process. Indeed, prior to the General Election in 2019, I publicly called for EU citizens to get the right to vote. Our Labour values of openness and internationalism must be at the core of everything we do. 7. Please share your thoughts on these wider issues that our supporters also feel strongly about:Even after Brexit, the UK government looks set to participate in Frontex (the European border agency) and its “Fortress Europe” policies. Will you challenge these policies? I certainly think the EU has often failed dismally to strike the right balance between border security and solidarity with people fleeing from war, poverty and the effects of global climate change. I am a proud pro-European, but that doesn’t mean my view of the EU is uncritical and I’ve never been afraid to say so. My values of international solidarity and openness don’t stop at the borders of Europe – they extend across the whole world. Human life always has equal value, no matter where that person comes from. Will you support an amnesty for undocumented migrants resident in the UK? We should always treat people with compassion and dignity, and we must place those values at the heart of everything we do when it comes to immigration. People in this country without documentation are often asylum seekers fleeing from horrific conditions and I want to see them treated with the human dignity they deserve. I would want to listen in more detail to expert opinion and feedback on the specific question of whether an amnesty is the right approach, but the principles of human dignity and compassion must always guide everything we do. Anything else you’d like Labour members, supporters and affiliates to know about what your leadership/deputy leadership would mean for migrants and migration policy? I am the living, breathing proof that free movement is a wonderful benefit to our country. My Polish mother was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Working on the frontlines of the NHS as an A&E doctor, I work alongside colleagues from across Europe and the rest of the world, and they are a credit to our country. It makes me proud to be British. But years of Tory government has created a literal Hostile Environment for migrants in this country. The drawbridge is being pulled up, and the rights of a whole generation of people to travel freely and live, love and work across Europe is being taken away. That is a tragedy, but it also means those of us who are proud of our outward-looking, progressive, internationalist values must fight even harder to protect and extend them. The fight starts now, and as your Deputy Leader (or even if I’m not!), I promise I will always be there fighting alongside you for those values with everything I’ve got. Nothing prepares you for seeing a colleague in tears over antisemitism.\nLabour deputy leadership hopeful, Rosena Allin-Khan, speaks about her heritage informing her fight against Jew-hate, and her commitment to mending ties with the community. “There is nothing that prepares you for seeing a colleague in tears,” says Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, one of five hopefuls standing for Labour’s deputy-leadership. Committed to winning back the trust of the community – and standing up for MPs such as Luciana Berger and Ruth Smeeth who are no longer in Westminster – Allin-Khan, currently the MP for Tooting, seems sincere in her battle against hate. She grew up as the daughter of immigrants – her father hailing from Pakistan, her mother from Poland, herself the descendent of resistance fighters killed by the Nazis. But she’s aware that hate and prejudice won’t be solved over a chat with tea and biscuits. Before her career in politics, she was a humanitarian doctor, working on the ground with Palestinians, while her mother’s family from Poland were killed by the Nazis. It’s these experiences which allow her to reconcile speaking out against Israeli policies, while committing herself to the fight against antisemitism, drawing praise from the community in carefully balancing these issues. The first of her pledges is to meet with the Jewish Labour Movement, should she get elected. It would be “essential to the restructuring” of relations, and “how we rebuild trust.” She is also keen on an education program, saying “people use antisemitic tropes and they don’t even realise what they’re doing and they repeatedly do so.” While indicating she would speak with “any group that was looking to acknowledge there was a problem, and work towards coming up with a solution to fix it” she adds that she is the “only deputy leader candidate who hasn’t nominated a leader”. She’s willing to “work with whomever the leader is” on rebuilding trust. Calling the demise in relations between the community and the party “sad” and “terrible”, she opens up about “people I know that I am very close to, who have been really brave and speaking out antisemitism in the party.” “They have received torrents of abuse and nothing’s been done about it”. “Any leader seeing something like this unfolding needs to be all over it”, she says. But was Corbyn’s team responsible? She says they were not the “cause of the antisemitic problem in Labour, I think they didn’t deal with the problem, well enough”. Yet, she’s under no illusions as to the extent of the problem, saying it must be tackled “from a grassroots membership level first and take it all the way to MPs themselves”. “The complaints process wasn’t dealt with properly”, Allin-Khan says, adding: “As people began to show antisemitic abuse .. the more they saw it wasn’t being dealt with the more they felt able to do so.” On mending ties, she wants an “independent” process for tackling complaints with “outstanding cases to be dealt with within a particular time”, and “automatic expulsion” for antisemitism, though she wouldn’t be drawn on whether she would intervene, like Tom Watson, who she is trying to succeed. Her drive to fight antisemitism is in part inspired by her heritage. “My mum’s Polish and I lost lots of family during the war. They were not Jewish, but they fought alongside Jewish friends and my great uncle died during that time, my grandma was pregnant in the Warsaw ghetto with my uncle.” “That whole experience is a very real part of my history, and it is a shared history that I understand deeply and I’m very saddened about with the Jewish community. She was embroiled in a dispute with the Israeli Deputy Ambassador in 2016, following a radio discussion about Palestinians’ access to medical aid. After revealing the two had met in person to discuss the issue, she was accused of being “bought by Zionists”, facing significant online abuse. Her response drew praise, with Dave Rich from the Community Security Trust saying it “illustrated the difference between pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist”. She says: “I am a doctor, and have been a humanitarian doctor for my whole professional life.” “It is possible, and fair, to identify areas where there could be improvement to somebody’s life and health and not to conflate that with a whole antisemitic issue. “ I will always be proud to stand up for people’s basic human rights, and I’m also very aware of my history and my shared history with the Jewish community. I feel it’s perfectly possible to manage the two.” Many former Labour voters feel unrepresented. That has to change\nThe Labour party has shaped who I am today. It has helped provide me with the opportunity to train as a doctor and has given me and my family life chances we otherwise would not have had. I want everyone to experience these opportunities. It deeply saddens me to see a lost generation for whom the door closed on their dreams and ambitions on 12 December. Growing up poor and cold while my single mum worked three jobs to support me and my brother taught me the reality of day-to-day life for many people in the UK. My mother always told me, even through our darkest moments, that there were people worse off than us – and I have never forgotten that. The Labour party changed my life. Despite failing my A-levels due to difficult circumstances at home, I was finally able to go to Cambridge University at the age of 24 to study medicine because of reforms the Labour party made in government. People did not know what we stood for – the Tories had three simple words Working on the A&E frontline has shown me the best and worst of society. A&E is a microcosm of real life. I hold parents as they say goodbye to their children who have died through senseless violence. I talk to nurses who tell me they can’t afford to feed their children and are having to use foodbanks. I treat older people who just want the dignity of accessing social care in their homes. But I also see hope. The UK is full of people pushing through barriers to serve their communities. Our NHS provided me with the skills to give back to society – it spurred me on to work as a humanitarian aid doctor in disaster zones across the world, something that I have been proud to continue during my time as an MP. I am proud of the internationalist views of the Labour party – we must never turn our backs on the world’s most vulnerable. On the border of Myanmar, it was shocking to listen to the stories of Rohingya refugees speaking of having to make the impossible decision of whether to save their child who was thrown alive on to a burning fire, or escape with their surviving child. We must not turn our backs on those who are living through the absolute worst of human atrocities. In Palestine, I was heartbroken to meet children who were undergoing cancer treatment utterly alone because their parents were unable to obtain permits to accompany them. Humanity should have no borders. Only with a Labour government can the UK have a truly outward, internationalist approach, ensuring that we are there for people in their times of greatest need. In order to be in government, we must get our house in order, and as deputy leader this would be my priority. We cannot look to champion equality abroad, while turning a blind eye to racism in our party. This needs to end. As deputy leader, my first major meeting would be with the Jewish Labour Movement – they are our official Jewish affiliate; we must listen. I want JLM to be at the forefront of this fight against antisemitism, especially when it comes to education at the grassroots level. I will separate the complaints process from HQ, making it independent and asking the new team to immediately review all cases, acting swiftly and expelling antisemites. There must also be a strict time limit by which cases need to be resolved. I commit to adopt every recommendation proposed by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, without hesitation. Enough is enough. Only then will we be able to start rebuilding trust. Communities across the country have turned away from Labour, thinking that we do not represent them. We must listen with humility to people across our country and across our movement to assess why we’ve lost the last four elections, and how we can win people back. From speaking to people in seats that we lost in December, I have been told that trust in us has gone. People did not know what we stood for – there appeared to be new policies announced every day and voters did not trust that we had a plan for how to deliver them. The Tories had three simple words. To win, we need to be able to communicate our messages, not just internally, but with the public. I will focus on grassroots campaigners being armed with the information and messaging that they need to talk to voters on the doorstep. I will equip candidates and their local Labour parties with the resources that they so desperately need. I will introduce reduced membership rates to our emergency service workers so they can have a say within Labour on the NHS at this vital time. We need to build our movement into one people can vote for. A party people can trust. Under this government, which has chosen to block child refugees from reunification with their families, I worry for the future of our children. I worry for the future of tolerance. I worry for the future of compassion. We have a wonderful society, which has welcomed so many people from across the world, but the hostile environment this government is imposing on our country is restricting the ability to hope. Hope for a brighter future. Hope for a tolerant society. The door may have closed on 12 December for a generation’s hopes and ambitions, but with the right leadership team in place in the Labour party, it will not be closed for good. We need to win the next general election, and we must start rebuilding trust ahead of local elections in May. As deputy leader, it will be my responsibility to rebuild trust, not just with the grassroots of our party, but with voters. Together, we can take Labour forward. As a doctor, I know that before a patient can be diagnosed, it is vital to first take a detailed history and examine them thoroughly. That’s the challenge we now face in revitalising the Labour Party and taking it off life-support. This is also why, when I decided to run for Deputy Leader, the first thing I did was contact every single Labour councillor I could find an email address for, as well as every single prospective parliamentary candidate who stood for Labour in the last General Election and lost.\nI’m not a leader-in-waiting, I’ll be a campaigner-in-chief, and you can be too. I’ve been travelling across the country, to seats where we won, seats where we lost, and even seats we’ve never held, to talk to activists and members on the ground - because I want to hear from the grassroots directly to truly understand what went wrong, what went right, and what we must do better. Using that detailed feedback, I am now publishing a manifesto called Grassroots Revival – a campaigning action plan that I will immediately start implementing if I’m elected as the next Labour Deputy Leader. **Download Grassroots revival**It starts with changes we must make to our internal organisation. We must overhaul the complaints process. I’ll remove the team from HQ and make it independent, put a time limit on reviewing complaints, and ensure those involved with each case are kept informed of its progress. I also want to start unlocking Labour’s membership talent. It’s not all about delivering leaflets and knocking on doors - we have social media experts, journalists, policy gurus, videographers and many other talents in our ranks. Let’s start making the most of that! For new members, attending meetings can feel daunting - we need to make them more enjoyable and accessible for all. We can ensure party democracy and due process are followed, while making meetings a more enjoyable experience. For example, some CLPs still spend up to an hour arguing about the minutes of the last meeting - which turns off new members. We need to streamline the procedural matters and get more political debate into our local meetings. We can be sociable too! I want to help local groups organise regional social events that break even, instead of looking to make a profit. Quiz nights, continuing the great work of Stand Up For Labour, pub nights, coffee mornings - let’s bring our movement together and celebrate all that we have to offer. Let’s look at how to grow and diversify our movement even further. I’ll offer reduced membership rates to emergency service workers, to encourage them to join the Party and have their say over how we fight to save our NHS. I would support BAME members to hold elected office - I will produce literature to be made available to BAME officers to distribute to new members, “how to be a councillor” meetings will be offered in each borough - not as an afterthought - and I will work with BAME officers to listen to what resources they need. We must start upgrading our technology and infrastructure - we’re running campaigns in 2020 with two colour printers from the 80s and 90s. I’d ensure every CLP has access to a full colour RISO printer (or similar). We can also boost data driven testing of our methods. Comparisons of leaflets, direct mails, e-newsletters, social media and canvassing will allow us to be so much more targeted and effective. A significant amount of dedicated time went into creating software and apps to revolutionise our digital campaigning in recent years but the party didn’t have the resources to fully roll them out - the doorknocking app, dialogue and chatter could have really helped us but members didn’t know how to use them or didn’t know they existed. Contact Creator regularly broke down during the General Election and the user interface hasn’t changed for over a decade. This must all change. Let’s also have a digital team at HQ who goes to every target seat, showing them how to make the most of Facebook ads, emails, Twitter, creating graphics and videos. Let’s also start looking at how to produce more personalised and localised content. The party produces some great literature and supplies it to key seats, but the vast majority of it is national with no localisation. Some leaflets and letters just didn’t arrive in 2019 for some seats, which left them in the dark, and adequate support was not available to deal with it, because staff were already overstretched. We must be better prepared. The manifesto came out weeks after the print deadlines for seats to order their leaflets and letters. I will ensure the necessary information is available to candidates in good time. The Labour Party must do better at supporting our candidates – I’ll make sure they all get adequate briefings and lines for use in their own leaflets, letters, emails and press releases. Candidates and their teams are superheroes, but they aren’t invincible, and campaigns can take their toll both financially, physically and mentally - This is why I’ll set up a dedicated team to offer mental health support and advice during difficult times. Too often, local organisers and staff have contracts that end at 10pm on polling day - this culture needs to change. Organisers put in endless hours to help our campaigns succeed and to dump them when polls close is just simply wrong. I’ll ensure no staff contracts end on Election Day, giving them vital time to find new employment. I also want to establish a system of sharing best practice amongst CLPs and boroughs. Campaigns shouldn’t have borders - we don’t have to operate solely within our constituency or ward boundaries. We need proper twinning with key seats. There’s no sugar-coating it – the Labour Party is in a critical condition right now. But with the right treatment, the right approach and the right support from the leadership team, we can get it back to fighting fitness. With the local elections coming up in May, there’s no time to waste. Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan MP for Tooting There is absolutely no place for antisemitism within the Labour Party, and I will put all my energy into rebuilding trust with the Jewish community.\nMy first major meeting will be with Jewish Labour Movement - they are Labour's official Jewish affiliate and we must trust them. I’ll separate the complaints process from head office, making it truly independent - to begin the process of rebuilding the trust. Once that new team is in place, I'll immediately get them to review all cases, acting swiftly and expelling antisemites. For future, I'll put a time limit on when cases need to be resolved by (for now and in future). The investigation from the Equality and Human Rights Commission is not an optional piece of diversity training, it's an embarrassment that this issue has gone so far without real action. The report they produce and the actions they want Labour to take are not optional - they are legally binding. I promise to fully adopt, without hesitation - every single one of their proposed steps. We are an open party, who welcome everyone from every background, no longer can we kick these issues into the long grass and offer the bare minimum in support and process. As Deputy Leader no form of racism will be accepted in our party. Front-line workers in the NHS have felt ignored by the Government - and now the Tories look set to give up the NHS for profit.\nThis Christmas I’ve been proud to support my hard-working colleagues on the front line by doing shifts in my local A&E. We’re all touched by the NHS at some point in our lives. For over 70 years it has been our lifeline, the glue holding our society together, often forgotten about, but there in our times of greatest need. The NHS is there to bring life, to offer care and dignity when we leave the world, and to support our loved ones when tragedy hits. But front-line workers in the NHS have felt ignored and that the Government does not recognise the day-to-day pressures they face. It didn’t start with claims on the side of a bus during the European referendum campaign in 2016 but, since then, using the NHS for political gain certainly picked up pace. Throughout the election, Boris Johnson repeatedly denied that the NHS would be up for sale. Just two weeks after the election, it was revealed that NHS cancer care and children’s treatments are up for grabs in a stealth Tory sell-off. Cardiology, gynaecology, paediatrics and oncology are among the services being offered to companies. As an A&E doctor, when someone is rushed into A&E having a heart attack, we work to patch someone up before sending them off to heart specialists. How will it feel knowing that those services are now being provided by a private company? Where is the trust? Allowing hospital trusts to outsource treatment to private companies could lead to a postcode lottery of health care, further widening the health divide. We need to be bringing the UK together, not tearing it apart, turning communities against each other. On top of this, discussions are taking place with tech giants on how to make money from patient data. While we must do everything possible to look for cures and ensure a better patient journey, we need to know how our own data is being used. The last decade has shown us that we must exercise caution with tech giants. The Government does not have the money or expertise needed to create an anonymised patient database, which is exactly why Amazon and Microsoft have been approached. Trust in our NHS cannot be destroyed because without trust, everything else could be up for grabs. I was stunned and heartbroken after the election result and bereft at what it would mean for our NHS. Our hospitals, treatments and dedicated staff cannot simply be sold off to the highest bidder. These aren’t the principles our NHS was founded and built on and I will continue fighting, standing side by side with our hospital workers, to protect our NHS from those who wish to destroy it. Shadow minister launches deputy leadership bid with a unifying pitch\nLabour must move past the factionalism and “ideological purity” that has alienated voters across the country, the shadow minister Rosena Allin-Khan has said as she set out her pitch to become the party’s deputy leader. The A&E doctor who has served on Jeremy Corbyn’s frontbench is the latest party figure to officially throw their hat in the ring for the deputy leadership, alongside the shadow cabinet members Angela Rayner and Richard Burgon. Allin-Khan, 43, said that for too long the party had been weighted down by infighting and described her politics as being inspired by public service, which she said was not based within soft- or hard-left identities. “I’ve got the campaigning experience but also the life experience to help rebuild the party again,” said Allin-Khan, who has been a shadow minister for sport since 2016 and still works hospital shifts. “We need to move beyond the last few years where nasty internal debates about faction and ideological purity have too often alienated people outside our movement. “Public service isn’t about identifying who sits on which side of the Labour party. I am Labour because of my values, my life experiences and the fact that I’m a doctor. We must communicate how we are going to change people’s lives in a way they can understand.” Her pitch as a unifying figure across Labour’s political spectrum would involve trying to make inroads in Scotland and Wales and other heartland areas that went Conservative, by holding town hall events, as well as meetings in synagogues, churches, mosques and temples. She said to rebuild the party’s base Labour must listen far more to councillors, who she says are the experts in their communities. The Tooting MP, who has a Pakistani father and Polish mother, dismissed concerns that Labour must have a leadership team that is drawn from northern constituencies. “I grew up poor with a single mum working three jobs to support me and my brother. That taught me the reality of day to day life for people across this country,” she said. “There’s no regional distinction to hunger. Loss of hope lives across the UK. London is used to mean ‘metropolitan elite’ but we also have some of the highest levels of deprivation. “Growing up in poverty. Understanding what it was like to get a job really young to supplement household income, to being careful in supermarkets with food, to feel there was no hope for someone from your background – that experience gives me a fire in my stomach to fight for all people around the country that have to go through that.” The mother of two studied medicine at Cambridge through Labour-initiated scholarships after initially failing her A-levels during a period of difficult family circumstances. After qualifying as a doctor she has worked as an A&E specialist in London hospitals and as a humanitarian aid doctor in the Middle East, Africa and Asia for a decade. She won the Tooting seat in a 2016 by-election after Sadiq Khan quit to run as mayor of London. In parliament she has highlighted the difficulty Palestinian children in Gaza have in accessing healthcare in Israeli hospitals because their parents are not allowed to accompany them through a restrictive permit system. As part of her sports brief she has fought for the return of safe standing at football clubs, as well as being an advocate for the women’s game both in parliament and as a player herself. She was also a vociferous campaigner for the People’s Vote campaign on a second referendum but said she accepted the country was leaving the EU, even though she had fought so hard against it because she did not believe the deal would work for her constituents. As for rejoining the bloc, she said that would have to be looked at if it should ever come up but was not a priority. Despite Corbyn being rejected at the election, she pointed out positive changes he made for the party, including a more welcoming immigration policy, and said she was proud of his strong anti-austerity message and the party’s continued support for the NHS. But on the defeat, she said: “We threw everything out there and nothing had time to land effectively. In comparison the Tories used three words and a few repeated soundbites which ultimately proved effective.” She said she would be happy to work with any leadership candidate should they be elected. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_previous_15/content_680.html": "|\nWhat a journey the Lionesses had this summer! Although it wasn't the result we wanted, our fantastic team can hold their heads high in pride for their performances and spirit. A World Cup final following on from a European championship win last year is an incredible record and I am sure we will be right up there again in four years. My family were firmly glued to the sofa all tournament and many spirited debates were had about England's best player. My eldest and I were firmly Team Lauren James, while my youngest maintained throughout thaT Russo is our star. Either way, very well done once again to the Lionesses and congratulations must go to Spain too for a well-played final.\nCongratulations to all the students who have received their A level results – and to the teachers, staff and schools that have helped get them there.\nWhether our students are going on to university, apprenticeships, further training, or joining the workforce, they have all made us proud with their hard work, dedication and resilience. This year was particularly challenging. For many pupils, this was their first experience of exams in a formal sense, after GCSEs were suspended during the pandemic. Grade boundaries were also raised to return to 2019 levels. However, our students and schools excelled, with a number of Tooting schools exceeding the London average of 30% A*-A grades – itself a pass rate that is the highest in the country. London schools are still benefitting from the London Challenge investment of the last Labour government. Our Tooting students and our Tooting schools and staff are something to celebrate. We are so proud of you.\nPolice forces across England are set to stop attending many incidents concerning mental health under a new National Partnership Agreement: Right Care, Right Person.\nThe Government's announcement leaves far too many questions unanswered and fails to tackle the root problem of lengthy NHS waiting lists in mental health services. I have written to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, asking him to come clean on what action he is taking to tackle mental health waiting lists. Read my full letter here:\nOver recent weeks, I have been appalled at the Tory's unworkable, unethical plans to house asylum seekers on a barge in Dorset.\nThe Government failed to listen to well-founded concerns or even carry out basic checks of the water supply, which was contaminated with Legionella bacteria, putting both asylum-seekers and staff at-risk. The Tories have serious questions to answer about the safety of this project and should stop wasting taxpayer's money pursuing headlines and instead fix this broken asylum system.\nRecently, I have received many emails about the climate emergency and how a potential Labour government would respond to it. We are facing a climate crisis and urgent action needs to be taken to avoid it. UN reports have shown that existing policies are not doing enough to avert cataclysmic climate related events, and we are already seeing historic weather activities causing floods, wildfires and droughts around the world.\nA Labour government would put climate change at the heart of our agenda to help build a better Britain. Labour would deliver zero-carbon power by 2030, insulate 19 million homes and establish a National Wealth Fund to help create over a million jobs in green industry. Labour will make the UK a clean energy superpower to cut energy bills and improve national energy security. As an A&E doctor and mother, I am incredibly concerned about the impact of poor air quality in our local area. I see many people attending hospital with breathing difficulties directly linked to toxic air, which contributes to thousands of premature deaths every year. It is my belief that it is the right thing to do to adopt enforceable targets and bring in preventative measures to tackle air pollution. As such, I am supportive of the ULEZ expansion coming to Tooting.\nHowever, I also acknowledge its impact on people’s budgets. I called on Sadiq to expand the scrappage scheme support – which he delivered on without Government support despite money being provided for similar schemes in other cities. Furthermore, I am pleased that he has further expanded the scheme, and information about the scrappage scheme can be found here. Wandsworth Council have also announced support through the Wandsworth Sustainable Travel Fund, details of which can be found here. The expansion of ULEZ was also mandated by the Government as part of the TfL bailout deal during the height of the pandemic – so they wanted the expansion to go ahead as well. The current housing market is incredibly difficult to get into as a first-time buyer. In our local area especially, house and rent prices are daunting, and sadly the Tories are not doing enough to provide support for people or help increase the housing supply.\nLabour have set out an ambitious plan for housebuilding targets to help supply the need for housing and provide security to people and their families. This would include relaxing planning restrictions to let local authorities and examining green Belt areas that could be used to build on. I fully support Labour’s ambition to have 70% of people owning their own home. Many people have got in touch with me recently about the Government’s proposed ban on electric shock collars for dogs. As an animal lover myself, it is my firm belief that the UK should lead the world in animal welfare standards which would mean no animal would be made to endure unnecessary suffering.\nAll pets deserve the utmost protection, and I’m pleased that the legislation introduced has been approved by the House of Lords. However, I’m also pleased that there will be an exemption for those with protected characteristics who have a legitimate need to use collars that produce sounds, vibrations, and other non-shock signals. At the start of August I hosted GMB Southern in Parliament.\nUnions play such a crucial role in supporting workers and ensuring our workplaces maintain the highest standards for safety, pay and conditions. I really enjoyed talking to the staff about the work they do: representing individuals and groups, helping people through disputes, and pushing for legislative change that keeps the UK’s workplaces reflective of our values and aspirations. If you haven’t already: join a union – they are there for you. It is incredible to see the work being done in Wandsworth Town Hall by the new Labour council. Recently, it was announced that free school meals would be available during school holidays for eligible children, while parents of pupils on free school meals will also have access to uniform vouchers to help cover this expense. With the Tory cost-of-living crisis, this is a hugely beneficial scheme for hard-working families across the borough.\nThis is the difference that Labour makes in power and I look forward to continued close cooperation with the new council administration in order to make our communities even better places to live. For further details, see here. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_schools/content_404.html": "|\nIt was wonderful to attend the Furzedown Project Christmas Party with a great carol performance from local children from Penwortham Primary School. Truly brilliant to see the community come together ahead of Christmas.\nThis morning, I joined pupils at Garratt Park School in Earslfield to plant the 500,000th tree of Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan's Trees for London scheme.\nIt's vital that we make London a green city for the future, where everyone has access to healthy outdoor space.\nVisiting Earlsfield Primary, I saw first-hand how universal free school meals are working to produce a level playing field in schools and provide all children with a delicious and nutritious lunch.\nLunch should never be a struggle for families or a time of stress and stigma for children – and Labour Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan’s funding means it won’t be here in London. The verdict from the judges that matter: the Red Velvet cake with beetroot was a hit.\nCongratulations to all the students who have received their A level results – and to the teachers, staff and schools that have helped get them there.\nWhether our students are going on to university, apprenticeships, further training, or joining the workforce, they have all made us proud with their hard work, dedication and resilience.

London schools are still benefitting from the London Challenge investment of the last Labour government. Our Tooting students and our Tooting schools and staff are something to celebrate. We are so proud of you. It was so nice to be at Smallwood Primary School to learn about the fantastic work of the Chefs In Schools. It's amazing that all catering is now in-house, with chefs cooking food that has been grown by the students themselves. The children were so enthusiastic about their freshly cooked and nutritious lunches. I believe that the work we’re doing with Chefs in Schools will go a long way to promote positive attitudes and relationships with food and mealtimes for our young people. It was great to be able to support! It was great to be joined by Lord Wajid Khan at Rutherford House School. We met with the school's Pupil Leaders who had some insightful questions about our work in Parliament, and also taught us about their values of resilience and respect. What a credit to the next generation! So glad that I was able to attend this event with Lord Khan. Tom's Farm at Nightingale Academy is truly special. From taking care of the animals to competing in national young farmer competitions, students here are provided with the very best learning opportunities. These kids have an outlet to learn about agriculture and animals in a supportive environment. I’m so proud of the work the farm is doing, and I’m looking forward to returning to see everyone soon - especially the adorable animals. It was an absolute pleasure to spend time at Beatrix Potter school today. The students were engaged, Year 3's cursive handwriting was impressive, and Year 6 had insightful suggestions on tackling the climate emergency. It's safe to say there were some future leaders in the room! It’s incredibly insightful to see young leaders develop and put their ideas into practice to shape the world in the future. I was truly inspired. Thank you for having me! The Year 2s at Tooting Primary School have been learning all about strong women. I was honoured to be invited to speak with the pupils all about being what it means to be a doctor and represent our wonderful community as MP. It is so important that we recognise and champion the voices and stories of strong women. And the students had great questions. They even taught me a few strong women facts! Last week, along with Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney, I was fortunate to visit Heathmere School - a local primary supported by the fantastic mental health charity, Place2Be. It was a wonderful opportunity to hear how Heathmere is promoting positive mental wellbeing for pupils, as well as learn more about the range of support Place2Be provides for schools across Wandsworth and the rest of the UK. During the visit, we heard first-hand from pupils who have benefitted from Heathmere’s whole school approach to mental health and Place2Be’s support. In addition, we were able to meet with Heathmere’s Headteacher, Emma Lewis, Place2Be’s Area Manager for South West London, Khalad Musse, and Place2Be’s Chief Executive Catherine Roche to discuss children’s mental health. It is so important that we shine a spotlight on the incredible work organisations, such as Place2Be, are doing to support children and young people. As we move beyond the pandemic, it is vital that we dedicate our care and attention to listening to young people to understand how we can best support them. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

It has been a year of change and renewal - full of ups and downs - but as I enter into my ninth year as your Member of Parliament for Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting, it remains the greatest honour of my life to represent the community in which I was born and raised. Entering the new year, I would like to pay tribute to the incredible frontline workers working around the clock to keep the country going through the festive period. From our NHS services to local hospitality staff to food bank volunteers - you all have my heartfelt gratitude for your tireless work this Christmas and throughout the year. A year for democracyWhat a year it has been for elections, both locally and across the country. We began the year with a fantastic win in the Tooting Broadway by-election, increasing the Labour vote share by nearly 7% to a whopping 58% majority. Then came the Mayoral elections in May, when we kept London red by electing my Tooting predecessor Sadiq Khan to a historic third term as Mayor of London. Finally - and most importantly - we finally elected a new Labour Government after 14 long years, with areas up and down the country voting Labour for the very first time. It was humbling to receive the most votes of any Labour MP and thanks must go to everyone who voted for me - your support means the world. £100m to fix Wandsworth PrisonAfter years of campaigning - and countless stories of mismanagement and scandal - the Ministry of Justice announced a £100 million funding package for HMP Wandsworth. This will go a long way to reduce the impact of overcrowding, repair crumbling cell blocks and facilities, and ensure that prison guards can work in a safe environment. Delivering for everyone in TootingThousands of local people have contacted me this year regarding a variety of issues, I have dealt with 15,000 cases. I reclaimed tens of thousands in unpaid pensions or benefits for local people, got decisions on hundreds of delayed passport or visa applications, and helped countless local residents get repairs to their homes. My door is always open and please get in touch if there is anything I can help with. On the NHS frontline\nSpeaking up for Gaza It has now been over a year since the horrific 7th October attacks and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza. The humanitarian disaster we have seen unfold there in the time since, has been truly heartwrenching. This year, I've raised the issue numerous times in Parliament, visited the region in the spring, and held evidence sessions with humanitarian experts. Revitalising Tooting town centre\nThis Morning and Loose Women Using my background as an NHS doctor, I have enjoyed trying my hand at being a TV medic this year! The lovely people at This Morning and Loose Women have had me on many times to talk about a range of topics from mental health to medical emergencies and even gave me space to open up about my own childhood challenges with speech, in a bid to end stigma and help others. Work in Parliament\nKeeping our streets safe in 2024, I successfully campaigned for a tripling of the Tooting neighbourhood policing team, putting more bobbies on our streets. In the summer, Operation Kenny run by the Metropolitan Police resulted in a 70% reduction in crime in Tooting town centre. This work will continue with the new Government's plans to recruit 13,000 new officers and return policing to communities. Cleaning up the local area I have never stopped campaigning for cleaner streets. This year saw a 15% reduction in fly-tipping in Wandsworth, with thousands of fines issued to people dumping their bulky rubbish on our streets. Meanwhile, Wandsworth Labour introduced food recycling for the first time ever in the borough. Free School Meals roll-out\nMental health reform Mental health is incredibly important to me and, for far too long, much-needed reforms were swept under the rug by a Conservative Government that simply wasn't interested. After much hard work, it was fantastic to see reform of the Mental Health Act announced in the King's Speech in July - this was long overdue.\nHistory was made last Thursday as my friend and predecessor as MP for Tooting, Sadiq Khan, was re-elected for an unprecedented third term as Mayor of London.\nAfter weeks of hard graft, the result was a decisive victory for Sadiq and Labour with our wonderful capital rejecting the divisive, toxic politics of the Tory candidate. I look forward to continuing to work with Sadiq to make Tooting and our wider city a greener, cleaner, safer and more prosperous place to live. Today, Tooting Broadway stayed red, winning a local council seat by-election in the ward! Our brilliant new councillor, Sean Lawless achieved the best result for Labour, since 1986. I've worked with Sean for years and know that he will be a brilliant representative for Tooting.\nThank you for everyone that voted for Labour. Full results: Labour - 1,888 (+6.8%) Tories - 542 (+0.8%) Green Party - 261 (-5.5%) Liberal Democrats - 113 (-2.0%) Changes w./ 2022 On polling day, I joined Labour Party candidates standing for council seats in Dover, Medway and Gravesham. Across the country, Labour won more than 600 local council seats in Stoke-on-Trent, Plymouth, Dover, Medway, and many other areas that we will need to win, if we are to form a Labour majority at the next General Election.\nTalking to voters in these seats, it's clear that people right across the country have turned their back on the Conservatives, looking to Labour to deal with the cost-of-living crisis, tackle NHS waiting lists, and improving safety in our communities. The road to Labour in Government runs through our local councils, and I am hopeful this local victory will be the springboard to Labour’s general election victory. It is an honour to have been unanimously re-selected by all the local party branches and affiliated organisations to stand as Labour’s candidate for Tooting in the next general election.\nI want to say a huge thank you to all the members and affiliates who took part, and who continue to put their trust in me to represent our community. Serving as the Member of Parliament for the community I grew up in is an honour. From helping local residents with casework, playing a part in winning the council, defending our NHS and serving as the shadow Minister to Mental Health - I have the best job in the world. My job is made even greater by the fantastic support local members show me all year round, so I want to take this opportunity to say a big thank you to them all! The next election is make-or-break for our party, we simply must win. I’m looking forward to working hard to make this happen. The NHS is being dismantled, I see it every time I work a shift. More people than ever are relying on foodbanks, and the cost-of-living crisis is having a devastating impact on people locally and across the country. I will be absolutely committed to doing everything I can to put Labour into Government and make the changes this country so desperately needs. Thank you again to everyone who voted. Fresh off the back of our trip to South Wales yesterday, Luke Pollard MP and I continued to take the fight to the Tories today, this time in Reading.\nWe kicked off the day with a doorknocking session in Reading West, another Tory-held marginal seat where it is essential Labour wins at the next general election. We were delighted to be joined by my colleague, Matt Rodda, MP for Reading East, who took us to a community-run cafe to show the empowering work that local people are doing on a daily basis. Reading is a great example of what Labour can do in power - the town's carbon emissions have been reduced by 70% in the last 12 years and the Council is currently investing £88 million in over 300 new social housing homes across Reading. Today, my friend Luke Pollard MP and I visited the lush landscape of South Wales in order to continue our fight to put Keir Starmer in 10 Downing Street.\nWe visited Barry Island (cue many Gavin and Stacey references!) in the Vale of Glamorgan seat and Chepstow in Monmouth - two vitally important areas that Labour needs to win to form a government. Labour took control of both Vale of Glamorgan & Monmouthshire Councils after the May elections and I greatly enjoyed campaigning with local members, building on that momentum in order to elect two new Labour MPs at the next election. Of course, a trip to Barry Island would not be complete without a wander down the beautiful seafront, complete with ice cream. Lloniannau! Yesterday, my friend Rex Osborn was elected to Wandsworth Council for Tooting Broadway with a whopping 62% of the vote!\nRex has been a constant in my political life – he was the Labour leader on the council when I was elected in 2014 and I served as his deputy. Rex was the one who urged me to run for selection as an MP and has been with me every step of the way since. Tooting has gained a fantastic voice on the council, who will prioritise our town centres, ensure a fairer deal for renters and push for increased cost-of-living support. This election took place under tragic circumstances, following the sad passing of Councillor Andy Gibbons, who served this area faithfully for 28 years. However, I could not think of a better person to represent Tooting in the Town Hall in Andy’s stead and I look forward to working closely with Rex to honour Andy’s legacy. 44 years of Tory rule in Wandsworth came to an end with Labour taking control of the Council after the local elections. Labour won 35 seats, whilst the Tories won 22. I was thrilled to play a part along with our fantastic Councillors, candidates, and activists in putting Labour into power locally.\nLabour’s historic victory here represents a new start for our borough, and it’s great to see Wandsworth’s group of Labour Councillors already taking action to help residents through the cost-of-living crisis. Talking to residents right across the borough, it was obvious to see that people in Wandsworth have rejected Conservative neglect both locally and nationally. The cost of living crisis is hitting residents hard, and it’s clear the Tories aren’t doing enough to address it. Wandsworth residents simply do not trust the Tories. The road to Labour in Government runs through our local councils, and I am hopeful this local victory will be the springboard to Labour’s general election victory. The Local Elections are hastily approaching on 5th May. After 44 long years of Tory rule, Wandsworth needs a breath of fresh air and a Labour council.\nOver the next four weeks, I will be out on the campaign trail - knocking on doors, delivering leaflets and working to help our fantastic Labour candidates. I would like to thank all the local residents for their support and warm welcome on the doorstep. Together we can turn Labour red this May! |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Share is a registered charity with a site in Tooting providing support to adults with learning disabilities and/or autism. Their befriending project matches people with similar interests to go for walks, bike rides, or coffee. Befriending is incredibly rewarding, providing companionship to those who are socially isolated and regular contact with a friendly face outside their usual circle. I am told that reliability and being a good listener are the only prerequisites to be a volunteer befriender. If this sounds like you, Share would love to hear from you! Click here to find out more. Here in South West London, over half a million residents have received their first vaccine dose so far! Although this is a pivotal milestone, the percentage of vaccinated persons still remains lower among all ethnic minority groups compared with the White British population. I recognise that many within the BAME community may be unfamiliar with vaccines and feel unsure. However, I can assure you that the vaccines have all been rigorously tested and declared safe by doctors around the world. I continue to urge everyone eligible to book their vaccine appointment as soon as possible. The sooner the vaccine is rolled out, the sooner we can begin to rebuild. Together we can do this. For those unaware, latest Government guidance states that those with a serious mental health illness are now eligible to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.\nSerious mental health illnesses include those such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. However, this list is not exhaustive and anyone who is severely affected by a mental health problem is encouraged to contact their GP if they have not yet been invited to receive the vaccine. If you are a carer for a person with a severe mental illness, you could also be eligible. Click here for more information on eligibility or contact your GP. If you are eligible, to book or manage an existing vaccination appointment, click here. The end of 2020 brought the news that we’d been waiting for - the first vaccine was approved for use in the UK. I’m hugely grateful to all the scientists who have made this happen. Around the world they’ve been working non-stop – just like our frontline healthcare professionals and key workers - to put a stop to this virus and allow us to get on with life as normal. Now another milestone in the vaccination programme is happening on our doorstep. St George’s is one of four sites participating in a new study to assess the safety and immune response of the Oxford-AstraZenaca jab in healthy children aged 6-17 years old. Building on previous trials of the vaccine, which have shown that it is safe, produces strong immune system responses, and has high efficacy in all adults, this trial will assess if children and young adults make a good immune response with the vaccine. I recognise that some have concerns about the vaccine, and dangerous myths circulate on social media – it’s simply not good enough to just ignore them and hope they go away. Labour has offered to work with ministers to tackle online harms. And we can all play our part in putting friends and family members at ease by reminding them that we can trust the NHS to take care of us in these difficult times. If the vaccine is good enough for scientists and the regulator, it’s good enough for my family and I. Indeed, I have joined together with a cross-party group of MPs, encouraging everyone to take up the vaccine. The video can be viewed here. We won’t see changes overnight and we still need to look out for our communities. Let's regain the spirit of coming together like we did in the first days of the pandemic and work to eradicate this virus. As you will know, a South African variant of Covid-19 has arrived in the UK. This new Covid variant has now been detected in CR4 (Merton). Residents in CR4 are no different to us in neighbouring Tooting (SW16 and SW17). We use the same shops, the same hospital, and the same parks, so if it’s there, it could very easily be here. This will be the same across all affected areas. As a matter of urgency, the Government needs to launch widespread testing in neighbouring postcodes. This is the only way to see how widespread these new variants are. I have written to the Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock MP, the Director of Public Health at Wandsworth Council, Shannon Katiyo, and the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Council, Paul Martin, to ask about plans to launch testing in neighbouring postcodes. While I press for action on this, we need to make sure we’re all doing everything we can to keep ourselves and each other safe. It’s absolutely vital that we minimise our social contact to prevent the spread of this new variant within our community. Please think twice before leaving home, and when you do leave, please continue to adhere to social distancing. Together, we will get through this. Throughout the ongoing pandemic I have been inundated with emails from parents, school staff, students, and residents alike who have taken the time to outline their views on school closures. Some are concerned about safety, with many teachers and students facing the very real and grave possibility of bringing the virus home to vulnerable family members. Some are concerned about the impact a further lockdown could have on children's wellbeing and their education. And some are concerned about the challenges school closures will cause for working families.\nAs I am sure you will agree, the current situation is incredibly serious. This virus is spreading exponentially across the country, many people are in hospital, and too many people are tragically losing their loved ones. We know how difficult another lockdown will be, but I believe that national measures are necessary. As the Shadow Minister for Mental Health and a working mother, it is safe to say the impact of extended school closures on children’s well-being and working families cannot be overstated. This is why Labour called on Government to do everything possible to avoid it. Boris Johnson must immediately set out clear plans for every child to return safely to school as soon as possible - and be honest with parents about the timetable for this. It is also critical that young people’s education is safeguarded throughout this period of remote learning, and every student must have access to the devices they need to learn. Schools and families can request free mobile data increases for students without broadband or who cannot afford extra data for devices. More information on this scheme can be found here: get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/about-increasing-mobile-data. It is vital the Government prevent disadvantaged families being priced out of education. As many families will agree, working parents face huge challenges in balancing work, childcare, and supporting their child’s education. They must have the support they need to do this. Nobody should have to choose between their job and supporting their children, so the Government - and employers - must clearly promote the use of the job retention scheme for those unable to work due to family commitments. Please rest assured that myself and Labour Party colleagues will continue to hold the Government to account on these issues as we all navigate the ongoing pandemic. Stay safe, Rosena. With the Officer for National Statistics estimating that 1 in 30 Londoners now have coronavirus, and the Mayor of London declaring a major incident across all London hospitals, the ongoing situation could not be more serious. NHS services in the capital are at risk of becoming overwhelmed in just a matter of days.\nWorking as a doctor in St George’s A&E department, I understand how emotionally drained healthcare workers are feeling. Indeed, ‘overwhelmed’ was the word used by nurses, consultants and registrars at our local hospital in Tooting when they were interviewed for a special report by the BBC, with one senior staff nurse saying she has “never felt so demoralised in her life.” The report conducted by BBC London's Political Correspondent, Karl Mercer, showed the heartbreaking situation in high dependency units at St George’s. The hospital has now had to increase intensive care capacity from 60 to 120, the vast majority of which are for coronavirus patients. Wandsworth alone recorded a further 2394 cases this week – the 13th highest in London. Whilst better times are on the horizon with the recent announcement of the approved Moderna vaccine, I can only implore residents to continue to follow latest public health advice on the virus to ensure we can protect as many lives as possible. On behalf of all my colleagues working on the frontline, please stay at home. The ongoing pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we live our lives, and it is understandable that this will have an impact on our mental health.\nAs we enter a national lockdown, it is vital that we all take care of our mental health. There are many brilliant services available to offer advice and support, and there is never any shame in asking for help. If you are facing a mental health crisis, you can call the Samaritans on 116 123, any time, day or night. If you are not comfortable speaking over the phone, you can also text SHOUT to 85258. They also have an advice page offering tips on how to take care of your mental health during the pandemic. If you are aged between 13-25, you can call The Mix on 0808 808 4994, with any question. They will connect you with experts and peers who will give you the support and advice you need. You can also phone Childline on 0800 1111, or speak directly to a counsellor here. For the LGBT+ community, you can call Switchboard on 0300 330 0630 or email [email protected]. All phone operators identify as LGBT+. Stonewall are also available on 08000 50 2020 for advice on a range of issues. If you are facing domestic abuse, you can call Refuge on 0808 2000 247, or access their online chat feature here. Women’s Aid live chat feature is also open here. Both of these websites have an option to quickly exit their sites and wipe them from your browser history. Sports Direct has shown exactly what not to do during this pandemic. If we’re to beat coronavirus, we have to be selflessThere seems to be a view amongst some under-70s, that coronavirus doesn’t really affect them and they don’t need to worry too much about it. I’ve listened to 69-year-olds tell me that because they themselves are fit and healthy, that it couldn’t possibly happen to them. Having just done a shift as a doctor in A&E over the weekend, I want to take this opportunity to warn people that this virus does not discriminate by age.\nIt was deeply, deeply eye-opening. Previously healthy people in their thirties and forties were seriously ill, some of them on ventilators. Being young does not grant you immunity to this disease. The symptoms of Covid-19 at its worst, are horrific. There can be no room for complacency. Our health service is facing an unprecedented crisis. There is a limited amount of vital equipment, including personal protective equipment for healthcare workers and precious ventilators. Every extra person in hospital requiring treatment means there are fewer resources available for others. London Covid-19 doctor says soon staff will be forced to choose whose life to saveRosena Allin-Khan, a Labour MP and A&E doctor, reveals ‘heart-wrenching’ decisions facing hospital workers\nRosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting and an A&E doctor, is still working regular shifts. On Sunday she worked at St George’s hospital in her south London constituency. She explains how the coronavirus pandemic has affected staff: I’ve been an A&E doctor for 15 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this before. The departments are quieter because people are staying away from hospital, but the patients are sicker. We’re seeing a distinct rise in the numbers coming in with respiratory symptoms, who are testing Covid-19 positive. On Sunday, very early in the morning, the entire resuscitation department, where the absolute sickest patients go, was full to capacity with patients with breathing difficulties. We had to move other very ill patients to the paediatric resuscitation area to keep them safe. This is only set to get worse. We’re seeing patients now who would have only contracted the virus two weeks ago. In the coming 10 days we expect the entire A&E department will be taken up with suspected Covid-19 patients. Doctors and nurses are brave, and the A&E department is known for being on the frontline and high risk, but there’s a palpable fear among staff for three reasons. Firstly, they’re frightened for their own health and those of the people they love. When I finished my shift yesterday, which was Mother’s Day, I came back to the house and I couldn’t touch or hug my two little girls until I put all my clothes in the wash and had a shower. The second reason is that staff expect, very soon, potentially to have to make heart-wrenching choices about whose life can be saved if we don’t have enough ventilators. That goes counter to everything you’ve ever learned as a doctor or nurse – to make life-and-death decisions, where we could possibly have saved every one of those people, is unimaginable. This is what our colleagues in Italy are living through now. Third, the patterns described thus far for symptoms of coronavirus are not what we’re now seeing in the emergency department. We’re seeing young, previously very healthy people, who are ill in hospital. Some are in their 30s, and they need ventilators to stay alive. Some patients are presenting with abdominal pain, which we hadn’t heard of before. A person can come in and say they have a stomach pain, and they’re put in the “green” area of the department – but then they mention they also have a cough. Everybody should be assumed to be Covid-positive until proven otherwise at this point. There’s also a real concern among staff around the country about personal protective equipment. They either don’t have any, or if they do many feel it’s being rationed. It’s very hard to listen to some colleagues say that as a result of there not being enough equipment to go round, they’re resigned to catching the virus – it’s just a matter of when. On social distancing, the messaging from the government hasn’t been clear enough. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has banned public gatherings of more than two people. It’s clear and easy to understand. There has to be no ambiguity in the language because people’s lives depend on it. Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

This is a very encouraging first step in ensuring that public transport is available and convenient for everyone in the local community. On Eating Disorder Awareness Week, I spoke a debate in Westminster Hall on challenging the stereotypes and assumptions around eating disorders. Across the UK, there are as many as 1.25 million people living with an eating disorder. Eating disorders have considerably high mortality rates, with anorexia claiming the most lives of any mental illness. Yet, with timely and appropriate treatment, people can go on to live healthy and fulfilling lives. We need a Government that will get serious on mental health and eating disorders. Labour will put prevention and early intervention at the forefront of our approach to mental health. We will place a mental health specialist in every school and place an open access hub for young people in every single community. The story of a Ukrainian family who wants to come to live in Furzedown recently made national news! Oksana and her young son Dmytro have a sponsor ready and willing to welcome them into their home in the local area, however Home Office delays have stopped them travelling to safety in the United Kingdom.\nIt is inspiring and heartwarming to see the generosity shown by the British public in welcoming Ukrainian refugees into their lives, however Oksana and Dmytro have been let down badly by the Home Office. They applied to come to the UK in September last year and, so far, the Home Office have refused to provide a timeframe for a decision to both myself and their sponsor's solicitors. This is simply not good enough and the Government must get a grip. Our latest research, shows that in 2021/22, the total number of days lost to poor mental health has doubled to more than 730,000 over the last decade. This comes at the same time that there has been a drop in the number of neighbourhood police officers by 6,000 and of Police Community Support Officers by 8,500.\nThese absences equate to over 2,000 police officers being off sick each day, last year alone, due to poor mental health. It is clear that this Conservative Government has presided over 13 years of neglect and staff shortages that have left our public services at breaking point. The next Labour Government will recruit 8,500 more mental health professionals, ensuring a million more patients get treated each year; and we will rebuild neighbourhood policing, delivering a package of 13,000 extra neighbourhood officers and PCSOs, putting police back on the beat. Read the full story here My thoughts and prayers went out to everyone affected by the recent tragic earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. I was very proud to see that Tooting Islamic Centre raised £16,000 for the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal for relief funds.\nIt is always incredibly touching to see the love, generosity and kindness demonstrated by our fantastic community - thank you to all those that donated and to Arshad Daud, imam at TIC, for all his hard work. Donations can still be made here Our exclusive data reveals that children in a mental health crisis spent more than 900,000 hours in A&E in England, last year. The total delays across England, in the past year alone, equate to 103 years of waiting time. This is a huge rise, up four-fold in the last decade.\nThe figures, made public through Freedom of Information requests, show the staggering number of hours that children have spent in a mental health crisis in Emergency Departments. With nowhere to turn, children with a mental illness are left to deteriorate – at which time A&E is the only place left for them to go. Emergency Departments are incredibly unsuitable settings for children in crisis, yet we’re witnessing increasingly younger children having to present to A&E in desperation. The next Labour Government will prioritise a truly preventative plan for mental health services and will put patient care first. We will ensure access to mental health professionals in every school and put an open access hub in every community, in addition to guaranteeing mental health treatment within a month for all who need it, by recruiting 8,500 new mental health staff to treat a million additional patients a year by Labour’s first term in office., funded by closing tax loopholes. Read the full article here For Children's Mental Health Week, I've written for LabourList about Labour's bold, transformative plan to deliver mental health care for children and young people. With children waiting days in A&E in a mental health crisis and more than one million people being turned away from mental health services without being seen, it is vital that we transform care by putting prevention at the heart of our plan.\nThis Government should not cut corners when it comes to young people’s mental health. Good mental health starts in childhood. Labour’s vision for future generations is one where mental health conditions are treated early. Adverse childhood experiences are the greatest driver of mental illness in adulthood – it’s just common sense to get mental health treatment right for young people in order to transform the future of the country’s mental health. The next Labour Government will ensure access to a mental health professional in every school, and we will put an open access mental health hub in every community. Every child should have the ability to raise concerns about their mental health with someone they trust, in an environment in which they feel safe. All of this will be funded by ending tax breaks for private schools. Read my full article here Last week, I asked the Government how many enquiries to the Home Office from MPs are outstanding and how many older than six months are awaiting a reply.\nIt was incredibly disheartening, although not surprising, to learn that over 10,000 case enquiries have not been answered by the Home Office with nearly 1,000 of those waiting longer than six months. These enquiries cover urgent and compassionate cases and it is simply unacceptable that the Government have allowed such a huge backlog to accumulate. These are people’s lives, with their family lives and jobs often dependent on Home Office decisions – the Government simply has to get a grip. To see these questions, follow the links here and here. Following reports from local residents of increased levels of speeding on Blackshaw Road, I am pleased that the police agreed to my suggestion of increased speed watches around the local area. Given that there is a nursery and St George's Hospital along this road, it is vital that speed levels are stringently enforced to ensure everyone's safety.\nI will continue to work with the police, Wandsworth Council and local councillors to keep our streets safe and accessible. To this end, I am very pleased to hear that the council is currently considering implementing a zebra crossing outside the nursery to protect both children and parents. Today, I have written to the Managing Director of the Southern Region of Network Rail calling for an investigation looking into improving accessibility and step-free access at Wandsworth Common Station.\nCurrently, there is step free access on Platform 1, but those wishing to travel on Platform 2 must cross an elevated footbridge, which is not accessible for wheelchair users, parents with young children, and the elderly. I have called for a feasibility study to be conducted, given the signifcant proportion of the local community that falls around the station.

As Transition Tooting’s annual sustainable community festival, this is a wonderful opportunity for local residents to come together to celebrate all things locally grown, cooked, re-created and re-imagined. Led by local volunteers, the event will run from 11- 5pm on Saturday 4th September and is free and open to all! To find out more, see here. The situation which has unfolded in Afghanistan is shocking and terribly regrettable. It is simply not good enough for world leaders to say the speed of the Taliban advance took them by surprise, when many have been warning of this for months. There has either been a monumental failing of our intelligence services or an unacceptable lack of transparency. Either way the Government has reacted too late. In 2010, I worked (pictured) as a Humanitarian Aid Doctor in the North West Frontier Province, on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan, following the flood crisis. I met many people who had suffered unimaginable pain at the hands of the Taliban. I am continuing to receive a high volume of emails from local residents concerned about loved ones in Afghanistan. Myself and my team are working to respond as quickly as possible. If you are worried about someone, please do not hesitate to get in touch by emailing their details to [email protected]. Please include the following information so I can take action quickly:\nWe must not allow history to repeat itself. Careless leadership from the Prime Minister enabled this tragedy to happen on his watch, while he had taken his eye off the ball. The world must not turn its back on the Afghan people. Following the recall of Parliament on Wednesday, I remain in close contact with my colleagues in the Shadow Foreign Team and will continue to be on hand to support local residents through this. Calling all dog lovers! The Friends of Tooting Common are planning to run their annual Fun Dog Show on Saturday 11 September. Last year's virtual event was a huge success – dogs competed across a range of categories, including Best Puppy, Best Rescue, Best Veteran, Best Trick, and – my personal favourite – Dog That Looks Most Like its Owner. An incredible £475 was raised for St George’s Hospital Charity’s Coronavirus Appeal in the process. Barring any unexpected developments, the Friends are looking forward to bringing this year’s event back to its rightful home on Tooting Common. For more information about this wonderful event, including how to get involved, email the Friends of Tooting Common on [email protected]. Today, the BBC revealed that in 2018 4,500 people in mental health crisis were unlawfully held in police custody due to a lack of mental health beds.\nI spoke about this matter on BBC News earlier today. There is no question that the system must change immediately. This is nothing short of a scandal. Rest assured I will be pressing the Government on this issue. Today, I spoke with GMB and Royal College of Nursing frontline NHS staff at St George’s Hospital to hear their views on the Government’s latest pay offer. The last 18 months has impacted our beloved NHS immeasurably, and staff have made significant sacrifices in order to save lives. I stand in solidarity with my NHS colleagues. They deserve far more than just claps. They need a proper pay rise. It was a pleasure to, once again, attend the annual Nicholas Stewart Project Community Day on the Henry Prince Estate in Earlsfield. It was a real honour to have been asked to lay flowers in memory of Nicholas, who tragically lost his life seven years ago. The Nicholas Stewart Project was founded in the wake of Nicholas Stewart’s murder and encourages young people to reject negative influences in their life and turn away from knife crime. It is always so inspiring to hear the work of the NSP in supporting young people and be part of our community standing together in hope. Tooting Community Kitchen is a wonderful organisation that serves hot food to those vulnerable in our community. And they need volunteers! If you have a few hours to spare, please consider lending a hand to help out this brilliant local organisation. You can find out more about how to get involved here. There was significant concern locally about Wandsworth Council’s decision to extend Controlled Parking Zone restrictions in areas of Earlsfield and Tooting from 9:30am to 9:30pm each day. Over 1400 local residents completed my consultation on the change. I am pleased that, following our pressure, Wandsworth Council have U-turned on their plans to extend CPZ restrictions. Instead, Event Day only restrictions are planned from 1 October - a far more sensible solution, and something which other councils with stadiums do. I received more than double the number of responses to Wandsworth Council’s rushed, ill-thought out consultation. In fact, over 93% of respondents were not happy with the council’s plans. This should never have happened. But I am pleased the Council finally listened and have U-turned on their attempt to rush through restrictions that would simply act as another cash-grab on hardworking local residents. It is so important that those living with sight loss in our community are supported when using public transport. That is why I recently wrote to South Western Rail and Southern Rail to enquire as to when warning tactile - a vital safety and accessibility tool for those travelling by train - will be installed at Earlsfield and Wandsworth Stations. I am happy to say that Southern Rail have now confirmed that warning tactile has been installed on surface platforms at Wandsworth Common Station. And, although tactile is yet to be installed at Earlsfield Station, South West Railway have stated that Network Rail is working hard to deliver these accessibility improvements. Rest assured I will continue to press for accessibility for local residents living with sight loss. A huge congratulations to Troy and Jarrell from Tooting’s Juci Jerk, who will be launching the first ever Caribbean pop-up in the Selfridges Food Hall next Monday (9th August). Juici Jerk is the go-to place for Caribbean deliciousness here in Tooting and I’m so please those not lucky enough to live here are finally getting the chance to sample the great food. Thankfully, the Tooting kitchen will remain open so we can still get our jerk fix! |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

As a proud Muslim, the period of reflection, prayer, and fasting is incredibly important to our Muslim community. Traditionally, Ramadan is a time for gathering and sharing Iftar with family and friends. Although, like last year, we are unable to come together and celebrate as we normally would, the spirit of Ramadan remains. To every Muslim nurse and doctor who have saved countless lives throughout this pandemic, to every volunteer and community leader in our Mosques and community centres who continue to support those most vulnerable, and to every Muslim in Tooting and across the country, I wish you all Ramadan Mubarak. With the easing of Government restrictions, The Share Community are seeking volunteer befrienders to help local residents with learning disabilities get back out into the community. Share is a registered charity with a site in Tooting providing support to adults with learning disabilities and/or autism. Their befriending project matches people with similar interests to go for walks, bike rides, or coffee. Befriending is incredibly rewarding, providing companionship to those who are socially isolated and regular contact with a friendly face outside their usual circle. I am told that reliability and being a good listener are the only prerequisites to be a volunteer befriender. If this sounds like you, Share would love to hear from you! Click here to find out more. Here in South West London, over half a million residents have received their first vaccine dose so far! Although this is a pivotal milestone, the percentage of vaccinated persons still remains lower among all ethnic minority groups compared with the White British population. I recognise that many within the BAME community may be unfamiliar with vaccines and feel unsure. However, I can assure you that the vaccines have all been rigorously tested and declared safe by doctors around the world. I continue to urge everyone eligible to book their vaccine appointment as soon as possible. The sooner the vaccine is rolled out, the sooner we can begin to rebuild. Together we can do this. Tooting Women’s Institute is looking for new members of all ages and backgrounds to join them in their monthly activities and events. Meeting on the second Wednesday of each month, this wonderful organisation provides a place for members to learn new skills, meet others in the community, discuss topical issues, and share interests. Previous sessions have involved everything from career mentoring and coding, to craftivism and calligraphy, while a variety of smaller groups meet to engage in more niche interests, including a supper club, which visits a new restaurant in Tooting each month, a book club, and a craft club, to name a few. Click here for more information. To deny that structural racism exists, denies the experiences of millions of people who live and experience it each and every day. This report was an opportunity to seriously engage with the reality of inequality and institutional racism in the UK. Instead we have a divisive polemic, which cherry picks statistics and whitewashes the structural inequalities which allow racism and discrimination to persist. It's gaslighting on a systemic scale. The Government must urgently explain how they came to publish content which glorifies the slave trade and immediately disassociate themselves from these remarks. The next Labour Government will introduce a Race Equality Act to end structural inequalities. Today, Trans Visibility Day, is a day that we celebrate each trans and nonbinary person, whether you choose to be visible or not, and reaffirm our commitment to stand against discrimination, bigotry and all forms of trans exclusionary behaviour.\nWhen wider society discusses trans issues, too often trans people have to deal with vitriolic and discriminatory language which has a profound impact on wellbeing. In October 2020, I organised and chaired a roundtable with leading trans charities to discuss mental health, discrimination, and how we can work together to tackle it. I will always be an ally of the trans community. As MP for Tooting and Shadow Minister for Mental Health, I want to be a voice for everyone - including the LGBTQ+ community - and I will continue to uphold LGBT+ Labour’s 10 pledges, which I signed up to during the 2020 Labour leadership race, outlined below. Many local residents have shared with me their concerns about pickpocketing in the Balham area.\nI have met with Wandsworth Police about this issue, who I know are working hard to ensure that our streets are safe. I have been assured that the police have now increased foot patrols around identified hotspots, in order to identify suspects and to tackle these worrying crimes. Unfortunately, although these crimes are reported on social media, very few of these are reported directly to the police. In order that the police can act on crime, it is vital that any offences are reported as soon as it is possible to do so, either via 999 or 101. This will help the police identify where to direct resources and provide the best opportunity to apprehend those responsible. Stay safe. With the sun shining in Tooting this week, I know it was a relief to many that outdoor sports could resume from Monday 29th March. As a lover of sports myself, I sympathise with everyone who has missed their daily swim, a kickabout with friends, or a game of tennis. Under current Government guidance, outdoor sports facilities and organised outdoor group sports for adults and children can all resume. You can now also play informal sports with a group of six friends or with any number of people up to two households. Here is what has reopened in the local area for your sports fix: Tooting Bec Lido - Open for bookings only and with a number of restrictions in place, including the changing rooms remaining shut for those without a disability. To book a slot at the Lido, please see here. Tooting Common and Furzedown Rec Tennis Courts - Anyone is able to use the tennis courts, provided that they book in advance. You can book using this link. Tooting Bec Athletics Track - The athletics track has reopened and organised outdoor activities for adults and children have resumed on the track. Bookings can be made in advance here. Garratt Park Ball Court - Organised sport will be allowed to take place on the ball court now and groups of six will be able to enjoy the kickabout wall or a group game of basketball. More information about recreational spaces can be found on the Enable Parks website here. For so many, our Tooting Bec Lido is a source of great local pride. During the most recent Government lockdown, I know residents have missed using Tooting Bec Lido and have felt the mental and physical pressure from not being able to swim regularly. I am so pleased that the Lido opened once again to the public from Monday 29th March and would like to thank volunteers from the South London Swimming Club for their efforts in preparation for its opening. As per previous rules, you will need to book to use the lido in advance and booking can be made via the Places Leisure app or website here: If you are going to enjoy a swim in the spring sunshine, please do make sure you follow the guidelines in place to keep everyone safe. Places Leisure have emphasised that there will be no lockers or changing facilities available at this time and that swimmers must stick to width-lane swimming only in order to abide by social distancing guidelines. As the weather gets warmer, I look forward to residents enjoying a safe, outdoor swim. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

With its causes and symptoms, it’s a complex issue. But in a country as decent and well off as ours, we should not be seeing this increase in rough sleeping on our streets. I invited council reps, the City Hall housing team and local police to join me and see the issues in our community first-hand. I'm working hard to bring agencies together and effect change. The Year 2s at Tooting Primary School have been learning all about strong women. I was honoured to be invited to speak with the pupils all about being what it means to be a doctor and represent our wonderful community as MP. It is so important that we recognise and champion the voices and stories of strong women. And the students had great questions. They even taught me a few strong women facts! I am concerned about South Western Railway’s planned cuts to local services. Earlsfield Station could lose two trains per hour off-peak, and direct services to Shepperton could be cut. With residents gradually returning to offices, I believe that these cuts to rail services are ill-considered. In addition, if we are to tackle air pollution and reduce carbon emissions, we need to be encouraging public transport use - not making it more difficult to use. The South Western Railway’s Consultation on this matter closes on Sunday 19th September. If you are affected by these planned changes, I would encourage you to submit your view to the consultation here. Local community champions Dons Local Action Group have joined forces with AFC Wimbledon to continue their fight against food poverty in our community. The Dons will be collecting donations at every home game this season, which will support even more families in need. The Dons are requesting donations of tinned meat, vegetables, fish, fruit, and pulses. Collection points are located by each stadium entrance. Next match day, please support this wonderful initiative in any way that you are able – the spirit of giving is what makes our Tooting community so special! Many local residents have been in touch regarding the expansion of the Cambo Oil Field, 75 miles to the west of the Shetland Islands in Scotland. I want to be clear in the fact that I oppose the expansion of the Cambo Oil Field. The climate crisis is the defining issue of our generation and should be treated with the urgency required. By expanding oil and gas exploration, we are abandoning our obligations to end the ongoing climate crisis. Ahead of COP26, we must support the end of oil and gas exploration whilst protecting our communities and jobs. Our Tooting community always comes together in the face of adversity, and I know many local residents will want to help those impacted by the current situation in Afghanistan in any way they can. That is why I have compiled a list of organisations and charities currently working to support Afghan refugees:\nTo provide refugee accommodation: Refugees at Home: UK charity which connects those with a spare room with refugees and asylum seekers in need of somewhere to stay. Apply to be a host here. Room for Refugees: Community hosting network that offers safe, temporary homes and emotional support for insecurely-housed refugees, asylum seekers and vulnerable groups - families, the sick, the elderly and unaccompanied asylum seeking children with no recourse to public funds. Apply to offer accommodation here. Wandsworth Borough Council: Residents, businesses, or other landlords who could offer a property for new arrivals are being asked to register their details - they are particularly keen to hear from those with 3 to 4 bedroom properties available. To offer accommodation, contact Wandsworth Borough Council via email at [email protected]k or by phone on 020 8871 7333. Local Organisations: Care4Calais: Asking for volunteers, financial donations and donations clothes, shoes, phones or other essentials at drop off points:\nNational Organisations: Choose Love: Supporting projects providing vital aid and services to Afghan people who have fled the country: clothes, shelter, support for children and groups protecting women and children’s rights.\nBritish Red Cross: Calling for donations to help staff and volunteers provide emotional support and essential items, including warm clothes, blankets, soap, toothbrushes and nappies.\nSave the Children: Calling for donations to an emergency fund.\nAction Aid: Calling for emergency donations to help charity provide emergency humanitarian assistance including food, water, and essential items such as hygiene kits, cash, tarpaulins, tents, cooking utensils, clothing, and bedding.\nAfghanaid: Afghanaid is a British humanitarian and development organisation, currently asking for donations to assist response to the Afghan crisis\nUNICEF: Raising money to support children in Afghanistan\nUNHCR: Calling for donations to help the organisation in the distribution of family tents, hygiene kits, core relief items like blankets, sleeping mats and kitchen sets.\nThe Big Give: Delivering emergency support to families whose lives have been destroyed or uprooted by the conflict.\nMuslim Aid: Calling for donations to Afghanistan Emergency Appeal.\nIslamic Relief: Calling for donations to aid Afghan’s on the ground in Afghanistan, and when they come to the UK.\nDoctors Without Borders: The MSF teams are responding to the crisis in Afghanistan, providing medical aid, expertise and life-saving supplies during the escalating crisis. Donate here. Paiwand: Established an Afghan Resettlement Emergency Fund, supporting displaced Afghans in need of assistance.\nRefugee Council: Providing aid, including mental health support, for refugees arriving in the UK.\nThis week, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan announced London will be welcoming 150 families from Afghanistan. To each and every family coming to Tooting - you are so welcome here. Want to help those arriving from Afghanistan? Here is what you can do: Little Village: Urgently in need of warm baby clothes, 9 months - 2 years and 4 - 6 years (specifically pyjamas, snow suits, jumpers and coats). Moses baskets, muslins, small toys and activity packs also needed. Regular collections are being held at Chancery Mews, SW17 7TD and Chillerton Road, SW17 9BE. Please do check their Facebook page for more information. Tooting Community Kitchen: Urgently in need of jogging bottoms and jeans in sizes 26-34 waist, jumpers, t-shirts, coats and trainers in sizes 38-45. Donations can be dropped off Friday 9-1pm and Saturday 3-5pm at Price Close (entrance at 104 Upper Tooting Road). I was also pleased to write to the Leader of Wandsworth Council alongside my colleagues, Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney, and Marshsa De Cordova, MP for Battersea, to call on Wandsworth Council to welcome in refugees from Afghanistan and provide them with a safe place to live. It was a pleasure to visit Earlsfield Foodbank recently with local Labour councillor Graeme Henderson. The team here do incredible work in supporting those families most in need across Earlsfield. In a country as well off as ours, the fact we have so many who rely on foodbanks is nothing short of outrageous. We discussed our shared aim to end this. If you’d like to support Earlsfield Foodbank, you can donate here or add to the foodbank collection points at Sainsburys Local (Earlsfield) or Co-op on Garratt Lane. If you need support from the Earlsfield Foodbank and would like to collect some food or arrange a delivery, email or call on 07585064428. Earlsfield Foodbank is open at St Andrew’s Church (on Garratt Lane) Thursdays 9.30am - 12pm. Tooting Foodival is back! As Transition Tooting’s annual sustainable community festival, this is a wonderful opportunity for local residents to come together to celebrate all things locally grown, cooked, re-created and re-imagined. Led by local volunteers, the event will run from 11- 5pm on Saturday 4th September and is free and open to all! To find out more, see here. Calling all dog lovers! The Friends of Tooting Common are planning to run their annual Fun Dog Show on Saturday 11 September. Last year's virtual event was a huge success – dogs competed across a range of categories, including Best Puppy, Best Rescue, Best Veteran, Best Trick, and – my personal favourite – Dog That Looks Most Like its Owner. An incredible £475 was raised for St George’s Hospital Charity’s Coronavirus Appeal in the process. Barring any unexpected developments, the Friends are looking forward to bringing this year’s event back to its rightful home on Tooting Common. For more information about this wonderful event, including how to get involved, email the Friends of Tooting Common on [email protected]. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

We have also been to visit the site of the fire and met with the Fire Brigade Commander who is leading at the scene.\nFurther, our team has met with Council Officers who have been proactively taking measurements of the air quality at local schools and on streets affected by smoke. Remember, keep your doors and windows closed. I would advise staying indoors. Local people will be aware that the fire at the Recycling plant on Weir Road is continuing to produce high volumes of smoke in the area. I have spoken to London Fire Brigade who has assured me that the fire remains in control and efforts are continuing to dampen out the remnants of the fire.\nI know many people will be concerned with the effects of the smoke on the air quality in the surrounding area. I am proactively engaging with Wandsworth Council to ensure steps are being taken to monitor the air quality. I understand that current advice is to keep doors and windows closed. I understand that a fire broke out at the Recycling Plant on Weir Road, just inside Merton yesterday evening. The Fire Brigade states that the fire is now under control, but efforts are now being taken to begin dampening out the fire.\nRest assured, I will continue to maintain contact with the Fire Brigade and monitor any developments closely. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_nhs/content_126.html": "|\nAs 2024 draws to a close, I wanted to take this opportunity to look back on the events of the past year. It has been a year of change and renewal - full of ups and downs - but as I enter into my ninth year as your Member of Parliament for Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting, it remains the greatest honour of my life to represent the community in which I was born and raised. Entering the new year, I would like to pay tribute to the incredible frontline workers working around the clock to keep the country going through the festive period. From our NHS services to local hospitality staff to food bank volunteers - you all have my heartfelt gratitude for your tireless work this Christmas and throughout the year. A year for democracyWhat a year it has been for elections, both locally and across the country. We began the year with a fantastic win in the Tooting Broadway by-election, increasing the Labour vote share by nearly 7% to a whopping 58% majority. Then came the Mayoral elections in May, when we kept London red by electing my Tooting predecessor Sadiq Khan to a historic third term as Mayor of London. Finally - and most importantly - we finally elected a new Labour Government after 14 long years, with areas up and down the country voting Labour for the very first time. It was humbling to receive the most votes of any Labour MP and thanks must go to everyone who voted for me - your support means the world. £100m to fix Wandsworth PrisonAfter years of campaigning - and countless stories of mismanagement and scandal - the Ministry of Justice announced a £100 million funding package for HMP Wandsworth. This will go a long way to reduce the impact of overcrowding, repair crumbling cell blocks and facilities, and ensure that prison guards can work in a safe environment. Delivering for everyone in TootingThousands of local people have contacted me this year regarding a variety of issues, I have dealt with 15,000 cases. I reclaimed tens of thousands in unpaid pensions or benefits for local people, got decisions on hundreds of delayed passport or visa applications, and helped countless local residents get repairs to their homes. My door is always open and please get in touch if there is anything I can help with. On the NHS frontline\nSpeaking up for Gaza It has now been over a year since the horrific 7th October attacks and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza. The humanitarian disaster we have seen unfold there in the time since, has been truly heartwrenching. This year, I've raised the issue numerous times in Parliament, visited the region in the spring, and held evidence sessions with humanitarian experts. Revitalising Tooting town centre\nThis Morning and Loose Women Using my background as an NHS doctor, I have enjoyed trying my hand at being a TV medic this year! The lovely people at This Morning and Loose Women have had me on many times to talk about a range of topics from mental health to medical emergencies and even gave me space to open up about my own childhood challenges with speech, in a bid to end stigma and help others. Work in Parliament\nKeeping our streets safe in 2024, I successfully campaigned for a tripling of the Tooting neighbourhood policing team, putting more bobbies on our streets. In the summer, Operation Kenny run by the Metropolitan Police resulted in a 70% reduction in crime in Tooting town centre. This work will continue with the new Government's plans to recruit 13,000 new officers and return policing to communities. Cleaning up the local area I have never stopped campaigning for cleaner streets. This year saw a 15% reduction in fly-tipping in Wandsworth, with thousands of fines issued to people dumping their bulky rubbish on our streets. Meanwhile, Wandsworth Labour introduced food recycling for the first time ever in the borough. Free School Meals roll-out\nMental health reform Mental health is incredibly important to me and, for far too long, much-needed reforms were swept under the rug by a Conservative Government that simply wasn't interested. After much hard work, it was fantastic to see reform of the Mental Health Act announced in the King's Speech in July - this was long overdue.\nFollowing the decision to relocate children's cancer services in South East England away from St George's Hospital, I met with the Health Secretary with a cross-party group of MPs to raise our concerns.\nWhen I visited the Pinckney Ward where this care is conducted, I met with Jackson, a former patient there, and his parents, who told me that such a move would be detrimental for parents, children and the hospital alike. I have urged the Secretary to review and reconsider NHS England's decision as soon as possible. The beginning of Mental Health Awareness week was marked by grim tidings that, for the first time in recorded history, the number of people on an waiting list for mental health treatment has hit 2 million.\nThis is more than the combined population of four major British cities and is a shocking indictment of the Tories' failed record on mental health. As someone who has had close friends and family members with eating disorders, I know just how damaging and dangerous they can be. I was proud to join my friend Hope Virgo at the Dump The Scales march to Parliament Square on Saturday with hundreds of campaigners and activists.\nThe Government’s attitude towards eating disorders must fundamentally change. They must listen to campaigners and experts, like Hope, to ensure everyone with an eating disorder gets the care they need. Yesterday, I was delighted to join CEN for their Healing our Broken Village Black Mental Health Conference at the New Testament Assembly church in Tooting.\nWith continued racial disparities in sectioning and the use of community treatment orders, more must be done to bring about much-needed change.\nAs part of my former role as Shadow Minister for Mental Health, I worked very closely with Melanie Leahy and other campaigners affected by the terrible deaths in Essex mental health hospitals.\nThe Terms of Reference for the inquiry into this scandal have now at long last been published. This inquiry has been beset by delays since the beginning, which is simply not good enough.\nIt was fantastic to join Dermot and Alison on the This Morning medical segment again; this time to talk about rashes and what to look out for.\nRashes can be difficult to see on darker skin tones and this can lead to delayed treatment and poorer outcomes, which is why it's especially important to be aware of the different symptoms and nuances.\nI was thrilled to join Dermot O'Leary and Josie Gibson for the health segment on This Morning today to talk about working as an emergency doctor in the NHS and when to seek help.\nYes, A&E departments are under huge strain and pressure, but always remember - if you need help, we are here.\nToday's announcement by NHS England that children's cancer services will be moved away from the world-class unit at St George's Hospital is profoundly disappointing.\nAs a doctor, I am clear that this decision has not been made in the interests of patients or their families and we're losing more than 25 years of expertise in the field of children's cancer care. I'm calling on the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Victoria Atkins to immediately review this decision. In today's Guardian, my latest figures reveal that thousands of people are re-admitted to mental health hospitals within days or weeks of leaving it, wreaking havoc on people's lives.\nWhy? Because the Tories cut a quarter of mental health beds and patients don't get the care they deserve. Read the full story here |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Every patient will now be allowed to have one visitor for one hour – at a pre-arranged time – between 1pm and 6pm each day. This applies on weekdays and weekends. Visitors should ideally be someone from the same household or support bubble. Where this is not possible, St George’s ask that the visitor be a close family member or friend. Each ward has implemented an appointment booking system to record visitors names and contact details. Appointments can be made by calling the ward clerk on shift between 8am and 4pm, Monday to Friday. To find out the contact details for each ward, please see here. Tooting Bec Athletics Track needs to be resurfaced.\nThe track surface – which is already 35 years old – failed a track inspection last summer, meaning that it can no longer be used for competitions. Athletes are permitted to train at the facility until the end of 2021. However, the future of the track beyond this time is yet to be secured. The track is much-loved and well utilised by a collective of local residents as diverse as Tooting itself. The Herne Hill Harriers have called the track home since the 1930’s. Their membership is comprised of people of all ages and backgrounds, including elite and Olympic athletes, while countless schools and community groups also make use of the facility. I am calling on Wandsworth Council to commit to funding the resurfacing of this vital community asset without further delay. Click here to add your name to a petition to the Council to refurbish the track. Continue to check back here, and on my Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for further updates. Today marks the beginning of Pride, a month where we celebrate our wonderful and diverse LGBT+ community. Pride is a time for joy, laughter and love. It is also a time to reaffirm our allyship with the LGBT+ communities. Unfortunately, the struggle for equality is not over. To this end, it is vital that the true meaning of Pride doesn’t get lost with corporations wanting to get involved with the ‘fun’. Indeed, we must remember all those who have and continue to suffer attacks on their basic human freedoms that so many of us simply take for granted. I am so proud to be an ally. But we must not rest until everyone feels comfortable to be open about who they are without fear, stigma or judgement. A big congratulations to our local football team Tooting and Mitcham FC, who beat AFC Wimbledon to win the London Senior Cup. On a hot and sunny bank holiday Monday, goals by Jake Rose and Dontai Stewart led to a 2-1 win against a strong Wimbledon side. It was also a great performance from Billy Brown, Ahkeem Belford, Daniel Williams and goalkeeper Gary Ross. As Adam Best wrote in his post-match commentary, “Jake Rose, as we’ve come to expect, finished it like James Bond dispatching a foe; calmly, suavely - a tailored assassin in his craft.” This was undoubtedly a time of celebration, as could be heard from pub gardens across Tooting and Mitcham! Tooting and Mitcham FC continue to be an inspiration to young players in the local community and a source of much needed celebration at this time. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

There were 138 Rohingya refugees crammed on the boat, fleeing from camps in Bangladesh. At least 15 bodies were found, including four children, with 50 more missing.\nI’ve been campaigning for the rights of the Rohingya since the recent crisis unfolded in 2017. I’ve been involved in humanitarian matters long before entering politics and standing to be Labour deputy leader. Stories such as those of the Rohingya do not often have a light shined upon them here in the UK. They happen far away and it feels as if they’re outside of our control. The UK has a proud history of humanitarian assistance and we must ensure that this continues. We must never allow ourselves to turn a blind eye. Every single human life has equal value, no matter where that person was born, what language they speak or what they look like. Humanity has no borders. This isn’t just something I believe in principle — I act on it. My work as a humanitarian doctor has taken me to the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, where grieving mothers told me accounts of their babies being ripped from their arms and murdered before their eyes. The guilt of coming home to my own three- and five-year-olds left me unable to sleep at night. Why should their lives be of more value to the world than those of the Rohingya children who are slaughtered without a dignified burial? I have seen how human life is not valued equally around the world. It lit a fire in my belly to continue fighting such injustice, no matter where it takes place. At the very heart of my Labour principles is internationalism. I believe this spirit of internationalism must drive everything we do as a party. We must always stand in unwavering opposition to any effort to restrict freedoms, whether here or globally. We’ve seen where this mentality leads — whether it is the tragedy of Windrush, the cruelty of detention centres like Yarl’s Wood, or the inhumanity of a government that votes against protection for vulnerable child refugees. Now is the time for all of us who believe in progressive, internationalist values to fight back. It is our duty to ensure that the Rohingya and other victims are not forgotten by the world. One of the reasons I decided to stand to become the next deputy leader of Labour is because I believe our party has a unique chance to become a global beacon of internationalism, as it has been before. We have arguably the largest grassroots membership of any political party in Europe. If we are able to unite behind a truly internationalist vision for our party and our country, we could be a force for change on a global scale. We have a wonderful society, which has welcomed so many people from across the world, but this government’s hostile environment is diminishing hope — hope for a brighter future, hope for a tolerant society. I first entered politics in order to shed light on humanitarian efforts around the world and give a voice to the voiceless. I still believe we can, and I want to help rebuild the Labour Party so that it becomes a powerful force for good. As a party we need to rebuild trust with our communities, with the British people and the international community. Let’s do this together.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_school-closures/content_358.html": "|\nThroughout the ongoing pandemic I have been inundated with emails from parents, school staff, students, and residents alike who have taken the time to outline their views on school closures. Some are concerned about safety, with many teachers and students facing the very real and grave possibility of bringing the virus home to vulnerable family members. Some are concerned about the impact a further lockdown could have on children's wellbeing and their education. And some are concerned about the challenges school closures will cause for working families.\nAs I am sure you will agree, the current situation is incredibly serious. This virus is spreading exponentially across the country, many people are in hospital, and too many people are tragically losing their loved ones. We know how difficult another lockdown will be, but I believe that national measures are necessary. As the Shadow Minister for Mental Health and a working mother, it is safe to say the impact of extended school closures on children’s well-being and working families cannot be overstated. This is why Labour called on Government to do everything possible to avoid it. Boris Johnson must immediately set out clear plans for every child to return safely to school as soon as possible - and be honest with parents about the timetable for this. It is also critical that young people’s education is safeguarded throughout this period of remote learning, and every student must have access to the devices they need to learn. Schools and families can request free mobile data increases for students without broadband or who cannot afford extra data for devices. More information on this scheme can be found here: get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/about-increasing-mobile-data. It is vital the Government prevent disadvantaged families being priced out of education. As many families will agree, working parents face huge challenges in balancing work, childcare, and supporting their child’s education. They must have the support they need to do this. Nobody should have to choose between their job and supporting their children, so the Government - and employers - must clearly promote the use of the job retention scheme for those unable to work due to family commitments. Please rest assured that myself and Labour Party colleagues will continue to hold the Government to account on these issues as we all navigate the ongoing pandemic. Stay safe, Rosena.

We’re fundraising as part of the Time for a Change appeal to help support St George’s Hospital Charity in their work to provide assistance to patients, their families, and the staff who care for them across St George’s Hospital, Queen Mary’s Hospital, and community sites.\nIt’s a 55-mile route from Clapham to Brighton, and we’ll be joined by other fantastic #TeamGeorges participants. Neither of us have done this before and it’s a big challenge for us. The Time for a Change Appeal is supporting children’s services at St George’s Hospital. We know that St George's Trust provides absolutely outstanding care for patients and incredible support for families, but sadly the facilities often don’t reflect this level of care. If you want to support us, our JustGiving link is here: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/fleurandrosenal2b\nAll too often, children are stuck on long waiting lists for mental health treatment and thousands of people are having their referrals closed before an appointment.\nThis Tory Government caused the crisis in mental health services - when will they fix it?\nOn the 75th birthday of the NHS, I joined the amazing team at St George’s Hospital, to say, a big thank you for the incredible care and compassion they show every day. I'm proud to work side-by-side with the team.\nOne of the most important jobs I do as your local Member of Parliament is ensuring that our wonderful communities in Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown, Tooting and Wandsworth Common remain safe and welcoming places to live.\nTo this end, I have recently hosted public meetings with local police leadership in Balham and Furzedown, conducted a walkaround with the Borough Superintendent around the local area, and written to the police on behalf of local residents on a wide range of issues. Please do let me know if you have any concerns regarding crime issues in the local area - my door is always open.\nToday, I appeared on BBC Question Time, where I held the Government to account on the shameful Rwanda policy, their neglect of the NHS, and the issues surrounding Thames Water.\nFor Pride month, Anneliese Dodds MP, Shadow Women and Equalities Secretary, and I brought together mental health and LGBT+ organisations to discuss the challenges facing the mental health of LGBT+ people.\nAs part of National Care Home Week. I recently met some of the incredible staff and residents at Nightingale House in Balham to see first-hand the fantastic work being done in the local community.\nJoining Billy Bragg’s ‘Left Field’ stage at Glastonbury, I spoke about the importance of protecting our NHS. It’s crucial that NHS staff are supported in their work and that patients can access timely treatment.\nIt was great to join Nish Kumar and Coco Khan on Pod Save the UK. We spoke about working on the frontline during the pandemic, Labour’s bold mental health plan, and pitying Matt Hancock.\nSee a clip of the Podcast here:\nThe annual BATCA Fun Day is always good fun - and this year was no exception. I was delighted to celebrate the helpers, heroes and happy Tooting residents at this wonderful community event.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

That’s the challenge we now face in revitalising the Labour Party and taking it off life-support. This is also why, when I decided to run for Deputy Leader, the first thing I did was contact every single Labour councillor I could find an email address for, as well as every single prospective parliamentary candidate who stood for Labour in the last General Election and lost.\nI’m not a leader-in-waiting, I’ll be a campaigner-in-chief, and you can be too. I’ve been travelling across the country, to seats where we won, seats where we lost, and even seats we’ve never held, to talk to activists and members on the ground - because I want to hear from the grassroots directly to truly understand what went wrong, what went right, and what we must do better. Using that detailed feedback, I am now publishing a manifesto called Grassroots Revival – a campaigning action plan that I will immediately start implementing if I’m elected as the next Labour Deputy Leader. **Download Grassroots revival**It starts with changes we must make to our internal organisation. We must overhaul the complaints process. I’ll remove the team from HQ and make it independent, put a time limit on reviewing complaints, and ensure those involved with each case are kept informed of its progress. I also want to start unlocking Labour’s membership talent. It’s not all about delivering leaflets and knocking on doors - we have social media experts, journalists, policy gurus, videographers and many other talents in our ranks. Let’s start making the most of that! For new members, attending meetings can feel daunting - we need to make them more enjoyable and accessible for all. We can ensure party democracy and due process are followed, while making meetings a more enjoyable experience. For example, some CLPs still spend up to an hour arguing about the minutes of the last meeting - which turns off new members. We need to streamline the procedural matters and get more political debate into our local meetings. We can be sociable too! I want to help local groups organise regional social events that break even, instead of looking to make a profit. Quiz nights, continuing the great work of Stand Up For Labour, pub nights, coffee mornings - let’s bring our movement together and celebrate all that we have to offer. Let’s look at how to grow and diversify our movement even further. I’ll offer reduced membership rates to emergency service workers, to encourage them to join the Party and have their say over how we fight to save our NHS. I would support BAME members to hold elected office - I will produce literature to be made available to BAME officers to distribute to new members, “how to be a councillor” meetings will be offered in each borough - not as an afterthought - and I will work with BAME officers to listen to what resources they need. We must start upgrading our technology and infrastructure - we’re running campaigns in 2020 with two colour printers from the 80s and 90s. I’d ensure every CLP has access to a full colour RISO printer (or similar). We can also boost data driven testing of our methods. Comparisons of leaflets, direct mails, e-newsletters, social media and canvassing will allow us to be so much more targeted and effective. A significant amount of dedicated time went into creating software and apps to revolutionise our digital campaigning in recent years but the party didn’t have the resources to fully roll them out - the doorknocking app, dialogue and chatter could have really helped us but members didn’t know how to use them or didn’t know they existed. Contact Creator regularly broke down during the General Election and the user interface hasn’t changed for over a decade. This must all change. Let’s also have a digital team at HQ who goes to every target seat, showing them how to make the most of Facebook ads, emails, Twitter, creating graphics and videos. Let’s also start looking at how to produce more personalised and localised content. The party produces some great literature and supplies it to key seats, but the vast majority of it is national with no localisation. Some leaflets and letters just didn’t arrive in 2019 for some seats, which left them in the dark, and adequate support was not available to deal with it, because staff were already overstretched. We must be better prepared. The manifesto came out weeks after the print deadlines for seats to order their leaflets and letters. I will ensure the necessary information is available to candidates in good time. The Labour Party must do better at supporting our candidates – I’ll make sure they all get adequate briefings and lines for use in their own leaflets, letters, emails and press releases. Candidates and their teams are superheroes, but they aren’t invincible, and campaigns can take their toll both financially, physically and mentally - This is why I’ll set up a dedicated team to offer mental health support and advice during difficult times. Too often, local organisers and staff have contracts that end at 10pm on polling day - this culture needs to change. Organisers put in endless hours to help our campaigns succeed and to dump them when polls close is just simply wrong. I’ll ensure no staff contracts end on Election Day, giving them vital time to find new employment. I also want to establish a system of sharing best practice amongst CLPs and boroughs. Campaigns shouldn’t have borders - we don’t have to operate solely within our constituency or ward boundaries. We need proper twinning with key seats. There’s no sugar-coating it – the Labour Party is in a critical condition right now. But with the right treatment, the right approach and the right support from the leadership team, we can get it back to fighting fitness. With the local elections coming up in May, there’s no time to waste. Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan MP for Tooting There is absolutely no place for antisemitism within the Labour Party, and I will put all my energy into rebuilding trust with the Jewish community.\nMy first major meeting will be with Jewish Labour Movement - they are Labour's official Jewish affiliate and we must trust them. I’ll separate the complaints process from head office, making it truly independent - to begin the process of rebuilding the trust. Once that new team is in place, I'll immediately get them to review all cases, acting swiftly and expelling antisemites. For future, I'll put a time limit on when cases need to be resolved by (for now and in future). The investigation from the Equality and Human Rights Commission is not an optional piece of diversity training, it's an embarrassment that this issue has gone so far without real action. The report they produce and the actions they want Labour to take are not optional - they are legally binding. I promise to fully adopt, without hesitation - every single one of their proposed steps. We are an open party, who welcome everyone from every background, no longer can we kick these issues into the long grass and offer the bare minimum in support and process. As Deputy Leader no form of racism will be accepted in our party. Front-line workers in the NHS have felt ignored by the Government - and now the Tories look set to give up the NHS for profit.\nThis Christmas I’ve been proud to support my hard-working colleagues on the front line by doing shifts in my local A&E. We’re all touched by the NHS at some point in our lives. For over 70 years it has been our lifeline, the glue holding our society together, often forgotten about, but there in our times of greatest need. The NHS is there to bring life, to offer care and dignity when we leave the world, and to support our loved ones when tragedy hits. But front-line workers in the NHS have felt ignored and that the Government does not recognise the day-to-day pressures they face. It didn’t start with claims on the side of a bus during the European referendum campaign in 2016 but, since then, using the NHS for political gain certainly picked up pace. Throughout the election, Boris Johnson repeatedly denied that the NHS would be up for sale. Just two weeks after the election, it was revealed that NHS cancer care and children’s treatments are up for grabs in a stealth Tory sell-off. Cardiology, gynaecology, paediatrics and oncology are among the services being offered to companies. As an A&E doctor, when someone is rushed into A&E having a heart attack, we work to patch someone up before sending them off to heart specialists. How will it feel knowing that those services are now being provided by a private company? Where is the trust? Allowing hospital trusts to outsource treatment to private companies could lead to a postcode lottery of health care, further widening the health divide. We need to be bringing the UK together, not tearing it apart, turning communities against each other. On top of this, discussions are taking place with tech giants on how to make money from patient data. While we must do everything possible to look for cures and ensure a better patient journey, we need to know how our own data is being used. The last decade has shown us that we must exercise caution with tech giants. The Government does not have the money or expertise needed to create an anonymised patient database, which is exactly why Amazon and Microsoft have been approached. Trust in our NHS cannot be destroyed because without trust, everything else could be up for grabs. I was stunned and heartbroken after the election result and bereft at what it would mean for our NHS. Our hospitals, treatments and dedicated staff cannot simply be sold off to the highest bidder. These aren’t the principles our NHS was founded and built on and I will continue fighting, standing side by side with our hospital workers, to protect our NHS from those who wish to destroy it. Shadow minister launches deputy leadership bid with a unifying pitch\nLabour must move past the factionalism and “ideological purity” that has alienated voters across the country, the shadow minister Rosena Allin-Khan has said as she set out her pitch to become the party’s deputy leader. The A&E doctor who has served on Jeremy Corbyn’s frontbench is the latest party figure to officially throw their hat in the ring for the deputy leadership, alongside the shadow cabinet members Angela Rayner and Richard Burgon. Allin-Khan, 43, said that for too long the party had been weighted down by infighting and described her politics as being inspired by public service, which she said was not based within soft- or hard-left identities. “I’ve got the campaigning experience but also the life experience to help rebuild the party again,” said Allin-Khan, who has been a shadow minister for sport since 2016 and still works hospital shifts. “We need to move beyond the last few years where nasty internal debates about faction and ideological purity have too often alienated people outside our movement. “Public service isn’t about identifying who sits on which side of the Labour party. I am Labour because of my values, my life experiences and the fact that I’m a doctor. We must communicate how we are going to change people’s lives in a way they can understand.” Her pitch as a unifying figure across Labour’s political spectrum would involve trying to make inroads in Scotland and Wales and other heartland areas that went Conservative, by holding town hall events, as well as meetings in synagogues, churches, mosques and temples. She said to rebuild the party’s base Labour must listen far more to councillors, who she says are the experts in their communities. The Tooting MP, who has a Pakistani father and Polish mother, dismissed concerns that Labour must have a leadership team that is drawn from northern constituencies. “I grew up poor with a single mum working three jobs to support me and my brother. That taught me the reality of day to day life for people across this country,” she said. “There’s no regional distinction to hunger. Loss of hope lives across the UK. London is used to mean ‘metropolitan elite’ but we also have some of the highest levels of deprivation. “Growing up in poverty. Understanding what it was like to get a job really young to supplement household income, to being careful in supermarkets with food, to feel there was no hope for someone from your background – that experience gives me a fire in my stomach to fight for all people around the country that have to go through that.” The mother of two studied medicine at Cambridge through Labour-initiated scholarships after initially failing her A-levels during a period of difficult family circumstances. After qualifying as a doctor she has worked as an A&E specialist in London hospitals and as a humanitarian aid doctor in the Middle East, Africa and Asia for a decade. She won the Tooting seat in a 2016 by-election after Sadiq Khan quit to run as mayor of London. In parliament she has highlighted the difficulty Palestinian children in Gaza have in accessing healthcare in Israeli hospitals because their parents are not allowed to accompany them through a restrictive permit system. As part of her sports brief she has fought for the return of safe standing at football clubs, as well as being an advocate for the women’s game both in parliament and as a player herself. She was also a vociferous campaigner for the People’s Vote campaign on a second referendum but said she accepted the country was leaving the EU, even though she had fought so hard against it because she did not believe the deal would work for her constituents. As for rejoining the bloc, she said that would have to be looked at if it should ever come up but was not a priority. Despite Corbyn being rejected at the election, she pointed out positive changes he made for the party, including a more welcoming immigration policy, and said she was proud of his strong anti-austerity message and the party’s continued support for the NHS. But on the defeat, she said: “We threw everything out there and nothing had time to land effectively. In comparison the Tories used three words and a few repeated soundbites which ultimately proved effective.” She said she would be happy to work with any leadership candidate should they be elected. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

I am delighted that more than 100 local businesses have already signed up to become a Safe Space.\nFor more details, head to the Safe Space here\nWith the nights getting longer and recent rise in crime, some people feel uncomfortable walking in public alone. I’ve launched my Safe Space campaign, where local businesses can sign up to offer a place of safety.\nFor businesses that would like to sign-up, head to drrosena.co.uk/safespace\nToday, I brought together officials from Wandsworth Council and Wandsworth Police to discuss what we can do to make Tooting Broadway a safer, cleaner and more vibrant place to live and work.\nSince the horrific terrorist attacks on Israel in October, more than 1,000 incidents of antisemitic hate crimes have been reported to Community Secure Trust.\nToday, I visited their headquarters in London to see the work they are doing to tackle antisemitism. It is a stain on our society. It must be combatted and those who perpetrate it must face the full force of the law.\nTonight, I invited Wandsworth Police to join our community to discuss how they’re working with Wandsworth Council to tackle violence against women and girls.\nMaking our community safe is a key priority for me. My door is always open. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch.\nPolice forces across England are set to stop attending many incidents concerning mental health under a new National Partnership Agreement: Right Care, Right Person.\nThe Government's announcement leaves far too many questions unanswered and fails to tackle the root problem of lengthy NHS waiting lists in mental health services. I have written to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, asking him to come clean on what action he is taking to tackle mental health waiting lists. Read my full letter here:\nOne of the most important jobs I do as your local Member of Parliament is ensuring that our wonderful communities in Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown, Tooting and Wandsworth Common remain safe and welcoming places to live.\nTo this end, I have recently hosted public meetings with local police leadership in Balham and Furzedown, conducted a walkaround with the Borough Superintendent around the local area, and written to the police on behalf of local residents on a wide range of issues. Please do let me know if you have any concerns regarding crime issues in the local area - my door is always open. Today, I asked Wandsworth Police officers to join me on a walk about in Tooting Bec.\nWe spoke to local residents and discussed tackling anti-social behaviour in the area. I know local residents have raised a number of concerns - about incidents targeting children and public safety in the area. I addressed these matters with the police, along with strategies already put in place aimed specifically at reducing worrying incidents of this kind and crime. Over recent months, I have taken the following action on anti-social behaviour and crime on the Heaver Estate:\nBaroness Casey's independent findings of racist, misogynistic, and homophobic abuses of power within the Met Police are deeply shocking and will leave many residents in Tooting concerned that the trust between the police and our community has been shattered.\nIt is clear that there is a failure of leadership from the Home Office and today's report lays bare the scale of the challenge needed to reform the Met Police. The rot runs right through the force, so no stone can be left unturned in the push for change. I welcome the work that Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has already begun with the new Commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, in addressing these deep-rooted issues and regaining the trust of residents and victims of crime in Tooting. However, under this Home Secretary and this Conservative Government, the Met Police are lacking the leadership, ambition and resources needed to grasp the scale of this challenge. Over the last 13 years, neighbourhood policing has been decimated, whilst prosecutions for violent and sexual crimes have hit the lowest levels on record, and victims of crime are now unsure that if they report a crime, the police will even turn up. It is clear we need a Government with a plan to overhaul policing in London which will deliver cultural and systematic change. Under a Labour Government, we will overhaul policing and raise standards, with strengthened training and mandatory vetting, and the restoration of neighbourhood policing. I would like to thank our hardworking neighbourhood police officers who have always worked constructively with me and for their continuing efforts to keep our local community safe. Our latest research, shows that in 2021/22, the total number of days lost to poor mental health has doubled to more than 730,000 over the last decade. This comes at the same time that there has been a drop in the number of neighbourhood police officers by 6,000 and of Police Community Support Officers by 8,500.\nThese absences equate to over 2,000 police officers being off sick each day, last year alone, due to poor mental health. It is clear that this Conservative Government has presided over 13 years of neglect and staff shortages that have left our public services at breaking point. The next Labour Government will recruit 8,500 more mental health professionals, ensuring a million more patients get treated each year; and we will rebuild neighbourhood policing, delivering a package of 13,000 extra neighbourhood officers and PCSOs, putting police back on the beat.

The Scheme helps schools install heat pumps, solar panels and other technologies to assist with schools hitting environmental targets.\nSustainability and green initiatives are absolutely vital in tackling climate change, and I am very pleased that local schools have been selected to help lead the way. With the ceasefire in Gaza in tatters, the devastation and human suffering there will only continue. In Parliament, I pushed the Foreign Secretary, David Lammy MP, to confirm whether his department holds any evidence that international law has been violated. I joined Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper MP at St George's Hospital to see the impact of their new knife amnesty bin.\nSince December, 47 weapons have already been handed in. It is great to see so many dangerous weapons being taken off our streets. Over the past months, I have heard from many local people who have been experiencing shocking delays to their post. Today, I went down to the local sorting office to meet with Royal Mail directors and pushed them to urgently rectify this issue. I am pleased to say that they have agreed to turn it around in 4 weeks. If you've been affected, please share your experience here: http://drrosena.co.uk/postdelays During these troubling times, we have never needed our EU friends and allies more.\nTogether, we can face down the threat of Putin and stand united to protect democracy. This week, I was in Brussels meeting MEPs to learn how we can work together in our shared defence interests. Today marks the fifth anniversary of the World Health Organisation declaring COVID-19 a pandemic. Our lives would change monumentally in the weeks and months that followed and, sadly, many of us would lose loved ones. Now is the time to remember all who lost their lives and celebrate the NHS heroes who did everything they could. The Environment Agency has provided another update following the weekend's work on the River Wandle to clean up last week's oil spill.\nI am pleased to hear that the majority of the pollution appears to have been cleared. The specialist contractors managing the clean-up report that the river is looking much better today, with very little visible oil sheen remaining and no further oil being washed from vegetation along the riverbanks. The Environment Agency tells me that, due to the swift response of multiple agencies, including the emergency services, local authorities, and charities, the impact on the environment around the Wandle appears to be minimal. Thankfully, the number of affected wildlife remains low. The few wild birds that have been impacted are being cared for by the RSPCA. No fish mortalities have been reported, and the fish populations in the Wandle appear to remain healthy. Investigations into this incident are ongoing, and options for enforcement are being considered by the Environment Agency and its partners. People are still urged to be cautious and keep pets away from the water and angling is not recommended for the time being. If you see any further signs of diesel around the Wandle, please contact the Environment Agency on its 24/7 incident number: 0800 807060 or via email at [email protected]. The Environment Agency continue to keep me updated about the recent oil spill into the River Wandle. The Environment Agency, along with emergency services, Thames Water, the RSPB, and local authorities, are actively working on containment and clean-up efforts.\nKey Points:\nMy office will continue to monitor the situation and I will provide any updates as they come in. Yesterday, I became aware that an incident had occurred on the River Wandle where diesel oil had spilled from a bus depot in Thornton Heath into the river.\nThe Wandle is a vital ecosystem, and is home to a range of wildbirds, fish, frogs and toads. It is critical to protect this pocket of wildlife and to ensure the progress made in bringing the river back to life is not allowed to slide backwards. I have been in contact with the Environment Agency who tell me that they are working to assess the impact of the oil on water quality and wildlife along the course of the river, as well as putting in place plans to extract the oil from the river. This remedial work will continue over the coming days. The Environment Agency advises local residents to report any oil spotted in the river to the Environment Agency's emergency hotline by phone 0800 807060 or email [email protected] Today, in Parliament, I launched the All Party Parliamentary Group on Emergency Care. As a doctor at the A&E in St George's, I know my colleagues up and down the country work tirelessly to provide the highest standards of care for their patients in some of the most difficult of circumstances.\nOur group of Parliamentarians is committed to fighting to improve emergency care at every level. We will be hearing from experts, publishing reports and making sure that the importance of emergency care is highlighted in Government policy. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

All too often it made me too afraid to speak, for fear of being ridiculed.\nPeople that have stammers aren't victims. Stammers are a normal part of life. Today I had such an amazing time with the ladies on Loose Women, opening up publicly about it for the first time. With greater awareness and better representation of people with stammers, we can become a society where people who are disfluent are not stigmatised. Great as always to catch up with my friend Denise Welch. And shout out to Adam Alexander in Tooting for my new, fresh hair colour.\nVisiting Earlsfield Primary, I saw first-hand how universal free school meals are working to produce a level playing field in schools and provide all children with a delicious and nutritious lunch.\nLunch should never be a struggle for families or a time of stress and stigma for children – and Labour Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan’s funding means it won’t be here in London. The verdict from the judges that matter: the Red Velvet cake with beetroot was a hit.\nIt was an absolute pleasure to take part in Wimbledon Sustainable Fashion Week with Wimbledon Go Inspire. I was so inspired by the incredible panel talking about sustainable fashion. I even got to wear some incredible sustainable knitwear. With 80 prison officers unavailable on the day Daniel Khalife escaped from Wandsworth Prison - it beggars belief that he was even allowed to work in the kitchen. The Government need to explain themselves. This morning, I've been out and about in Tooting with Wandsworth Police Officers. We've been talking to residents who are concerned about rising street drinking and anti-social behaviour.\nTogether we're now working to increase the number of patrols in the area and ensure that resident's concerns are being addressed. London to Brighton? Completed it.\nFleur Anderson and I absolutely smashed a 55-mile bike ride, raising money for the brilliant St George's Hospital Charity. I can't believe just how challenging it was and I want to thank everyone who helped us to smash our fundraising target. You can still donate here Today, I've been speaking about the very serious concerns I have regarding the prisoner escape from Wandsworth Prison. The Government need to provide answers regarding how this was allowed to happen. With schools crumbling, our prisons falling apart, and the NHS on it's knees, you can't trust the Tories with the NHS.

With children waiting days in A&E in a mental health crisis and more than one million people being turned away from mental health services without being seen, it is vital that we transform care by putting prevention at the heart of our plan.\nThis Government should not cut corners when it comes to young people’s mental health. Good mental health starts in childhood. Labour’s vision for future generations is one where mental health conditions are treated early. Adverse childhood experiences are the greatest driver of mental illness in adulthood – it’s just common sense to get mental health treatment right for young people in order to transform the future of the country’s mental health. The next Labour Government will ensure access to a mental health professional in every school, and we will put an open access mental health hub in every community. Every child should have the ability to raise concerns about their mental health with someone they trust, in an environment in which they feel safe. All of this will be funded by ending tax breaks for private schools. Read my full article here Today, the Committee's Report on the Draft Mental Health Bill has been published - this is a once in a generation opportunity to improve the rights of patients experiencing a mental health crisis and to tackle the health inequalities enshrined in current legislation.\nOver the last six months, I've been proud to work with my committee colleagues, listening to patient voices and evidence from experts. We heard heartbreaking accounts from patients. Above all else, the legislation has to protect them and ensure they receiving appropriate care. For years, the Government kicked updating this legislation into the long grass, and now, the current draft bill still does not go far enough to tackle the racial disparity of those detained under the Mental Health Act. Patient voices must be at the heart of this legislation. Read the full report here: https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt5803/jtselect/jtmentalhealth/696/report.html Today, Justin Madders MP and I met with the Retail trade union Usdaw and a group of retail workers in Westminster to talk about how the cost-of-living crisis, rising violence and abuse in stores, and the impact of Christmas holiday trade is affecting the mental health of customers and colleagues.\nFar too many people are facing this Christmas period worried about how to provide for their families. With so many Usdaw members having their mental health impacted as a result of the cost-of-living crisis and increased levels of abuse in the workplace, it is deeply important that we, as politicians, take the time to listen. An undercover joint investigation by Sky News and The Independent has raised serious concerns about the safety of patients at inpatient settings ran by the Huntercombe Group.\nThis is the third investigation into abuse in secure inpatient mental health settings, in four weeks. The system is broken. I previously wrote to Therese Coffey, the previous Health Secretary, to raise my concerns about other similar investigations highlighting allegations of abuse, by Channel 4 Dispatches and BBC Panorama, but did not receive a response. The Government has been silent over these allegations and for weeks there wasn’t even a functioning Mental Health Minister. Patients, and their families, deserve answers. They deserve dignity, respect and access to high quality treatment, which is why I have called for a rapid review into mental health services and the way patients are treated in inpatient settings. See my statement in Parliament here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1587420289662492672?s=20&t=Gj2YhL3GB3Os4nSrRoGK7Q There is a crisis in our universities up and down the country, with record numbers of students now seeking mental health support, according to our latest research. Through Freedom of Information requests, we found that over 200,000 students sought support for their mental health across the UK in 2020-2021 – a threefold increase, since 2010. The lack of mental health support for our young people is not only affecting their health, but it also having a knock-on impact on their future prospects.\nUniversities are struggling to cope with the rising demand for access to the mental health treatment students need. Every five days, a student takes their own life. That is why Labour has put forward a comprehensive plan, that will put prevention of the heart of mental health services. Under Labour’s plan, we will recruit 8,500 new mental health professionals by the end of our first term in office, to see an addition one million patients per year. See more about the crisis in mental health at universities, here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1579388728153604098?s=20&t=CcG6Wxm1iHr6xo0Cfsjyww Parents arriving in A&E with ashen faces holding their children, whose bodies are skeletal and covered in cuts. Families are on suicide watch. Frontline NHS workers are at breaking point. This is the reality of Tory Britain in 2022.\nOur latest research has shown that more than a million patients referred to mental health services were turned away over the last 12 months, whilst the cost of mental illness to the British economy is £117 billion a year. This is the direct result of 12 years of Conservative mismanagement of our economy and public services. We need a growing economy to pay for modern, preventative sustainable healthcare, but we can only do this with a Labour Government that will put our public services back on track. The next Labour Government will transform our mental health services: new staff, new services, faster treatment, and prevention as our watchword. Better mental health for all. Read my latest piece in the Daily Mirror here. https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1579113927438663681?s=20&t=FTZA6bYs6BUjLJ-vVYAmzg The Prime Minister has been forced to abandon her unfunded tax cut for the 1% of highest earners.\nThis Government U-turn is too late for the families who will pay higher mortgages for years to come. It will also do nothing to help or to reassure the people in Tooting and beyond. The Tories have destroyed their economic credibility and damaged trust in the British economy. Twelve years of Tory government have left the economy in chaos, and the new Prime Minister continues to make it up as she goes along. Today’s U-turn does not mark a move away from disastrous Tory economics, it’s just some districation. The Government needs to reverse their trickle down strategy. It just doesn’t work. Instead, they need to offer a programme of measures that will offer real support to those struggling with rises in food and energy bills, and increases in rent and mortgage payments. Too many people will struggle to pay their bills and put food on the table this winter, and the Government must step in now. Labour will revolutionise mental health treatment – putting prevention front and centre.\nIf ever there was an argument that prevention is better than cure, it is with mental health. We know that the longer mental illnesses are left untreated, the harder and more costly they are to treat. This mental health crisis is wrecking the British economy. Last year, 18 million work days were lost to mental illness - more than industrial disputes, more than injuries. It costs the UK economy at least £117 billion a year. And who does the cost-of-living crisis hit the hardest? Those already living with mental illnesses. The next Labour Government will guarantee treatment within a month, recruit 8,500 new staff, put a specialist in every school and a hub in every community. Labour will transform our mental health services: New staff. New services. Faster treatment. Prevention as our watchword. Better mental health for all. Watch my full speech here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1575177559943581696?s=20&t=wn3hxvRyskYM3JmyFl3dlg Fresh off the back of our trip to South Wales yesterday, Luke Pollard MP and I continued to take the fight to the Tories today, this time in Reading.\nWe kicked off the day with a doorknocking session in Reading West, another Tory-held marginal seat where it is essential Labour wins at the next general election. We were delighted to be joined by my colleague, Matt Rodda, MP for Reading East, who took us to a community-run cafe to show the empowering work that local people are doing on a daily basis. Reading is a great example of what Labour can do in power - the town's carbon emissions have been reduced by 70% in the last 12 years and the Council is currently investing £88 million in over 300 new social housing homes across Reading. Today, my friend Luke Pollard MP and I visited the lush landscape of South Wales in order to continue our fight to put Keir Starmer in 10 Downing Street.\nWe visited Barry Island (cue many Gavin and Stacey references!) in the Vale of Glamorgan seat and Chepstow in Monmouth - two vitally important areas that Labour needs to win to form a government. Labour took control of both Vale of Glamorgan & Monmouthshire Councils after the May elections and I greatly enjoyed campaigning with local members, building on that momentum in order to elect two new Labour MPs at the next election. Of course, a trip to Barry Island would not be complete without a wander down the beautiful seafront, complete with ice cream. Lloniannau! |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

It was brilliant to welcome residents from Tooting and Furzedown. I am really grateful to everyone who attended, including some local organisations and charities who do invaluable work in the community.\nMany people in Gaza were already living in appalling conditions before this latest conflict. If the Israeli bombardment continues and aid doesn't get through, I really fear for the consequences. Today, I appeared on Peston to reiterate calls for an immediate ceasefire in Israel and Gaza. Every effort needs to be made to work towards a peaceful solution. See my clip here:\nToday in Parliament, I challenged the Foreign Secretary to call on his Israeli counterpart to demand an immediate ceasefire to the escalating crisis in Gaza. While rightly calling out Hamas’ horrific attacks, we also have a duty to speak on behalf of those innocent Palestinians who are being collectively punished, starved and bombed in their own homes by Israeli forces. See my question here:\nTonight, I held a peace vigil at Tooting Broadway station to bring our community together to remember all those who have died in Israel and Gaza recently. I want to pay a huge thanks to the representatives from our local religious groups who said a prayer for peace.\nDuring some of our darkest hours, Tooting reminds us that there is always hope. Today marks International Stammer Awareness Day. I know from my own experience, the impact the stigma of stammering has on those affected. We must not create a narrative of trying to fix people with speech disfluency. Instead we need to work to create a more inclusive society.\nToday, I was on BBC Politics Live ahead of Prime Minister Questions, to discuss the conflict in Israel and Gaza, free speech and the drinking culture in Westminster.\nThe Government is dragging its feet on reforming mental health services – it's costing people their lives.\nI asked the Minister if she will keep her promise to reform the Mental Health Act - there was no answer. This is a Government out of ideas. We need a General Election now.\nTonight, I invited Wandsworth Police to join our community to discuss how they’re working with Wandsworth Council to tackle violence against women and girls.\nMaking our community safe is a key priority for me. My door is always open. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch.\nPalestinians must not pay the collective price for the acts of terror carried out by Hamas. World leaders have a duty to ensure Israel doesn’t deliberately indiscriminately target civilians.\nIn Parliament today, I sought assurances from the Prime Minister regarding Gaza: - Incendiary weapons won't be used in civilian areas. - Hospitals/medics won't be targeted. - Food, water and electricity immediately restored. - No occupation of Gaza.\nThe Hamas attacks on Israel in recent days were horrific. The brutal murder of innocent civilians in their own homes, killing innocent festivalgoers, raping women and taking children hostage must be condemned in the strongest possible terms - nothing can justify it. Those who planned and carried out the attacks must face justice.\nWe have not been close to peace in the region, but there is no doubt that these attacks, and the response from Israel, will set us back many years. This will be devastating for the many innocent people in Israel and Palestine who just want peace. I fear it will be innocent men, women and children from Gaza who are going to pay the price for Hamas' attacks. I have been very critical of Netanyahu throughout the years, and I really do worry about what the next few days and weeks will bring. The cutting off of water, gas and electricity supplies breaches a whole host of internationally recognised laws. Refusing to allow aid in and stopping food supplies will hit the most vulnerable the hardest. Countless innocent lives will be lost and the international community must work on a resolution that de-escalates the conflict as soon as possible. The discourse I've seen on Twitter has appalled me in recent days, which is why I have decided to post this on my website, instead of there. I have worked as a humanitarian doctor in the region, spanning a period of over a decade. I've always sought the recognition of a sovereign Palestinian state, and my views have not changed, I believe it is the only way to achieve peace in the region. But I will also call out barbaric attacks when they occur. The rape and murder of innocent civilians should be called out and I'm sure the vast majority of people will share my disgust. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

These kids have an outlet to learn about agriculture and animals in a supportive environment. I’m so proud of the work the farm is doing, and I’m looking forward to returning to see everyone soon - especially the adorable animals. This week the Council finally listened to us! Our beloved Tooting Bec Athletics Track will be saved and get the investment it so desperately needs and deserves. To lose such a valuable asset in our community would be a devastating blow to so many of our young people. Having this track will be useful for encouraging young people to be physically active and lead a healthy lifestyle. Thank you to everyone who joined the efforts to save our track! It was an absolute pleasure to spend time at Beatrix Potter school today. The students were engaged, Year 3's cursive handwriting was impressive, and Year 6 had insightful suggestions on tackling the climate emergency. It's safe to say there were some future leaders in the room! It’s incredibly insightful to see young leaders develop and put their ideas into practice to shape the world in the future. I was truly inspired. Thank you for having me! It was an absolute pleasure to spend time at the Khalsa Centre Gurdwara here in Tooting, sharing prayers and food. It was nice to meet the Sikh community at the Gurdwara. Our community is a vibrant and multicultural place, and the diversity of our community is such a strength. Thank you so much for the warm welcome. Last week was the first time in two years, Tooting came together for the Multi-Faith Peace Ceremony. The importance of this ceremony is that leaders of the main faiths and civic leaders gather with the general public to express prayers and wishes for peace and community solidarity. Our community stood side-by-side, many faiths, all ages, and people from all walks of life who bonded over those differences. It was a real honour to be asked to speak and say a few words. Thank you.\nIt was a privilege to speak at the 13th Annual Black Mental Health Conference, hosted by Wandsworth Community Empowerment Network. As a society, we have to understand the role cultural contact and intersecting identities play when working to support those struggling with their mental health. And we must continue to push back against stigma and foster an open and honest dialogue around mental health in our communities. Thank you for having me. It was great to be part of the 'Any Questions' panel last night. During the show, I spoke about how every death caused by the Covid-19 pandemic is more than just a number. Each death is a family, torn apart by grief by losing a loved one.\nMask wearing, supporting people with proper sick pay, ensuring that indoor areas are ventilated - these are all things that should have never ended. As winter approaches, the Government must take the risk posed by Coronavirus seriously. The Government needs to step and take the safety of people seriously. If you missed the show, you can listen back here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0010nv1 Rough sleeping is a significant and growing concern within our community. With its causes and symptoms, it’s a complex issue. But in a country as decent and well off as ours, we should not be seeing this increase in rough sleeping on our streets. I invited council reps, the City Hall housing team and local police to join me and see the issues in our community first-hand. I'm working hard to bring agencies together and effect change. The Year 2s at Tooting Primary School have been learning all about strong women. I was honoured to be invited to speak with the pupils all about being what it means to be a doctor and represent our wonderful community as MP. It is so important that we recognise and champion the voices and stories of strong women. And the students had great questions.

Shamefully, the Minister refused to commit to funding. This is just further proof that this Tory Government couldn't care less about our NHS heroes.\nYesterday, I was delighted to join CEN for their Healing our Broken Village Black Mental Health Conference at the New Testament Assembly church in Tooting.\nWith continued racial disparities in sectioning and the use of community treatment orders, more must be done to bring about much-needed change.\nThe Tories' Rwanda Bill is one of the most shameful pieces of legislation in recent memory on both moral and practical grounds, which is why I voted 20 times against the Bill last night.\nAs part of my former role as Shadow Minister for Mental Health, I worked very closely with Melanie Leahy and other campaigners affected by the terrible deaths in Essex mental health hospitals.\nThe Terms of Reference for the inquiry into this scandal have now at long last been published.

If you have a problem with your state benefits or pension, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me and I'd be happy to help. I wish everyone in Tooting and beyond a peaceful and blessed Eid. My thoughts and prayers are especially with all those facing hardship and suffering at this time.\nMaking Wandsworth a greener and cleaner borough was a key policy in our campaign in the 2022 local elections, which is why I'm delighted that the new Labour administration in the Town Hall have now rolled out food waste recycling bins across the local area.\nIt is shameful that the Prime Minister continues to allow the sale of British weapons and military equipment to Israel.in breach of the UK's international commitments. I have been calling for a suspension of sales immediately and my comments can be read in the Independent here. Last week, I also signed a joint letter to the Foreign and Business Secretaries alongside a cross-party group of over 130 MPs, calling for the halting of UK arms sales to Israel.

This year was particularly challenging. For many pupils, this was their first experience of exams in a formal sense, after GCSEs were suspended during the pandemic. Grade boundaries were also raised to return to 2019 levels. However, our students and schools excelled, with a number of Tooting schools exceeding the London average of 30% A*-A grades – itself a pass rate that is the highest in the country. London schools are still benefitting from the London Challenge investment of the last Labour government. Our Tooting students and our Tooting schools and staff are something to celebrate. We are so proud of you.\nAll too often, children are stuck on long waiting lists for mental health treatment and thousands of people are having their referrals closed before an appointment.\nThis Tory Government caused the crisis in mental health services - when will they fix it?\nOur exclusive data reveals that children in a mental health crisis spent more than 900,000 hours in A&E in England, last year. The total delays across England, in the past year alone, equate to 103 years of waiting time. This is a huge rise, up four-fold in the last decade.\nThe figures, made public through Freedom of Information requests, show the staggering number of hours that children have spent in a mental health crisis in Emergency Departments. With nowhere to turn, children with a mental illness are left to deteriorate – at which time A&E is the only place left for them to go. Emergency Departments are incredibly unsuitable settings for children in crisis, yet we’re witnessing increasingly younger children having to present to A&E in desperation. The next Labour Government will prioritise a truly preventative plan for mental health services and will put patient care first. We will ensure access to mental health professionals in every school and put an open access hub in every community, in addition to guaranteeing mental health treatment within a month for all who need it, by recruiting 8,500 new mental health staff to treat a million additional patients a year by Labour’s first term in office., funded by closing tax loopholes. Read the full article here For Children's Mental Health Week, I've written for LabourList about Labour's bold, transformative plan to deliver mental health care for children and young people. With children waiting days in A&E in a mental health crisis and more than one million people being turned away from mental health services without being seen, it is vital that we transform care by putting prevention at the heart of our plan.\nThis Government should not cut corners when it comes to young people’s mental health. Good mental health starts in childhood. Labour’s vision for future generations is one where mental health conditions are treated early. Adverse childhood experiences are the greatest driver of mental illness in adulthood – it’s just common sense to get mental health treatment right for young people in order to transform the future of the country’s mental health. The next Labour Government will ensure access to a mental health professional in every school, and we will put an open access mental health hub in every community. Every child should have the ability to raise concerns about their mental health with someone they trust, in an environment in which they feel safe. All of this will be funded by ending tax breaks for private schools. Read my full article here Recently I visited the fantastic Balham Ballers holiday club, based at Ravensbourne Primary school.\nBalham Ballers provide a sports programme for young people aged five to twelve over the school holidays, focusing mainly on football but also giving young people a chance to enjoy a wide range of other sporting activities. I have loved working with the Balham Ballers team over the last few years and it has been fantastic to see them go from strength to strength. Balham Ballers are passionate about promoting a love of sports amongst both boys and girls. This is something that I am particularly supportive of. Following the Lionesses' fantastic win at the Euros earlier this month, the England football team have said \"every girl should be given the chance to play football at school.\" However, currently only 63% of schools offer equal access to football, a number that falls to just 44% at secondary schools. It was great to see so many young people in our community enjoying football, and I even took a penalty myself! To find out more about the Balham Ballers, click here.\nIt was so nice to be at Smallwood Primary School to learn about the fantastic work of the Chefs In Schools. It's amazing that all catering is now in-house, with chefs cooking food that has been grown by the students themselves. The children were so enthusiastic about their freshly cooked and nutritious lunches. I believe that the work we’re doing with Chefs in Schools will go a long way to promote positive attitudes and relationships with food and mealtimes for our young people. It was great to be able to support! It was great to be joined by Lord Wajid Khan at Rutherford House School. We met with the school's Pupil Leaders who had some insightful questions about our work in Parliament, and also taught us about their values of resilience and respect. What a credit to the next generation! So glad that I was able to attend this event with Lord Khan. Tom's Farm at Nightingale Academy is truly special. From taking care of the animals to competing in national young farmer competitions, students here are provided with the very best learning opportunities. These kids have an outlet to learn about agriculture and animals in a supportive environment. I’m so proud of the work the farm is doing, and I’m looking forward to returning to see everyone soon - especially the adorable animals. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Trains in the morning evening peaks, to and from Central London, have all seen a worsening of their \"on-time percentage\" in the last six months compared to the same period of 2023. The full breakdown of delays at each station is below. It is shocking to see that, not only are trains late at some stations late half the time, but that there has been a steady decline from an already-unacceptable level of lateness last year. Particularly concerning are the figures at Tooting station, where over half of services were late despite there being only two services per hour on that line.\nSome of the worst performing services include: 8:05 from Balham (8:07 from Wandsworth Common) to Victoria - 88% late (Southern) 18:12 from Waterloo to Earlsfield - 81% late (South Western) 8:21 from Balham to Victoria - 79% late (Southern) 8:40 from Balham (8:42 from Wandsworth Common) to Victoria - 76% late (Southern) 8:13 from Tooting to London Blackfriars - 70% late (Thameslink) Local commuters deserve better than the shoddy service they are currently receiving from Southern, South Western and Thameslink. I look forward to the Government's plans to bring our local rail services back into public control, so that our trains are always run with the interests of the people who use them at heart.

The Government need to provide answers regarding how this was allowed to happen. With schools crumbling, our prisons falling apart, and the NHS on it's knees, you can't trust the Tories with the NHS. Following my letter to Network Rail regarding step-free access at Wandsworth Common Station, I was very pleased to receive confirmation that the station will be nominated for funding in the next round of the \"Access for All\" programme.\nThis programme has funded step-free access and other accessibility measures in stations across the country, including just down the line at Balham. This is a very encouraging first step in ensuring that public transport is available and convenient for everyone in the local community. Today, I have written to the Managing Director of the Southern Region of Network Rail calling for an investigation looking into improving accessibility and step-free access at Wandsworth Common Station.\nCurrently, there is step free access on Platform 1, but those wishing to travel on Platform 2 must cross an elevated footbridge, which is not accessible for wheelchair users, parents with young children, and the elderly. I have called for a feasibility study to be conducted, given the signifcant proportion of the local community that falls around the station. Read my full letter here: I've written to the Chief Executive of Bellway on behalf of residents at Fitzgerald and Fleming Houses on St George's Grove, many of whom have been left in limbo, unable to sell or re-mortgage their properties due to the flammable cladding that was installed by Bellway, when the houses were built. In May, London Fire Brigade instituted a waking watch on both of the buildings due to fire risk, which residents were forced to pay for themselves. I have been working alongside Bellway resident directors in good faith for months but have been met with delay and excuses while their properties remain without a suitable facade. My position is clear: Developers must fund remediations works on these properties and the replacement of the cladding to the new required standard. Leaseholders cannot be held liable for these costs. To add your name to the letter, sign below. It is an honour to have been unanimously re-selected by all the local party branches and affiliated organisations to stand as Labour’s candidate for Tooting in the next general election.\nI want to say a huge thank you to all the members and affiliates who took part, and who continue to put their trust in me to represent our community. Serving as the Member of Parliament for the community I grew up in is an honour. From helping local residents with casework, playing a part in winning the council, defending our NHS and serving as the shadow Minister to Mental Health - I have the best job in the world. My job is made even greater by the fantastic support local members show me all year round, so I want to take this opportunity to say a big thank you to them all! The next election is make-or-break for our party, we simply must win. I’m looking forward to working hard to make this happen. The NHS is being dismantled, I see it every time I work a shift. More people than ever are relying on foodbanks, and the cost-of-living crisis is having a devastating impact on people locally and across the country. I will be absolutely committed to doing everything I can to put Labour into Government and make the changes this country so desperately needs. Thank you again to everyone who voted. On Monday 13 June, I was delighted to welcome organisations and individuals from across Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting to Parliament, in order to recognise their fantastic contributions to society in the face of adversity in the last few years. It was a sheer joy to see the pillars of our communities together in one place and I look forward to continuing to collaborate and support the inspiring people who do so much for the local area.\nI presented the following organisations and individuals with trophies for truly exceptional services in the community: Councillor Andy Gibbons, for his dedicated public service over the last three decades.

I would like to thank all those who attended - I cannot overstate how proud I am of our community. Each and every one of you is a true Tooting Hero. 44 years of Tory rule in Wandsworth came to an end with Labour taking control of the Council after the local elections. Labour won 35 seats, whilst the Tories won 22. I was thrilled to play a part along with our fantastic Councillors, candidates, and activists in putting Labour into power locally.\nLabour’s historic victory here represents a new start for our borough, and it’s great to see Wandsworth’s group of Labour Councillors already taking action to help residents through the cost-of-living crisis. Talking to residents right across the borough, it was obvious to see that people in Wandsworth have rejected Conservative neglect both locally and nationally. The cost of living crisis is hitting residents hard, and it’s clear the Tories aren’t doing enough to address it. Wandsworth residents simply do not trust the Tories. The road to Labour in Government runs through our local councils, and I am hopeful this local victory will be the springboard to Labour’s general election victory. The Local Elections are hastily approaching on 5th May. After 44 long years of Tory rule, Wandsworth needs a breath of fresh air and a Labour council.\nOver the next four weeks, I will be out on the campaign trail - knocking on doors, delivering leaflets and working to help our fantastic Labour candidates. I would like to thank all the local residents for their support and warm welcome on the doorstep. Together we can turn Labour red this May! It was great to be joined by Wandsworth Police for my community safety event last night. We discussed local crime concerns, updated residents on local safety initiatives, and learned new ways to keep our homes safe. A big thank you to all who joined - the community feeling is strong. Additionally, it was great to hear from local residents about how we can make our area safer & about our success of the #SafeSpace campaign. Finally, we discussed future plans to tackle violence against women and girls. It was a privilege to speak at the 13th Annual Black Mental Health Conference, hosted by Wandsworth Community Empowerment Network. As a society, we have to understand the role cultural contact and intersecting identities play when working to support those struggling with their mental health. And we must continue to push back against stigma and foster an open and honest dialogue around mental health in our communities. Thank you for having me. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Oksana and her young son Dmytro have a sponsor ready and willing to welcome them into their home in the local area, however Home Office delays have stopped them travelling to safety in the United Kingdom.\nIt is inspiring and heartwarming to see the generosity shown by the British public in welcoming Ukrainian refugees into their lives, however Oksana and Dmytro have been let down badly by the Home Office. They applied to come to the UK in September last year and, so far, the Home Office have refused to provide a timeframe for a decision to both myself and their sponsor's solicitors. This is simply not good enough and the Government must get a grip. It was great to visit the wonderful volunteers at the White Eagle Club in Balham recently. The Tooting and Balham Community has rallied together to support the appeal for Ukraine since the Russian invasion in March. Since the appeal was launched, the White Eagle Club has sent 74 trucks, 112 vans, and a massive 1,800 tonnes of goods to Ukraine as part of their humanitarian aid mission. They have also provided many Ukrainian nationals who have recently fled to the UK with clothes, shoes, toiletries, and supplies for babies and infants. It’s always amazing to see the community come together to help those in need. There is however, still much more that the White Eagle Club needs, both for Ukrainian nationals arriving in the UK and to be sent to those still living in Ukraine. Items that are most in need include; medical supplies, toiletries, sanitary products and baby powder, as well as clothes for those who have recently arrived in the UK. You can donate items to 211 Balham High Street at the following times: Tuesdays: 11.00 - 20.00 Wednesday: 10.00 - 17.00 Thursday: 11.00-20.00 Friday: 10.00-17.00 Saturday 10.00-17.00 I arrived back home safely from Ukraine yesterday. I went on a humanitarian mission with MedGlobalOrg, who are helping support hospitals to prepare for the darkest days of this conflict.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_national_11/content_666.html": "|\nEven before the pandemic hit, the case for investing in this kind of support was clear. Coronavirus has exacerbated the existing crisis in mental health. Many NHS and social care staff have been scared of going to work, and they have lost patients and colleagues. It has been heartbreaking to witness the toll this virus has taken on staff mental health. Current support is not good enough, and without a tailored, fast-tracked service for staff who have faced death and despair every day for over three months, our frontline heroes will continue to be failed. We need to care for our carers. It is time for the Government to give back to those who have sacrificed so much to keep our loved ones safe. Unless our staff are protected, they cannot continue their vital work of keeping us all safe. The consequences of not having adequate personal protective equipment for NHS staff are devastatingBarely a day goes by without pictures online of frontline staff fashioning protection out of clinical waste bags. We need to ensure NHS staff are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients.\nThe challenge that coronavirus poses to our society is unprecedented. It is a scary and worrying time, especially for our NHS. Having worked as a frontline A&E doctor this weekend, in my local hospital, I am increasingly concerned that our health service may buckle under the increased strain that Covid-19 has brought. Our only priority must be to protect lives. Every possible resource we have should be dedicated to that single objective. Crucially, our NHS and healthcare workers on the frontlines must be given whatever resources they need to tackle this and to save lives. It’s disheartening then, that basic resources are in short supply. Full personal protective equipment (PPE) is vital to not only protect frontline staff, but also to limit the spread of infection to our loved ones and to our patients. The Government have known this crisis was coming for weeks, and yet they still have not been fully prepared for it. A country like the UK should not be having to ask manufacturing companies to switch production to provide emergency ventilators, or for NHS workers to have to go without PPE. The first part of my shift this weekend was spent looking for the correct masks and aprons - this is happening to frontline workers ahead of every shift, across the country. While we would all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. The consequences of this for NHS staff are devastating. There’s a feeling amongst many frontline staff that protective equipment is already being rationed. A few weeks ago, the guidance for healthcare staff treating people with confirmed cases of Covid-19 was to wear a full FFP3 mask as well as gloves and a full apron - now, that guidance has changed and we are told to only wear gloves and a basic surgical mask. Barely a day goes by without pictures online of frontline staff fashioning protection out of clinical waste bags. We need full transparency on decisions and changes to guidance, otherwise concerns will only grow. As this virus spreads, and as more and more people are forced into hospital, NHS workers are going to have to start making very difficult choices because of the limited resources they have available. They are going to have to start deciding who can access the most urgent care, including who is given priority for the last available ventilator - they’ll be making impossible choices about whose lives can be saved. We have already seen this happening in Italy, and it is an unimaginable tragedy for medics who are dedicated to saving lives above all else. The best way to help frontline staff who go to work to save lives, is for everyone else to stay home. We will get through this, together. The Government must take responsibility for providing all the resources and equipment the NHS needs, including vital PPE, for communicating the message on social distancing clearly to the public, and for enforcing it robustly. I welcome the new, more stringent measures announced yesterday – however, as Mike Ashley has shown, there’s still room for people to exploit it. As a country, we must do what will save the most lives. That’s true of the Government, people across the country, and medics on the frontline. The faster we get on top of this disease, the faster our society will be able to tackle this virus, and fewer lives will be lost. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can and we will save lives. Sports Direct has shown exactly what not to do during this pandemic. If we’re to beat coronavirus, we have to be selflessThere seems to be a view amongst some under-70s, that coronavirus doesn’t really affect them and they don’t need to worry too much about it. I’ve listened to 69-year-olds tell me that because they themselves are fit and healthy, that it couldn’t possibly happen to them. Having just done a shift as a doctor in A&E over the weekend, I want to take this opportunity to warn people that this virus does not discriminate by age.\nIt was deeply, deeply eye-opening. Previously healthy people in their thirties and forties were seriously ill, some of them on ventilators. Being young does not grant you immunity to this disease. The symptoms of Covid-19 at its worst, are horrific. There can be no room for complacency. Our health service is facing an unprecedented crisis. There is a limited amount of vital equipment, including personal protective equipment for healthcare workers and precious ventilators. Every extra person in hospital requiring treatment means there are fewer resources available for others. London Covid-19 doctor says soon staff will be forced to choose whose life to saveRosena Allin-Khan, a Labour MP and A&E doctor, reveals ‘heart-wrenching’ decisions facing hospital workers\nRosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting and an A&E doctor, is still working regular shifts. On Sunday she worked at St George’s hospital in her south London constituency. She explains how the coronavirus pandemic has affected staff: I’ve been an A&E doctor for 15 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this before. The departments are quieter because people are staying away from hospital, but the patients are sicker. We’re seeing a distinct rise in the numbers coming in with respiratory symptoms, who are testing Covid-19 positive. On Sunday, very early in the morning, the entire resuscitation department, where the absolute sickest patients go, was full to capacity with patients with breathing difficulties. We had to move other very ill patients to the paediatric resuscitation area to keep them safe. This is only set to get worse. We’re seeing patients now who would have only contracted the virus two weeks ago. In the coming 10 days we expect the entire A&E department will be taken up with suspected Covid-19 patients. Doctors and nurses are brave, and the A&E department is known for being on the frontline and high risk, but there’s a palpable fear among staff for three reasons. Firstly, they’re frightened for their own health and those of the people they love. When I finished my shift yesterday, which was Mother’s Day, I came back to the house and I couldn’t touch or hug my two little girls until I put all my clothes in the wash and had a shower. The second reason is that staff expect, very soon, potentially to have to make heart-wrenching choices about whose life can be saved if we don’t have enough ventilators. That goes counter to everything you’ve ever learned as a doctor or nurse – to make life-and-death decisions, where we could possibly have saved every one of those people, is unimaginable. This is what our colleagues in Italy are living through now. Third, the patterns described thus far for symptoms of coronavirus are not what we’re now seeing in the emergency department. We’re seeing young, previously very healthy people, who are ill in hospital. Some are in their 30s, and they need ventilators to stay alive. Some patients are presenting with abdominal pain, which we hadn’t heard of before. A person can come in and say they have a stomach pain, and they’re put in the “green” area of the department – but then they mention they also have a cough. Everybody should be assumed to be Covid-positive until proven otherwise at this point. There’s also a real concern among staff around the country about personal protective equipment. They either don’t have any, or if they do many feel it’s being rationed. It’s very hard to listen to some colleagues say that as a result of there not being enough equipment to go round, they’re resigned to catching the virus – it’s just a matter of when. On social distancing, the messaging from the government hasn’t been clear enough. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has banned public gatherings of more than two people. It’s clear and easy to understand. There has to be no ambiguity in the language because people’s lives depend on it. Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives. The MP for Tooting has been working in her local hospital where doctors and nurses are already dealing with cases of covid-19. She warns that many of those being treated are in their 30s and 40s.\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan is the MP for Tooting but she is also a practising doctor in A&E. She regularly goes in to do shifts in her local hospital St George's and has been in contact with her colleagues. This Sunday she took a record down for Mirror readers about the situation faced by nurses, doctors and others on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus. She said her latest shift had been a \"deeply, deeply eye-opening\" experience with previously fit and healthy people in their 30s and 40s \"attached to machines, fighting for their lives\". And she has been deeply critical of the approach taken by the government in tackling the spread of the deadly virus. \"The Prime Minister has been blase about this from the start, waiting for others to make decisions so he doesn't have to. It is costing lives,\" she said. Mirror Diary - Sunday 22 March6.30am – Leaving the HouseOn the way to work in A&E, to help out the real heroes of the frontline – the NHS staff who work day-in, day-out to keep us all safe. I am a bit apprehensive after seeing the stories that are being reported about Covid-19 and having spoken to colleagues across the country, but we need to come together at times like these for our communities. 7am – Reporting for DutyJust finished handover, which is when the day shift gets given notes on the patients who have come in overnight. There’s a very real sense that the number of cases are growing extremely quickly, something that will present a real challenge in the coming days and weeks. Some of the sickest patients that have been admitted have been young – they’re in their 30s and 40s, previously fit and well, but now fighting for their lives in Intensive Care (ICU). There was a lot of talk in January that this was a virus just like the flu that only affects older people – that simply isn’t the case. There’s a real sense of apprehension ahead of the shift – we’re all expecting a rocky road ahead in the coming days. 8am- Protective EquipmentThe first part of the shift was spent looking for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – these are masks and aprons that keep those working on the frontlines safe. While we’d all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. Frontline staff across the country are scared. We’re scared that we’re going to lose patients – we have spent years training to save every life that we can. We are scared of passing this deadly virus onto our loved ones because we don’t always have the PPE that we so desperately need. We’re scared that that if we aren’t properly protected, that we run the risk of spreading the virus between patients. It’s vital that people practice social distancing measures properly – crowded areas will only add to the number of cases, and the number of people being admitted into hospitals across the country. In the coming days and weeks, difficult decisions will be made by my colleagues in ICU about who gets a ventilator – it’s that serious. Midday – Resus overwhelmedThe whole of resus is full of patients with respiratory problems – this is the part of A&E where the sickest patients go. Patients are arriving breathless, with crackles so fine in their lungs, you can hardly hear them. Their X-rays show white lungs where normally, they would look clear and black, full of air. Major trauma, such as heart attacks and victims of car crashes, are now being moved into paediatric A&E. The situation around Covid-19 is clearly getting worse by the day. The talk amongst the team is that we feel that we will be overwhelmed in the coming days. I’m going for a refresher course on ventilators for staff – they’re also training new staff on how to use ventilators. The talk is, of course, feeling quite bleak as the day goes on – but this is what we’ve all been trained for. 4pm – Leaving A&EJust leaving A&E now – it’s been a difficult shift and a difficult Mother’s Day. At times like these, we must think about our loved ones - if we want to protect those dearest to us, we must stay indoors. I’ve just called my husband and asked him to let our daughters know that they won’t be able to cuddle me and give me their handmade presents when I get home. Instead, I’ll be getting straight in the shower and throwing my clothes in the washing machine – it is our duty to protect the ones we love. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can, and we will, save lives. Former Labour MEP SEB DANCE explains why he is supporting Rosena Allin-Khan in the Labour deputy leadership race.\nBritain has left the EU. As a former Labour Member of the European Parliament, as a Remainer, and as a proud pro-European, that’s still not an easy thing for me to say – but it’s the reality. There is no longer a campaign to remain. That doesn’t mean that Boris Johnson’s famous lie of “get Brexit done” has suddenly come true. The ongoing negotiations with the EU will continue to define our country’s future for years to come. Perhaps one day the fight to join the EU will come. How soon that time comes depends on what we do next. Pro-Europeans must now fight for a close relationship between the UK and our friends in the EU and ongoing rights for UK citizens. The Labour Party must play a crucial role in that fight. That’s why I’m supporting Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan to become the next deputy leader of Labour. Rosena was elected as the MP for Tooting the week before the EU referendum in 2016. Despite holding a shadow frontbench position, she refused to compromise on her principles or on the promises she’d made to her community, so she broke the whip and voted against triggering Article 50. Considering the shambles that followed Theresa May’s early triggering of Article 50, this has been conclusively demonstrated as the right decision. Rosena was also the first shadow frontbench minister to come out publicly and call for a People’s Vote. This was an incredibly brave thing to do, at a time when Labour MPs and shadow ministers were being pressured not to speak out against the leadership’s position on Brexit. At a time when the leadership of Labour needed a firm push in the right direction, Rosena was the one brave enough to stand up and do it. There are some voices in the Labour Party, who’ll try to convince you that Brexit was the only reason for Labour’s failure at the last general election – that backing a public vote cost us seats in the so-called ‘Red Wall’. But this analysis is deeply misleading, and is simply not supported by the facts. Yes, of course Brexit was a divisive issue, for Labour as much as for anyone else. The reality however, is that the overwhelming majority of Labour voters, members and supporters voted Remain, wanted us to stay in the EU and wanted a public vote on Brexit. That fact is as true of Labour voters in Redcar, Grimsby or Wakefield as it is of Labour voters in Oxford, Islington or Bristol – Labour’s share of the vote went down in 98% of all seats. Labour’s position on Brexit was fatally undermined not because supporting a public vote was the wrong position for our voters, but because the leadership of the party took so long to get to that position. We sat in the middle of the road on the biggest issue of our time and neither side trusted us. We lost trust among all our communities. Rosena knows this – she won’t stop standing up for our internationalist values. I joined the Labour Party because I believe in internationalism and solidarity across borders. So does Rosena. That’s why she’s worked across the world in conflict and disaster zones as a humanitarian doctor, and why she still does shifts in her local hospital as an A&E doctor alongside her work as an MP. So if you are like me – a proud pro-European, an internationalist and a Labour supporter – and if you want someone as deputy leader who’ll stand up for those values, and who’ll fight for our country to maintain the closest possible relationship with the EU, protecting our workers’ rights, our environmental protections, our food standards, our NHS, and most importantly the rights of EU citizens living in the UK – then vote for Doctor Rosena. Together, let’s take Labour forward. Rosena Allin-Khan MP: \"I want to inspire Asians to own their identity”A CANDIDATE in the race for Labour’s deputy leadership has admitted the party “lost trust with voters” following its crushing defeat in the December general election.\nTooting MP Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is up against fellow MPs Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler, Ian Murray and Angela Rayner in the race, triggered by Labour’s huge loss last year. Suffering one of its worst results since 1935, Labour lost dozens of seats which they had held for decades, including a number of constituencies in the Midlands and northern England, which historically tended to support the party. The loss was down to a lack of trust, Allin- Khan believes. “People, quite frankly, didn’t trust us to govern,” the MP told Eastern Eye. “We had a manifesto which I believe was full of good things, but voters didn’t trust us to deliver it.” The party’s stance on Brexit was an additional factor – “we didn’t seem decisive enough” – and the level of anti-Semitism in the party and the way it was subsequently handled “closed a lot of doors”. “I’ve been up and down the country talking to individuals, wondering why Labour lost, and I’ve been told by activists that people didn’t think we had our own house in order,” she said. Today, she said, the most common concern of voters is the NHS, the level of safety on the streets and housing. “We need to show that the hopes and dreams that people have for themselves are the ones that we (Labour) have for them,” the mother-of-two said. Next month’s contest will also see the unveiling of a new Labour leader, after Jeremy Corbyn announced he would be stepping down following the general election last year. Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey are in the running to lead the opposition party. Allin-Khan, however, will not be voicing her support for any of the candidates as she believes the party needs to “heal all divisions (and) unite” after it fared so badly in the election. “When I’m working in A&E and I see kids coming in with lung infections because of mouldy housing or I see kids who have to go to food banks (…) they don’t care if Labour is left, right or centre,” she explained. “So, the most important thing to move forward is to unite and I can show that by not nominating someone for leader.” On her role in the deputy leadership race, Allin-Khan said she was determined to use it as an opportunity to help “ethnic minorities own their identity and be proud of it”. “That is what I want people to feel I embody when they look at me,” she explained. “For me, being in this race, if that is the one thing I get out of this…that other young British Asians can look at me and say, ‘if she can do it, I can do it too’, then that is my job done.” Allin-Khan admitted she had faced prejudice due to her mixed Pakistani-Polish heritage and has received criticism that she “isn’t fully Asian”. In response to the comments, the MP is keen to highlight her mixed heritage does not make her Asian background any less “important, valuable or special.” “I identify with being an Asian woman, in the same way that I am proud to be Polish,” she said. “Some people in the Asian community wonder how Asian I feel because I’m mixed race, but I’m proud to wear my sari and embrace my heritage.” Some have even suggested that she change her forename to Rosie and take her husband’s surname to downplay her ethnicity. However, Allin-Khan is proud of her roots and is keen to emphasise it. “I went double barrelled because I didn’t want to lose the Asian part of my surname and that for me, is very important,” she said. “I am proud to say that this is who I am – a Polish and Pakistani, proudly British Muslim woman who loves the Labour party.” Born and brought up in Tooting in a working-class household, Allin-Khan described her young life as “tough”. Her mother worked three jobs to keep the family financially afloat, and Allin-Khan recalled there only being one heater in the house that they had to move from room to room to keep themselves warm. Allin-Khan failed her A-Levels, citing the difficulties at home as a factor. Despite the setbacks, she still had a desire to study medicine. However, she was told “it wasn’t for girls like (her)”, as it was financially prohibitive, and she didn’t come from the “right background”. Allin-Khan, who still works part-time as a doctor, knew she had to keep fighting if she wanted to pursue her dream career. “I think my upbringing led me to believe I had no choice but to sink or swim,” she said. After resitting her A-Levels, the then-24-year-old accepted a place to study medicine at Lucy Cavendish College, University of Cambridge, which was funded by scholarships. “I really believe that where you start off in life doesn’t need to dictate where you end up,” the A&E doctor said. Although she credited her own resilience for her success, Allin-Khan believes the Labour government gave her an opportunity to fulfil her potential when things looked bleak. “The Labour government turned my life around,” the 43-year-old claimed. “I redid my A-Levels, did a degree and went to Cambridge to study medicine and I’m afraid those possibilities aren’t going to be there for a new generation of kids under this Tory government.” Allin-Khan, the MP for Tooting since 2016, admitted the biggest challenge of her involvement in politics is racism. She often faces abuse on social media and is mostly targeted for her Muslim beliefs. “When I look at the order in which my abuse comes, it is Muslim first, then my Asian heritage comes second,” she admitted. “My gender is third. Without a doubt, the amount of abuse is a huge challenge.” It is a concern that young BAME women may be deterred from entering politics due to the abuse other politicians have faced, she said. In response, Allin-Khan regularly engages with schools and community groups to encourage young people to “keep going and not to lose faith”. There is also a level of racism in the House of Commons, she said, highlighting that she is the first Muslim person ever to make it on to the deputy leadership ballot. Although it is encouraging to see more women and ethnic minority politicians in parliament, Allin-Khan believes there is “still a ceiling on what we can achieve”. Recently, Allin-Khan approached a “prominent BAME politician” to ask them to consider nominating her in the deputy leadership contest. However, the politician responded: “I’m only in the game of backing winners and you don’t look like you’ve got any chance of winning.” “We can’t have that attitude towards people, and I’ve said in my grassroots revival plan that our BAME communities can’t be an afterthought when it comes to supporting people to hold public office,” she said. “We need to be seeing ethnic minorities at the top of our party, on the front benches. “I’ve smashed that ceiling, but I plan to throw the ladder down and say people ‘come up behind, you can do this.’ But I know it isn’t easy.” My pledge to rebuild confidence in LabourI never imagined that one day I’d become an MP, or now a candidate to become the next Deputy Leader of the Labour Party. Growing up, I was regularly told that ‘girls like me’ from ‘backgrounds like mine’ wouldn’t amount to anything. I never planned to go into politics - I always wanted to be a doctor. The last Labour Government gave me that chance, allowing me to study Medicine aged 24 after failing my A-Levels the first time around because of pressures at home. This shaped the person that I am today and has given me the fire in my belly to ensure that no other child feels that there is a ceiling on what they can achieve.\nWhen I work shifts as an A&E doctor at my local hospital, I see first-hand the issues facing our communities today. I treat young people who come to A&E after self-harming, I treat those who haven’t been able to access mental health services for years, and yes, I treat victims of violent crime. To see a young person breathe their last breath is a pain that never leaves you. Teenage boys, once full of bravado on the street, with the words “Born to die” tattooed on their chests, victims of horrific stab wounds, laying there crying out for their mothers. The sound of a parent grieving for their child is universal - it can’t be forgotten. As the MP for Tooting, I have worked incredibly closely with community groups and young people to try and tackle the rise of violent crime in our society. I’ve organised summits with representatives from local community organisations, charities, the police, the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Council and the Deputy Mayor for Policing, to start tackling this problem from a community perspective. Working with affected communities is paramount in order to resolve these critical issues once and for all. As a keen boxer myself, I have promoted the work of local boxing clubs to tackle violent crime. Boxing is far more than just a sport - for many, it’s family. Clubs offer an opportunity for local young ¬people to make friends, engage with sport and receive mentorship. So much of gang culture and violence is about a sense of belonging. We have a duty to show young people that, if you can gain respect in the ring, you do not have to get respect from violence on the street. One of the reasons I decided to run to become the next Deputy Leader of the Labour Party is because it would give me the platform to give a voice to the voiceless. Whether it’s children losing their lives to senseless violence, older people being unable to access safe and decent social care, or refugees fleeing violence and persecution, their voices must be amplified. A platform alone isn’t enough though - Labour needs to be in power to affect real change for the most vulnerable in our communities. As Deputy Leader, I will rebuild our movement into one people can vote for. A party people can trust. The door may have closed on 12 December for a generation’s hopes and ambitions, but with the right leadership team in place in the Labour Party, it will not be closed for good. We need to win the next General Election, and we must listen to our voters ahead of the Mayoral election in May. As Deputy Leader, it will be my responsibility to rebuild trust, not just with the grassroots of our party, but with voters. Together, we can take Labour forward. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is MP for Tooting and candidate for Deputy Leader of Labour NHS workers battling coronavirus are facing a “national shortage” of protective clothing, HuffPost UK has been told.Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan, a working doctor who still works shifts in A&E, said scientists had told her that there were not enough body suits in the right sizes, while some doctors were only now starting to receive protective clothing.\nIt came amid new official estimates suggesting 5,000 to 10,000 people in the UK have coronavirus, leaving many doctors, nurses and other health workers at risk of infection. Last month, the World Health Organisation also warned that there was a global shortage of protective masks and body suits. One NHS source who worked at a hospital where coronavirus patients were being treated told HuffPost UK: “There were staff forced to wear oversized suits because that’s all they had. “All we have left is XL. “There is a national shortage of suits but this was raised with the government at least three weeks ago so something should have been done.” Appearing on HuffPost UK’s Commons People podcast, Allin-Khan repeated the concerns. “I held a meeting today with some people from the scientific community and they said their concern was though they had been testing out various modes of protective clothing, it turns out that there is a lack of the clothing they need available, the sizes aren’t available,” she said. “Just yesterday - because people still contact me because I’m a doctor still, to let me know what’s going on - someone said they were a GP and had only started receiving the necessary protective clothing yesterday and this has been going on for a month now. The Labour deputy leadership candidate criticised the government for moving too slowly to tackle from coronavirus. In a departure from Labour’s broad support for the government, Allin-Khan called for tougher measures to tackle the outbreak, including testing those with symptoms for the virus as a matter of course. Allin-Khan said the government’s testing programme could be “more robust”, reporting that “friends in the NHS” said people were being given “really unclear messaging”. She gave an example of two people who returned from northern Italy who phoned NHS 111 and were told to wait for a call back which did not come for five days, during which time they self isolated. When they eventually spoke again to NHS staff, they had to give their details again and had to self-isolate for eight days before finally being tested for coronavirus. Test results are also taking three to five days to materialise. Allin-Khan said: “We need to be moving quicker, people need to have a better idea of how to access testing, what it means for their daily lives. “The messaging needs to be clearer and the testing needs to be more robust.” She added: “We should have moved into the delay phase sooner than now and I don’t think we should measure our performance compared to what other countries are doing. “I think we should be looking at what’s best for us and when you look at the fact that China had the same number of cases that we already have surpassed before implementing measures we do need to be listening to what the other scientific community, for example some eminent epidemiologists, listen to what they’re saying. “Because ultimately we can’t leave the scientific community to be scapegoated for the government making bad decisions if they are proven to be wrong.” Allin-Khan meanwhile sidestepped questions on whether she wants to be shadow health secretary under the next Labour leader. “I like to focus on one thing at a time, genuinely, and I don’t think you should ever have a plan B because that’s implying you’ve accepted that your plan A won’t work out,” she said. “So I am genuinely, steely focused on winning this deputy leadership bid.” Put to her that she would be a good fit for the job, she replied: “Well I am a practising NHS doctor and I have got a master’s degree in public health and I care about our party so that’s honestly for whoever is the leader to decide.” |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

As part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood schemes, many streets have had filters put in to close the road to all vehicles except cycles and some now have turning restrictions. As part of the Streetspace scheme, a number of changes have been made to Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road including the installation of wands to segregate cycle lanes, a number of turning restrictions as well as changes to bus stops.\nThese changes have come about as a result of statutory guidance that the Government issued in May, stating that local authorities were expected to make significant changes to their road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians “as swiftly as possible”. (If you would like to read more about this statutory guidance you can read it in full here.) As a result, TfL made £55m of funding available to the 33 councils in London as part of its “Streetspace for London” programme to urgently create new segregated cycle lanes, extend pavements and close roads to traffic. Wandsworth Council was given £1,923,500 by TfL and used this money to implement the LTNs. TfL has, in consultation with Wandsworth Council but acting separately, implemented changes to the A24. I am supportive of initiatives which reduce car usage, make our streets safer, encourage cycling and create a better local environment. But we must make it work for everyone in Tooting and Balham. I know that lots of local residents have concerns and comments about how the changes have affected our community. The only way to have your voice heard is to feed into the consultations that Wandsworth Council is running and to let TfL know what you think by emailing them. To respond to Wandsworth Council's consultation, click here. To provide feedback to TfL please email: [email protected] It is important to note that I was not consulted prior to the implementation of these changes to our roads and I have no control over the decisions that have been made. As the local MP, I can lobby the Government and the relevant Ministers, but I cannot make decisions for the Conservative Council. I am listening and engaging with local residents on this but I cannot make alterations to these changes. If you have already provided your feedback to Wandsworth Council's consultation and/or emailed TfL, and you want to raise your concerns with other officials, you may also wish to contact Wandsworth Council's Transport spokesperson Councillor John Locker via email at [email protected], or the Government's Minister of State with responsibility for cycling and walking Chris Heaton-Harris MP via email at [email protected] |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Private renters make up a significant proportion of local residents and a key part of our campaign in the local elections last year was to ensure that they get a fair deal.\nThis scheme will strengthen protections and rights for private tenants and I look forward to its successful trial in Tooting before a wider roll-out across the borough.\nIt was wonderful to host a coffee morning for local residents today at Tooting United Reform Church. It was brilliant to welcome residents from Tooting and Furzedown. I am really grateful to everyone who attended, including some local organisations and charities who do invaluable work in the community.\nMany people in Gaza were already living in appalling conditions before this latest conflict. If the Israeli bombardment continues and aid doesn't get through, I really fear for the consequences. Today, I appeared on Peston to reiterate calls for an immediate ceasefire in Israel and Gaza. Every effort needs to be made to work towards a peaceful solution. See my clip here:\nToday in Parliament, I challenged the Foreign Secretary to call on his Israeli counterpart to demand an immediate ceasefire to the escalating crisis in Gaza. While rightly calling out Hamas’ horrific attacks, we also have a duty to speak on behalf of those innocent Palestinians who are being collectively punished, starved and bombed in their own homes by Israeli forces. See my question here:\nTonight, I held a peace vigil at Tooting Broadway station to bring our community together to remember all those who have died in Israel and Gaza recently. I want to pay a huge thanks to the representatives from our local religious groups who said a prayer for peace.\nDuring some of our darkest hours, Tooting reminds us that there is always hope. Today marks International Stammer Awareness Day. I know from my own experience, the impact the stigma of stammering has on those affected. We must not create a narrative of trying to fix people with speech disfluency. Instead we need to work to create a more inclusive society.\nToday, I was on BBC Politics Live ahead of Prime Minister Questions, to discuss the conflict in Israel and Gaza, free speech and the drinking culture in Westminster.\nThe Government is dragging its feet on reforming mental health services – it's costing people their lives.\nI asked the Minister if she will keep her promise to reform the Mental Health Act - there was no answer. This is a Government out of ideas. We need a General Election now.\nTonight, I invited Wandsworth Police to join our community to discuss how they’re working with Wandsworth Council to tackle violence against women and girls.\nMaking our community safe is a key priority for me. My door is always open. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch.\nPalestinians must not pay the collective price for the acts of terror carried out by Hamas. World leaders have a duty to ensure Israel doesn’t deliberately indiscriminately target civilians.\nIn Parliament today, I sought assurances from the Prime Minister regarding Gaza: - Incendiary weapons won't be used in civilian areas. - Hospitals/medics won't be targeted. - Food, water and electricity immediately restored. - No occupation of Gaza.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Trains in the morning evening peaks, to and from Central London, have all seen a worsening of their \"on-time percentage\" in the last six months compared to the same period of 2023. The full breakdown of delays at each station is below. It is shocking to see that, not only are trains late at some stations late half the time, but that there has been a steady decline from an already-unacceptable level of lateness last year. Particularly concerning are the figures at Tooting station, where over half of services were late despite there being only two services per hour on that line.\nSome of the worst performing services include: 8:05 from Balham (8:07 from Wandsworth Common) to Victoria - 88% late (Southern) 18:12 from Waterloo to Earlsfield - 81% late (South Western) 8:21 from Balham to Victoria - 79% late (Southern) 8:40 from Balham (8:42 from Wandsworth Common) to Victoria - 76% late (Southern) 8:13 from Tooting to London Blackfriars - 70% late (Thameslink) Local commuters deserve better than the shoddy service they are currently receiving from Southern, South Western and Thameslink. I look forward to the Government's plans to bring our local rail services back into public control, so that our trains are always run with the interests of the people who use them at heart.\nWe did it! I want to give a massive thank you to everyone who went out and voted yesterday.\nI am so proud to have been re-elected with an increased 19,487 majority. Wishing everyone a very Happy Pride today!\nWhile we celebrate the progress over the years, we must remember that there is still much work to be done to end hatred and discrimination against the LGBT+ community, at home and across the world.\nIf you're a postal voter, your ballot should arrive any day now, if it hasn’t already.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_housing/content_261.html": "|\nIt's finally Friday and what better way to prepare for the weekend than by reading my latest column in the South London Press.\nRead my article on the steps Labour are taking, both nationally and locally, to tackle the housing crisis here.\nI am very pleased to see that Labour-run Wandsworth Council will be introducing a landlord licensing pilot scheme in Tooting and Furzedown. Private renters make up a significant proportion of local residents and a key part of our campaign in the local elections last year was to ensure that they get a fair deal.\nThis scheme will strengthen protections and rights for private tenants and I look forward to its successful trial in Tooting before a wider roll-out across the borough.\nThe current housing market is incredibly difficult to get into as a first-time buyer. In our local area especially, house and rent prices are daunting, and sadly the Tories are not doing enough to provide support for people or help increase the housing supply.\nLabour have set out an ambitious plan for housebuilding targets to help supply the need for housing and provide security to people and their families. This would include relaxing planning restrictions to let local authorities and examining green Belt areas that could be used to build on. I fully support Labour’s ambition to have 70% of people owning their own home. I've written to the Chief Executive of Bellway on behalf of residents at Fitzgerald and Fleming Houses on St George's Grove, many of whom have been left in limbo, unable to sell or re-mortgage their properties due to the flammable cladding that was installed by Bellway, when the houses were built. In May, London Fire Brigade instituted a waking watch on both of the buildings due to fire risk, which residents were forced to pay for themselves. I have been working alongside Bellway resident directors in good faith for months but have been met with delay and excuses while their properties remain without a suitable facade. My position is clear: Developers must fund remediations works on these properties and the replacement of the cladding to the new required standard. Leaseholders cannot be held liable for these costs. To add your name to the letter, sign below. In light of the upcoming Fire Safety Bill, I would to thank every resident who has written to me with their concerns on this and for continuing to keep me updated on the cladding issues affecting their property. I recognise what an exceptionally difficult time this is and appreciate how much anxiety the cladding proposals are causing to many leaseholders.\nOn more than fifteen occasions, Ministers promised that leaseholders would not be landed with the costs of remedial works. Yet, people are still being put at risk, trapped in flammable buildings for a third lockdown, with leaseholders placed in an impossible position and promises broken. It is evident that the Government’s handling of the cladding crisis has lacked any sense of grip or urgency. For this reason, the Labour Party have tabled an Opposition Day Debate on cladding for Monday, which will subsequently bring forward a vote that will call for leaseholders to be protected from the costs of remediating their blocks with dangerous cladding. The party will also be tabling a number of amendments to the Fire Safety Bill that will aim to protect leaseholders from unfair costs through the power of the law. I am aware that many residents have been in touch to request that I support the McPartland and Smith amendment, which provides welcome clarity on the specific costs that would be prevented from being passed on to leaseholders. Labour has sought to go further on this. As currently drafted, the McPartland and Smith amendment would not have covered blocks like Grenfell - where flammable cladding has been added at some stage following the building of the block. It only applies to defects in the original design of buildings. The Labour Party’s amendment would ensure that the cost of fire safety problems from refurbishment jobs, like the cladding on Grenfell Tower, cannot be passed on to leaseholders. Labour’s amendments also include new clauses so that the Bill protects leaseholders from the day it comes into law, instead of an unknown date in the future. I would like to thank my colleagues in the Labour Party, Sarah Jones MP, Nick Thomas-Symonds MP, Thangam Debbonaire MP and Mike Amesbury MP for their hard work and commitment to addressing this large injustice on a national scale. If any residents have any further queries on this issue, please do not hesitate to get in touch to discuss this further. In the meantime, I hope this post assures you of the steps myself and the Labour Party are taking to protect tenants and leaseholders during this cladding crisis. I have written to the Housing Secretary to outline residents concerns about EWS1 forms and cladding. The creation of EWS1 forms and concerns about cladding are issues I know a lot of Tooting residents are facing. Everyone deserves the safety and security of home and I am shocked that so many local residents have found themselves in this situation. Following discussions with local people, I have written to the Financial Conduct Authority, Aviva, the National Housing and Building Council and the Shadow Secretary of State for Housing.

With so many households already feeling the squeeze, it’s crucial that we work together to tackle poverty. Representatives from Earlsfield and Wandsworth foodbanks as well as Dons Local Action Group and Little Village Tooting told me that they are seeing unprecedented demand at present, as more and more of those who were just-about-managing become unable to afford the basics. All the organisations represented spoke of the added difficulties the rise in energy prices have brought. The hike in energy prices has meant that even the local charities who are there to address the crisis are struggling to pay their bills, and this means they are less able to help those in need. This comes at the worst possible time, when demand is at it’s highest level for decades. Everyone at the event had numerous stories of people facing hardship, people in overcrowded accommodation, people not being able to put food on the table or buy school uniforms for their children. Many people are also concerned about how they will meet the additional cost of christmas. Despite heartbreaking stories, it was uplifting to see so many people who donate their time, energy and money into making things better for people in our community. I am always amazed by the generosity of people in Tooting. However, in Britain in 2022 these organisations and charitable schemes shouldn’t have to exist. It is imperative that the Government take action immediately to support people through the months ahead. It was great to attend and speak at the annual Balham and Tooting Community Association’s multi-faith peace ceremony in Tooting Broadway.\nLocal people of all faiths and none gathered to celebrate all that unites us. We heard prayers and moving speeches from leaders of six different faiths and school students. I love representing a community where so many faiths are represented. People of all faiths and none live and work alongside each other in our community and I was honoured to be part of such a joyous occasion that celebrates our diversity and our commitment to common values of tolerance and understanding. Leaders from Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh communities spoke and prayed in their own traditions. Senior school pupils from Al Risalah Girls Secondary School spoke of what their faith means to them and their hopes for peace. This event has taken place in Tooting for many years now and it’s always an inspiring and uplifting event that I look forward to attending. It’s always fantastic to see our community come together. Thank you to all who attending and to those who worked so hard to make this event a success. I've written to the Chief Executive of Bellway on behalf of residents at Fitzgerald and Fleming Houses on St George's Grove, many of whom have been left in limbo, unable to sell or re-mortgage their properties due to the flammable cladding that was installed by Bellway, when the houses were built.

My position is clear: Developers must fund remediations works on these properties and the replacement of the cladding to the new required standard. Leaseholders cannot be held liable for these costs. To add your name to the letter, sign below. An undercover joint investigation by Sky News and The Independent has raised serious concerns about the safety of patients at inpatient settings ran by the Huntercombe Group.\nThis is the third investigation into abuse in secure inpatient mental health settings, in four weeks. The system is broken. I previously wrote to Therese Coffey, the previous Health Secretary, to raise my concerns about other similar investigations highlighting allegations of abuse, by Channel 4 Dispatches and BBC Panorama, but did not receive a response. The Government has been silent over these allegations and for weeks there wasn’t even a functioning Mental Health Minister. Patients, and their families, deserve answers. They deserve dignity, respect and access to high quality treatment, which is why I have called for a rapid review into mental health services and the way patients are treated in inpatient settings.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_all_38/content_745.html": "|\nNothing prepares you for seeing a colleague in tears over antisemitism.\nLabour deputy leadership hopeful, Rosena Allin-Khan, speaks about her heritage informing her fight against Jew-hate, and her commitment to mending ties with the community. “There is nothing that prepares you for seeing a colleague in tears,” says Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, one of five hopefuls standing for Labour’s deputy-leadership. Committed to winning back the trust of the community – and standing up for MPs such as Luciana Berger and Ruth Smeeth who are no longer in Westminster – Allin-Khan, currently the MP for Tooting, seems sincere in her battle against hate. She grew up as the daughter of immigrants – her father hailing from Pakistan, her mother from Poland, herself the descendent of resistance fighters killed by the Nazis. But she’s aware that hate and prejudice won’t be solved over a chat with tea and biscuits. Before her career in politics, she was a humanitarian doctor, working on the ground with Palestinians, while her mother’s family from Poland were killed by the Nazis. It’s these experiences which allow her to reconcile speaking out against Israeli policies, while committing herself to the fight against antisemitism, drawing praise from the community in carefully balancing these issues. The first of her pledges is to meet with the Jewish Labour Movement, should she get elected. It would be “essential to the restructuring” of relations, and “how we rebuild trust.” She is also keen on an education program, saying “people use antisemitic tropes and they don’t even realise what they’re doing and they repeatedly do so.” While indicating she would speak with “any group that was looking to acknowledge there was a problem, and work towards coming up with a solution to fix it” she adds that she is the “only deputy leader candidate who hasn’t nominated a leader”. She’s willing to “work with whomever the leader is” on rebuilding trust. Calling the demise in relations between the community and the party “sad” and “terrible”, she opens up about “people I know that I am very close to, who have been really brave and speaking out antisemitism in the party.” “They have received torrents of abuse and nothing’s been done about it”. “Any leader seeing something like this unfolding needs to be all over it”, she says. But was Corbyn’s team responsible? She says they were not the “cause of the antisemitic problem in Labour, I think they didn’t deal with the problem, well enough”. Yet, she’s under no illusions as to the extent of the problem, saying it must be tackled “from a grassroots membership level first and take it all the way to MPs themselves”. “The complaints process wasn’t dealt with properly”, Allin-Khan says, adding: “As people began to show antisemitic abuse .. the more they saw it wasn’t being dealt with the more they felt able to do so.” On mending ties, she wants an “independent” process for tackling complaints with “outstanding cases to be dealt with within a particular time”, and “automatic expulsion” for antisemitism, though she wouldn’t be drawn on whether she would intervene, like Tom Watson, who she is trying to succeed. Her drive to fight antisemitism is in part inspired by her heritage. “My mum’s Polish and I lost lots of family during the war. They were not Jewish, but they fought alongside Jewish friends and my great uncle died during that time, my grandma was pregnant in the Warsaw ghetto with my uncle.” “That whole experience is a very real part of my history, and it is a shared history that I understand deeply and I’m very saddened about with the Jewish community. She was embroiled in a dispute with the Israeli Deputy Ambassador in 2016, following a radio discussion about Palestinians’ access to medical aid. After revealing the two had met in person to discuss the issue, she was accused of being “bought by Zionists”, facing significant online abuse. Her response drew praise, with Dave Rich from the Community Security Trust saying it “illustrated the difference between pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist”. She says: “I am a doctor, and have been a humanitarian doctor for my whole professional life.” “It is possible, and fair, to identify areas where there could be improvement to somebody’s life and health and not to conflate that with a whole antisemitic issue. “ I will always be proud to stand up for people’s basic human rights, and I’m also very aware of my history and my shared history with the Jewish community. I feel it’s perfectly possible to manage the two.” Many former Labour voters feel unrepresented. That has to change\nThe Labour party has shaped who I am today. It has helped provide me with the opportunity to train as a doctor and has given me and my family life chances we otherwise would not have had. I want everyone to experience these opportunities. It deeply saddens me to see a lost generation for whom the door closed on their dreams and ambitions on 12 December. Growing up poor and cold while my single mum worked three jobs to support me and my brother taught me the reality of day-to-day life for many people in the UK. My mother always told me, even through our darkest moments, that there were people worse off than us – and I have never forgotten that. The Labour party changed my life. Despite failing my A-levels due to difficult circumstances at home, I was finally able to go to Cambridge University at the age of 24 to study medicine because of reforms the Labour party made in government. People did not know what we stood for – the Tories had three simple words Working on the A&E frontline has shown me the best and worst of society. A&E is a microcosm of real life. I hold parents as they say goodbye to their children who have died through senseless violence. I talk to nurses who tell me they can’t afford to feed their children and are having to use foodbanks. I treat older people who just want the dignity of accessing social care in their homes. But I also see hope. The UK is full of people pushing through barriers to serve their communities. Our NHS provided me with the skills to give back to society – it spurred me on to work as a humanitarian aid doctor in disaster zones across the world, something that I have been proud to continue during my time as an MP. I am proud of the internationalist views of the Labour party – we must never turn our backs on the world’s most vulnerable. On the border of Myanmar, it was shocking to listen to the stories of Rohingya refugees speaking of having to make the impossible decision of whether to save their child who was thrown alive on to a burning fire, or escape with their surviving child. We must not turn our backs on those who are living through the absolute worst of human atrocities. In Palestine, I was heartbroken to meet children who were undergoing cancer treatment utterly alone because their parents were unable to obtain permits to accompany them. Humanity should have no borders. Only with a Labour government can the UK have a truly outward, internationalist approach, ensuring that we are there for people in their times of greatest need. In order to be in government, we must get our house in order, and as deputy leader this would be my priority. We cannot look to champion equality abroad, while turning a blind eye to racism in our party. This needs to end. As deputy leader, my first major meeting would be with the Jewish Labour Movement – they are our official Jewish affiliate; we must listen. I want JLM to be at the forefront of this fight against antisemitism, especially when it comes to education at the grassroots level. I will separate the complaints process from HQ, making it independent and asking the new team to immediately review all cases, acting swiftly and expelling antisemites. There must also be a strict time limit by which cases need to be resolved. I commit to adopt every recommendation proposed by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, without hesitation. Enough is enough. Only then will we be able to start rebuilding trust. Communities across the country have turned away from Labour, thinking that we do not represent them. We must listen with humility to people across our country and across our movement to assess why we’ve lost the last four elections, and how we can win people back. From speaking to people in seats that we lost in December, I have been told that trust in us has gone. People did not know what we stood for – there appeared to be new policies announced every day and voters did not trust that we had a plan for how to deliver them. The Tories had three simple words. To win, we need to be able to communicate our messages, not just internally, but with the public. I will focus on grassroots campaigners being armed with the information and messaging that they need to talk to voters on the doorstep. I will equip candidates and their local Labour parties with the resources that they so desperately need. I will introduce reduced membership rates to our emergency service workers so they can have a say within Labour on the NHS at this vital time. We need to build our movement into one people can vote for. A party people can trust. Under this government, which has chosen to block child refugees from reunification with their families, I worry for the future of our children. I worry for the future of tolerance. I worry for the future of compassion. We have a wonderful society, which has welcomed so many people from across the world, but the hostile environment this government is imposing on our country is restricting the ability to hope. Hope for a brighter future. Hope for a tolerant society. The door may have closed on 12 December for a generation’s hopes and ambitions, but with the right leadership team in place in the Labour party, it will not be closed for good. We need to win the next general election, and we must start rebuilding trust ahead of local elections in May. As deputy leader, it will be my responsibility to rebuild trust, not just with the grassroots of our party, but with voters. Together, we can take Labour forward. As a doctor, I know that before a patient can be diagnosed, it is vital to first take a detailed history and examine them thoroughly. That’s the challenge we now face in revitalising the Labour Party and taking it off life-support. This is also why, when I decided to run for Deputy Leader, the first thing I did was contact every single Labour councillor I could find an email address for, as well as every single prospective parliamentary candidate who stood for Labour in the last General Election and lost.\nI’m not a leader-in-waiting, I’ll be a campaigner-in-chief, and you can be too. I’ve been travelling across the country, to seats where we won, seats where we lost, and even seats we’ve never held, to talk to activists and members on the ground - because I want to hear from the grassroots directly to truly understand what went wrong, what went right, and what we must do better. Using that detailed feedback, I am now publishing a manifesto called Grassroots Revival – a campaigning action plan that I will immediately start implementing if I’m elected as the next Labour Deputy Leader. **Download Grassroots revival**It starts with changes we must make to our internal organisation. We must overhaul the complaints process. I’ll remove the team from HQ and make it independent, put a time limit on reviewing complaints, and ensure those involved with each case are kept informed of its progress. I also want to start unlocking Labour’s membership talent. It’s not all about delivering leaflets and knocking on doors - we have social media experts, journalists, policy gurus, videographers and many other talents in our ranks. Let’s start making the most of that! For new members, attending meetings can feel daunting - we need to make them more enjoyable and accessible for all. We can ensure party democracy and due process are followed, while making meetings a more enjoyable experience. For example, some CLPs still spend up to an hour arguing about the minutes of the last meeting - which turns off new members. We need to streamline the procedural matters and get more political debate into our local meetings. We can be sociable too! I want to help local groups organise regional social events that break even, instead of looking to make a profit. Quiz nights, continuing the great work of Stand Up For Labour, pub nights, coffee mornings - let’s bring our movement together and celebrate all that we have to offer. Let’s look at how to grow and diversify our movement even further. I’ll offer reduced membership rates to emergency service workers, to encourage them to join the Party and have their say over how we fight to save our NHS. I would support BAME members to hold elected office - I will produce literature to be made available to BAME officers to distribute to new members, “how to be a councillor” meetings will be offered in each borough - not as an afterthought - and I will work with BAME officers to listen to what resources they need. We must start upgrading our technology and infrastructure - we’re running campaigns in 2020 with two colour printers from the 80s and 90s. I’d ensure every CLP has access to a full colour RISO printer (or similar). We can also boost data driven testing of our methods. Comparisons of leaflets, direct mails, e-newsletters, social media and canvassing will allow us to be so much more targeted and effective. A significant amount of dedicated time went into creating software and apps to revolutionise our digital campaigning in recent years but the party didn’t have the resources to fully roll them out - the doorknocking app, dialogue and chatter could have really helped us but members didn’t know how to use them or didn’t know they existed. Contact Creator regularly broke down during the General Election and the user interface hasn’t changed for over a decade. This must all change. Let’s also have a digital team at HQ who goes to every target seat, showing them how to make the most of Facebook ads, emails, Twitter, creating graphics and videos. Let’s also start looking at how to produce more personalised and localised content. The party produces some great literature and supplies it to key seats, but the vast majority of it is national with no localisation. Some leaflets and letters just didn’t arrive in 2019 for some seats, which left them in the dark, and adequate support was not available to deal with it, because staff were already overstretched. We must be better prepared. The manifesto came out weeks after the print deadlines for seats to order their leaflets and letters. I will ensure the necessary information is available to candidates in good time. The Labour Party must do better at supporting our candidates – I’ll make sure they all get adequate briefings and lines for use in their own leaflets, letters, emails and press releases. Candidates and their teams are superheroes, but they aren’t invincible, and campaigns can take their toll both financially, physically and mentally - This is why I’ll set up a dedicated team to offer mental health support and advice during difficult times. Too often, local organisers and staff have contracts that end at 10pm on polling day - this culture needs to change. Organisers put in endless hours to help our campaigns succeed and to dump them when polls close is just simply wrong. I’ll ensure no staff contracts end on Election Day, giving them vital time to find new employment. I also want to establish a system of sharing best practice amongst CLPs and boroughs. Campaigns shouldn’t have borders - we don’t have to operate solely within our constituency or ward boundaries. We need proper twinning with key seats. There’s no sugar-coating it – the Labour Party is in a critical condition right now. But with the right treatment, the right approach and the right support from the leadership team, we can get it back to fighting fitness. With the local elections coming up in May, there’s no time to waste. Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan MP for Tooting There is absolutely no place for antisemitism within the Labour Party, and I will put all my energy into rebuilding trust with the Jewish community.\nMy first major meeting will be with Jewish Labour Movement - they are Labour's official Jewish affiliate and we must trust them. I’ll separate the complaints process from head office, making it truly independent - to begin the process of rebuilding the trust. Once that new team is in place, I'll immediately get them to review all cases, acting swiftly and expelling antisemites. For future, I'll put a time limit on when cases need to be resolved by (for now and in future). The investigation from the Equality and Human Rights Commission is not an optional piece of diversity training, it's an embarrassment that this issue has gone so far without real action. The report they produce and the actions they want Labour to take are not optional - they are legally binding. I promise to fully adopt, without hesitation - every single one of their proposed steps. We are an open party, who welcome everyone from every background, no longer can we kick these issues into the long grass and offer the bare minimum in support and process. As Deputy Leader no form of racism will be accepted in our party. Front-line workers in the NHS have felt ignored by the Government - and now the Tories look set to give up the NHS for profit.\nThis Christmas I’ve been proud to support my hard-working colleagues on the front line by doing shifts in my local A&E. We’re all touched by the NHS at some point in our lives. For over 70 years it has been our lifeline, the glue holding our society together, often forgotten about, but there in our times of greatest need. The NHS is there to bring life, to offer care and dignity when we leave the world, and to support our loved ones when tragedy hits. But front-line workers in the NHS have felt ignored and that the Government does not recognise the day-to-day pressures they face. It didn’t start with claims on the side of a bus during the European referendum campaign in 2016 but, since then, using the NHS for political gain certainly picked up pace. Throughout the election, Boris Johnson repeatedly denied that the NHS would be up for sale. Just two weeks after the election, it was revealed that NHS cancer care and children’s treatments are up for grabs in a stealth Tory sell-off. Cardiology, gynaecology, paediatrics and oncology are among the services being offered to companies. As an A&E doctor, when someone is rushed into A&E having a heart attack, we work to patch someone up before sending them off to heart specialists. How will it feel knowing that those services are now being provided by a private company? Where is the trust? Allowing hospital trusts to outsource treatment to private companies could lead to a postcode lottery of health care, further widening the health divide. We need to be bringing the UK together, not tearing it apart, turning communities against each other. On top of this, discussions are taking place with tech giants on how to make money from patient data. While we must do everything possible to look for cures and ensure a better patient journey, we need to know how our own data is being used. The last decade has shown us that we must exercise caution with tech giants. The Government does not have the money or expertise needed to create an anonymised patient database, which is exactly why Amazon and Microsoft have been approached. Trust in our NHS cannot be destroyed because without trust, everything else could be up for grabs. I was stunned and heartbroken after the election result and bereft at what it would mean for our NHS. Our hospitals, treatments and dedicated staff cannot simply be sold off to the highest bidder. These aren’t the principles our NHS was founded and built on and I will continue fighting, standing side by side with our hospital workers, to protect our NHS from those who wish to destroy it. Shadow minister launches deputy leadership bid with a unifying pitch\nLabour must move past the factionalism and “ideological purity” that has alienated voters across the country, the shadow minister Rosena Allin-Khan has said as she set out her pitch to become the party’s deputy leader. The A&E doctor who has served on Jeremy Corbyn’s frontbench is the latest party figure to officially throw their hat in the ring for the deputy leadership, alongside the shadow cabinet members Angela Rayner and Richard Burgon. Allin-Khan, 43, said that for too long the party had been weighted down by infighting and described her politics as being inspired by public service, which she said was not based within soft- or hard-left identities. “I’ve got the campaigning experience but also the life experience to help rebuild the party again,” said Allin-Khan, who has been a shadow minister for sport since 2016 and still works hospital shifts. “We need to move beyond the last few years where nasty internal debates about faction and ideological purity have too often alienated people outside our movement. “Public service isn’t about identifying who sits on which side of the Labour party. I am Labour because of my values, my life experiences and the fact that I’m a doctor. We must communicate how we are going to change people’s lives in a way they can understand.” Her pitch as a unifying figure across Labour’s political spectrum would involve trying to make inroads in Scotland and Wales and other heartland areas that went Conservative, by holding town hall events, as well as meetings in synagogues, churches, mosques and temples. She said to rebuild the party’s base Labour must listen far more to councillors, who she says are the experts in their communities. The Tooting MP, who has a Pakistani father and Polish mother, dismissed concerns that Labour must have a leadership team that is drawn from northern constituencies. “I grew up poor with a single mum working three jobs to support me and my brother. That taught me the reality of day to day life for people across this country,” she said. “There’s no regional distinction to hunger. Loss of hope lives across the UK. London is used to mean ‘metropolitan elite’ but we also have some of the highest levels of deprivation. “Growing up in poverty. Understanding what it was like to get a job really young to supplement household income, to being careful in supermarkets with food, to feel there was no hope for someone from your background – that experience gives me a fire in my stomach to fight for all people around the country that have to go through that.” The mother of two studied medicine at Cambridge through Labour-initiated scholarships after initially failing her A-levels during a period of difficult family circumstances. After qualifying as a doctor she has worked as an A&E specialist in London hospitals and as a humanitarian aid doctor in the Middle East, Africa and Asia for a decade. She won the Tooting seat in a 2016 by-election after Sadiq Khan quit to run as mayor of London. In parliament she has highlighted the difficulty Palestinian children in Gaza have in accessing healthcare in Israeli hospitals because their parents are not allowed to accompany them through a restrictive permit system. As part of her sports brief she has fought for the return of safe standing at football clubs, as well as being an advocate for the women’s game both in parliament and as a player herself. She was also a vociferous campaigner for the People’s Vote campaign on a second referendum but said she accepted the country was leaving the EU, even though she had fought so hard against it because she did not believe the deal would work for her constituents. As for rejoining the bloc, she said that would have to be looked at if it should ever come up but was not a priority. Despite Corbyn being rejected at the election, she pointed out positive changes he made for the party, including a more welcoming immigration policy, and said she was proud of his strong anti-austerity message and the party’s continued support for the NHS. But on the defeat, she said: “We threw everything out there and nothing had time to land effectively. In comparison the Tories used three words and a few repeated soundbites which ultimately proved effective.” She said she would be happy to work with any leadership candidate should they be elected. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Our brilliant new councillor, Sean Lawless achieved the best result for Labour, since 1986. I've worked with Sean for years and know that he will be a brilliant representative for Tooting.\nThank you for everyone that voted for Labour. Full results: Labour - 1,888 (+6.8%) Tories - 542 (+0.8%) Green Party - 261 (-5.5%) Liberal Democrats - 113 (-2.0%) Changes w./ 2022\nWith the nights getting longer and recent rise in crime, some people feel uncomfortable walking in public alone. I’ve launched my Safe Space campaign, where local businesses can sign up to offer a place of safety.\nFor businesses that would like to sign-up, head to drrosena.co.uk/safespace\nIt was wonderful to attend the Furzedown Project Christmas Party with a great carol performance from local children from Penwortham Primary School. Truly brilliant to see the community come together ahead of Christmas.\nOn Small Business Saturday, I’m at the local family-run business, Lark in Earlsfield, to showcase small businesses, who are the beating heart of our community.\nThis year, make sure you show our small businesses some love and buy local.\nThis morning, I joined pupils at Garratt Park School in Earslfield to plant the 500,000th tree of Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan's Trees for London scheme.\nIt's vital that we make London a green city for the future, where everyone has access to healthy outdoor space. A great time had by all at my local coffee morning, today. Pleasure to invite local residents to share a cuppa and hear about their local issues. Thanks to local organisations and the police for coming along and listening to residents.\nToday, I brought together officials from Wandsworth Council and Wandsworth Police to discuss what we can do to make Tooting Broadway a safer, cleaner and more vibrant place to live and work.\nTonight, I joined with representatives of all faiths and none at the BATCA annual peace ceremony in Tooting.\nThank you to everyone for their prayers of peace. They are needed now more than ever and I am so proud to represent such a wonderful, caring community.\nToday, I read out the names of the fallen and laid a wreath at St Nicholas Church in Tooting with local councillors, Rex Osborn, Kate Forbes and Kemi Akinola and members of our emergency services.\nI am very pleased to see that Labour-run Wandsworth Council will be introducing a landlord licensing pilot scheme in Tooting and Furzedown. Private renters make up a significant proportion of local residents and a key part of our campaign in the local elections last year was to ensure that they get a fair deal.\nThis scheme will strengthen protections and rights for private tenants and I look forward to its successful trial in Tooting before a wider roll-out across the borough.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_local_18/content_711.html": "|\nThe creation of EWS1 forms and concerns about cladding are issues I know a lot of Tooting residents are facing. Everyone deserves the safety and security of home and I am shocked that so many local residents have found themselves in this situation. Following discussions with local people, I have written to the Financial Conduct Authority, Aviva, the National Housing and Building Council and the Shadow Secretary of State for Housing. You can see these letters below. Today Wandsworth Council has announced that it is suspending the Low Traffic Neighbourhoods that it implemented across our community. Wandsworth Council failed from the start to communicate the implementation of LTNs to local residents, and instead of listening and reviewing they have now decided to pull them out because do not want the fuss.\nAs I have said before, I was not consulted and nor were local residents on these changes. They were brought in overnight and pitted neighbour against neighbour, causing fierce rows and division. The Council should be ashamed. When the going got tough, they tried to pass the buck, and now Wandsworth Council is wasting tens of thousands of pounds by scrapping the LTNs entirely. The Conservative Cabinet Member for Transport's position is untenable. Attention will now turn to the TfL Streetspace scheme on Upper Tooting Road, Balham High Road and Tooting High Street. I know that this is a scheme that has its issues and needs reviewing. However, I am confident that TfL want to make it work for our local environment. Contrast TfL's response with that of Wandsworth Council. TfL is taking feedback on board, they are hosting a virtual public meeting next week to gather feedback from local people and I am meeting with a TfL representative next week to discuss the scheme. I will be taking him to meet some of the affected businesses and discussing the issues emergency services have had. TfL evidently want the scheme to work and they deserve credit for trying. I have been clear from the start that I am supportive of schemes which encourage cycling and make our streets safer. We do that by engaging in polite and respectful discussion to bring about changes collectively. I have received lots of correspondence from local residents regarding the changes that have been made to our roads as part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood and the Streetspace schemes on the A24 (Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road). As part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood schemes, many streets have had filters put in to close the road to all vehicles except cycles and some now have turning restrictions. As part of the Streetspace scheme, a number of changes have been made to Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road including the installation of wands to segregate cycle lanes, a number of turning restrictions as well as changes to bus stops.\nThese changes have come about as a result of statutory guidance that the Government issued in May, stating that local authorities were expected to make significant changes to their road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians “as swiftly as possible”. (If you would like to read more about this statutory guidance you can read it in full here.) As a result, TfL made £55m of funding available to the 33 councils in London as part of its “Streetspace for London” programme to urgently create new segregated cycle lanes, extend pavements and close roads to traffic. Wandsworth Council was given £1,923,500 by TfL and used this money to implement the LTNs. TfL has, in consultation with Wandsworth Council but acting separately, implemented changes to the A24. I am supportive of initiatives which reduce car usage, make our streets safer, encourage cycling and create a better local environment. But we must make it work for everyone in Tooting and Balham. I know that lots of local residents have concerns and comments about how the changes have affected our community. The only way to have your voice heard is to feed into the consultations that Wandsworth Council is running and to let TfL know what you think by emailing them. To respond to Wandsworth Council's consultation, click here. To provide feedback to TfL please email: [email protected] It is important to note that I was not consulted prior to the implementation of these changes to our roads and I have no control over the decisions that have been made. As the local MP, I can lobby the Government and the relevant Ministers, but I cannot make decisions for the Conservative Council. I am listening and engaging with local residents on this but I cannot make alterations to these changes. If you have already provided your feedback to Wandsworth Council's consultation and/or emailed TfL, and you want to raise your concerns with other officials, you may also wish to contact Wandsworth Council's Transport spokesperson Councillor John Locker via email at [email protected], or the Government's Minister of State with responsibility for cycling and walking Chris Heaton-Harris MP via email at [email protected] |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

I’ve enjoyed working with this fantastic organisation over the last few years. Mount Carmel offers residential and day programmes to people struggling with addictions. Their Counsellors provide a series of programmes, including a range of talking therapy groups, art therapy and equine therapy, to help people overcome their addiction issues. The pandemic has left Mount Carmel more stretched than ever, with many people seeking help after relapsing or struggling with new addiction problems during the lockdowns. Despite the increased demand, the team at Mount Carmel continue to provide first class care to all their clients. I look forward to continuing to work with the team at Mount Carmel, and seeing all that they go on to achieve. If you would like to support the work they do in our community, you can donate to their Just Giving page below\nWhat a fantastic summer of sport we’ve been treated to! I was lucky to be able to experience the absolutely electric atmosphere at Wembley as the Lionesses roared to an inspirational victory which was one of many sensational memories from the tournament, from Russo’s backheel to Toone’s winner, I know so many young girls will be inspired to continue the wonderful legacy left by this team. The Commonwealth Games have also had a more local hero. Eden Cheng won a silver medal in the 10m synchro platform competition along with Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix. Eden is a brilliant example of our community producing talented athletes, and I am sure many will aspire to reach Eden’s success. Congratulations to Eden, and all the medal winners at the Games! Tooting Bec Athletics Track reopened this summer after a successful community campaign against its closure. It was great to be at their official reopening along with local Councillor Judi Gasser.\nIt was great to meet some young athletes and see the wide range of facilities that they offer, including a seven-a-side football pitch, an eight lane track, and a state of the art fitness centre. I am so grateful we have this brilliant resource on our doorstep in Tooting. The fantastic facilities at Tooting Bec Athletics Track will be vital in helping Tooting’s children become the Olympians of tomorrow. I have no doubt that future Team GB medalists are already training here and I look forward to seeing what they all go on to achieve. Yesterday, my friend Rex Osborn was elected to Wandsworth Council for Tooting Broadway with a whopping 62% of the vote!\nRex has been a constant in my political life – he was the Labour leader on the council when I was elected in 2014 and I served as his deputy. Rex was the one who urged me to run for selection as an MP and has been with me every step of the way since. Tooting has gained a fantastic voice on the council, who will prioritise our town centres, ensure a fairer deal for renters and push for increased cost-of-living support. This election took place under tragic circumstances, following the sad passing of Councillor Andy Gibbons, who served this area faithfully for 28 years. However, I could not think of a better person to represent Tooting in the Town Hall in Andy’s stead and I look forward to working closely with Rex to honour Andy’s legacy. It was a pleasure to invite Royal Mahal, led by Adil Javid, to the Tooting Heroes Awards in Parliament on Monday.\nAdil, and his team, have provided exemplary services to our community, delivering free food parcels to the homeless; supported soup kitchens in Tooting, Balham, Croydon, Norbury, and Purley; provided free school meals to children unable to afford a hot meal and emergency public services, namely the NHS, Police and Fire Services. I would like to send my personal thanks to the Royal Mahal team for being a shining example of a successful local business and key community hub. On behalf of the Tooting community, I wish them the best of luck in continuing to do so. On Monday 13 June, I was delighted to welcome organisations and individuals from across Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting to Parliament, in order to recognise their fantastic contributions to society in the face of adversity in the last few years. It was a sheer joy to see the pillars of our communities together in one place and I look forward to continuing to collaborate and support the inspiring people who do so much for the local area.\nI presented the following organisations and individuals with trophies for truly exceptional services in the community: Councillor Andy Gibbons, for his dedicated public service over the last three decades.

I would like to thank all those who attended - I cannot overstate how proud I am of our community. Each and every one of you is a true Tooting Hero. 44 years of Tory rule in Wandsworth came to an end with Labour taking control of the Council after the local elections. Labour won 35 seats, whilst the Tories won 22. I was thrilled to play a part along with our fantastic Councillors, candidates, and activists in putting Labour into power locally.\nLabour’s historic victory here represents a new start for our borough, and it’s great to see Wandsworth’s group of Labour Councillors already taking action to help residents through the cost-of-living crisis. Talking to residents right across the borough, it was obvious to see that people in Wandsworth have rejected Conservative neglect both locally and nationally. The cost of living crisis is hitting residents hard, and it’s clear the Tories aren’t doing enough to address it. Wandsworth residents simply do not trust the Tories. The road to Labour in Government runs through our local councils, and I am hopeful this local victory will be the springboard to Labour’s general election victory. The Local Elections are hastily approaching on 5th May. After 44 long years of Tory rule, Wandsworth needs a breath of fresh air and a Labour council.\nOver the next four weeks, I will be out on the campaign trail - knocking on doors, delivering leaflets and working to help our fantastic Labour candidates. I would like to thank all the local residents for their support and warm welcome on the doorstep. Together we can turn Labour red this May!\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

It's amazing that all catering is now in-house, with chefs cooking food that has been grown by the students themselves. The children were so enthusiastic about their freshly cooked and nutritious lunches. I believe that the work we’re doing with Chefs in Schools will go a long way to promote positive attitudes and relationships with food and mealtimes for our young people. It was great to be able to support!\nThis week, we celebrated our fantastic women business owners in Tooting. Over the last two years, many women have felt a disproportionate economic hit. Women hold the key to supercharging our economy as we recover from the pandemic. Today I was delighted to welcome Anneliese Dodds MP to Tooting and meet with women business owners. I believe it is essential that we recognise the significant contribution women make and commit to tackling the challenges that they still face today. Also, we welcomed some of our community's many impressive business women and community leaders to Parliament. Tooting is home to so many - it's only right we back women in business. Lastly, a big thank you to Sir Keir Starmer MP for hosting. It was great to be joined by Wandsworth Police for my community safety event last night. We discussed local crime concerns, updated residents on local safety initiatives, and learned new ways to keep our homes safe. A big thank you to all who joined - the community feeling is strong. Additionally, it was great to hear from local residents about how we can make our area safer & about our success of the #SafeSpace campaign. Finally, we discussed future plans to tackle violence against women and girls. It was great to be joined by Lord Wajid Khan at Rutherford House School. We met with the school's Pupil Leaders who had some insightful questions about our work in Parliament, and also taught us about their values of resilience and respect. What a credit to the next generation! So glad that I was able to attend this event with Lord Khan. I was honoured to give a sermon at St. John the Divine Church today on racial justice - talking about me work in Calais and how we can all work against racism in our community. We all must stand together for racial justice! Thank you to the whole church community for the warm welcome. Such an incredible honour to have volunteered with the Care4Calais team in Calais and Dunkirk. Their compassion and work ethic is second to none and they do so much to help and support those who have lost everything, in the most difficult of circumstances. Care4Calais is a refugee crisis charity that helps with delivering essential aid and support, such as food and medical supplies, to refugees living in the UK, France, and Belgium. So glad that I could be a part of this experience to help with the crisis in Calais. I’m officially in the Christmas spirit! It was such a pleasure to open the Christmas fair at Penwortham, and hear the school choir perform together after two years! Lots of Christmas cheer and great stalls. I wanted to congratulate the Penwortham choir on their legendary performance. Thank you for the opportunity to attend! Today is Small Business Saturday and it is important to me to understand what it's like to run a local business, and the challenges and successes that people in our local community experience. So I rolled up my sleeves and got stuck into a shift at Tooting's famous flower stall with local legend Chris. Chris was absolutely wonderful! Thank you for teaching me a few things about the flower industry! I’m looking forward to learning more. Tom's Farm at Nightingale Academy is truly special. From taking care of the animals to competing in national young farmer competitions, students here are provided with the very best learning opportunities. These kids have an outlet to learn about agriculture and animals in a supportive environment. I’m so proud of the work the farm is doing, and I’m looking forward to returning to see everyone soon - especially the adorable animals. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Our beloved Tooting Bec Athletics Track will be saved and get the investment it so desperately needs and deserves. To lose such a valuable asset in our community would be a devastating blow to so many of our young people. Having this track will be useful for encouraging young people to be physically active and lead a healthy lifestyle. Thank you to everyone who joined the efforts to save our track! It was an absolute pleasure to spend time at Beatrix Potter school today. The students were engaged, Year 3's cursive handwriting was impressive, and Year 6 had insightful suggestions on tackling the climate emergency. It's safe to say there were some future leaders in the room! It’s incredibly insightful to see young leaders develop and put their ideas into practice to shape the world in the future. I was truly inspired. Thank you for having me! It was an absolute pleasure to spend time at the Khalsa Centre Gurdwara here in Tooting, sharing prayers and food. It was nice to meet the Sikh community at the Gurdwara. Our community is a vibrant and multicultural place, and the diversity of our community is such a strength. Thank you so much for the warm welcome. Last week was the first time in two years, Tooting came together for the Multi-Faith Peace Ceremony. The importance of this ceremony is that leaders of the main faiths and civic leaders gather with the general public to express prayers and wishes for peace and community solidarity. Our community stood side-by-side, many faiths, all ages, and people from all walks of life who bonded over those differences. It was a real honour to be asked to speak and say a few words. Thank you. It was a privilege to speak at the 13th Annual Black Mental Health Conference, hosted by Wandsworth Community Empowerment Network. As a society, we have to understand the role cultural contact and intersecting identities play when working to support those struggling with their mental health. And we must continue to push back against stigma and foster an open and honest dialogue around mental health in our communities. Thank you for having me. Rough sleeping is a significant and growing concern within our community. With its causes and symptoms, it’s a complex issue. But in a country as decent and well off as ours, we should not be seeing this increase in rough sleeping on our streets. I invited council reps, the City Hall housing team and local police to join me and see the issues in our community first-hand. I'm working hard to bring agencies together and effect change. The Year 2s at Tooting Primary School have been learning all about strong women. I was honoured to be invited to speak with the pupils all about being what it means to be a doctor and represent our wonderful community as MP. It is so important that we recognise and champion the voices and stories of strong women. And the students had great questions. They even taught me a few strong women facts! I am concerned about South Western Railway’s planned cuts to local services. Earlsfield Station could lose two trains per hour off-peak, and direct services to Shepperton could be cut. With residents gradually returning to offices, I believe that these cuts to rail services are ill-considered. In addition, if we are to tackle air pollution and reduce carbon emissions, we need to be encouraging public transport use - not making it more difficult to use. The South Western Railway’s Consultation on this matter closes on Sunday 19th September. If you are affected by these planned changes, I would encourage you to submit your view to the consultation here. Local community champions Dons Local Action Group have joined forces with AFC Wimbledon to continue their fight against food poverty in our community. The Dons will be collecting donations at every home game this season, which will support even more families in need. The Dons are requesting donations of tinned meat, vegetables, fish, fruit, and pulses. Collection points are located by each stadium entrance. Next match day, please support this wonderful initiative in any way that you are able – the spirit of giving is what makes our Tooting community so special! Many local residents have been in touch regarding the expansion of the Cambo Oil Field, 75 miles to the west of the Shetland Islands in Scotland. I want to be clear in the fact that I oppose the expansion of the Cambo Oil Field. The climate crisis is the defining issue of our generation and should be treated with the urgency required. By expanding oil and gas exploration, we are abandoning our obligations to end the ongoing climate crisis. Ahead of COP26, we must support the end of oil and gas exploration whilst protecting our communities and jobs. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_all_33/content_739.html": "|\nI am aware of residents’ concerns regarding the planning application at 56 Glenburnie Road, which on granting would see the existing house demolished to make way for nine flats. Whilst not a conservation area, I know many are worried about the occupancy increase and a potential increase in traffic congestion, as well as the removal of the existing family home. So far, 51 residents have objected to these applications, which were approved by Wandsworth Council on December 4th 2020 with conditions. On behalf of those Glenburnie Road residents who have expressed their concerns with these proposals, I have written to the Planning Technical Support Team at Wandsworth Council to make clear the strength of feeling on this issue locally. It is important to me that concerns are properly recognised at this time. Please be assured that I remain in close communication with the local Councillor Annamarie Critchard and will continue to monitor developments on this closely. Beyond all doubt, the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated existing issues within the private renting sector. I know that many have fallen behind on household bills and rent due to financial pressures caused by many factors such as unemployment and furlough. Studies show one in four private renters have seen their earnings fall since the start of the pandemic and half a million private tenants are in rent arrears and at risk of eviction. I want to say that my thoughts are with those experiencing uncertainty. I strongly believe it is important that Ministers drop their proposals to cut UC, end the five-week wait for housing benefit, and suspend the benefit cap. Furthermore, Local Housing Allowance (LHA) should also be increased to cover average rents throughout the pandemic. In the meantime, the following organisations may be of some assistance if you are experiencing any financial difficulties: • Shelter’s online webchat and advice pages • Citizens Advice Wandsworth: 0800 144 8444 • Turn2Us (for issues relating to benefits): 0808 802 2000 For those unaware, latest Government guidance states that those with a serious mental health illness are now eligible to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.\nSerious mental health illnesses include those such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. However, this list is not exhaustive and anyone who is severely affected by a mental health problem is encouraged to contact their GP if they have not yet been invited to receive the vaccine. If you are a carer for a person with a severe mental illness, you could also be eligible. Click here for more information on eligibility or contact your GP. If you are eligible, to book or manage an existing vaccination appointment, click here. The inability to afford everyday hygiene and personal grooming essentials is sadly a growing problem. With people and families hit hard by the ongoing pandemic, hygiene poverty is a bigger problem than ever before - many are struggling to afford essential products like soap, shampoo, toothpaste, period products, and hand sanitiser. Here in Wandsworth, a new hygiene bank has opened to tackle this growing problem and alleviate the issue of hygiene poverty in our local area. As a volunteer-run project, all the money raised by the hygiene bank goes directly towards providing much-needed essentials for local residents, with all donated products distributed to local frontline organisations in the borough. To find out more about the Hygiene Bank Wandsworth, or to make a donation, see here. The issue of litter in our local area is not a new problem. Indeed, back in 2019 I provided Wandsworth Council with a number of solutions to this issue, which were not acknowledged or enacted upon. I have recently been inundated with complaints from residents who have received Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs). As you may know, FPNs cannot be appealed, and I am concerned about the lack of oversight and accountability this procedure affords. It is clear from the litter on our streets that fining residents for putting out their household waste is not defeating the issue of fly-tipping. Fly-tipping fines need to be issued to the right people, for the right reasons – to deter genuine incidences of fly-tipping. Instead of being a deterrent, I am concerned that these fly-tipping fines are being misused as a Council cash-grab – making money from hardworking residents under the guise of keeping our streets clean. I have written to Paul Martin, Chief Executive at Wandsworth Council, and Paul Chadwick, Director of Environment and Community Services, to ask what action they will take to address these concerns. Keep an eye out for updates here.\nWhen the water has been turned off, the water flow can disturb sediment in the pipes, which can then cause the water to appear to be dark in colour. I have been in contact with Thames Water regarding this and they have assured me that it is not harmful.\nWith the colder weather, Thames Water have also advised the following to help prevent water leaks: • Check pipes – thaw frozen pipes with a hot water bottle or a towel soaked in water • Bleed the radiators – use a radiator key to open the valve and release trapped air • Look after your central heating – get your boiler serviced often and keep the heating on low when not at home • Find your stop tap – these are usually found under the kitchen sink. Turn right to tighten and left to loosen • Keep a plumber on hand – keep details of a reputable plumber on hand and make sure to check home insurance cover In the instance that you see a leak, you can report it to Thames Water here, then phone a plumber immediately. Please do keep an eye on my Twitter, where I am posting updates on the water issues as they arise. The end of 2020 brought the news that we’d been waiting for - the first vaccine was approved for use in the UK. I’m hugely grateful to all the scientists who have made this happen. Around the world they’ve been working non-stop – just like our frontline healthcare professionals and key workers - to put a stop to this virus and allow us to get on with life as normal. Now another milestone in the vaccination programme is happening on our doorstep. St George’s is one of four sites participating in a new study to assess the safety and immune response of the Oxford-AstraZenaca jab in healthy children aged 6-17 years old. Building on previous trials of the vaccine, which have shown that it is safe, produces strong immune system responses, and has high efficacy in all adults, this trial will assess if children and young adults make a good immune response with the vaccine. I recognise that some have concerns about the vaccine, and dangerous myths circulate on social media – it’s simply not good enough to just ignore them and hope they go away. Labour has offered to work with ministers to tackle online harms. And we can all play our part in putting friends and family members at ease by reminding them that we can trust the NHS to take care of us in these difficult times. If the vaccine is good enough for scientists and the regulator, it’s good enough for my family and I. Indeed, I have joined together with a cross-party group of MPs, encouraging everyone to take up the vaccine. The video can be viewed here. We won’t see changes overnight and we still need to look out for our communities. Let's regain the spirit of coming together like we did in the first days of the pandemic and work to eradicate this virus.\nTeachers and school teams are doing a phenomenal job, and I know that digital poverty is a real worry for them, as well as for families across Tooting. Early on in the pandemic, Labour called for a set of measures that would see a mass roll-out of devices and internet access to students currently struggling to learn online, alongside steps such as ‘zero-rating’ of educational websites to ensure data charges are not putting barriers on access to education during lockdown.\nThe digital divide risks failing a generation. I am so pleased to have been able to help close this gap. I know that the Climate and Ecological Emergency (CEE) Bill is one of interest to many people here in Tooting. On 9th February, the CEE Bill was debated in a thirty-minute adjournment debate. Adjournment debates are spaces at the end of the Parliamentary day when MPs can debate a specific topic. As you may know, the CEE Bill is a Private Members Bill (Presentation Bill), meaning that it does not involve a debate or a vote in Parliament, but rather it is a way of drawing attention to an issue. I support the principles of this Bill and will therefore continue to support Parliamentary measures that seek to implement many of the principles laid out in the Bill. Indeed, I have already supported several amendments to the Environment Bill in order to improve it, such as Clause 2 for environmental targets on particulate matter and Clause 7 for Environmental Improvement Plans. I will absolutely continue to support strong and effective amendments to the Environment Bill when it returns to the House of Commons in due course. The climate crisis is an imminent threat to current and future generations. Please know that I am committed to holding the Government to account on their approach to climate change. As puppy prices soar across the UK, I am aware of concerns with the recent rise of dog thefts in our community, with incidents taking place particularly on and around Tooting Common. Perpetrators have been using a number of tactics, including snatching leads from dog owners’ hands, using dog whistles to attract dogs roaming off-lead, and impersonating RSPCA employees to gain access to dogs. One strategy involves approaching people walking their dogs and informing them that their dog resembles an animal that has been reported lost, before asking to scan the dog’s microchip in their van. Once near the van, dogs are being separated from their unsuspecting owners before driving away. The RSPCA reminds that their officers will always be wearing uniforms bearing the charity’s logo and will be carrying identification, and asks that any member of the public who believes someone is impersonating an officer report the incident to the RSPCA and to local police. Suspicious activity – including being approached with questions about your dog, asking for photographs to be taken of your dog – should also be reported. I have written to Inspector Barrie Capper, Head of Wandsworth Neighbourhood Policing Team, asking them to take action to protect our pets and tackle this awful crime. In the meantime, Blue Cross have provided a helpful list of actions you can take to help keep your dog safe.\nClick here for more information. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

In 2015, the union nominated Andy Burnham for leader and Caroline Flint for deputy, and in 2016 it backed leadership challenger Owen Smith. Commenting on their nomination on Twitter, the Musicians’ Union said Starmer had been “a strong supporter of musicians”. “He understands the challenges musicians working in the EU are facing and what we need to do to meet them”. The organisation also revealed in a tweet that Allin-Khan was a “former Musicians’ Union member” and said they were “proud to see her rise so far” and “to support her as she continues fighting for young people to have a free musical education.” Starmer has already secured his place on the final ballot through both the support of affiliates, including large trade union UNISON, and the backing of local Labour parties. To reach the ballot paper, each candidate must be nominated by 5% of local parties or three affiliates, two of which must be trade unions, amounting to more than 5% of the total affiliate membership. Starmer has been nominated by a total of 159 constituency parties so far, as well as UNISON, Usdaw, SERA, Community, Labour Movement for Europe, Labour Business and the Socialist Health Association. Allin-Khan has yet to secure a place on the final ballot, having so far only secured the support of 17 CLPs and the Labour Campaign for International Development.

It has been a year of change and renewal - full of ups and downs - but as I enter into my ninth year as your Member of Parliament for Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting, it remains the greatest honour of my life to represent the community in which I was born and raised. Entering the new year, I would like to pay tribute to the incredible frontline workers working around the clock to keep the country going through the festive period. From our NHS services to local hospitality staff to food bank volunteers - you all have my heartfelt gratitude for your tireless work this Christmas and throughout the year. A year for democracyWhat a year it has been for elections, both locally and across the country. We began the year with a fantastic win in the Tooting Broadway by-election, increasing the Labour vote share by nearly 7% to a whopping 58% majority. Then came the Mayoral elections in May, when we kept London red by electing my Tooting predecessor Sadiq Khan to a historic third term as Mayor of London. Finally - and most importantly - we finally elected a new Labour Government after 14 long years, with areas up and down the country voting Labour for the very first time. It was humbling to receive the most votes of any Labour MP and thanks must go to everyone who voted for me - your support means the world. £100m to fix Wandsworth PrisonAfter years of campaigning - and countless stories of mismanagement and scandal - the Ministry of Justice announced a £100 million funding package for HMP Wandsworth. This will go a long way to reduce the impact of overcrowding, repair crumbling cell blocks and facilities, and ensure that prison guards can work in a safe environment. Delivering for everyone in TootingThousands of local people have contacted me this year regarding a variety of issues, I have dealt with 15,000 cases. I reclaimed tens of thousands in unpaid pensions or benefits for local people, got decisions on hundreds of delayed passport or visa applications, and helped countless local residents get repairs to their homes. My door is always open and please get in touch if there is anything I can help with. On the NHS frontline\nSpeaking up for Gaza It has now been over a year since the horrific 7th October attacks and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza. The humanitarian disaster we have seen unfold there in the time since, has been truly heartwrenching. This year, I've raised the issue numerous times in Parliament, visited the region in the spring, and held evidence sessions with humanitarian experts. Revitalising Tooting town centre\nThis Morning and Loose Women Using my background as an NHS doctor, I have enjoyed trying my hand at being a TV medic this year! The lovely people at This Morning and Loose Women have had me on many times to talk about a range of topics from mental health to medical emergencies and even gave me space to open up about my own childhood challenges with speech, in a bid to end stigma and help others. Work in Parliament\nKeeping our streets safe in 2024, I successfully campaigned for a tripling of the Tooting neighbourhood policing team, putting more bobbies on our streets. In the summer, Operation Kenny run by the Metropolitan Police resulted in a 70% reduction in crime in Tooting town centre. This work will continue with the new Government's plans to recruit 13,000 new officers and return policing to communities. Cleaning up the local area I have never stopped campaigning for cleaner streets. This year saw a 15% reduction in fly-tipping in Wandsworth, with thousands of fines issued to people dumping their bulky rubbish on our streets. Meanwhile, Wandsworth Labour introduced food recycling for the first time ever in the borough. Free School Meals roll-out\nMental health reform Mental health is incredibly important to me and, for far too long, much-needed reforms were swept under the rug by a Conservative Government that simply wasn't interested. After much hard work, it was fantastic to see reform of the Mental Health Act announced in the King's Speech in July - this was long overdue.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

The Commonwealth Games have also had a more local hero. Eden Cheng won a silver medal in the 10m synchro platform competition along with Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix. Eden is a brilliant example of our community producing talented athletes, and I am sure many will aspire to reach Eden’s success. Congratulations to Eden, and all the medal winners at the Games! Tooting Bec Athletics Track reopened this summer after a successful community campaign against its closure. It was great to be at their official reopening along with local Councillor Judi Gasser.\nIt was great to meet some young athletes and see the wide range of facilities that they offer, including a seven-a-side football pitch, an eight lane track, and a state of the art fitness centre. I am so grateful we have this brilliant resource on our doorstep in Tooting. The fantastic facilities at Tooting Bec Athletics Track will be vital in helping Tooting’s children become the Olympians of tomorrow. I have no doubt that future Team GB medalists are already training here and I look forward to seeing what they all go on to achieve. Yesterday, my friend Rex Osborn was elected to Wandsworth Council for Tooting Broadway with a whopping 62% of the vote!\nRex has been a constant in my political life – he was the Labour leader on the council when I was elected in 2014 and I served as his deputy. Rex was the one who urged me to run for selection as an MP and has been with me every step of the way since. Tooting has gained a fantastic voice on the council, who will prioritise our town centres, ensure a fairer deal for renters and push for increased cost-of-living support. This election took place under tragic circumstances, following the sad passing of Councillor Andy Gibbons, who served this area faithfully for 28 years. However, I could not think of a better person to represent Tooting in the Town Hall in Andy’s stead and I look forward to working closely with Rex to honour Andy’s legacy. It was a pleasure to invite Royal Mahal, led by Adil Javid, to the Tooting Heroes Awards in Parliament on Monday.\nAdil, and his team, have provided exemplary services to our community, delivering free food parcels to the homeless; supported soup kitchens in Tooting, Balham, Croydon, Norbury, and Purley; provided free school meals to children unable to afford a hot meal and emergency public services, namely the NHS, Police and Fire Services. I would like to send my personal thanks to the Royal Mahal team for being a shining example of a successful local business and key community hub. On behalf of the Tooting community, I wish them the best of luck in continuing to do so. On Monday 13 June, I was delighted to welcome organisations and individuals from across Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting to Parliament, in order to recognise their fantastic contributions to society in the face of adversity in the last few years. It was a sheer joy to see the pillars of our communities together in one place and I look forward to continuing to collaborate and support the inspiring people who do so much for the local area.\nI presented the following organisations and individuals with trophies for truly exceptional services in the community: Councillor Andy Gibbons, for his dedicated public service over the last three decades.

I would like to thank all those who attended - I cannot overstate how proud I am of our community. Each and every one of you is a true Tooting Hero. 44 years of Tory rule in Wandsworth came to an end with Labour taking control of the Council after the local elections. Labour won 35 seats, whilst the Tories won 22. I was thrilled to play a part along with our fantastic Councillors, candidates, and activists in putting Labour into power locally.\nLabour’s historic victory here represents a new start for our borough, and it’s great to see Wandsworth’s group of Labour Councillors already taking action to help residents through the cost-of-living crisis. Talking to residents right across the borough, it was obvious to see that people in Wandsworth have rejected Conservative neglect both locally and nationally. The cost of living crisis is hitting residents hard, and it’s clear the Tories aren’t doing enough to address it. Wandsworth residents simply do not trust the Tories. The road to Labour in Government runs through our local councils, and I am hopeful this local victory will be the springboard to Labour’s general election victory. The Local Elections are hastily approaching on 5th May. After 44 long years of Tory rule, Wandsworth needs a breath of fresh air and a Labour council.\nOver the next four weeks, I will be out on the campaign trail - knocking on doors, delivering leaflets and working to help our fantastic Labour candidates. I would like to thank all the local residents for their support and warm welcome on the doorstep. Together we can turn Labour red this May!\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_tooting_7/content_656.html": "|\nLast week was the first time in two years, Tooting came together for the Multi-Faith Peace Ceremony. The importance of this ceremony is that leaders of the main faiths and civic leaders gather with the general public to express prayers and wishes for peace and community solidarity. Our community stood side-by-side, many faiths, all ages, and people from all walks of life who bonded over those differences. It was a real honour to be asked to speak and say a few words. Thank you. The Year 2s at Tooting Primary School have been learning all about strong women. I was honoured to be invited to speak with the pupils all about being what it means to be a doctor and represent our wonderful community as MP. It is so important that we recognise and champion the voices and stories of strong women. And the students had great questions. They even taught me a few strong women facts! Tooting Foodival is back! As Transition Tooting’s annual sustainable community festival, this is a wonderful opportunity for local residents to come together to celebrate all things locally grown, cooked, re-created and re-imagined. Led by local volunteers, the event will run from 11- 5pm on Saturday 4th September and is free and open to all! To find out more, see here. Today, I spoke with GMB and Royal College of Nursing frontline NHS staff at St George’s Hospital to hear their views on the Government’s latest pay offer. The last 18 months has impacted our beloved NHS immeasurably, and staff have made significant sacrifices in order to save lives. I stand in solidarity with my NHS colleagues. They deserve far more than just claps. They need a proper pay rise. Tooting Community Kitchen is a wonderful organisation that serves hot food to those vulnerable in our community. And they need volunteers! If you have a few hours to spare, please consider lending a hand to help out this brilliant local organisation. You can find out more about how to get involved here. There was significant concern locally about Wandsworth Council’s decision to extend Controlled Parking Zone restrictions in areas of Earlsfield and Tooting from 9:30am to 9:30pm each day. Over 1400 local residents completed my consultation on the change. I am pleased that, following our pressure, Wandsworth Council have U-turned on their plans to extend CPZ restrictions. Instead, Event Day only restrictions are planned from 1 October - a far more sensible solution, and something which other councils with stadiums do. I received more than double the number of responses to Wandsworth Council’s rushed, ill-thought out consultation. In fact, over 93% of respondents were not happy with the council’s plans. This should never have happened. But I am pleased the Council finally listened and have U-turned on their attempt to rush through restrictions that would simply act as another cash-grab on hardworking local residents. On the eve of Tokyo 2020, Tooting is preparing to celebrate a hero of the Antwerp Games a century earlier - champion middle-distance runner Albert Hill. Hill, who took gold at the 1920 Olympics, was born and raised in Tooting. A blue plaque commemorating his outstanding achievements is now set to be erected outside his former home. The plaque was funded through community donations, and is the result of the tireless efforts of the students of Fircroft Primary School, who campaigned for its creation. Local historian Geoff Simmons said, “It’s great that Great Britain’s Olympic past is being honoured, but its future is under threat. Tooting Bec Athletics Track, home to the historic athletics club Herne Hill Harriers, and used by 80,000 young people every year, has been ruled unfit for competition and is in need of repair.” Click here to sign the petition calling on Wandsworth Tories to fund vital repairs to Tooting Track. On Sunday I had the great honour of presenting the medals and winners’ trophy to the Sinjun Grammarians under 12s cricket team - 2021 champions of the Surrey Tier Three League. Masterfully managed by Mukesh Dev, and captained with distinction by Rufus Ford, the team’s achievement is all the more remarkable on account of the club’s small size – with a membership of just over 50 junior players, Sinjun Grammarians rarely have enough players in the same age group to enter into league competitions. Their success is also astounding for the fact that the playing group, who were experiencing league competition for the first time, marched to the title unbeaten in all their 10 games. I could not be more proud of this group of talented young athletes, not only for overcoming the odds and taking the title so convincingly, but for the focus, determination, sportsmanship, and teamwork they showed along the way. This is what Tooting is all about: the players are truly a credit to themselves, their families, their club, and our community. I was absolutely bowled over by the Club’s decision to award me the title of Honorary President of Sinjun Grammarians Cricket Club. This success is undoubtedly the first of many such achievements for this passionate group of young cricketers, and I look forward to celebrating with them again in coming seasons. Well done, team! The future of Tooting Bec Athletics Track is still yet to be secured, with vital repairs still needing to be undertaken. Tooting Bec Athletics Track is a much-loved and well-utilised facility, both by local residents and the wider London community. The track is a home to schools, clubs such as Herne Hill Harriers, as well as aspiring athletes. To lose such a valuable asset would be a devastating blow to so many of our young people in our local area. Top British athletes are made at Tooting Bec Athletics Track - Jade Johnson, who represented Great Britain at two Olympics, trained at the track since childhood, as has Katie Snowden, who will represent Great Britain in Tokyo next month. By allowing the track to fall into disrepair, Wandsworth Tories are destroying the legacy of London 2012, and seriously damaging the chances of our next generation of Olympic hopefuls in the process. The deadline for the petition to save Tooting Bec Athletics Track has been extended until 1 August – click here to sign and show Wandsworth Tories how much our community cares about the future of our young people. Worryingly, coronavirus rates are soaring once again across London. The vaccine is our best defence. If you are yet to receive either your first or second dose, please do so as soon as possible. To help get Tooting vaccinated, the Pearl Chemist Vaccination Centre is now offering a walk-in clinic for those aged 18+ at St Boniface Church on Mitcham Road (Monday to Saturday 9-5pm). Appointments are available for first doses as well as second doses. Second doses can be given eight weeks after the first. Any questions can be directed to Pearl Chemist on 0208 049 6640. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_parliament/content_387.html": "|\nIt's finally Friday and what better way to prepare for the weekend than by reading my latest column in the South London Press.\nRead my article on the steps Labour are taking, both nationally and locally, to tackle the housing crisis here. As 2024 draws to a close, I wanted to take this opportunity to look back on the events of the past year. It has been a year of change and renewal - full of ups and downs - but as I enter into my ninth year as your Member of Parliament for Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting, it remains the greatest honour of my life to represent the community in which I was born and raised. Entering the new year, I would like to pay tribute to the incredible frontline workers working around the clock to keep the country going through the festive period. From our NHS services to local hospitality staff to food bank volunteers - you all have my heartfelt gratitude for your tireless work this Christmas and throughout the year. A year for democracyWhat a year it has been for elections, both locally and across the country. We began the year with a fantastic win in the Tooting Broadway by-election, increasing the Labour vote share by nearly 7% to a whopping 58% majority. Then came the Mayoral elections in May, when we kept London red by electing my Tooting predecessor Sadiq Khan to a historic third term as Mayor of London. Finally - and most importantly - we finally elected a new Labour Government after 14 long years, with areas up and down the country voting Labour for the very first time. It was humbling to receive the most votes of any Labour MP and thanks must go to everyone who voted for me - your support means the world. £100m to fix Wandsworth PrisonAfter years of campaigning - and countless stories of mismanagement and scandal - the Ministry of Justice announced a £100 million funding package for HMP Wandsworth. This will go a long way to reduce the impact of overcrowding, repair crumbling cell blocks and facilities, and ensure that prison guards can work in a safe environment. Delivering for everyone in TootingThousands of local people have contacted me this year regarding a variety of issues, I have dealt with 15,000 cases. I reclaimed tens of thousands in unpaid pensions or benefits for local people, got decisions on hundreds of delayed passport or visa applications, and helped countless local residents get repairs to their homes. My door is always open and please get in touch if there is anything I can help with. On the NHS frontline\nSpeaking up for Gaza It has now been over a year since the horrific 7th October attacks and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza. The humanitarian disaster we have seen unfold there in the time since, has been truly heartwrenching. This year, I've raised the issue numerous times in Parliament, visited the region in the spring, and held evidence sessions with humanitarian experts. Revitalising Tooting town centre\nThis Morning and Loose Women Using my background as an NHS doctor, I have enjoyed trying my hand at being a TV medic this year! The lovely people at This Morning and Loose Women have had me on many times to talk about a range of topics from mental health to medical emergencies and even gave me space to open up about my own childhood challenges with speech, in a bid to end stigma and help others. Work in Parliament\nKeeping our streets safe in 2024, I successfully campaigned for a tripling of the Tooting neighbourhood policing team, putting more bobbies on our streets. In the summer, Operation Kenny run by the Metropolitan Police resulted in a 70% reduction in crime in Tooting town centre. This work will continue with the new Government's plans to recruit 13,000 new officers and return policing to communities. Cleaning up the local area I have never stopped campaigning for cleaner streets. This year saw a 15% reduction in fly-tipping in Wandsworth, with thousands of fines issued to people dumping their bulky rubbish on our streets. Meanwhile, Wandsworth Labour introduced food recycling for the first time ever in the borough. Free School Meals roll-out\nMental health reform Mental health is incredibly important to me and, for far too long, much-needed reforms were swept under the rug by a Conservative Government that simply wasn't interested. After much hard work, it was fantastic to see reform of the Mental Health Act announced in the King's Speech in July - this was long overdue.\nEight years ago today, I was selected as the Tooting Labour candidate for the by-election caused by Sadiq becoming a candidate for Mayor of London.\nIt has been a huge honour and privilege to serve as the representative for the community in which I was born and raised. My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has supported me on this incredible journey.\nAs part of my previous work as Shadow Minister for Mental Health and in my capacity as an A&E doctor at St George's, I know firsthand the toll that working on the NHS frontline can take.\nToday, I asked the Government whether they will continue to fund mental health support services past the 12 months they've committed to. Shamefully, the Minister refused to commit to funding. This is just further proof that this Tory Government couldn't care less about our NHS heroes.\nThe Tories' Rwanda Bill is one of the most shameful pieces of legislation in recent memory on both moral and practical grounds, which is why I voted 20 times against the Bill last night.\nIt is shameful that the Prime Minister continues to allow the sale of British weapons and military equipment to Israel.in breach of the UK's international commitments. I have been calling for a suspension of sales immediately and my comments can be read in the Independent here. Last week, I also signed a joint letter to the Foreign and Business Secretaries alongside a cross-party group of over 130 MPs, calling for the halting of UK arms sales to Israel. The full text of this letter can be read below. After more than a year of waiting, the Government has finally responded to the Joint Committee report on the draft Mental Health Bill.\nIn that time, they kicked mental health into the long grass while patients continued to suffer. The Government response is poor - rejecting vital calls for a Mental Health Commissioner, refusing to ban discriminatory Community Treatment Orders and ignoring a right to culturally appropriate advocacy. Why make us wait so long and not provide any meaningful change? With waiting lists higher than ever, we need bold action on mental health. It is clear the Tories are simply not up to the job. A Labour Government must bring forward mental health reform with the recommendations of the committee at its core.\nThere was a huge turnout today for the Oxfam Lobby Day event calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. I was proud to join other MPs and charities calling for an unconditional, immediate ceasefire.\nThank you to the charities who helped support it and to all attendees, who brought a powerful energy to the room.\nTonight, I joined Robert Peston on ITV alongside Conservative MP, Paul Scully, Government Minister, Kevin Hollinrake and environmental campaigner, Fergal Sharkey to discuss the hot topics of the day. We chatted about the appalling comments made by a Tory donor about Diane Abbott and extremism in the UK.\nUp to 86,000 people could die in Gaza in the next 6 months due to war, disease and starvation. There’s one latrine for every 500 people and only 4 trucks of aid per day.\nAt the International Development Select Committee, we heard evidence about the appalling humanitarian situation from experts working on the ground. The Committee published our report on the ongoing crisis. You can read more about it here\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

It’s a time to celebrate all the brilliant women who make our community, the incredible place it is.\nToday, I brought together a group of fantastic leading women in business and community organisations. Their stories were inspiring and shows what women can do when we support each other. Today, I am marking International Women's Day 2023 by celebrating some of the inspiring women who make Tooting the best place to work and live.\nHere are just some of Tooting's amazing women: Sahar Beg - Sahar, and her amazing team of volunteers, run the Tooting Community Kitchen, which has provided hot meals, toiletries, and care packages to those in need since 2018. Sophie Livingstone - Sophie, and the team at Little Village, are hardworking local activists providing vital support at their baby bank in Tooting. Kate Allan - Kate is a leading member of the Balham and Tooting Community Association (BATCA). BATCA works to organise community events, celebreate the local heroes in our area and bring people of all backgrounds together.

She is a volunteer for Global Human Rights Defence and has been the spokesperson to the United Nations Human Rights Council. Cllr Lizzy Dobres - Lizzy has been a dedicated councillor since being elected last May and has led on fighting inequality and violence against women. Charlotte White - Charlotte is part of the fantastic team at Earlsfield Foodbank. During the most difficult of times, she has worked tirelessly to support those in need of our community.

She explains how the coronavirus pandemic has affected staff: I’ve been an A&E doctor for 15 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this before. The departments are quieter because people are staying away from hospital, but the patients are sicker. We’re seeing a distinct rise in the numbers coming in with respiratory symptoms, who are testing Covid-19 positive. On Sunday, very early in the morning, the entire resuscitation department, where the absolute sickest patients go, was full to capacity with patients with breathing difficulties. We had to move other very ill patients to the paediatric resuscitation area to keep them safe. This is only set to get worse. We’re seeing patients now who would have only contracted the virus two weeks ago. In the coming 10 days we expect the entire A&E department will be taken up with suspected Covid-19 patients. Doctors and nurses are brave, and the A&E department is known for being on the frontline and high risk, but there’s a palpable fear among staff for three reasons. Firstly, they’re frightened for their own health and those of the people they love. When I finished my shift yesterday, which was Mother’s Day, I came back to the house and I couldn’t touch or hug my two little girls until I put all my clothes in the wash and had a shower. The second reason is that staff expect, very soon, potentially to have to make heart-wrenching choices about whose life can be saved if we don’t have enough ventilators. That goes counter to everything you’ve ever learned as a doctor or nurse – to make life-and-death decisions, where we could possibly have saved every one of those people, is unimaginable. This is what our colleagues in Italy are living through now. Third, the patterns described thus far for symptoms of coronavirus are not what we’re now seeing in the emergency department. We’re seeing young, previously very healthy people, who are ill in hospital. Some are in their 30s, and they need ventilators to stay alive. Some patients are presenting with abdominal pain, which we hadn’t heard of before. A person can come in and say they have a stomach pain, and they’re put in the “green” area of the department – but then they mention they also have a cough. Everybody should be assumed to be Covid-positive until proven otherwise at this point. There’s also a real concern among staff around the country about personal protective equipment. They either don’t have any, or if they do many feel it’s being rationed. It’s very hard to listen to some colleagues say that as a result of there not being enough equipment to go round, they’re resigned to catching the virus – it’s just a matter of when. On social distancing, the messaging from the government hasn’t been clear enough. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has banned public gatherings of more than two people. It’s clear and easy to understand. There has to be no ambiguity in the language because people’s lives depend on it. Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives.

In fact, some key workers will end up more than £1,000 worse off. While I have long called for investment in social care, this is not the appropriate way to fund it. Once again the Tories have put the very wealthiest above working people. I am proud to have voted against this National Insurance increase, which will be a damaging blow to so many working people in Tooting. I am concerned about South Western Railway’s planned cuts to local services. Earlsfield Station could lose two trains per hour off-peak, and direct services to Shepperton could be cut. With residents gradually returning to offices, I believe that these cuts to rail services are ill-considered. In addition, if we are to tackle air pollution and reduce carbon emissions, we need to be encouraging public transport use - not making it more difficult to use. The South Western Railway’s Consultation on this matter closes on Sunday 19th September. If you are affected by these planned changes, I would encourage you to submit your view to the consultation here. Local community champions Dons Local Action Group have joined forces with AFC Wimbledon to continue their fight against food poverty in our community. The Dons will be collecting donations at every home game this season, which will support even more families in need. The Dons are requesting donations of tinned meat, vegetables, fish, fruit, and pulses. Collection points are located by each stadium entrance. Next match day, please support this wonderful initiative in any way that you are able – the spirit of giving is what makes our Tooting community so special! Many local residents have been in touch regarding the expansion of the Cambo Oil Field, 75 miles to the west of the Shetland Islands in Scotland. I want to be clear in the fact that I oppose the expansion of the Cambo Oil Field. The climate crisis is the defining issue of our generation and should be treated with the urgency required. By expanding oil and gas exploration, we are abandoning our obligations to end the ongoing climate crisis. Ahead of COP26, we must support the end of oil and gas exploration whilst protecting our communities and jobs. It was an honour to host my first ever radio show on Riverside Radio last night on all things mental health. Mental health struggles are nothing to be ashamed of, and tackling the stigma starts with open, honest conversations. Thank you to all the wonderful listeners who called up with their mental health questions during the show, and to Sahar Beg from Tooting Community Kitchen who joined me in the studio. If you missed the show, you can listen back here. Our Tooting community always comes together in the face of adversity, and I know many local residents will want to help those impacted by the current situation in Afghanistan in any way they can. That is why I have compiled a list of organisations and charities currently working to support Afghan refugees:\nTo provide refugee accommodation: Refugees at Home: UK charity which connects those with a spare room with refugees and asylum seekers in need of somewhere to stay. Apply to be a host here. Room for Refugees: Community hosting network that offers safe, temporary homes and emotional support for insecurely-housed refugees, asylum seekers and vulnerable groups - families, the sick, the elderly and unaccompanied asylum seeking children with no recourse to public funds. Apply to offer accommodation here. Wandsworth Borough Council: Residents, businesses, or other landlords who could offer a property for new arrivals are being asked to register their details - they are particularly keen to hear from those with 3 to 4 bedroom properties available. To offer accommodation, contact Wandsworth Borough Council via email at [email protected]k or by phone on 020 8871 7333. Local Organisations: Care4Calais: Asking for volunteers, financial donations and donations clothes, shoes, phones or other essentials at drop off points:\nNational Organisations: Choose Love: Supporting projects providing vital aid and services to Afghan people who have fled the country: clothes, shelter, support for children and groups protecting women and children’s rights.\nBritish Red Cross: Calling for donations to help staff and volunteers provide emotional support and essential items, including warm clothes, blankets, soap, toothbrushes and nappies.\nSave the Children: Calling for donations to an emergency fund.\nAction Aid: Calling for emergency donations to help charity provide emergency humanitarian assistance including food, water, and essential items such as hygiene kits, cash, tarpaulins, tents, cooking utensils, clothing, and bedding.\nAfghanaid: Afghanaid is a British humanitarian and development organisation, currently asking for donations to assist response to the Afghan crisis\nUNICEF: Raising money to support children in Afghanistan\nUNHCR: Calling for donations to help the organisation in the distribution of family tents, hygiene kits, core relief items like blankets, sleeping mats and kitchen sets.\nThe Big Give: Delivering emergency support to families whose lives have been destroyed or uprooted by the conflict.\nMuslim Aid: Calling for donations to Afghanistan Emergency Appeal.\nIslamic Relief: Calling for donations to aid Afghan’s on the ground in Afghanistan, and when they come to the UK.\nDoctors Without Borders: The MSF teams are responding to the crisis in Afghanistan, providing medical aid, expertise and life-saving supplies during the escalating crisis. Donate here. Paiwand: Established an Afghan Resettlement Emergency Fund, supporting displaced Afghans in need of assistance.\nRefugee Council: Providing aid, including mental health support, for refugees arriving in the UK.\nThis week, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan announced London will be welcoming 150 families from Afghanistan. To each and every family coming to Tooting - you are so welcome here. Want to help those arriving from Afghanistan? Here is what you can do: Little Village: Urgently in need of warm baby clothes, 9 months - 2 years and 4 - 6 years (specifically pyjamas, snow suits, jumpers and coats). Moses baskets, muslins, small toys and activity packs also needed. Regular collections are being held at Chancery Mews, SW17 7TD and Chillerton Road, SW17 9BE. Please do check their Facebook page for more information. Tooting Community Kitchen: Urgently in need of jogging bottoms and jeans in sizes 26-34 waist, jumpers, t-shirts, coats and trainers in sizes 38-45. Donations can be dropped off Friday 9-1pm and Saturday 3-5pm at Price Close (entrance at 104 Upper Tooting Road). I was also pleased to write to the Leader of Wandsworth Council alongside my colleagues, Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney, and Marshsa De Cordova, MP for Battersea, to call on Wandsworth Council to welcome in refugees from Afghanistan and provide them with a safe place to live. On Monday 6 September, I’ll be live on Riverside Radio diving into why mental health matters and, perhaps most importantly, all your mental health matters. The last 18 months have been incredibly challenging for so many of us and have highlighted the importance of mental health care. We need true parity of esteem between physical and mental health. One step we can take towards reducing any stigma is by being open in our conversations around mental health. Join me for an honest, straight-talking hour, 6-7pm next Monday! And if you have any questions about mental health that you want to ask on air, please email [email protected]. With the Springfield Development well underway, I recently contacted local residents to understand the impact, if any, of ongoing works. I received a great response to the call for residents to share their experiences of the ongoing development at Springfield Village. Following the close of the consultation on 21 August 2021, I have written to David Thomas, Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer of Barratt Developments, to outline the concerns raised with me. See the letter below: It was a pleasure to visit Earlsfield Foodbank recently with local Labour councillor Graeme Henderson. The team here do incredible work in supporting those families most in need across Earlsfield. In a country as well off as ours, the fact we have so many who rely on foodbanks is nothing short of outrageous. We discussed our shared aim to end this. If you’d like to support Earlsfield Foodbank, you can donate here or add to the foodbank collection points at Sainsburys Local (Earlsfield) or Co-op on Garratt Lane. If you need support from the Earlsfield Foodbank and would like to collect some food or arrange a delivery, email or call on 07585064428. Earlsfield Foodbank is open at St Andrew’s Church (on Garratt Lane) Thursdays 9.30am - 12pm. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

SWR is keeping 28 stations open in London through this period, of which 21 have lower passenger usage than Earlsfield. Only big hubs, such as Clapham Junction, Wimbledon and Waterloo, have higher passenger numbers than Earlsfield - this is simply not good enough! Add your name to my open letter calling for an immediate reconsideration of the decision not to run services through Earlsfield and a full explanation of why this decision was taken in the first place. Today, Justin Madders MP and I met with the Retail trade union Usdaw and a group of retail workers in Westminster to talk about how the cost-of-living crisis, rising violence and abuse in stores, and the impact of Christmas holiday trade is affecting the mental health of customers and colleagues.\nFar too many people are facing this Christmas period worried about how to provide for their families. With so many Usdaw members having their mental health impacted as a result of the cost-of-living crisis and increased levels of abuse in the workplace, it is deeply important that we, as politicians, take the time to listen. Recently, I visited the fantastic team at Love Triangle, a brilliant pizza restaurant situated between Balham and Tooting Bec.\nThey’ve been selling pizza to the community for two and a half years now, but things are getting increasingly difficult. The cost-of-living crisis is hitting small businesses hard, with customers having less money to spend to things such as meals out, and the cost of energy and supplies rising astronomically. Will, who owns Love Triangle, told me that despite trying many different creative ways to stay afloat, things are only getting more difficult. Love Triangle have tried different opening times, and an array of different promotions and deals to help combat the challenges, but it is still far from easy, just to keep their head above water. The rising cost of food and energy, coupled with the reduction in disposable income for many is proving a difficult picture to navigate. Speaking to Will, and other business owners in our community, one message stands out. It is crucial to support local businesses where you can, or we risk losing more of our fantastic local businesses from Tooting, and across the country. Watch my visit to Love Triangle here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1599084624847642624?s=20&t=xq-atIy2mtAe0cDqI51dLw |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_parliament_5/content_647.html": "|\nI have written to the Housing Secretary to outline residents concerns about EWS1 forms and cladding.\nA number of local residents have reached out to ask me why my name was not included in a letter signed by 61 out of 650 MPs about the very concerning deportation flight to Jamaica. I wanted to explain how the process works.\nFirstly, let me say that this was an incredibly serious matter, which is why I was pleased to see my colleague, Holly Lynch MP, the Shadow Immigration Minister, send an urgent letter to the Government raising concerns. I added my voice to her letter by writing to Priti Patel myself - requesting that the points Holly Lynch raised were answered urgently. A copy of that letter is below:\nAs a member of the Labour Shadow Cabinet, my role is to intervene in matters related to mental health (because I am the Shadow Minister for Mental Health). Members of the Shadow Cabinet do not speak in debates, sign letters, sign EDMs or intervene in matters which are not related to their role. This rule has been in place for as long as I know, it was the same when Jeremy Corbyn was leader.\nI have noticed that my name was put on a list along with 12 colleagues, suggesting we were the only people not to sign this letter. No member of the Labour Shadow Cabinet signed the letter, indeed, almost three quarters of Labour MPs didn't sign the letter. Does that mean that they don't care? No, of course not. Sometimes they miss the deadline to sign, sometimes they can't sign, sometimes they make representations in different ways. It's very disappointing that some would single out me and 12 other colleagues, suggesting we were the only ones not to sign - simply to fit their political agenda. My background has seen me work in war torn countries, disaster zones and refugee camps helping the world's most marginalised and vulnerable people. I always care deeply about these issues and to suggest otherwise is incorrect. I'll continue to liaise with my colleagues in the Home Affairs team with regards to this, and other important issues. The creation of EWS1 forms and concerns about cladding are issues I know a lot of Tooting residents are facing. Everyone deserves the safety and security of home and I am shocked that so many local residents have found themselves in this situation. Following discussions with local people, I have written to the Financial Conduct Authority, Aviva, the National Housing and Building Council and the Shadow Secretary of State for Housing. You can see these letters below. The consequences of not having adequate personal protective equipment for NHS staff are devastatingBarely a day goes by without pictures online of frontline staff fashioning protection out of clinical waste bags. We need to ensure NHS staff are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients.\nThe challenge that coronavirus poses to our society is unprecedented. It is a scary and worrying time, especially for our NHS. Having worked as a frontline A&E doctor this weekend, in my local hospital, I am increasingly concerned that our health service may buckle under the increased strain that Covid-19 has brought. Our only priority must be to protect lives. Every possible resource we have should be dedicated to that single objective. Crucially, our NHS and healthcare workers on the frontlines must be given whatever resources they need to tackle this and to save lives. It’s disheartening then, that basic resources are in short supply. Full personal protective equipment (PPE) is vital to not only protect frontline staff, but also to limit the spread of infection to our loved ones and to our patients. The Government have known this crisis was coming for weeks, and yet they still have not been fully prepared for it. A country like the UK should not be having to ask manufacturing companies to switch production to provide emergency ventilators, or for NHS workers to have to go without PPE. The first part of my shift this weekend was spent looking for the correct masks and aprons - this is happening to frontline workers ahead of every shift, across the country. While we would all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. The consequences of this for NHS staff are devastating. There’s a feeling amongst many frontline staff that protective equipment is already being rationed. A few weeks ago, the guidance for healthcare staff treating people with confirmed cases of Covid-19 was to wear a full FFP3 mask as well as gloves and a full apron - now, that guidance has changed and we are told to only wear gloves and a basic surgical mask. Barely a day goes by without pictures online of frontline staff fashioning protection out of clinical waste bags. We need full transparency on decisions and changes to guidance, otherwise concerns will only grow. As this virus spreads, and as more and more people are forced into hospital, NHS workers are going to have to start making very difficult choices because of the limited resources they have available. They are going to have to start deciding who can access the most urgent care, including who is given priority for the last available ventilator - they’ll be making impossible choices about whose lives can be saved. We have already seen this happening in Italy, and it is an unimaginable tragedy for medics who are dedicated to saving lives above all else. The best way to help frontline staff who go to work to save lives, is for everyone else to stay home. We will get through this, together. The Government must take responsibility for providing all the resources and equipment the NHS needs, including vital PPE, for communicating the message on social distancing clearly to the public, and for enforcing it robustly. I welcome the new, more stringent measures announced yesterday – however, as Mike Ashley has shown, there’s still room for people to exploit it. As a country, we must do what will save the most lives. That’s true of the Government, people across the country, and medics on the frontline. The faster we get on top of this disease, the faster our society will be able to tackle this virus, and fewer lives will be lost. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can and we will save lives. Sports Direct has shown exactly what not to do during this pandemic. If we’re to beat coronavirus, we have to be selflessThere seems to be a view amongst some under-70s, that coronavirus doesn’t really affect them and they don’t need to worry too much about it. I’ve listened to 69-year-olds tell me that because they themselves are fit and healthy, that it couldn’t possibly happen to them. Having just done a shift as a doctor in A&E over the weekend, I want to take this opportunity to warn people that this virus does not discriminate by age.\nIt was deeply, deeply eye-opening. Previously healthy people in their thirties and forties were seriously ill, some of them on ventilators. Being young does not grant you immunity to this disease. The symptoms of Covid-19 at its worst, are horrific. There can be no room for complacency. Our health service is facing an unprecedented crisis. There is a limited amount of vital equipment, including personal protective equipment for healthcare workers and precious ventilators. Every extra person in hospital requiring treatment means there are fewer resources available for others. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Today I challenged him at Prime Minister's Questions on why he continues to stand idly by while innocent civilians suffer in their hundreds of thousands.\nFollowing the decision to relocate children's cancer services in South East England away from St George's Hospital, I met with the Health Secretary with a cross-party group of MPs to raise our concerns.\nWhen I visited the Pinckney Ward where this care is conducted, I met with Jackson, a former patient there, and his parents, who told me that such a move would be detrimental for parents, children and the hospital alike. I have urged the Secretary to review and reconsider NHS England's decision as soon as possible. Eight years ago today, I was selected as the Tooting Labour candidate for the by-election caused by Sadiq becoming a candidate for Mayor of London.\nIt has been a huge honour and privilege to serve as the representative for the community in which I was born and raised. My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has supported me on this incredible journey. The beginning of Mental Health Awareness week was marked by grim tidings that, for the first time in recorded history, the number of people on an waiting list for mental health treatment has hit 2 million.\nThis is more than the combined population of four major British cities and is a shocking indictment of the Tories' failed record on mental health.\nFollowing a recent spot inspection of HMP Wandsworth by the Chief Inspector of Prisons. an Urgent Notification was issued to the Secretary of State for Justice, meaning that the Chief Inspector has serious and immediate concerns about the day-to-day operation of the prison.\nThe report was damning and laid the blame for the deficiencies squarely at the Government's door, citing a lack of leadership at the very highest levels. I have been raising these issues for years now and my concerns have gone unheeded by this Tory Government, even after a high-profile alleged escape last autumn. Read my Twitter thread on the subject below:\nNew data published by the Environment Agency recently revealed that sewage was pumped in our local rivers, the Graveney and Wandle, for over 700 hours last year. This is equivalent to the entire month of February and demonstrates this Tory Government's complete disregard for our natural environment.\nOnly Labour has a plan to clean up our waterways and hold water companies to account by fines for illegal discharges, blocking bonuses for bosses of companies that violate the rules and holding these bosses personally criminally liable for any violations. History was made last Thursday as my friend and predecessor as MP for Tooting, Sadiq Khan, was re-elected for an unprecedented third term as Mayor of London.\nAfter weeks of hard graft, the result was a decisive victory for Sadiq and Labour with our wonderful capital rejecting the divisive, toxic politics of the Tory candidate. I look forward to continuing to work with Sadiq to make Tooting and our wider city a greener, cleaner, safer and more prosperous place to live.\nAs someone who grew up with and later overcame a stammer, I know all too well the difficulties and challenges that having one can bring. I was very glad and honoured to join Dermot and Alison on This Morning once again to talk about stammers and the wonderful work that Stamma charity do.\nAs someone who has had close friends and family members with eating disorders, I know just how damaging and dangerous they can be. I was proud to join my friend Hope Virgo at the Dump The Scales march to Parliament Square on Saturday with hundreds of campaigners and activists.\nThe Government’s attitude towards eating disorders must fundamentally change. They must listen to campaigners and experts, like Hope, to ensure everyone with an eating disorder gets the care they need. It was brilliant to speak at the Watercooler event in the ExCeL London today, for a discussion on mental health in Government and the NHS.\nRather than railing against a \"sick note\" culture as Rishi Sunak has done recently, we must be encouraging more openness and understanding around mental health. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Wandsworth Council failed from the start to communicate the implementation of LTNs to local residents, and instead of listening and reviewing they have now decided to pull them out because do not want the fuss.\nAs I have said before, I was not consulted and nor were local residents on these changes. They were brought in overnight and pitted neighbour against neighbour, causing fierce rows and division. The Council should be ashamed. When the going got tough, they tried to pass the buck, and now Wandsworth Council is wasting tens of thousands of pounds by scrapping the LTNs entirely. The Conservative Cabinet Member for Transport's position is untenable. Attention will now turn to the TfL Streetspace scheme on Upper Tooting Road, Balham High Road and Tooting High Street. I know that this is a scheme that has its issues and needs reviewing. However, I am confident that TfL want to make it work for our local environment. Contrast TfL's response with that of Wandsworth Council. TfL is taking feedback on board, they are hosting a virtual public meeting next week to gather feedback from local people and I am meeting with a TfL representative next week to discuss the scheme. I will be taking him to meet some of the affected businesses and discussing the issues emergency services have had. TfL evidently want the scheme to work and they deserve credit for trying. I have been clear from the start that I am supportive of schemes which encourage cycling and make our streets safer. We do that by engaging in polite and respectful discussion to bring about changes collectively. I have received lots of correspondence from local residents regarding the changes that have been made to our roads as part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood and the Streetspace schemes on the A24 (Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road). As part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood schemes, many streets have had filters put in to close the road to all vehicles except cycles and some now have turning restrictions. As part of the Streetspace scheme, a number of changes have been made to Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road including the installation of wands to segregate cycle lanes, a number of turning restrictions as well as changes to bus stops.\nThese changes have come about as a result of statutory guidance that the Government issued in May, stating that local authorities were expected to make significant changes to their road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians “as swiftly as possible”. (If you would like to read more about this statutory guidance you can read it in full here.) As a result, TfL made £55m of funding available to the 33 councils in London as part of its “Streetspace for London” programme to urgently create new segregated cycle lanes, extend pavements and close roads to traffic. Wandsworth Council was given £1,923,500 by TfL and used this money to implement the LTNs. TfL has, in consultation with Wandsworth Council but acting separately, implemented changes to the A24. I am supportive of initiatives which reduce car usage, make our streets safer, encourage cycling and create a better local environment. But we must make it work for everyone in Tooting and Balham. I know that lots of local residents have concerns and comments about how the changes have affected our community. The only way to have your voice heard is to feed into the consultations that Wandsworth Council is running and to let TfL know what you think by emailing them. To respond to Wandsworth Council's consultation, click here. To provide feedback to TfL please email: [email protected] It is important to note that I was not consulted prior to the implementation of these changes to our roads and I have no control over the decisions that have been made. As the local MP, I can lobby the Government and the relevant Ministers, but I cannot make decisions for the Conservative Council. I am listening and engaging with local residents on this but I cannot make alterations to these changes. If you have already provided your feedback to Wandsworth Council's consultation and/or emailed TfL, and you want to raise your concerns with other officials, you may also wish to contact Wandsworth Council's Transport spokesperson Councillor John Locker via email at [email protected], or the Government's Minister of State with responsibility for cycling and walking Chris Heaton-Harris MP via email at [email protected] |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

I was also pleased to write to the Leader of Wandsworth Council alongside my colleagues, Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney, and Marshsa De Cordova, MP for Battersea, to call on Wandsworth Council to welcome in refugees from Afghanistan and provide them with a safe place to live. It was a pleasure to visit Earlsfield Foodbank recently with local Labour councillor Graeme Henderson. The team here do incredible work in supporting those families most in need across Earlsfield. In a country as well off as ours, the fact we have so many who rely on foodbanks is nothing short of outrageous. We discussed our shared aim to end this. If you’d like to support Earlsfield Foodbank, you can donate here or add to the foodbank collection points at Sainsburys Local (Earlsfield) or Co-op on Garratt Lane. If you need support from the Earlsfield Foodbank and would like to collect some food or arrange a delivery, email or call on 07585064428. Earlsfield Foodbank is open at St Andrew’s Church (on Garratt Lane) Thursdays 9.30am - 12pm. Tooting Foodival is back! As Transition Tooting’s annual sustainable community festival, this is a wonderful opportunity for local residents to come together to celebrate all things locally grown, cooked, re-created and re-imagined. Led by local volunteers, the event will run from 11- 5pm on Saturday 4th September and is free and open to all! To find out more, see here. Calling all dog lovers! The Friends of Tooting Common are planning to run their annual Fun Dog Show on Saturday 11 September. Last year's virtual event was a huge success – dogs competed across a range of categories, including Best Puppy, Best Rescue, Best Veteran, Best Trick, and – my personal favourite – Dog That Looks Most Like its Owner. An incredible £475 was raised for St George’s Hospital Charity’s Coronavirus Appeal in the process. Barring any unexpected developments, the Friends are looking forward to bringing this year’s event back to its rightful home on Tooting Common. For more information about this wonderful event, including how to get involved, email the Friends of Tooting Common on [email protected]. Today, I spoke with GMB and Royal College of Nursing frontline NHS staff at St George’s Hospital to hear their views on the Government’s latest pay offer. The last 18 months has impacted our beloved NHS immeasurably, and staff have made significant sacrifices in order to save lives. I stand in solidarity with my NHS colleagues. They deserve far more than just claps. They need a proper pay rise. It was a pleasure to, once again, attend the annual Nicholas Stewart Project Community Day on the Henry Prince Estate in Earlsfield. It was a real honour to have been asked to lay flowers in memory of Nicholas, who tragically lost his life seven years ago. The Nicholas Stewart Project was founded in the wake of Nicholas Stewart’s murder and encourages young people to reject negative influences in their life and turn away from knife crime. It is always so inspiring to hear the work of the NSP in supporting young people and be part of our community standing together in hope. Tooting Community Kitchen is a wonderful organisation that serves hot food to those vulnerable in our community. And they need volunteers! If you have a few hours to spare, please consider lending a hand to help out this brilliant local organisation. You can find out more about how to get involved here. There was significant concern locally about Wandsworth Council’s decision to extend Controlled Parking Zone restrictions in areas of Earlsfield and Tooting from 9:30am to 9:30pm each day. Over 1400 local residents completed my consultation on the change. I am pleased that, following our pressure, Wandsworth Council have U-turned on their plans to extend CPZ restrictions. Instead, Event Day only restrictions are planned from 1 October - a far more sensible solution, and something which other councils with stadiums do. I received more than double the number of responses to Wandsworth Council’s rushed, ill-thought out consultation. In fact, over 93% of respondents were not happy with the council’s plans. This should never have happened. But I am pleased the Council finally listened and have U-turned on their attempt to rush through restrictions that would simply act as another cash-grab on hardworking local residents. It is so important that those living with sight loss in our community are supported when using public transport. That is why I recently wrote to South Western Rail and Southern Rail to enquire as to when warning tactile - a vital safety and accessibility tool for those travelling by train - will be installed at Earlsfield and Wandsworth Stations. I am happy to say that Southern Rail have now confirmed that warning tactile has been installed on surface platforms at Wandsworth Common Station. And, although tactile is yet to be installed at Earlsfield Station, South West Railway have stated that Network Rail is working hard to deliver these accessibility improvements. Rest assured I will continue to press for accessibility for local residents living with sight loss. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_archives_03-2021/content_322.html": "|\nToday, Trans Visibility Day, is a day that we celebrate each trans and nonbinary person, whether you choose to be visible or not, and reaffirm our commitment to stand against discrimination, bigotry and all forms of trans exclusionary behaviour.\nWhen wider society discusses trans issues, too often trans people have to deal with vitriolic and discriminatory language which has a profound impact on wellbeing. In October 2020, I organised and chaired a roundtable with leading trans charities to discuss mental health, discrimination, and how we can work together to tackle it. I will always be an ally of the trans community. As MP for Tooting and Shadow Minister for Mental Health, I want to be a voice for everyone - including the LGBTQ+ community - and I will continue to uphold LGBT+ Labour’s 10 pledges, which I signed up to during the 2020 Labour leadership race, outlined below. Many local residents have shared with me their concerns about pickpocketing in the Balham area.\nI have met with Wandsworth Police about this issue, who I know are working hard to ensure that our streets are safe. I have been assured that the police have now increased foot patrols around identified hotspots, in order to identify suspects and to tackle these worrying crimes. Unfortunately, although these crimes are reported on social media, very few of these are reported directly to the police. In order that the police can act on crime, it is vital that any offences are reported as soon as it is possible to do so, either via 999 or 101. This will help the police identify where to direct resources and provide the best opportunity to apprehend those responsible. Stay safe. With the sun shining in Tooting this week, I know it was a relief to many that outdoor sports could resume from Monday 29th March. As a lover of sports myself, I sympathise with everyone who has missed their daily swim, a kickabout with friends, or a game of tennis. Under current Government guidance, outdoor sports facilities and organised outdoor group sports for adults and children can all resume. You can now also play informal sports with a group of six friends or with any number of people up to two households. Here is what has reopened in the local area for your sports fix: Tooting Bec Lido - Open for bookings only and with a number of restrictions in place, including the changing rooms remaining shut for those without a disability. To book a slot at the Lido, please see here. Tooting Common and Furzedown Rec Tennis Courts - Anyone is able to use the tennis courts, provided that they book in advance. You can book using this link. Tooting Bec Athletics Track - The athletics track has reopened and organised outdoor activities for adults and children have resumed on the track. Bookings can be made in advance here. Garratt Park Ball Court - Organised sport will be allowed to take place on the ball court now and groups of six will be able to enjoy the kickabout wall or a group game of basketball. More information about recreational spaces can be found on the Enable Parks website here. For so many, our Tooting Bec Lido is a source of great local pride. During the most recent Government lockdown, I know residents have missed using Tooting Bec Lido and have felt the mental and physical pressure from not being able to swim regularly. I am so pleased that the Lido opened once again to the public from Monday 29th March and would like to thank volunteers from the South London Swimming Club for their efforts in preparation for its opening. As per previous rules, you will need to book to use the lido in advance and booking can be made via the Places Leisure app or website here: If you are going to enjoy a swim in the spring sunshine, please do make sure you follow the guidelines in place to keep everyone safe. Places Leisure have emphasised that there will be no lockers or changing facilities available at this time and that swimmers must stick to width-lane swimming only in order to abide by social distancing guidelines. As the weather gets warmer, I look forward to residents enjoying a safe, outdoor swim. Last week the Balham and Tooting Community Association (BATCA) celebrated its 15th anniversary.\nBATCA is a network of diverse individuals and organisations committed to creating a cohesive, thriving community in Balham and Tooting. Their annual events – the Fun Day on Broadwater Road, the Tooting Broadway Peace Ceremony, and the Community Heroes Awards – are local institutions. BATCA have continued their good works throughout the pandemic, moving events online and acting as a platform for groups to share news and information. BATCA are always looking to welcome new members to help them further the organisation’s aims. Click here to find out more, and to join this wonderful collective. It was a pleasure to join Basildon Councillor Gavin Callaghan as well as local Basildon organisations to talk about mental health this week. Coronavirus has had a profound impact on our mental health support services and it is always great to see a local authority listen to and work with local organisations on the front line providing help where it is most needed. We need to take inspiration from Basildon Council and create an environment at a national level where community organisations and peer support groups work in tandem with local authorities and local health services. A huge thank you to Kim Bailey of Purple Genie Life Coaching, Karen Pullen of Craig Tyler Trust, Jonathan Barrow of Sociability, and Alison Cunningham of The Listening Post, for taking part. The recent vigil on Clapham Common was our chance to come together and grieve the loss of Sarah Everard's life. Our chance to mourn the lives of the women lost to violence. And it was a chance to mourn our own lived experiences. I share the frustrations and disappointment felt over police action taken that day. In light of events at Clapham Common, I know many are concerned about the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, and what this divisive law would mean for the right to protest. I want to be clear: Tonight, I will be voting against this Bill. I believe that the Government has undermined this Bill through draconian measures that impose disproportionate controls on free expression and the right to protest. I believe these measures will have an unfair impact on Black, Asian, and ethnic minority people. I also believe 10 year sentences for crimes against statues – significantly longer than the sentences for crimes which disproportionately impact women – is a worrying priority. Under this Government, rape convictions have fallen to an all-time low, delays in the Crown Courts are at an all-time high, and justice is not being served for thousands of women and girls. This is now the time for the Government to correct their woeful record and commit to putting in place long overdue protections for women. In light of the recent tragic events, many residents have been in touch to share their concerns about the lighting in Tooting and Wandsworth Commons. Indeed, many women feel unable to use the Commons in the evening due to the poor lighting, whereby many of the paths are unlit. All our local residents, including women, should feel safe to access these vital green spaces, which is why I have written to Paul Chadwick, Director Environment and Community Services at Wandsworth Council, and Neil Blackley, Head of Parks at Enable, who manage Wandsworth’s green spaces on the Council’s behalf, calling for action to improve the lighting across both sites as quickly as possible. Please check back here for updates on the Council’s response. Our hearts go out to Sarah Everard's friends and family at this unspeakably difficult time. My statement on this and the #ReclaimTheseStreets vigil here: As we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel, many of our Tooting community are looking forward to spending time with our loved ones once again. However – for a variety of reasons – not all of us have this opportunity.\nOnly one in five children spend time with their grandparents, whilst half a million people aged 65+ go at least five days without seeing or speaking to anyone, this is a fantastic organisation. The Wiser Collective – a local intergenerational community initiative that connects older people with younger families who can benefit from their skills and experience – was formed in 2018. Before the pandemic, The Wiser Collective hosted a variety of local events to combat loneliness across the generations, including the monthly ‘Skill Share Saturdays’, where neighbours of different generations meet to make new local friends, share talents, hobbies, passions, and chat over tea and cake. During the lockdown, the group helped the elderly with shopping deliveries, the collection of prescriptions, and stopped by for doorstep chats.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_crime/content_117.html": "|\nFollowing a recent spot inspection of HMP Wandsworth by the Chief Inspector of Prisons. an Urgent Notification was issued to the Secretary of State for Justice, meaning that the Chief Inspector has serious and immediate concerns about the day-to-day operation of the prison.\nThe report was damning and laid the blame for the deficiencies squarely at the Government's door, citing a lack of leadership at the very highest levels. I have been raising these issues for years now and my concerns have gone unheeded by this Tory Government, even after a high-profile alleged escape last autumn. Read my Twitter thread on the subject below:\nToday, I brought together officials from Wandsworth Council and Wandsworth Police to discuss what we can do to make Tooting Broadway a safer, cleaner and more vibrant place to live and work.\nWith 80 prison officers unavailable on the day Daniel Khalife escaped from Wandsworth Prison - it beggars belief that he was even allowed to work in the kitchen. The Government need to explain themselves. This morning, I've been out and about in Tooting with Wandsworth Police Officers. We've been talking to residents who are concerned about rising street drinking and anti-social behaviour.\nTogether we're now working to increase the number of patrols in the area and ensure that resident's concerns are being addressed. Today, I've been speaking about the very serious concerns I have regarding the prisoner escape from Wandsworth Prison. The Government need to provide answers regarding how this was allowed to happen. With schools crumbling, our prisons falling apart, and the NHS on it's knees, you can't trust the Tories with the NHS. One of the most important jobs I do as your local Member of Parliament is ensuring that our wonderful communities in Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown, Tooting and Wandsworth Common remain safe and welcoming places to live.\nTo this end, I have recently hosted public meetings with local police leadership in Balham and Furzedown, conducted a walkaround with the Borough Superintendent around the local area, and written to the police on behalf of local residents on a wide range of issues. Please do let me know if you have any concerns regarding crime issues in the local area - my door is always open. Today, I asked Wandsworth Police officers to join me on a walk about in Tooting Bec.\nWe spoke to local residents and discussed tackling anti-social behaviour in the area. I know local residents have raised a number of concerns - about incidents targeting children and public safety in the area. I addressed these matters with the police, along with strategies already put in place aimed specifically at reducing worrying incidents of this kind and crime. Over recent months, I have taken the following action on anti-social behaviour and crime on the Heaver Estate:\nToday, Justin Madders MP and I met with the Retail trade union Usdaw and a group of retail workers in Westminster to talk about how the cost-of-living crisis, rising violence and abuse in stores, and the impact of Christmas holiday trade is affecting the mental health of customers and colleagues.\nFar too many people are facing this Christmas period worried about how to provide for their families. With so many Usdaw members having their mental health impacted as a result of the cost-of-living crisis and increased levels of abuse in the workplace, it is deeply important that we, as politicians, take the time to listen. I was deeply concerned to hear pupils at Graveney School in Tooting were being targeted in a recent spate of muggings. I have been in touch with local police leadership to insist on swift action to address this issue. I know that the police are actively working to identify and arrest those responsible.\nEvery child deserves to walk our streets without fear. I am therefore pleased to hear that the local police force are carrying out high visibility patrols and are carrying out regular weapon sweeps around the school. Police are also patrolling the area in unmarked cars to try and identify and arrest the suspects. Pupils at Graveney School have also received assemblies on how to keep safe and how to report a street crime. The local police have also liaised with local CCTV to ensure appropriate coverage. It is vital that all of these issues are reported to the police so they can bring these worrying incidents to an end as quickly as possible. Anyone who has been a victim of a street robbery in this area who is yet to report the incident to the police are advised to do so. Please be assured, I will continue to work with our local police team to resolve this issue as quickly as possible, and I will continue to follow this case as a matter of urgency. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_nhs_3/content_568.html": "|\nToday, I wrote to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, calling on him to listen to concerns expressed by local residents about the proposed closure of Trinity Medical Centre.\nAt a time when waiting times are at record levels, these plans by the NHS and Government will make it harder for local residents to access a local GP. That's why, alongside our local Labour Councillors, I'm campaigning to keep GP services at this site. Please add your name to the petition here Read my letter below: Today, I wrote to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, regarding my growing concerns about the limited powers of the ongoing inquiry into the deaths of up to 2,000 patients in mental health hospitals in Essex Partnership University Trust over the past 20 years.\nThe inquiry has only received the co-operation of less than 30% of named staff, who are essential witnesses in the deaths that are being investigated, leaving families in limbo and further compounding their grief. I have called on the Health Secretary to give the inquiry the full statutory powers required to ensure families get answers and that lessons can be learned for the future. Read my full letter here: The children's cancer centre at St George's Hospital is at risk of closure.\nThis is deeply concerning. The St George's children's cancer centre has more than 25 years of expertise delivering the highest quality care for patients, which will be lost if the services are moved away from Tooting. Under these plans, patients will be forced to travel to a site in central London. Parents have made it very clear that it is easier, cheaper, safer, and more comfortable to take their children to St George's. There is also a huge added cost. The plans to relocate services will cost an estimated £90 million, more than three times the cost to redevelop facilities at St George's Hospital. Today, I've launched a petition calling on the Government and NHS England to keep the children’s cancer service at St George's Hospital. Add your name and share the petition with friends and family here Patients experiencing a mental health crisis often find themselves stuck in A&E.\nThe Health Secretary should be ashamed. Today, I asked the Health Secretary when will he finally get his act together and back Labour's plans to recruit thousands of additional staff to bring down waiting times? See my question here Our exclusive data reveals that children in a mental health crisis spent more than 900,000 hours in A&E in England, last year. The total delays across England, in the past year alone, equate to 103 years of waiting time. This is a huge rise, up four-fold in the last decade.\nThe figures, made public through Freedom of Information requests, show the staggering number of hours that children have spent in a mental health crisis in Emergency Departments. With nowhere to turn, children with a mental illness are left to deteriorate – at which time A&E is the only place left for them to go. Emergency Departments are incredibly unsuitable settings for children in crisis, yet we’re witnessing increasingly younger children having to present to A&E in desperation. The next Labour Government will prioritise a truly preventative plan for mental health services and will put patient care first. We will ensure access to mental health professionals in every school and put an open access hub in every community, in addition to guaranteeing mental health treatment within a month for all who need it, by recruiting 8,500 new mental health staff to treat a million additional patients a year by Labour’s first term in office., funded by closing tax loopholes. Read the full article here An undercover joint investigation by Sky News and The Independent has raised serious concerns about the safety of patients at inpatient settings ran by the Huntercombe Group.\nThis is the third investigation into abuse in secure inpatient mental health settings, in four weeks. The system is broken. I previously wrote to Therese Coffey, the previous Health Secretary, to raise my concerns about other similar investigations highlighting allegations of abuse, by Channel 4 Dispatches and BBC Panorama, but did not receive a response. The Government has been silent over these allegations and for weeks there wasn’t even a functioning Mental Health Minister. Patients, and their families, deserve answers. They deserve dignity, respect and access to high quality treatment, which is why I have called for a rapid review into mental health services and the way patients are treated in inpatient settings. See my statement in Parliament here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1587420289662492672?s=20&t=Gj2YhL3GB3Os4nSrRoGK7Q Parents arriving in A&E with ashen faces holding their children, whose bodies are skeletal and covered in cuts. Families are on suicide watch. Frontline NHS workers are at breaking point. This is the reality of Tory Britain in 2022.\nOur latest research has shown that more than a million patients referred to mental health services were turned away over the last 12 months, whilst the cost of mental illness to the British economy is £117 billion a year. This is the direct result of 12 years of Conservative mismanagement of our economy and public services. We need a growing economy to pay for modern, preventative sustainable healthcare, but we can only do this with a Labour Government that will put our public services back on track. The next Labour Government will transform our mental health services: new staff, new services, faster treatment, and prevention as our watchword. Better mental health for all. Read my latest piece in the Daily Mirror here. https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1579113927438663681?s=20&t=FTZA6bYs6BUjLJ-vVYAmzg\nToday, the BBC revealed that in 2018 4,500 people in mental health crisis were unlawfully held in police custody due to a lack of mental health beds.\nI spoke about this matter on BBC News earlier today. There is no question that the system must change immediately. This is nothing short of a scandal. Rest assured I will be pressing the Government on this issue. Today, I spoke with GMB and Royal College of Nursing frontline NHS staff at St George’s Hospital to hear their views on the Government’s latest pay offer. The last 18 months has impacted our beloved NHS immeasurably, and staff have made significant sacrifices in order to save lives. I stand in solidarity with my NHS colleagues.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_travel/content_219.html": "|\nData from National Rail and the Rail Delivery Group has revealed a shocking rise in the number of late trains at Balham, Earlsfield, Tooting and Wandsworth Common stations. Trains in the morning evening peaks, to and from Central London, have all seen a worsening of their \"on-time percentage\" in the last six months compared to the same period of 2023. The full breakdown of delays at each station is below. It is shocking to see that, not only are trains late at some stations late half the time, but that there has been a steady decline from an already-unacceptable level of lateness last year. Particularly concerning are the figures at Tooting station, where over half of services were late despite there being only two services per hour on that line.\nSome of the worst performing services include: 8:05 from Balham (8:07 from Wandsworth Common) to Victoria - 88% late (Southern) 18:12 from Waterloo to Earlsfield - 81% late (South Western) 8:21 from Balham to Victoria - 79% late (Southern) 8:40 from Balham (8:42 from Wandsworth Common) to Victoria - 76% late (Southern) 8:13 from Tooting to London Blackfriars - 70% late (Thameslink) Local commuters deserve better than the shoddy service they are currently receiving from Southern, South Western and Thameslink. I look forward to the Government's plans to bring our local rail services back into public control, so that our trains are always run with the interests of the people who use them at heart. As an A&E doctor and mother, I am incredibly concerned about the impact of poor air quality in our local area. I see many people attending hospital with breathing difficulties directly linked to toxic air, which contributes to thousands of premature deaths every year. It is my belief that it is the right thing to do to adopt enforceable targets and bring in preventative measures to tackle air pollution. As such, I am supportive of the ULEZ expansion coming to Tooting.\nHowever, I also acknowledge its impact on people’s budgets. I called on Sadiq to expand the scrappage scheme support – which he delivered on without Government support despite money being provided for similar schemes in other cities. Furthermore, I am pleased that he has further expanded the scheme, and information about the scrappage scheme can be found here. Wandsworth Council have also announced support through the Wandsworth Sustainable Travel Fund, details of which can be found here. The expansion of ULEZ was also mandated by the Government as part of the TfL bailout deal during the height of the pandemic – so they wanted the expansion to go ahead as well. Today, I have written to the Managing Director of the Southern Region of Network Rail calling for an investigation looking into improving accessibility and step-free access at Wandsworth Common Station.\nCurrently, there is step free access on Platform 1, but those wishing to travel on Platform 2 must cross an elevated footbridge, which is not accessible for wheelchair users, parents with young children, and the elderly. I have called for a feasibility study to be conducted, given the signifcant proportion of the local community that falls around the station. Read my full letter here: After cutting services through Earlsfield station for commuters since the pandemic, South Western Railway have announced that no services will run through Earlsfield from 19 December until 2 January, ostensibly due to industrial action. SWR is keeping 28 stations open in London through this period, of which 21 have lower passenger usage than Earlsfield. Only big hubs, such as Clapham Junction, Wimbledon and Waterloo, have higher passenger numbers than Earlsfield - this is simply not good enough! Add your name to my open letter calling for an immediate reconsideration of the decision not to run services through Earlsfield and a full explanation of why this decision was taken in the first place. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

For others, it will be a day of celebration. For most people, I suspect they will simply hope we can now move on from talking about Brexit at the expense of everything else. As someone who campaigned with all my heart to stay in the EU, and as the first person on Labour’s front bench to publicly call for a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal, I am desperately sad to see us leaving our friends and allies in Europe. But we are leaving. The disastrous result of the General Election has settled that. This is no longer an argument about Leave or Remain, it’s about what kind of future we want for our country and for our children. That’s where the new fight begins. Boris Johnson wants to pretend he’s now “Got Brexit Done”, and we no longer need to worry about the details. He wants us to simply trust him to sort it all out. Well, I don’t trust him. Neither should you. He talks about “Global Britain” whilst turning his back on vulnerable child refugees. He talks about “Taking Back Control” while reducing parliament’s ability to scrutinise his decisions. He talks about attracting “Global Talent” to the UK while creating huge distress and uncertainty for EU citizens, many of whom have been here for years and who have made their lives in this country. The fight for our internationalist values starts now. It will be long, and it will be difficult, because Boris Johnson has a large majority – but that’s why it’s so important. When it feels like hope is lost, that’s when those of us who believe in progressive values and internationalism need to stand up and fight. If we don’t, no-one else is going to do it for us. We need to stand up and fight for our hard-won workers’ rights. We need to stand up and fight for our environmental protections. Most importantly, we need to stand up and fight for the rights of EU citizens living in this country. They are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues, our family. I work side-by-side with many of them in the NHS, when I work shifts as a doctor in my local A&E department. Under the draconian new immigration laws being bandied around by this government, my own Polish mother might not have been able to move to this country and make a life for herself. Although the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback. That’s one of the main reasons I am running to become the next Deputy Leader. We have huge organisational strength through our membership, through our links with the trade unions and through our MPs and councillors embedded in their local communities. Now is the time to deploy those strengths to maximum effect, to hold the Government to account and ensure that we fight back against every attempt to undercut our rights and freedoms at work, every attempt to weaken our environmental safeguards, every attempt to inject privatisation into our National Health Service. The slogan “Get Brexit Done” might have helped win the election for Boris Johnson, but for those of us who stand against his destructive vision for the future of our country, this fight isn’t done. It’s just getting started. My responses to the questions provided by the Labour Campaign for Free Movement 1. Defend and extend free movement: opposing any reduction in the freedoms of UK and EU citizens to live, work, and access social security in each others’ countries, and any immigration system based on incomes, migrants’ utility to business, and number caps or targets.I am the very embodiment of the benefits free movement has brought – my mother is Polish and was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Under the draconian new immigration policies being discussed by this Tory government, she might never have been able to do that. Protecting and extending free movement is at the very heart of my internationalist Labour principles. I believe our country is stronger and better because of free movement. When I work shifts as an A&E doctor in my local hospital, I work with NHS staff from across Europe and it breaks my heart to see many of them feeling unwanted or undervalued because of Brexit. As Deputy Leader, I pledge to do everything in my power to promote the core Labour values of internationalism and solidarity across borders, because I believe human life has the same value no matter where someone comes from. That means defending and extending free movement, and it means fighting to protect the human rights of migrants from this hostile Tory government. 2. Close every detention centreHolding migrants in detention centres, often in substandard conditions, is incredibly cruel and degrading. These are often vulnerable people, fleeing from a variety of horrific circumstances such as war, trafficking and poverty. They have the right to be treated with dignity, as human beings, as we would want ourselves or our family to be treated in such horrendous circumstances. When working abroad as a humanitarian doctor, I’ve seen first-hand some of the terrible conditions people are forced to endure in detention centres and it horrified me. We must fight back against the hostile environment the Tories have created for migrants – the Labour Party has always stood for international solidarity and openness to the world – we need a Labour government to bring those principles back into the core of our approach to immigration. I would want to listen to expert opinion on how to do this in a responsible way, but I certainly would want to close as many detention centres as possible and make sure we have an overall approach to immigration that means a concept as cruel as detention centres are not required in the first place. 3. Unconditional rights to family reunionYes, I fully support this. The unconditional right to family reunion is a fundamental element of treating migrants as human beings with dignity and equal value, rather than the Tory approach of seeing migrants as a problem to be managed. When I’ve worked as a humanitarian doctor in conflict zones across the world, it was always horrendous to see so many families ripped apart or prevented from seeing each other again. When I visited Palestine on a humanitarian mission, I saw sick children alone in hospital because the permit system meant their parents weren’t allowed to visit them. I immediately began working on ways to resolve this. It’s not enough to just talk about this – we need to be working every day to deliver a Labour government so we can fix these kinds of injustices. That’s what I’d do as Deputy Leader. 4. End “no recourse to public funds” policiesI support ending such policies, yes. This is another case of a Tory government treating migrants not as human beings with human dignity and equal value, but instead as a problem to be managed through cruelty. I want to deliver a Labour government with internationalism at its core, which would allow us to change our entire approach to migration, and begin seeing human life as equally valuable and equally dignified no matter where that person was born or where they’ve come from. 5. Oppose all Hostile Environment measures, use of landlords and public service providers as border guards, and restrictions on migrants’ NHS accessThe Tory Hostile Environment approach to immigration is a stain on the soul of their party, and they should be ashamed of it. Tragedies such as the Windrush scandal are a horrendous demonstration of where this approach leads, and I worry a similar scandal could occur with EU citizens who’ve made their lives in this country. I want a Labour government so we can end the Hostile Environment immediately and start treating migrants with the human dignity and respect they deserve. 6. Equal voting rights for all UK residents I am certainly interested in all ideas for how to revitalise our democracy and increase the level of engagement with our political process. Indeed, prior to the General Election in 2019, I publicly called for EU citizens to get the right to vote. Our Labour values of openness and internationalism must be at the core of everything we do. 7. Please share your thoughts on these wider issues that our supporters also feel strongly about:Even after Brexit, the UK government looks set to participate in Frontex (the European border agency) and its “Fortress Europe” policies. Will you challenge these policies? I certainly think the EU has often failed dismally to strike the right balance between border security and solidarity with people fleeing from war, poverty and the effects of global climate change. I am a proud pro-European, but that doesn’t mean my view of the EU is uncritical and I’ve never been afraid to say so. My values of international solidarity and openness don’t stop at the borders of Europe – they extend across the whole world. Human life always has equal value, no matter where that person comes from. Will you support an amnesty for undocumented migrants resident in the UK? We should always treat people with compassion and dignity, and we must place those values at the heart of everything we do when it comes to immigration. People in this country without documentation are often asylum seekers fleeing from horrific conditions and I want to see them treated with the human dignity they deserve. I would want to listen in more detail to expert opinion and feedback on the specific question of whether an amnesty is the right approach, but the principles of human dignity and compassion must always guide everything we do. Anything else you’d like Labour members, supporters and affiliates to know about what your leadership/deputy leadership would mean for migrants and migration policy? I am the living, breathing proof that free movement is a wonderful benefit to our country. My Polish mother was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Working on the frontlines of the NHS as an A&E doctor, I work alongside colleagues from across Europe and the rest of the world, and they are a credit to our country. It makes me proud to be British. But years of Tory government has created a literal Hostile Environment for migrants in this country. The drawbridge is being pulled up, and the rights of a whole generation of people to travel freely and live, love and work across Europe is being taken away. That is a tragedy, but it also means those of us who are proud of our outward-looking, progressive, internationalist values must fight even harder to protect and extend them. The fight starts now, and as your Deputy Leader (or even if I’m not!), I promise I will always be there fighting alongside you for those values with everything I’ve got. Nothing prepares you for seeing a colleague in tears over antisemitism.\nLabour deputy leadership hopeful, Rosena Allin-Khan, speaks about her heritage informing her fight against Jew-hate, and her commitment to mending ties with the community. “There is nothing that prepares you for seeing a colleague in tears,” says Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, one of five hopefuls standing for Labour’s deputy-leadership. Committed to winning back the trust of the community – and standing up for MPs such as Luciana Berger and Ruth Smeeth who are no longer in Westminster – Allin-Khan, currently the MP for Tooting, seems sincere in her battle against hate. She grew up as the daughter of immigrants – her father hailing from Pakistan, her mother from Poland, herself the descendent of resistance fighters killed by the Nazis. But she’s aware that hate and prejudice won’t be solved over a chat with tea and biscuits. Before her career in politics, she was a humanitarian doctor, working on the ground with Palestinians, while her mother’s family from Poland were killed by the Nazis. It’s these experiences which allow her to reconcile speaking out against Israeli policies, while committing herself to the fight against antisemitism, drawing praise from the community in carefully balancing these issues. The first of her pledges is to meet with the Jewish Labour Movement, should she get elected. It would be “essential to the restructuring” of relations, and “how we rebuild trust.” She is also keen on an education program, saying “people use antisemitic tropes and they don’t even realise what they’re doing and they repeatedly do so.” While indicating she would speak with “any group that was looking to acknowledge there was a problem, and work towards coming up with a solution to fix it” she adds that she is the “only deputy leader candidate who hasn’t nominated a leader”. She’s willing to “work with whomever the leader is” on rebuilding trust. Calling the demise in relations between the community and the party “sad” and “terrible”, she opens up about “people I know that I am very close to, who have been really brave and speaking out antisemitism in the party.” “They have received torrents of abuse and nothing’s been done about it”. “Any leader seeing something like this unfolding needs to be all over it”, she says. But was Corbyn’s team responsible? She says they were not the “cause of the antisemitic problem in Labour, I think they didn’t deal with the problem, well enough”. Yet, she’s under no illusions as to the extent of the problem, saying it must be tackled “from a grassroots membership level first and take it all the way to MPs themselves”. “The complaints process wasn’t dealt with properly”, Allin-Khan says, adding: “As people began to show antisemitic abuse .. the more they saw it wasn’t being dealt with the more they felt able to do so.” On mending ties, she wants an “independent” process for tackling complaints with “outstanding cases to be dealt with within a particular time”, and “automatic expulsion” for antisemitism, though she wouldn’t be drawn on whether she would intervene, like Tom Watson, who she is trying to succeed. Her drive to fight antisemitism is in part inspired by her heritage. “My mum’s Polish and I lost lots of family during the war. They were not Jewish, but they fought alongside Jewish friends and my great uncle died during that time, my grandma was pregnant in the Warsaw ghetto with my uncle.” “That whole experience is a very real part of my history, and it is a shared history that I understand deeply and I’m very saddened about with the Jewish community. She was embroiled in a dispute with the Israeli Deputy Ambassador in 2016, following a radio discussion about Palestinians’ access to medical aid. After revealing the two had met in person to discuss the issue, she was accused of being “bought by Zionists”, facing significant online abuse. Her response drew praise, with Dave Rich from the Community Security Trust saying it “illustrated the difference between pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist”. She says: “I am a doctor, and have been a humanitarian doctor for my whole professional life.” “It is possible, and fair, to identify areas where there could be improvement to somebody’s life and health and not to conflate that with a whole antisemitic issue. “ I will always be proud to stand up for people’s basic human rights, and I’m also very aware of my history and my shared history with the Jewish community. I feel it’s perfectly possible to manage the two.” Many former Labour voters feel unrepresented. That has to change\nThe Labour party has shaped who I am today. It has helped provide me with the opportunity to train as a doctor and has given me and my family life chances we otherwise would not have had. I want everyone to experience these opportunities. It deeply saddens me to see a lost generation for whom the door closed on their dreams and ambitions on 12 December. Growing up poor and cold while my single mum worked three jobs to support me and my brother taught me the reality of day-to-day life for many people in the UK. My mother always told me, even through our darkest moments, that there were people worse off than us – and I have never forgotten that. The Labour party changed my life. Despite failing my A-levels due to difficult circumstances at home, I was finally able to go to Cambridge University at the age of 24 to study medicine because of reforms the Labour party made in government. People did not know what we stood for – the Tories had three simple words Working on the A&E frontline has shown me the best and worst of society. A&E is a microcosm of real life. I hold parents as they say goodbye to their children who have died through senseless violence. I talk to nurses who tell me they can’t afford to feed their children and are having to use foodbanks. I treat older people who just want the dignity of accessing social care in their homes. But I also see hope. The UK is full of people pushing through barriers to serve their communities. Our NHS provided me with the skills to give back to society – it spurred me on to work as a humanitarian aid doctor in disaster zones across the world, something that I have been proud to continue during my time as an MP. I am proud of the internationalist views of the Labour party – we must never turn our backs on the world’s most vulnerable. On the border of Myanmar, it was shocking to listen to the stories of Rohingya refugees speaking of having to make the impossible decision of whether to save their child who was thrown alive on to a burning fire, or escape with their surviving child. We must not turn our backs on those who are living through the absolute worst of human atrocities. In Palestine, I was heartbroken to meet children who were undergoing cancer treatment utterly alone because their parents were unable to obtain permits to accompany them. Humanity should have no borders. Only with a Labour government can the UK have a truly outward, internationalist approach, ensuring that we are there for people in their times of greatest need. In order to be in government, we must get our house in order, and as deputy leader this would be my priority. We cannot look to champion equality abroad, while turning a blind eye to racism in our party. This needs to end. As deputy leader, my first major meeting would be with the Jewish Labour Movement – they are our official Jewish affiliate; we must listen. I want JLM to be at the forefront of this fight against antisemitism, especially when it comes to education at the grassroots level. I will separate the complaints process from HQ, making it independent and asking the new team to immediately review all cases, acting swiftly and expelling antisemites. There must also be a strict time limit by which cases need to be resolved. I commit to adopt every recommendation proposed by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, without hesitation. Enough is enough. Only then will we be able to start rebuilding trust. Communities across the country have turned away from Labour, thinking that we do not represent them. We must listen with humility to people across our country and across our movement to assess why we’ve lost the last four elections, and how we can win people back. From speaking to people in seats that we lost in December, I have been told that trust in us has gone. People did not know what we stood for – there appeared to be new policies announced every day and voters did not trust that we had a plan for how to deliver them. The Tories had three simple words. To win, we need to be able to communicate our messages, not just internally, but with the public. I will focus on grassroots campaigners being armed with the information and messaging that they need to talk to voters on the doorstep. I will equip candidates and their local Labour parties with the resources that they so desperately need. I will introduce reduced membership rates to our emergency service workers so they can have a say within Labour on the NHS at this vital time. We need to build our movement into one people can vote for. A party people can trust. Under this government, which has chosen to block child refugees from reunification with their families, I worry for the future of our children. I worry for the future of tolerance. I worry for the future of compassion. We have a wonderful society, which has welcomed so many people from across the world, but the hostile environment this government is imposing on our country is restricting the ability to hope. Hope for a brighter future. Hope for a tolerant society. The door may have closed on 12 December for a generation’s hopes and ambitions, but with the right leadership team in place in the Labour party, it will not be closed for good. We need to win the next general election, and we must start rebuilding trust ahead of local elections in May. As deputy leader, it will be my responsibility to rebuild trust, not just with the grassroots of our party, but with voters. Together, we can take Labour forward. As a doctor, I know that before a patient can be diagnosed, it is vital to first take a detailed history and examine them thoroughly. That’s the challenge we now face in revitalising the Labour Party and taking it off life-support. This is also why, when I decided to run for Deputy Leader, the first thing I did was contact every single Labour councillor I could find an email address for, as well as every single prospective parliamentary candidate who stood for Labour in the last General Election and lost.\nI’m not a leader-in-waiting, I’ll be a campaigner-in-chief, and you can be too. I’ve been travelling across the country, to seats where we won, seats where we lost, and even seats we’ve never held, to talk to activists and members on the ground - because I want to hear from the grassroots directly to truly understand what went wrong, what went right, and what we must do better. Using that detailed feedback, I am now publishing a manifesto called Grassroots Revival – a campaigning action plan that I will immediately start implementing if I’m elected as the next Labour Deputy Leader. **Download Grassroots revival**It starts with changes we must make to our internal organisation. We must overhaul the complaints process. I’ll remove the team from HQ and make it independent, put a time limit on reviewing complaints, and ensure those involved with each case are kept informed of its progress. I also want to start unlocking Labour’s membership talent. It’s not all about delivering leaflets and knocking on doors - we have social media experts, journalists, policy gurus, videographers and many other talents in our ranks. Let’s start making the most of that! For new members, attending meetings can feel daunting - we need to make them more enjoyable and accessible for all. We can ensure party democracy and due process are followed, while making meetings a more enjoyable experience. For example, some CLPs still spend up to an hour arguing about the minutes of the last meeting - which turns off new members. We need to streamline the procedural matters and get more political debate into our local meetings. We can be sociable too! I want to help local groups organise regional social events that break even, instead of looking to make a profit. Quiz nights, continuing the great work of Stand Up For Labour, pub nights, coffee mornings - let’s bring our movement together and celebrate all that we have to offer. Let’s look at how to grow and diversify our movement even further. I’ll offer reduced membership rates to emergency service workers, to encourage them to join the Party and have their say over how we fight to save our NHS. I would support BAME members to hold elected office - I will produce literature to be made available to BAME officers to distribute to new members, “how to be a councillor” meetings will be offered in each borough - not as an afterthought - and I will work with BAME officers to listen to what resources they need. We must start upgrading our technology and infrastructure - we’re running campaigns in 2020 with two colour printers from the 80s and 90s. I’d ensure every CLP has access to a full colour RISO printer (or similar). We can also boost data driven testing of our methods. Comparisons of leaflets, direct mails, e-newsletters, social media and canvassing will allow us to be so much more targeted and effective. A significant amount of dedicated time went into creating software and apps to revolutionise our digital campaigning in recent years but the party didn’t have the resources to fully roll them out - the doorknocking app, dialogue and chatter could have really helped us but members didn’t know how to use them or didn’t know they existed. Contact Creator regularly broke down during the General Election and the user interface hasn’t changed for over a decade. This must all change. Let’s also have a digital team at HQ who goes to every target seat, showing them how to make the most of Facebook ads, emails, Twitter, creating graphics and videos. Let’s also start looking at how to produce more personalised and localised content. The party produces some great literature and supplies it to key seats, but the vast majority of it is national with no localisation. Some leaflets and letters just didn’t arrive in 2019 for some seats, which left them in the dark, and adequate support was not available to deal with it, because staff were already overstretched. We must be better prepared. The manifesto came out weeks after the print deadlines for seats to order their leaflets and letters. I will ensure the necessary information is available to candidates in good time. The Labour Party must do better at supporting our candidates – I’ll make sure they all get adequate briefings and lines for use in their own leaflets, letters, emails and press releases. Candidates and their teams are superheroes, but they aren’t invincible, and campaigns can take their toll both financially, physically and mentally - This is why I’ll set up a dedicated team to offer mental health support and advice during difficult times. Too often, local organisers and staff have contracts that end at 10pm on polling day - this culture needs to change. Organisers put in endless hours to help our campaigns succeed and to dump them when polls close is just simply wrong. I’ll ensure no staff contracts end on Election Day, giving them vital time to find new employment. I also want to establish a system of sharing best practice amongst CLPs and boroughs. Campaigns shouldn’t have borders - we don’t have to operate solely within our constituency or ward boundaries. We need proper twinning with key seats. There’s no sugar-coating it – the Labour Party is in a critical condition right now. But with the right treatment, the right approach and the right support from the leadership team, we can get it back to fighting fitness. With the local elections coming up in May, there’s no time to waste. Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan MP for Tooting There is absolutely no place for antisemitism within the Labour Party, and I will put all my energy into rebuilding trust with the Jewish community.\nMy first major meeting will be with Jewish Labour Movement - they are Labour's official Jewish affiliate and we must trust them. I’ll separate the complaints process from head office, making it truly independent - to begin the process of rebuilding the trust. Once that new team is in place, I'll immediately get them to review all cases, acting swiftly and expelling antisemites. For future, I'll put a time limit on when cases need to be resolved by (for now and in future). The investigation from the Equality and Human Rights Commission is not an optional piece of diversity training, it's an embarrassment that this issue has gone so far without real action. The report they produce and the actions they want Labour to take are not optional - they are legally binding. I promise to fully adopt, without hesitation - every single one of their proposed steps. We are an open party, who welcome everyone from every background, no longer can we kick these issues into the long grass and offer the bare minimum in support and process. As Deputy Leader no form of racism will be accepted in our party. Front-line workers in the NHS have felt ignored by the Government - and now the Tories look set to give up the NHS for profit.\nThis Christmas I’ve been proud to support my hard-working colleagues on the front line by doing shifts in my local A&E. We’re all touched by the NHS at some point in our lives. For over 70 years it has been our lifeline, the glue holding our society together, often forgotten about, but there in our times of greatest need. The NHS is there to bring life, to offer care and dignity when we leave the world, and to support our loved ones when tragedy hits. But front-line workers in the NHS have felt ignored and that the Government does not recognise the day-to-day pressures they face. It didn’t start with claims on the side of a bus during the European referendum campaign in 2016 but, since then, using the NHS for political gain certainly picked up pace. Throughout the election, Boris Johnson repeatedly denied that the NHS would be up for sale. Just two weeks after the election, it was revealed that NHS cancer care and children’s treatments are up for grabs in a stealth Tory sell-off. Cardiology, gynaecology, paediatrics and oncology are among the services being offered to companies. As an A&E doctor, when someone is rushed into A&E having a heart attack, we work to patch someone up before sending them off to heart specialists. How will it feel knowing that those services are now being provided by a private company? Where is the trust? Allowing hospital trusts to outsource treatment to private companies could lead to a postcode lottery of health care, further widening the health divide. We need to be bringing the UK together, not tearing it apart, turning communities against each other. On top of this, discussions are taking place with tech giants on how to make money from patient data. While we must do everything possible to look for cures and ensure a better patient journey, we need to know how our own data is being used. The last decade has shown us that we must exercise caution with tech giants. The Government does not have the money or expertise needed to create an anonymised patient database, which is exactly why Amazon and Microsoft have been approached. Trust in our NHS cannot be destroyed because without trust, everything else could be up for grabs. I was stunned and heartbroken after the election result and bereft at what it would mean for our NHS. Our hospitals, treatments and dedicated staff cannot simply be sold off to the highest bidder. These aren’t the principles our NHS was founded and built on and I will continue fighting, standing side by side with our hospital workers, to protect our NHS from those who wish to destroy it. Shadow minister launches deputy leadership bid with a unifying pitch\nLabour must move past the factionalism and “ideological purity” that has alienated voters across the country, the shadow minister Rosena Allin-Khan has said as she set out her pitch to become the party’s deputy leader. The A&E doctor who has served on Jeremy Corbyn’s frontbench is the latest party figure to officially throw their hat in the ring for the deputy leadership, alongside the shadow cabinet members Angela Rayner and Richard Burgon. Allin-Khan, 43, said that for too long the party had been weighted down by infighting and described her politics as being inspired by public service, which she said was not based within soft- or hard-left identities. “I’ve got the campaigning experience but also the life experience to help rebuild the party again,” said Allin-Khan, who has been a shadow minister for sport since 2016 and still works hospital shifts. “We need to move beyond the last few years where nasty internal debates about faction and ideological purity have too often alienated people outside our movement. “Public service isn’t about identifying who sits on which side of the Labour party. I am Labour because of my values, my life experiences and the fact that I’m a doctor. We must communicate how we are going to change people’s lives in a way they can understand.” Her pitch as a unifying figure across Labour’s political spectrum would involve trying to make inroads in Scotland and Wales and other heartland areas that went Conservative, by holding town hall events, as well as meetings in synagogues, churches, mosques and temples. She said to rebuild the party’s base Labour must listen far more to councillors, who she says are the experts in their communities. The Tooting MP, who has a Pakistani father and Polish mother, dismissed concerns that Labour must have a leadership team that is drawn from northern constituencies. “I grew up poor with a single mum working three jobs to support me and my brother. That taught me the reality of day to day life for people across this country,” she said. “There’s no regional distinction to hunger. Loss of hope lives across the UK. London is used to mean ‘metropolitan elite’ but we also have some of the highest levels of deprivation. “Growing up in poverty. Understanding what it was like to get a job really young to supplement household income, to being careful in supermarkets with food, to feel there was no hope for someone from your background – that experience gives me a fire in my stomach to fight for all people around the country that have to go through that.” The mother of two studied medicine at Cambridge through Labour-initiated scholarships after initially failing her A-levels during a period of difficult family circumstances. After qualifying as a doctor she has worked as an A&E specialist in London hospitals and as a humanitarian aid doctor in the Middle East, Africa and Asia for a decade. She won the Tooting seat in a 2016 by-election after Sadiq Khan quit to run as mayor of London. In parliament she has highlighted the difficulty Palestinian children in Gaza have in accessing healthcare in Israeli hospitals because their parents are not allowed to accompany them through a restrictive permit system. As part of her sports brief she has fought for the return of safe standing at football clubs, as well as being an advocate for the women’s game both in parliament and as a player herself. She was also a vociferous campaigner for the People’s Vote campaign on a second referendum but said she accepted the country was leaving the EU, even though she had fought so hard against it because she did not believe the deal would work for her constituents. As for rejoining the bloc, she said that would have to be looked at if it should ever come up but was not a priority. Despite Corbyn being rejected at the election, she pointed out positive changes he made for the party, including a more welcoming immigration policy, and said she was proud of his strong anti-austerity message and the party’s continued support for the NHS. But on the defeat, she said: “We threw everything out there and nothing had time to land effectively. In comparison the Tories used three words and a few repeated soundbites which ultimately proved effective.” She said she would be happy to work with any leadership candidate should they be elected. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Our art, food and history are what makes our community great.\nThat's why I'm so proud that Wandsworth has been selected as London's Borough of Culture in 2025. Thanks to everyone who has worked to make this happen.\nThere is a disused council site on Swaffield Road which I want to see converted into a pocket park for local families. I was overwhelmed by the support that this plan has received. The petition has now been submitted to the council and will be reviewed.\nWandsworth Labour are freezing council tax for another year to help families through the cost-of-living crisis.\nAt the same time, we're improving services and building a better Wandsworth. Wandsworth is bursting with creativity and culture. Our art, food and history are what makes our community such a great place to live.\nToday, Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney, and Marsha de Cordova, MP for Battersea, and I have written to Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, to support Wandsworth’s bid to be London Borough of Culture 2025.\nToday, I brought together officials from Wandsworth Council and Wandsworth Police to discuss what we can do to make Tooting Broadway a safer, cleaner and more vibrant place to live and work.\nI am very pleased to see that Labour-run Wandsworth Council will be introducing a landlord licensing pilot scheme in Tooting and Furzedown. Private renters make up a significant proportion of local residents and a key part of our campaign in the local elections last year was to ensure that they get a fair deal.\nThis scheme will strengthen protections and rights for private tenants and I look forward to its successful trial in Tooting before a wider roll-out across the borough.\nTonight, I invited Wandsworth Police to join our community to discuss how they’re working with Wandsworth Council to tackle violence against women and girls.\nMaking our community safe is a key priority for me. My door is always open. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch.\nIt is incredible to see the work being done in Wandsworth Town Hall by the new Labour council. Recently, it was announced that free school meals would be available during school holidays for eligible children, while parents of pupils on free school meals will also have access to uniform vouchers to help cover this expense. With the Tory cost-of-living crisis, this is a hugely beneficial scheme for hard-working families across the borough.\nThis is the difference that Labour makes in power and I look forward to continued close cooperation with the new council administration in order to make our communities even better places to live. For further details, see here. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Stacey Dooley: Back On The Psych Ward follows the dedicated mental health professionals working on the frontline at Springfield, as well as a number of brave patients who came forward to share their experiences of life at Springfield during lockdown. I am always exceptionally proud of everyone working in mental health across the country. As both the Shadow Minister for Mental Health and Member of Parliament for Tooting, I remain committed to ensuring that local mental health services receive the funding they deserve. Today Muslims across the UK and around the world mark the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan. As a proud Muslim, the period of reflection, prayer, and fasting is incredibly important to our Muslim community. Traditionally, Ramadan is a time for gathering and sharing Iftar with family and friends. Although, like last year, we are unable to come together and celebrate as we normally would, the spirit of Ramadan remains. To every Muslim nurse and doctor who have saved countless lives throughout this pandemic, to every volunteer and community leader in our Mosques and community centres who continue to support those most vulnerable, and to every Muslim in Tooting and across the country, I wish you all Ramadan Mubarak. With the easing of Government restrictions, The Share Community are seeking volunteer befrienders to help local residents with learning disabilities get back out into the community. Share is a registered charity with a site in Tooting providing support to adults with learning disabilities and/or autism. Their befriending project matches people with similar interests to go for walks, bike rides, or coffee. Befriending is incredibly rewarding, providing companionship to those who are socially isolated and regular contact with a friendly face outside their usual circle. I am told that reliability and being a good listener are the only prerequisites to be a volunteer befriender. If this sounds like you, Share would love to hear from you! Click here to find out more. Here in South West London, over half a million residents have received their first vaccine dose so far! Although this is a pivotal milestone, the percentage of vaccinated persons still remains lower among all ethnic minority groups compared with the White British population. I recognise that many within the BAME community may be unfamiliar with vaccines and feel unsure. However, I can assure you that the vaccines have all been rigorously tested and declared safe by doctors around the world. I continue to urge everyone eligible to book their vaccine appointment as soon as possible. The sooner the vaccine is rolled out, the sooner we can begin to rebuild. Together we can do this. Tooting Women’s Institute is looking for new members of all ages and backgrounds to join them in their monthly activities and events. Meeting on the second Wednesday of each month, this wonderful organisation provides a place for members to learn new skills, meet others in the community, discuss topical issues, and share interests. Previous sessions have involved everything from career mentoring and coding, to craftivism and calligraphy, while a variety of smaller groups meet to engage in more niche interests, including a supper club, which visits a new restaurant in Tooting each month, a book club, and a craft club, to name a few. Click here for more information. To deny that structural racism exists, denies the experiences of millions of people who live and experience it each and every day. This report was an opportunity to seriously engage with the reality of inequality and institutional racism in the UK. Instead we have a divisive polemic, which cherry picks statistics and whitewashes the structural inequalities which allow racism and discrimination to persist. It's gaslighting on a systemic scale. The Government must urgently explain how they came to publish content which glorifies the slave trade and immediately disassociate themselves from these remarks. The next Labour Government will introduce a Race Equality Act to end structural inequalities. Today, Trans Visibility Day, is a day that we celebrate each trans and nonbinary person, whether you choose to be visible or not, and reaffirm our commitment to stand against discrimination, bigotry and all forms of trans exclusionary behaviour.\nWhen wider society discusses trans issues, too often trans people have to deal with vitriolic and discriminatory language which has a profound impact on wellbeing. In October 2020, I organised and chaired a roundtable with leading trans charities to discuss mental health, discrimination, and how we can work together to tackle it. I will always be an ally of the trans community. As MP for Tooting and Shadow Minister for Mental Health, I want to be a voice for everyone - including the LGBTQ+ community - and I will continue to uphold LGBT+ Labour’s 10 pledges, which I signed up to during the 2020 Labour leadership race, outlined below. Many local residents have shared with me their concerns about pickpocketing in the Balham area.\nI have met with Wandsworth Police about this issue, who I know are working hard to ensure that our streets are safe. I have been assured that the police have now increased foot patrols around identified hotspots, in order to identify suspects and to tackle these worrying crimes. Unfortunately, although these crimes are reported on social media, very few of these are reported directly to the police. In order that the police can act on crime, it is vital that any offences are reported as soon as it is possible to do so, either via 999 or 101. This will help the police identify where to direct resources and provide the best opportunity to apprehend those responsible. Stay safe. With the sun shining in Tooting this week, I know it was a relief to many that outdoor sports could resume from Monday 29th March. As a lover of sports myself, I sympathise with everyone who has missed their daily swim, a kickabout with friends, or a game of tennis. Under current Government guidance, outdoor sports facilities and organised outdoor group sports for adults and children can all resume. You can now also play informal sports with a group of six friends or with any number of people up to two households. Here is what has reopened in the local area for your sports fix: Tooting Bec Lido - Open for bookings only and with a number of restrictions in place, including the changing rooms remaining shut for those without a disability. To book a slot at the Lido, please see here. Tooting Common and Furzedown Rec Tennis Courts - Anyone is able to use the tennis courts, provided that they book in advance. You can book using this link. Tooting Bec Athletics Track - The athletics track has reopened and organised outdoor activities for adults and children have resumed on the track. Bookings can be made in advance here. Garratt Park Ball Court - Organised sport will be allowed to take place on the ball court now and groups of six will be able to enjoy the kickabout wall or a group game of basketball. More information about recreational spaces can be found on the Enable Parks website here. For so many, our Tooting Bec Lido is a source of great local pride. During the most recent Government lockdown, I know residents have missed using Tooting Bec Lido and have felt the mental and physical pressure from not being able to swim regularly. I am so pleased that the Lido opened once again to the public from Monday 29th March and would like to thank volunteers from the South London Swimming Club for their efforts in preparation for its opening. As per previous rules, you will need to book to use the lido in advance and booking can be made via the Places Leisure app or website here: If you are going to enjoy a swim in the spring sunshine, please do make sure you follow the guidelines in place to keep everyone safe. Places Leisure have emphasised that there will be no lockers or changing facilities available at this time and that swimmers must stick to width-lane swimming only in order to abide by social distancing guidelines. As the weather gets warmer, I look forward to residents enjoying a safe, outdoor swim. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

It is a stain on our society. It must be combatted and those who perpetrate it must face the full force of the law.\nMany people in Gaza were already living in appalling conditions before this latest conflict. If the Israeli bombardment continues and aid doesn't get through, I really fear for the consequences. Today, I appeared on Peston to reiterate calls for an immediate ceasefire in Israel and Gaza. Every effort needs to be made to work towards a peaceful solution. See my clip here:\nToday in Parliament, I challenged the Foreign Secretary to call on his Israeli counterpart to demand an immediate ceasefire to the escalating crisis in Gaza. While rightly calling out Hamas’ horrific attacks, we also have a duty to speak on behalf of those innocent Palestinians who are being collectively punished, starved and bombed in their own homes by Israeli forces. See my question here:\nTonight, I held a peace vigil at Tooting Broadway station to bring our community together to remember all those who have died in Israel and Gaza recently. I want to pay a huge thanks to the representatives from our local religious groups who said a prayer for peace.\nDuring some of our darkest hours, Tooting reminds us that there is always hope.\nPalestinians must not pay the collective price for the acts of terror carried out by Hamas. World leaders have a duty to ensure Israel doesn’t deliberately indiscriminately target civilians.\nIn Parliament today, I sought assurances from the Prime Minister regarding Gaza: - Incendiary weapons won't be used in civilian areas. - Hospitals/medics won't be targeted. - Food, water and electricity immediately restored. - No occupation of Gaza.\nThe Hamas attacks on Israel in recent days were horrific. The brutal murder of innocent civilians in their own homes, killing innocent festivalgoers, raping women and taking children hostage must be condemned in the strongest possible terms - nothing can justify it. Those who planned and carried out the attacks must face justice.\nWe have not been close to peace in the region, but there is no doubt that these attacks, and the response from Israel, will set us back many years. This will be devastating for the many innocent people in Israel and Palestine who just want peace. I fear it will be innocent men, women and children from Gaza who are going to pay the price for Hamas' attacks. I have been very critical of Netanyahu throughout the years, and I really do worry about what the next few days and weeks will bring. The cutting off of water, gas and electricity supplies breaches a whole host of internationally recognised laws. Refusing to allow aid in and stopping food supplies will hit the most vulnerable the hardest. Countless innocent lives will be lost and the international community must work on a resolution that de-escalates the conflict as soon as possible. The discourse I've seen on Twitter has appalled me in recent days, which is why I have decided to post this on my website, instead of there. I have worked as a humanitarian doctor in the region, spanning a period of over a decade. I've always sought the recognition of a sovereign Palestinian state, and my views have not changed, I believe it is the only way to achieve peace in the region. But I will also call out barbaric attacks when they occur. The rape and murder of innocent civilians should be called out and I'm sure the vast majority of people will share my disgust. I've always been a proud supporter of Palestinian rights, which is why it was great to sit down and catch-up with the Palestinian Ambassador to the UK, Husam Zumot, in Parliament today.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_previous_5/content_521.html": "|\nProtecting our natural world is hugely important. I was proud to have worked with the Mayor of London on his pledge to plant more trees across our city. This culminated in the Mayor and I planting his 500,000th tree right here at a local Tooting school.\nMore broadly, Labour is vowing to establish three new National Forests in England, whilst planting millions of trees and creating new woodlands. These trees will provide vital habitats for our fantastic wildlife and help fight the climate emergency. In my work as a humanitarian doctor, I have worked across the globe with the victims of war and human suffering. Ensuring that every person, wherever they are, has the safety and security of a roof over their heads and food in their stomach is of paramount importance to me.\nBefore the dissolution of Parliament, I sat on the International Development Committee, where we led an inquiry into the progress on the UN's second Sustainable Development Goal, namely to end world hunger. More broadly, I am pleased to see the Labour manifesto committing to restoring international aid to 0.7% of GNI as soon as the fiscal situation allows. As an NHS doctor myself, I understand how important speedy access to care is. With NHS waiting lists longer than ever, it comes as no surprise that many people are finding it difficult to reach the services they depend on.\nWith as many as 10 million people in the UK having been diagnosed with arthritis, it is of paramount importance that those with the condition can reach the support they need. Especially considering that arthritis and other MSK conditions can have a significant effect on a person’s quality of life. That is why I am pleased to see Labour pledging to cut NHS waiting times with 40,000 more appointments every week. As an animal lover and pet owner myself - I want the very best for all living creatures. I have long believed the UK should lead the world with high animal welfare standards. I was pleased to see the Labour Party pledge to ban exports of foie gras early on in the election campaign.\nI know that many people are concerned specifically about cruelty to our greatest companions; cats, dogs and other pets. Rest assured, I will always stand against cruelty. At this election, I am standing on a manifesto to improve animal welfare. Labour has pledged to ban trail hunting and the import of hunting trophies. We will end the scourge of puppy smuggling and farming, along with the use of snare traps. Most of all, we will partner with scientists, industry, and civil society as we work towards the phasing out of animal testing. I am wishing a happy Eid to those who are celebrating today. Hoping those celebrating enjoy a peaceful and blessed holiday.\nThe dedication and togetherness shown is so uplifting and makes our community the special place that it is. The Labour Party has finally announced our manifesto for change - the platform we'll be standing on to fix the mess made by 14 years of Tory failure.\nRead the manifesto online here. It was a fantastic experience to be at the Friends of Tooting Common Dog Show. The hosts, participants and everyone behind the scenes were brilliant. Judging Most Handsome Dog was incredibly hard, but many congratulations to Loki and his owner in what was a very close competition. The election campaign is in full swing - and there is lots of support on the doorstep for Labour.\nVoters are sick and tired of this shameful Tory Government. We need to get them out so that Labour can get on with the job of fixing their mess. This week, we've been campaigning locally in Balham, Earlsfield and Tooting. We've even been helping out our Labour colleagues out in Hitchin. The Tories have showcased their true colours once again recently; attacking people with mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety as belonging to \"sick note culture\" and meriting exclusion from the welfare system.\nRather than attacking people with mental illnesses, the Tories should have some humility and contrition, and look at the impact of their own shameful policies.

Understandably, this is very unpleasant for those who live near this area and I have therefore written to Paul Chadwick, Director of Environment and Community Services at Wandsworth Council, as well as notifying the local councillors of the issue in the hope that this can be rectified as soon as possible. Please be assured that I will keep local resident updated of the progress on this. Furzedown Police are currently appealing for witnesses, so if you have any information about this fly-tip, please do email [email protected] or message them via Twitter. As you will know, a South African variant of Covid-19 has arrived in the UK. This new Covid variant has now been detected in CR4 (Merton). Residents in CR4 are no different to us in neighbouring Tooting (SW16 and SW17). We use the same shops, the same hospital, and the same parks, so if it’s there, it could very easily be here. This will be the same across all affected areas. As a matter of urgency, the Government needs to launch widespread testing in neighbouring postcodes. This is the only way to see how widespread these new variants are. I have written to the Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock MP, the Director of Public Health at Wandsworth Council, Shannon Katiyo, and the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Council, Paul Martin, to ask about plans to launch testing in neighbouring postcodes. While I press for action on this, we need to make sure we’re all doing everything we can to keep ourselves and each other safe. It’s absolutely vital that we minimise our social contact to prevent the spread of this new variant within our community. Please think twice before leaving home, and when you do leave, please continue to adhere to social distancing. Together, we will get through this. Since the Labour Party tabled a vote on the cladding scandal, I wanted to update you on the outcome of the Opposition Day Debate and the subsequent vote that took place on Monday 1 February 2021. While I'm pleased to let residents know that the Labour Party motion proposed passed 263 to 0, disappointingly, however, the Government didn't bother to turn up. It is worth noting that, while the motion has been passed, Opposition Day motions are not legally binding and there is no guarantee that the Government will take the proposals into consideration. In recent times, however, it has generally been convention for the Government to review policies that have been successful at the end of an Opposition Day Debate. My thoughts remain with everyone in the local area who is affected by this cladding scandal. I know how difficult this is for you, and please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this. Earlier this week I met with local small business owners to hear the issues affecting them.\nFrom the insufficient support available to businesses that are non-direct ratepayers, to a lack of flexibility from landlords regarding rental payments, it is clear that the challenges Tooting small business owners are experiencing are considerable. Their resilience in the face of adversity is a credit to our community. The concerns shared will inform my actions to ensure that small businesses remain the beating heart of Tooting. Please check back here for updates, and keep an eye on my Facebook and Twitter pages for announcements of further events. In light of the upcoming Fire Safety Bill, I would to thank every resident who has written to me with their concerns on this and for continuing to keep me updated on the cladding issues affecting their property. I recognise what an exceptionally difficult time this is and appreciate how much anxiety the cladding proposals are causing to many leaseholders.\nOn more than fifteen occasions, Ministers promised that leaseholders would not be landed with the costs of remedial works. Yet, people are still being put at risk, trapped in flammable buildings for a third lockdown, with leaseholders placed in an impossible position and promises broken. It is evident that the Government’s handling of the cladding crisis has lacked any sense of grip or urgency. For this reason, the Labour Party have tabled an Opposition Day Debate on cladding for Monday, which will subsequently bring forward a vote that will call for leaseholders to be protected from the costs of remediating their blocks with dangerous cladding. The party will also be tabling a number of amendments to the Fire Safety Bill that will aim to protect leaseholders from unfair costs through the power of the law. I am aware that many residents have been in touch to request that I support the McPartland and Smith amendment, which provides welcome clarity on the specific costs that would be prevented from being passed on to leaseholders. Labour has sought to go further on this. As currently drafted, the McPartland and Smith amendment would not have covered blocks like Grenfell - where flammable cladding has been added at some stage following the building of the block. It only applies to defects in the original design of buildings. The Labour Party’s amendment would ensure that the cost of fire safety problems from refurbishment jobs, like the cladding on Grenfell Tower, cannot be passed on to leaseholders. Labour’s amendments also include new clauses so that the Bill protects leaseholders from the day it comes into law, instead of an unknown date in the future. I would like to thank my colleagues in the Labour Party, Sarah Jones MP, Nick Thomas-Symonds MP, Thangam Debbonaire MP and Mike Amesbury MP for their hard work and commitment to addressing this large injustice on a national scale. If any residents have any further queries on this issue, please do not hesitate to get in touch to discuss this further. In the meantime, I hope this post assures you of the steps myself and the Labour Party are taking to protect tenants and leaseholders during this cladding crisis. I recently raised residents' concerns about damage to our beloved Tooting Common with Mr Neil Blackley, Head of Parks at Enable Leisure and Culture and have since received a response on this important issue I am told comprehensive is in plan to return the Common to its pre-pandemic state, while keeping as much as possible open for public use. Initial works will target the worst affected areas, and will see the soil replenished and grass seeds planted. While these works are scheduled to commence in the spring, it will be a number of years before this much-loved part of Tooting is restored.\nWandsworth Council is currently consulting local residents on its ‘Local Plan’ document on developments for the borough across the next 15 years. This plan identifies Tooting as a potential area for regeneration, where proposals include new sustainable transport, improvements to public realm, and contributions to the health and wellbeing of residents.\n3. 56 Tooting High Street on the west corner of the Garratt Lane and Tooting High Street junction: The Council are considering using this site for a development of sustainable architecture and urban design, as well as considering the planting of street trees on Garratt Lane.\nFurther information on these proposals can be found here. Whilst I hold no authority over Wandsworth Council, it is important to me that residents, businesses and organisations have their say on these proposals. If you would like to submit comments on the ‘Pre-Publication’ Draft Local Plan, you must do so before 11.59pm on Monday 1 March 2021 using the following link: https://www.wandsworth.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy/local-plan/draft-local-plan-pre-publication/\nA number of local residents have raised their concerns about people rough sleeping during this exceptionally cold spell, and of course amidst the pandemic.\nLike many, I believe the Government’s delay in housing rough sleepers during this third lockdown was completely irresponsible and lacked basic human compassion. In London alone, the Office for National Statistics estimates that 1 in 30 people have coronavirus, and we know that sleeping rough - without adequate shelter or access to basic hygiene facilities - leaves people more exposed to the virus. Today, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick MP announced that councils will collectively receive an additional £10 million in funding to house those currently sleeping rough, as well as an extension to the ban on bailiff evictions. Whilst I welcome this much-needed funding, this money will not help get everyone off the streets, and the ban on bailiffs fails to sufficiently protect renters. Many residents have contacted me with concerns for those who are sleeping rough outside Tooting Broadway tube station, Buzz Bingo and Sainsbury's. I want to reassure residents that I have recently written to the Head of Wandsworth Neighbourhood Policing Team to ensure these people are supported in the best way possible. Beyond the coronavirus emergency, there can be no return to business as usual. It is paramount that Ministers end rough sleeping for good. In a country as well-off as ours, we need to ensure that everyone has the right to a safe place to live. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Meeting on the second Wednesday of each month, this wonderful organisation provides a place for members to learn new skills, meet others in the community, discuss topical issues, and share interests. Previous sessions have involved everything from career mentoring and coding, to craftivism and calligraphy, while a variety of smaller groups meet to engage in more niche interests, including a supper club, which visits a new restaurant in Tooting each month, a book club, and a craft club, to name a few. Click here for more information. Many local residents have shared with me their concerns about pickpocketing in the Balham area.\nI have met with Wandsworth Police about this issue, who I know are working hard to ensure that our streets are safe. I have been assured that the police have now increased foot patrols around identified hotspots, in order to identify suspects and to tackle these worrying crimes. Unfortunately, although these crimes are reported on social media, very few of these are reported directly to the police. In order that the police can act on crime, it is vital that any offences are reported as soon as it is possible to do so, either via 999 or 101. This will help the police identify where to direct resources and provide the best opportunity to apprehend those responsible. Stay safe. For so many, our Tooting Bec Lido is a source of great local pride. During the most recent Government lockdown, I know residents have missed using Tooting Bec Lido and have felt the mental and physical pressure from not being able to swim regularly. I am so pleased that the Lido opened once again to the public from Monday 29th March and would like to thank volunteers from the South London Swimming Club for their efforts in preparation for its opening. As per previous rules, you will need to book to use the lido in advance and booking can be made via the Places Leisure app or website here: If you are going to enjoy a swim in the spring sunshine, please do make sure you follow the guidelines in place to keep everyone safe. Places Leisure have emphasised that there will be no lockers or changing facilities available at this time and that swimmers must stick to width-lane swimming only in order to abide by social distancing guidelines. As the weather gets warmer, I look forward to residents enjoying a safe, outdoor swim. Last week the Balham and Tooting Community Association (BATCA) celebrated its 15th anniversary.\nBATCA is a network of diverse individuals and organisations committed to creating a cohesive, thriving community in Balham and Tooting. Their annual events – the Fun Day on Broadwater Road, the Tooting Broadway Peace Ceremony, and the Community Heroes Awards – are local institutions. BATCA have continued their good works throughout the pandemic, moving events online and acting as a platform for groups to share news and information. BATCA are always looking to welcome new members to help them further the organisation’s aims. Click here to find out more, and to join this wonderful collective. In light of the recent tragic events, many residents have been in touch to share their concerns about the lighting in Tooting and Wandsworth Commons. Indeed, many women feel unable to use the Commons in the evening due to the poor lighting, whereby many of the paths are unlit. All our local residents, including women, should feel safe to access these vital green spaces, which is why I have written to Paul Chadwick, Director Environment and Community Services at Wandsworth Council, and Neil Blackley, Head of Parks at Enable, who manage Wandsworth’s green spaces on the Council’s behalf, calling for action to improve the lighting across both sites as quickly as possible. Please check back here for updates on the Council’s response. Our hearts go out to Sarah Everard's friends and family at this unspeakably difficult time. My statement on this and the #ReclaimTheseStreets vigil here: As we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel, many of our Tooting community are looking forward to spending time with our loved ones once again. However – for a variety of reasons – not all of us have this opportunity.\nOnly one in five children spend time with their grandparents, whilst half a million people aged 65+ go at least five days without seeing or speaking to anyone, this is a fantastic organisation. The Wiser Collective – a local intergenerational community initiative that connects older people with younger families who can benefit from their skills and experience – was formed in 2018. Before the pandemic, The Wiser Collective hosted a variety of local events to combat loneliness across the generations, including the monthly ‘Skill Share Saturdays’, where neighbours of different generations meet to make new local friends, share talents, hobbies, passions, and chat over tea and cake. During the lockdown, the group helped the elderly with shopping deliveries, the collection of prescriptions, and stopped by for doorstep chats. To find out more and get involved with this wonderful organisation, visit their website: thewisercollective.com/ For those unaware, latest Government guidance states that those with a serious mental health illness are now eligible to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.\nSerious mental health illnesses include those such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. However, this list is not exhaustive and anyone who is severely affected by a mental health problem is encouraged to contact their GP if they have not yet been invited to receive the vaccine. If you are a carer for a person with a severe mental illness, you could also be eligible. Click here for more information on eligibility or contact your GP. If you are eligible, to book or manage an existing vaccination appointment, click here. The inability to afford everyday hygiene and personal grooming essentials is sadly a growing problem. With people and families hit hard by the ongoing pandemic, hygiene poverty is a bigger problem than ever before - many are struggling to afford essential products like soap, shampoo, toothpaste, period products, and hand sanitiser. Here in Wandsworth, a new hygiene bank has opened to tackle this growing problem and alleviate the issue of hygiene poverty in our local area. As a volunteer-run project, all the money raised by the hygiene bank goes directly towards providing much-needed essentials for local residents, with all donated products distributed to local frontline organisations in the borough. To find out more about the Hygiene Bank Wandsworth, or to make a donation, see here. The issue of litter in our local area is not a new problem. Indeed, back in 2019 I provided Wandsworth Council with a number of solutions to this issue, which were not acknowledged or enacted upon. I have recently been inundated with complaints from residents who have received Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs). As you may know, FPNs cannot be appealed, and I am concerned about the lack of oversight and accountability this procedure affords. It is clear from the litter on our streets that fining residents for putting out their household waste is not defeating the issue of fly-tipping. Fly-tipping fines need to be issued to the right people, for the right reasons – to deter genuine incidences of fly-tipping. Instead of being a deterrent, I am concerned that these fly-tipping fines are being misused as a Council cash-grab – making money from hardworking residents under the guise of keeping our streets clean. I have written to Paul Martin, Chief Executive at Wandsworth Council, and Paul Chadwick, Director of Environment and Community Services, to ask what action they will take to address these concerns. Keep an eye out for updates here. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_campaigns_2/content_321.html": "|\nFormer Labour MEP SEB DANCE explains why he is supporting Rosena Allin-Khan in the Labour deputy leadership race.\nBritain has left the EU. As a former Labour Member of the European Parliament, as a Remainer, and as a proud pro-European, that’s still not an easy thing for me to say – but it’s the reality. There is no longer a campaign to remain. That doesn’t mean that Boris Johnson’s famous lie of “get Brexit done” has suddenly come true. The ongoing negotiations with the EU will continue to define our country’s future for years to come. Perhaps one day the fight to join the EU will come. How soon that time comes depends on what we do next. Pro-Europeans must now fight for a close relationship between the UK and our friends in the EU and ongoing rights for UK citizens. The Labour Party must play a crucial role in that fight. That’s why I’m supporting Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan to become the next deputy leader of Labour. Rosena was elected as the MP for Tooting the week before the EU referendum in 2016. Despite holding a shadow frontbench position, she refused to compromise on her principles or on the promises she’d made to her community, so she broke the whip and voted against triggering Article 50. Considering the shambles that followed Theresa May’s early triggering of Article 50, this has been conclusively demonstrated as the right decision. Rosena was also the first shadow frontbench minister to come out publicly and call for a People’s Vote. This was an incredibly brave thing to do, at a time when Labour MPs and shadow ministers were being pressured not to speak out against the leadership’s position on Brexit. At a time when the leadership of Labour needed a firm push in the right direction, Rosena was the one brave enough to stand up and do it. There are some voices in the Labour Party, who’ll try to convince you that Brexit was the only reason for Labour’s failure at the last general election – that backing a public vote cost us seats in the so-called ‘Red Wall’. But this analysis is deeply misleading, and is simply not supported by the facts. Yes, of course Brexit was a divisive issue, for Labour as much as for anyone else. The reality however, is that the overwhelming majority of Labour voters, members and supporters voted Remain, wanted us to stay in the EU and wanted a public vote on Brexit. That fact is as true of Labour voters in Redcar, Grimsby or Wakefield as it is of Labour voters in Oxford, Islington or Bristol – Labour’s share of the vote went down in 98% of all seats. Labour’s position on Brexit was fatally undermined not because supporting a public vote was the wrong position for our voters, but because the leadership of the party took so long to get to that position. We sat in the middle of the road on the biggest issue of our time and neither side trusted us. We lost trust among all our communities. Rosena knows this – she won’t stop standing up for our internationalist values. I joined the Labour Party because I believe in internationalism and solidarity across borders. So does Rosena. That’s why she’s worked across the world in conflict and disaster zones as a humanitarian doctor, and why she still does shifts in her local hospital as an A&E doctor alongside her work as an MP. So if you are like me – a proud pro-European, an internationalist and a Labour supporter – and if you want someone as deputy leader who’ll stand up for those values, and who’ll fight for our country to maintain the closest possible relationship with the EU, protecting our workers’ rights, our environmental protections, our food standards, our NHS, and most importantly the rights of EU citizens living in the UK – then vote for Doctor Rosena. Together, let’s take Labour forward. Rosena Allin-Khan MP: \"I want to inspire Asians to own their identity”A CANDIDATE in the race for Labour’s deputy leadership has admitted the party “lost trust with voters” following its crushing defeat in the December general election.\nTooting MP Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is up against fellow MPs Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler, Ian Murray and Angela Rayner in the race, triggered by Labour’s huge loss last year. Suffering one of its worst results since 1935, Labour lost dozens of seats which they had held for decades, including a number of constituencies in the Midlands and northern England, which historically tended to support the party. The loss was down to a lack of trust, Allin- Khan believes. “People, quite frankly, didn’t trust us to govern,” the MP told Eastern Eye. “We had a manifesto which I believe was full of good things, but voters didn’t trust us to deliver it.” The party’s stance on Brexit was an additional factor – “we didn’t seem decisive enough” – and the level of anti-Semitism in the party and the way it was subsequently handled “closed a lot of doors”. “I’ve been up and down the country talking to individuals, wondering why Labour lost, and I’ve been told by activists that people didn’t think we had our own house in order,” she said. Today, she said, the most common concern of voters is the NHS, the level of safety on the streets and housing. “We need to show that the hopes and dreams that people have for themselves are the ones that we (Labour) have for them,” the mother-of-two said. Next month’s contest will also see the unveiling of a new Labour leader, after Jeremy Corbyn announced he would be stepping down following the general election last year. Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey are in the running to lead the opposition party. Allin-Khan, however, will not be voicing her support for any of the candidates as she believes the party needs to “heal all divisions (and) unite” after it fared so badly in the election. “When I’m working in A&E and I see kids coming in with lung infections because of mouldy housing or I see kids who have to go to food banks (…) they don’t care if Labour is left, right or centre,” she explained. “So, the most important thing to move forward is to unite and I can show that by not nominating someone for leader.” On her role in the deputy leadership race, Allin-Khan said she was determined to use it as an opportunity to help “ethnic minorities own their identity and be proud of it”. “That is what I want people to feel I embody when they look at me,” she explained. “For me, being in this race, if that is the one thing I get out of this…that other young British Asians can look at me and say, ‘if she can do it, I can do it too’, then that is my job done.” Allin-Khan admitted she had faced prejudice due to her mixed Pakistani-Polish heritage and has received criticism that she “isn’t fully Asian”. In response to the comments, the MP is keen to highlight her mixed heritage does not make her Asian background any less “important, valuable or special.” “I identify with being an Asian woman, in the same way that I am proud to be Polish,” she said. “Some people in the Asian community wonder how Asian I feel because I’m mixed race, but I’m proud to wear my sari and embrace my heritage.” Some have even suggested that she change her forename to Rosie and take her husband’s surname to downplay her ethnicity. However, Allin-Khan is proud of her roots and is keen to emphasise it. “I went double barrelled because I didn’t want to lose the Asian part of my surname and that for me, is very important,” she said. “I am proud to say that this is who I am – a Polish and Pakistani, proudly British Muslim woman who loves the Labour party.” Born and brought up in Tooting in a working-class household, Allin-Khan described her young life as “tough”. Her mother worked three jobs to keep the family financially afloat, and Allin-Khan recalled there only being one heater in the house that they had to move from room to room to keep themselves warm. Allin-Khan failed her A-Levels, citing the difficulties at home as a factor. Despite the setbacks, she still had a desire to study medicine. However, she was told “it wasn’t for girls like (her)”, as it was financially prohibitive, and she didn’t come from the “right background”. Allin-Khan, who still works part-time as a doctor, knew she had to keep fighting if she wanted to pursue her dream career. “I think my upbringing led me to believe I had no choice but to sink or swim,” she said. After resitting her A-Levels, the then-24-year-old accepted a place to study medicine at Lucy Cavendish College, University of Cambridge, which was funded by scholarships. “I really believe that where you start off in life doesn’t need to dictate where you end up,” the A&E doctor said. Although she credited her own resilience for her success, Allin-Khan believes the Labour government gave her an opportunity to fulfil her potential when things looked bleak. “The Labour government turned my life around,” the 43-year-old claimed. “I redid my A-Levels, did a degree and went to Cambridge to study medicine and I’m afraid those possibilities aren’t going to be there for a new generation of kids under this Tory government.” Allin-Khan, the MP for Tooting since 2016, admitted the biggest challenge of her involvement in politics is racism. She often faces abuse on social media and is mostly targeted for her Muslim beliefs. “When I look at the order in which my abuse comes, it is Muslim first, then my Asian heritage comes second,” she admitted. “My gender is third. Without a doubt, the amount of abuse is a huge challenge.” It is a concern that young BAME women may be deterred from entering politics due to the abuse other politicians have faced, she said. In response, Allin-Khan regularly engages with schools and community groups to encourage young people to “keep going and not to lose faith”. There is also a level of racism in the House of Commons, she said, highlighting that she is the first Muslim person ever to make it on to the deputy leadership ballot. Although it is encouraging to see more women and ethnic minority politicians in parliament, Allin-Khan believes there is “still a ceiling on what we can achieve”. Recently, Allin-Khan approached a “prominent BAME politician” to ask them to consider nominating her in the deputy leadership contest. However, the politician responded: “I’m only in the game of backing winners and you don’t look like you’ve got any chance of winning.” “We can’t have that attitude towards people, and I’ve said in my grassroots revival plan that our BAME communities can’t be an afterthought when it comes to supporting people to hold public office,” she said. “We need to be seeing ethnic minorities at the top of our party, on the front benches. “I’ve smashed that ceiling, but I plan to throw the ladder down and say people ‘come up behind, you can do this.’ But I know it isn’t easy.” My pledge to rebuild confidence in LabourI never imagined that one day I’d become an MP, or now a candidate to become the next Deputy Leader of the Labour Party. Growing up, I was regularly told that ‘girls like me’ from ‘backgrounds like mine’ wouldn’t amount to anything. I never planned to go into politics - I always wanted to be a doctor. The last Labour Government gave me that chance, allowing me to study Medicine aged 24 after failing my A-Levels the first time around because of pressures at home. This shaped the person that I am today and has given me the fire in my belly to ensure that no other child feels that there is a ceiling on what they can achieve.\nWhen I work shifts as an A&E doctor at my local hospital, I see first-hand the issues facing our communities today. I treat young people who come to A&E after self-harming, I treat those who haven’t been able to access mental health services for years, and yes, I treat victims of violent crime. To see a young person breathe their last breath is a pain that never leaves you. Teenage boys, once full of bravado on the street, with the words “Born to die” tattooed on their chests, victims of horrific stab wounds, laying there crying out for their mothers. The sound of a parent grieving for their child is universal - it can’t be forgotten. As the MP for Tooting, I have worked incredibly closely with community groups and young people to try and tackle the rise of violent crime in our society. I’ve organised summits with representatives from local community organisations, charities, the police, the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Council and the Deputy Mayor for Policing, to start tackling this problem from a community perspective. Working with affected communities is paramount in order to resolve these critical issues once and for all. As a keen boxer myself, I have promoted the work of local boxing clubs to tackle violent crime. Boxing is far more than just a sport - for many, it’s family. Clubs offer an opportunity for local young ¬people to make friends, engage with sport and receive mentorship. So much of gang culture and violence is about a sense of belonging. We have a duty to show young people that, if you can gain respect in the ring, you do not have to get respect from violence on the street. One of the reasons I decided to run to become the next Deputy Leader of the Labour Party is because it would give me the platform to give a voice to the voiceless. Whether it’s children losing their lives to senseless violence, older people being unable to access safe and decent social care, or refugees fleeing violence and persecution, their voices must be amplified. A platform alone isn’t enough though - Labour needs to be in power to affect real change for the most vulnerable in our communities. As Deputy Leader, I will rebuild our movement into one people can vote for. A party people can trust. The door may have closed on 12 December for a generation’s hopes and ambitions, but with the right leadership team in place in the Labour Party, it will not be closed for good. We need to win the next General Election, and we must listen to our voters ahead of the Mayoral election in May. As Deputy Leader, it will be my responsibility to rebuild trust, not just with the grassroots of our party, but with voters. Together, we can take Labour forward. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is MP for Tooting and candidate for Deputy Leader of Labour When I first met Rosena, she was Labour’s candidate in the 2016 Tooting by-election.\nAs a by-election candidate myself in Heywood and Middleton in 2014, I know how difficult and uniquely pressured by-elections can be and I wanted to help Rosena win the seat after the amazing Sadiq Khan left to become London mayor. As soon as I met Rosena, I knew that Tooting would soon have another fantastic Labour MP. Her boundless energy and enthusiasm inspired her whole team. I also knew that Rosena wouldn’t be just a backbench MP but that she would bring her skills and experience to the parliamentary Labour party and she’s certainly done that in her role as shadow sports minister and with her background as a practising A&E doctor in our NHS. The choice of who to support in the deputy leadership contest has been a difficult one for me. I know all the candidates and they’re all people I am proud to call friends. But it’s Rosena who has most impressed me in this campaign and I think she has the qualities that we need in our new deputy leader. After the disastrous election result in December 2019, where I lost my seat to the Tories – the first time that they have ever taken Heywood & Middleton – Rosena was one of the first people to contact me, to commiserate but also to talk about what went wrong and how we rebuild from here. She came up to my constituency to talk with key activists about the campaign and we explored every aspect, from Brexit through to our manifesto and the Labour leadership. We talked about Heywood and Middleton being a 62% Leave voting constituency and how I had tried to represent the views of all my constituents in trying to get a deal that worked for 100%. Rosena understands the issues that we face here in the North and I know that she is going to be a great campaigning deputy leader who will reach out across the country to win back those lost Labour seats in the North, the Midlands, Scotland and Wales. I see the role of deputy leader as being a campaigner, an organiser, an advisor and also a critical friend. I think that Rosena is more than capable of doing this job, and doing it extremely well. I am wary of any offer of leader/deputy leader ‘dream tickets’ suggesting a cosy, already formed relationship. The deputy leader has to be able to stand back and assess situations critically and I know that Rosena has the independence and strength of character to do this. I know how hard Rosena has worked to become a qualified doctor, and she’s not only continued to work shifts at St George’s Hospital, keeping her grounded and in touch with our NHS but she’s also done great humanitarian work reaching out internationally. I’ll never forget her impassioned speech in parliament when she returned from the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh where she’d been providing medical care to people who have nothing – no citizenship, no home, in many cases no family and no prospect of their situation improving. Rosena has the strength, knowledge, intelligence and empathy needed to unite our party and also to take our message out to the wider public. And whoever becomes leader, she will be a unique complement to them. I’m proud to call Rosena a friend, and I’m proud to support her to be the next deputy leader of the Labour Party. Rosena Allin-Khan kicks off Labour deputy leader campaign in Putney with ‘fire in her belly’\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan launched her deputy Labour leadership campaign in Putney last night. The campaign, held in the ballroom of the Star & Garter pub, brought together an eclectic crowd, including some young first-time voters. Tooting MP Dr Allin-Khan, who is running with the slogan ‘Taking Labour Forward’, is a qualified A&E front-line doctor and has provided humanitarian aid to refugees in Syria. Describing her determination to be the next deputy leader, she said: “Expertise in building trust in communities and shared life experience has put fire in my belly to achieve for others.” She set out her ‘internationalist’ vision of Britain’s future after Brexit and brought attention to the importance of social care reform, the significance of a grassroots revival and updating technology within the Labour Party. Labour’s Putney MP Fleur Anderson said that Dr Allin-Khan would be a ‘campaigner-in-chief’ and not a ‘leader-in-waiting’ if elected as deputy leader in a PoliticsHome article last week. The Musician’s Union has given their endorsement to Dr Allin-Khan and to Sir Keir Starmer for leader. Voting takes place from February 24 to April 2 and results will be announced on the April 4. Labour needs to become a party of progressive internationalism once againLast Tuesday, a boat capsized and sank in the Bay of Bengal. There were 138 Rohingya refugees crammed on the boat, fleeing from camps in Bangladesh. At least 15 bodies were found, including four children, with 50 more missing.\nI’ve been campaigning for the rights of the Rohingya since the recent crisis unfolded in 2017. I’ve been involved in humanitarian matters long before entering politics and standing to be Labour deputy leader. Stories such as those of the Rohingya do not often have a light shined upon them here in the UK. They happen far away and it feels as if they’re outside of our control. The UK has a proud history of humanitarian assistance and we must ensure that this continues. We must never allow ourselves to turn a blind eye. Every single human life has equal value, no matter where that person was born, what language they speak or what they look like. Humanity has no borders. This isn’t just something I believe in principle — I act on it. My work as a humanitarian doctor has taken me to the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, where grieving mothers told me accounts of their babies being ripped from their arms and murdered before their eyes. The guilt of coming home to my own three- and five-year-olds left me unable to sleep at night. Why should their lives be of more value to the world than those of the Rohingya children who are slaughtered without a dignified burial? I have seen how human life is not valued equally around the world. It lit a fire in my belly to continue fighting such injustice, no matter where it takes place. At the very heart of my Labour principles is internationalism. I believe this spirit of internationalism must drive everything we do as a party. We must always stand in unwavering opposition to any effort to restrict freedoms, whether here or globally. We’ve seen where this mentality leads — whether it is the tragedy of Windrush, the cruelty of detention centres like Yarl’s Wood, or the inhumanity of a government that votes against protection for vulnerable child refugees. Now is the time for all of us who believe in progressive, internationalist values to fight back. It is our duty to ensure that the Rohingya and other victims are not forgotten by the world. One of the reasons I decided to stand to become the next deputy leader of Labour is because I believe our party has a unique chance to become a global beacon of internationalism, as it has been before. We have arguably the largest grassroots membership of any political party in Europe. If we are able to unite behind a truly internationalist vision for our party and our country, we could be a force for change on a global scale. We have a wonderful society, which has welcomed so many people from across the world, but this government’s hostile environment is diminishing hope — hope for a brighter future, hope for a tolerant society. I first entered politics in order to shed light on humanitarian efforts around the world and give a voice to the voiceless. I still believe we can, and I want to help rebuild the Labour Party so that it becomes a powerful force for good. As a party we need to rebuild trust with our communities, with the British people and the international community. Let’s do this together. Rosena Allin-Khan is Labour MP for Tooting and candidate for the deputy leadership The Musicians’ Union has nominated Keir Starmer to be the next leader of the Labour Party, and Rosena Allin-Khan to be the next deputy.\nThe party-affiliated organisation has become the fourth trade union to back Starmer, and the first to back Allin-Khan. In 2015, the union nominated Andy Burnham for leader and Caroline Flint for deputy, and in 2016 it backed leadership challenger Owen Smith. Commenting on their nomination on Twitter, the Musicians’ Union said Starmer had been “a strong supporter of musicians”. “He understands the challenges musicians working in the EU are facing and what we need to do to meet them”. The organisation also revealed in a tweet that Allin-Khan was a “former Musicians’ Union member” and said they were “proud to see her rise so far” and “to support her as she continues fighting for young people to have a free musical education.” Starmer has already secured his place on the final ballot through both the support of affiliates, including large trade union UNISON, and the backing of local Labour parties. To reach the ballot paper, each candidate must be nominated by 5% of local parties or three affiliates, two of which must be trade unions, amounting to more than 5% of the total affiliate membership. Starmer has been nominated by a total of 159 constituency parties so far, as well as UNISON, Usdaw, SERA, Community, Labour Movement for Europe, Labour Business and the Socialist Health Association. Allin-Khan has yet to secure a place on the final ballot, having so far only secured the support of 17 CLPs and the Labour Campaign for International Development. Rosena Allin-Khan is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in5/2/2020\nFleur Anderson MP: As Deputy Leader, Rosena Allin-Khan would be a campaigner-in-chief, not a leader-in-waitingRosena Allin-Khan is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in, writes Putney's new MP, Fleur Anderson.\nThe night of the General Election result was a deeply distressing moment for all of us who love the Labour Party and who love our country. It was an horrific experience to watch the door close on a whole generation as the Tories won a huge majority to continue their destructive and damaging agenda. But I was also hugely proud and honoured to produce the only Labour gain of the night, as I became the new MP for Putney. It was, I hope, a rare bright light in an otherwise long, dark night for all those Labour activists, members and volunteers who worked tirelessly during the election. Rosena’s help and support was vital to that win. She is my friend and colleague, as we were councillors together and she is the MP for the neighbouring constituency of Tooting. It’s sometimes forgotten how difficult it can be for prospective parliamentary candidates, especially ones who’ve never stood to be an MP before. Of course, it’s a huge honour to be given the chance to represent your local community, and to make their voices heard in the corridors of power – but you also have to put your life on hold for months, spending hardly any time with your friends and family, working and campaigning relentlessly, whatever the weather, rain or shine. And at the end of it all, there’s absolutely no guarantee you’ll get the job, especially in a marginal seat like Putney. It’s incredibly rewarding, but it’s hard work too. Rosena was there for me every step of the way, helping me, guiding me, giving me advice and encouragement and very practical support too. I cannot thank her enough. She is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in, and every single voter who meets her comes away with a positive impression and a smile on their face. I should know - we stood to be Councillors together in the same ward in 2014 - fighting a seat that had been Tory for 24 years - and we won, through sheer hard work and positive conversations. Rosena is a relentless optimist – she always finds the positives in every situation and she never gives up, no matter what. Her life-story is a true demonstration of our Labour values – she comes from an impoverished background, failed her A-levels first time around but persevered, and because of reforms introduced by a Labour government, she was able to study at Cambridge and become a doctor before becoming an MP - it shows the difference a Labour Government can make to the lives of people across our country. Rosena is now running to become the next Deputy Leader of Labour. There’s no doubt she’s the underdog in the race, but that’s never stopped her before, and I know it won’t stop her now. She would be a phenomenal Deputy Leader of our Party, and that’s why she’s got my total support. She’s got the most interesting and substantive ideas of any of the candidates, and she’s already published a fantastic Grassroots Revival manifesto of how the Labour Party can improve our campaigning practices to get back to winning ways ahead of the local elections in May. As Deputy Leader, she would be a campaigner-in-chief, not a leader-in-waiting. In Putney, I saw the real difference she made with her energy, her optimism and her campaigning skill. Thanks to Rosena’s help, we turned blue seats into red ones, and if she’s elected as the next Deputy Leader, we can start doing that across the whole country - at both a local and a national level. Let’s take Labour forward. Fleur Anderson is Labour MP for Putney. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan: As a doctor and as a daughter I know social care is broken.\nThe deputy leadership candidate has spoken about the horror of finding her dad - who has dementia- injured and not knowing what happened. She wants to make sure no other family has to suffer that way. Nothing prepares you for finding your loved one bruised and blooded. Nothing prepares you for never finding answers. This is the reality that every day, so many people are living through, across the UK, because of the nature of the social care system. Nothing prepared me for being one of the statistics. My father has fronto-temporal dementia – he cannot communicate his thoughts but he is fully aware of what is happening. My brother and I found him bloodied and bruised on more than one occasion, we have sought answers but we know that we will never find them. He is safe now, but his health has deteriorated massively and has affected his life expectancy. This is not just my reality. This is the reality for so many others across the country. I am lucky. I was able to call a debate last year and get The Mirror to cover my family’s journey. Most people don’t have that luxury. Instead, they’re left fighting the social care system. I’ve been on both sides. As an aggrieved family member and a local politician with a responsibility for social care, I’ve seen the strife that goes into placements on both sides. The system is failing our most vulnerable residents. As it stands, the social care system is not fit for purpose. The Tories promised in their manifesto that they would tackle social care. It’s been three years – and yet still no Green Paper, despite countless promises. Last week, in Parliament, I asked the Health Secretary how many more families will suffer before the Government looks to reform the social care system. There was no answer. As an A&E doctor, who regularly sees vulnerable older people stranded in hospital because they don’t have access to adequate social care, and as a daughter, who’s had to go through this process, I have the following recommendations: - A truly independent complaints process – formal complaints should not have to go through the care provider or local authority who the complaint is against. - A reformed process for awarding care contracts – to ensure that failing companies cannot simply change their name and continue providing inadequate care. - An Independent Advocate for Older People – to protect and promote the rights of older people. - Mandatory CCTV with an opt-out – CCTV in communal areas within care homes should be mandatory to provide evidence of any unacceptable behaviour in a care setting. - A fully funded social care system, integrated into our NHS, with a ban on outsourcing to private companies. Increased funding alone won’t solve the problems being faced by our most vulnerable – only enacting the above changes will. At some point in our lives, we all have an experience with the social care system – as a daughter, I know how difficult it is when this system fails you. As Labour Deputy Leader, I would continue putting pressure on this Tory Government and their poor record on social care. As a society, we must protect our most vulnerable – sadly, nothing prepares you for confronting the worst. As your Deputy Leader, I would work with the Leader of the Labour Party to put the NHS and social care front and centre of our policy going forward. We need to protect our most vulnerable. We need a Labour Government. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/https_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_balham/content_579.html": "|\nData from National Rail and the Rail Delivery Group has revealed a shocking rise in the number of late trains at Balham, Earlsfield, Tooting and Wandsworth Common stations. Trains in the morning evening peaks, to and from Central London, have all seen a worsening of their \"on-time percentage\" in the last six months compared to the same period of 2023. The full breakdown of delays at each station is below. It is shocking to see that, not only are trains late at some stations late half the time, but that there has been a steady decline from an already-unacceptable level of lateness last year. Particularly concerning are the figures at Tooting station, where over half of services were late despite there being only two services per hour on that line.\nSome of the worst performing services include: 8:05 from Balham (8:07 from Wandsworth Common) to Victoria - 88% late (Southern) 18:12 from Waterloo to Earlsfield - 81% late (South Western) 8:21 from Balham to Victoria - 79% late (Southern) 8:40 from Balham (8:42 from Wandsworth Common) to Victoria - 76% late (Southern) 8:13 from Tooting to London Blackfriars - 70% late (Thameslink) Local commuters deserve better than the shoddy service they are currently receiving from Southern, South Western and Thameslink. I look forward to the Government's plans to bring our local rail services back into public control, so that our trains are always run with the interests of the people who use them at heart. Eight years ago today, I was selected as the Tooting Labour candidate for the by-election caused by Sadiq becoming a candidate for Mayor of London.\nIt has been a huge honour and privilege to serve as the representative for the community in which I was born and raised.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_cladding-update-fire-safety-bill/content_531.html": "|\nIn light of the upcoming Fire Safety Bill, I would to thank every resident who has written to me with their concerns on this and for continuing to keep me updated on the cladding issues affecting their property. I recognise what an exceptionally difficult time this is and appreciate how much anxiety the cladding proposals are causing to many leaseholders.\nOn more than fifteen occasions, Ministers promised that leaseholders would not be landed with the costs of remedial works. Yet, people are still being put at risk, trapped in flammable buildings for a third lockdown, with leaseholders placed in an impossible position and promises broken. It is evident that the Government’s handling of the cladding crisis has lacked any sense of grip or urgency. For this reason, the Labour Party have tabled an Opposition Day Debate on cladding for Monday, which will subsequently bring forward a vote that will call for leaseholders to be protected from the costs of remediating their blocks with dangerous cladding. The party will also be tabling a number of amendments to the Fire Safety Bill that will aim to protect leaseholders from unfair costs through the power of the law. I am aware that many residents have been in touch to request that I support the McPartland and Smith amendment, which provides welcome clarity on the specific costs that would be prevented from being passed on to leaseholders. Labour has sought to go further on this. As currently drafted, the McPartland and Smith amendment would not have covered blocks like Grenfell - where flammable cladding has been added at some stage following the building of the block. It only applies to defects in the original design of buildings. The Labour Party’s amendment would ensure that the cost of fire safety problems from refurbishment jobs, like the cladding on Grenfell Tower, cannot be passed on to leaseholders. Labour’s amendments also include new clauses so that the Bill protects leaseholders from the day it comes into law, instead of an unknown date in the future. I would like to thank my colleagues in the Labour Party, Sarah Jones MP, Nick Thomas-Symonds MP, Thangam Debbonaire MP and Mike Amesbury MP for their hard work and commitment to addressing this large injustice on a national scale. If any residents have any further queries on this issue, please do not hesitate to get in touch to discuss this further. In the meantime, I hope this post assures you of the steps myself and the Labour Party are taking to protect tenants and leaseholders during this cladding crisis.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_archives_08-2022/content_21.html": "|\nIt is an honour to have been unanimously re-selected by all the local party branches and affiliated organisations to stand as Labour’s candidate for Tooting in the next general election.\nI want to say a huge thank you to all the members and affiliates who took part, and who continue to put their trust in me to represent our community. Serving as the Member of Parliament for the community I grew up in is an honour. From helping local residents with casework, playing a part in winning the council, defending our NHS and serving as the shadow Minister to Mental Health - I have the best job in the world. My job is made even greater by the fantastic support local members show me all year round, so I want to take this opportunity to say a big thank you to them all! The next election is make-or-break for our party, we simply must win. I’m looking forward to working hard to make this happen. The NHS is being dismantled, I see it every time I work a shift. More people than ever are relying on foodbanks, and the cost-of-living crisis is having a devastating impact on people locally and across the country. I will be absolutely committed to doing everything I can to put Labour into Government and make the changes this country so desperately needs. Thank you again to everyone who voted. Recently I visited the fantastic Balham Ballers holiday club, based at Ravensbourne Primary school.\nBalham Ballers provide a sports programme for young people aged five to twelve over the school holidays, focusing mainly on football but also giving young people a chance to enjoy a wide range of other sporting activities. I have loved working with the Balham Ballers team over the last few years and it has been fantastic to see them go from strength to strength. Balham Ballers are passionate about promoting a love of sports amongst both boys and girls. This is something that I am particularly supportive of. Following the Lionesses' fantastic win at the Euros earlier this month, the England football team have said \"every girl should be given the chance to play football at school.\" However, currently only 63% of schools offer equal access to football, a number that falls to just 44% at secondary schools. It was great to see so many young people in our community enjoying football, and I even took a penalty myself! To find out more about the Balham Ballers, click here. Fresh off the back of our trip to South Wales yesterday, Luke Pollard MP and I continued to take the fight to the Tories today, this time in Reading.\nWe kicked off the day with a doorknocking session in Reading West, another Tory-held marginal seat where it is essential Labour wins at the next general election. We were delighted to be joined by my colleague, Matt Rodda, MP for Reading East, who took us to a community-run cafe to show the empowering work that local people are doing on a daily basis. Reading is a great example of what Labour can do in power - the town's carbon emissions have been reduced by 70% in the last 12 years and the Council is currently investing £88 million in over 300 new social housing homes across Reading. Today, my friend Luke Pollard MP and I visited the lush landscape of South Wales in order to continue our fight to put Keir Starmer in 10 Downing Street.\nWe visited Barry Island (cue many Gavin and Stacey references!) in the Vale of Glamorgan seat and Chepstow in Monmouth - two vitally important areas that Labour needs to win to form a government. Labour took control of both Vale of Glamorgan & Monmouthshire Councils after the May elections and I greatly enjoyed campaigning with local members, building on that momentum in order to elect two new Labour MPs at the next election. Of course, a trip to Barry Island would not be complete without a wander down the beautiful seafront, complete with ice cream. Lloniannau! It was great to visit the wonderful volunteers at the White Eagle Club in Balham recently. The Tooting and Balham Community has rallied together to support the appeal for Ukraine since the Russian invasion in March. Since the appeal was launched, the White Eagle Club has sent 74 trucks, 112 vans, and a massive 1,800 tonnes of goods to Ukraine as part of their humanitarian aid mission. They have also provided many Ukrainian nationals who have recently fled to the UK with clothes, shoes, toiletries, and supplies for babies and infants. It’s always amazing to see the community come together to help those in need. There is however, still much more that the White Eagle Club needs, both for Ukrainian nationals arriving in the UK and to be sent to those still living in Ukraine. Items that are most in need include; medical supplies, toiletries, sanitary products and baby powder, as well as clothes for those who have recently arrived in the UK. You can donate items to 211 Balham High Street at the following times: Tuesdays: 11.00 - 20.00 Wednesday: 10.00 - 17.00 Thursday: 11.00-20.00 Friday: 10.00-17.00 Saturday 10.00-17.00 It was great to visit Mount Carmel Rehabilitation centre again recently. I’ve enjoyed working with this fantastic organisation over the last few years. Mount Carmel offers residential and day programmes to people struggling with addictions. Their Counsellors provide a series of programmes, including a range of talking therapy groups, art therapy and equine therapy, to help people overcome their addiction issues. The pandemic has left Mount Carmel more stretched than ever, with many people seeking help after relapsing or struggling with new addiction problems during the lockdowns. Despite the increased demand, the team at Mount Carmel continue to provide first class care to all their clients. I look forward to continuing to work with the team at Mount Carmel, and seeing all that they go on to achieve. If you would like to support the work they do in our community, you can donate to their Just Giving page below\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Before deciding how to vote, I have carefully considered the provisions of the legislation, taken into account the views of those in Tooting, as well as discussing this at length with experts.\nThere are deeply felt personal, spiritual, philosophical and moral opinions held by individuals on both sides of this debate. Death is always a difficult subject. Our own death and the loss of those we love is a sad fact of life that each and every one of us will deal with at some point. As a doctor, death is something that my colleagues and I must confront every day. As a daughter, the death of my father from a terminal illness was a very eye-opening and traumatic experience, one which I’d wish on no-one. After much thought, reflection and engagement with the community I represent, I have decided to vote against the Bill at its Second Reading. The concerns I hold with the current proposals are multifaceted. I have spoken to key organisations and charities who have detailed their concerns that this legislation will have a disproportionate impact on disabled and BAME individuals. I am further worried that the current legislation does not go far enough to eliminate risks of coercion. Currently neither of the two doctors that would sign off on the process need to know the patient or their family. Nor are they mandated to seek a specialist clinical assessment. It is also important to me that we ensure people considering ending their own lives have access to good quality, well-resourced end-of-life care. This is currently not the reality for much of the country owing to a lack of resources. As such, moving forward, I will continue to advocate for improvements to palliative care, which can empower many individuals at the end of their lives, to enjoy their last moments with loved ones in as much comfort as possible and with peace of mind. There is no doubt that my colleagues have decided their vote, regardless of which side, with the very best of intentions. It is right that this Bill is being considered under a free vote, where every MP can vote with their conscience, and I am pleased that this has been a largely respectful, measured debate. I would like to thank everyone who has contacted me regarding this deeply personal issue - I have really listened. If the legislation passes today, there will remain opportunities to amend the Bill. I will look at any potential changes to the legislation closely. While I cannot support the Bill at this stage, this debate was needed and the issue is very important to the public. Regardless of the outcome of the vote, I hope we can all continue to be as respectful and understanding towards one another as possible.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

It has been a year of change and renewal - full of ups and downs - but as I enter into my ninth year as your Member of Parliament for Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting, it remains the greatest honour of my life to represent the community in which I was born and raised. Entering the new year, I would like to pay tribute to the incredible frontline workers working around the clock to keep the country going through the festive period. From our NHS services to local hospitality staff to food bank volunteers - you all have my heartfelt gratitude for your tireless work this Christmas and throughout the year. A year for democracyWhat a year it has been for elections, both locally and across the country. We began the year with a fantastic win in the Tooting Broadway by-election, increasing the Labour vote share by nearly 7% to a whopping 58% majority. Then came the Mayoral elections in May, when we kept London red by electing my Tooting predecessor Sadiq Khan to a historic third term as Mayor of London. Finally - and most importantly - we finally elected a new Labour Government after 14 long years, with areas up and down the country voting Labour for the very first time. It was humbling to receive the most votes of any Labour MP and thanks must go to everyone who voted for me - your support means the world. £100m to fix Wandsworth PrisonAfter years of campaigning - and countless stories of mismanagement and scandal - the Ministry of Justice announced a £100 million funding package for HMP Wandsworth. This will go a long way to reduce the impact of overcrowding, repair crumbling cell blocks and facilities, and ensure that prison guards can work in a safe environment. Delivering for everyone in TootingThousands of local people have contacted me this year regarding a variety of issues, I have dealt with 15,000 cases. I reclaimed tens of thousands in unpaid pensions or benefits for local people, got decisions on hundreds of delayed passport or visa applications, and helped countless local residents get repairs to their homes. My door is always open and please get in touch if there is anything I can help with. On the NHS frontline\nSpeaking up for Gaza It has now been over a year since the horrific 7th October attacks and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza. The humanitarian disaster we have seen unfold there in the time since, has been truly heartwrenching. This year, I've raised the issue numerous times in Parliament, visited the region in the spring, and held evidence sessions with humanitarian experts. Revitalising Tooting town centre\nThis Morning and Loose Women Using my background as an NHS doctor, I have enjoyed trying my hand at being a TV medic this year! The lovely people at This Morning and Loose Women have had me on many times to talk about a range of topics from mental health to medical emergencies and even gave me space to open up about my own childhood challenges with speech, in a bid to end stigma and help others. Work in Parliament\nKeeping our streets safe in 2024, I successfully campaigned for a tripling of the Tooting neighbourhood policing team, putting more bobbies on our streets. In the summer, Operation Kenny run by the Metropolitan Police resulted in a 70% reduction in crime in Tooting town centre. This work will continue with the new Government's plans to recruit 13,000 new officers and return policing to communities. Cleaning up the local area I have never stopped campaigning for cleaner streets. This year saw a 15% reduction in fly-tipping in Wandsworth, with thousands of fines issued to people dumping their bulky rubbish on our streets. Meanwhile, Wandsworth Labour introduced food recycling for the first time ever in the borough. Free School Meals roll-out\nMental health reform Mental health is incredibly important to me and, for far too long, much-needed reforms were swept under the rug by a Conservative Government that simply wasn't interested. After much hard work, it was fantastic to see reform of the Mental Health Act announced in the King's Speech in July - this was long overdue.\nComments are closed.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

There was such a fantastic display of local arts and crafts on sale, which demonstrated the truly incredible talents that local people have to offer.\nLondon UNISON members have fought hard for some amazing victories over the last year. I was proud to meet with some of our fantastic reps working in local healthcare when I addressed UNISON’s conference last month.\nOur local NHS board have announced that Trinity Medical Centre will close on 31st July. The decision to close the surgery is deeply disappointing and I am concerned that it will leave thousands of local residents scrambling to find another GP, including vulnerable patients.\nAt a time when local residents are already waiting weeks to see a GP, this decision is a shocking, short-sighted solution for users of the surgery. People will find themselves trying to squeeze onto the books of existing practices, travelling further to see a GP, losing the strong and trusted relationships with their GPs they've built over time. The blame for this decision lies squarely with this Conservative Government who have imposed 13 years of underfunding and neglect on our local NHS services. I have already called on the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, to meet with the community to see the impact of this decision first-hand and to reverse this disastrous decision. I've always been a proud supporter of Palestinian rights, which is why it was great to sit down and catch-up with the Palestinian Ambassador to the UK, Husam Zumot, in Parliament today.\nToday, I proudly led Labour's opposition debate on mental health and put forward our plan to transform mental health services across the country. It includes more staff, specialists in schools, hubs in communities, treatment within a month. Today, I called on the Health Secretary to get his act together on our failing mental health services. Across mental health services, children are being failed, police are spending hours waiting with children in crisis in A&E, staff are overworked are under-resourced. It's time for the Health Secretary to get a grip or get out of the way. Some businesses take their workplace mental health responsibilities very seriously. It was extremely insightful to talk to leaders of Talon, JCDecaux, Clear Channel Outdoor, Ocean Outdoor today, about what they’re doing to support employees’ mental health.\nToday, I wrote to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, calling on him to listen to concerns expressed by local residents about the proposed closure of Trinity Medical Centre.\nAt a time when waiting times are at record levels, these plans by the NHS and Government will make it harder for local residents to access a local GP. That's why, alongside our local Labour Councillors, I'm campaigning to keep GP services at this site. Please add your name to the petition here Read my letter below: Today, I wrote to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, regarding my growing concerns about the limited powers of the ongoing inquiry into the deaths of up to 2,000 patients in mental health hospitals in Essex Partnership University Trust over the past 20 years.\nThe inquiry has only received the co-operation of less than 30% of named staff, who are essential witnesses in the deaths that are being investigated, leaving families in limbo and further compounding their grief. I have called on the Health Secretary to give the inquiry the full statutory powers required to ensure families get answers and that lessons can be learned for the future. Read my full letter here: The children's cancer centre at St George's Hospital is at risk of closure.\nThis is deeply concerning. The St George's children's cancer centre has more than 25 years of expertise delivering the highest quality care for patients, which will be lost if the services are moved away from Tooting. Under these plans, patients will be forced to travel to a site in central London. Parents have made it very clear that it is easier, cheaper, safer, and more comfortable to take their children to St George's. There is also a huge added cost. The plans to relocate services will cost an estimated £90 million, more than three times the cost to redevelop facilities at St George's Hospital. Today, I've launched a petition calling on the Government and NHS England to keep the children’s cancer service at St George's Hospital.

People of all ages are invited to enjoy this wonderful green space with their friends and family. Forever Fishponds have a range of activities planned for you to enjoy, including pop-up garden and nature walks, a bake sale and competition, bat and ball games, races, cricket, football, and much more. Head down to Fishponds Playing Fields between 10am and 12pm to be part of the fun! Children and young people have suffered immensely during the pandemic. But the mental health crisis facing Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) is nothing new. CAMHS services are at breaking point. They were before the pandemic. Tens of thousands of children are being turned away from mental health services – support they vitally need. Parents have raised this issue. Doctors have raised this issue. The stats provide the evidence. When will the Government admit that CAMHS services need to be better resourced? On the eve of Tokyo 2020, Tooting is preparing to celebrate a hero of the Antwerp Games a century earlier - champion middle-distance runner Albert Hill. Hill, who took gold at the 1920 Olympics, was born and raised in Tooting. A blue plaque commemorating his outstanding achievements is now set to be erected outside his former home. The plaque was funded through community donations, and is the result of the tireless efforts of the students of Fircroft Primary School, who campaigned for its creation. Local historian Geoff Simmons said, “It’s great that Great Britain’s Olympic past is being honoured, but its future is under threat. Tooting Bec Athletics Track, home to the historic athletics club Herne Hill Harriers, and used by 80,000 young people every year, has been ruled unfit for competition and is in need of repair.” Click here to sign the petition calling on Wandsworth Tories to fund vital repairs to Tooting Track. Balham has a long and proud history, and its architecture is of real importance to the local community; and Balham Railway Bridge is a prominent and important feature of this historical architecture. Unfortunately in recent years, the bridge’s grandeur has sadly faded beyond all recognition. I recently spoke with the local community group Beautify Balham who have made suggestions, such as painting the bridge an attractive colour, re-painting the metal columns, and installing up-lighting to showcase the bridge. I am wholly supportive of these suggestions. As such, I wrote to Network Rail, asking them to consider incorporating these simple yet impactful improvements as part of the £2.6 million investment they have committed to restore Balham Station. Swift action was taken and I was delighted to hear that the Bridge has had its first coat of paint! It has been a pleasure to support the wonderful Beautify Balham volunteers with this campaign and I would like to especially thank Councillor Clare Fraser, who works so hard to support local residents. Today, I voted against the Nationality and Borders Bill, a piece of legislation that risks breaking international law and turns our backs on unaccompanied children fleeing war and persecution. The Conservatives just voted to make it harder to give a safe haven to children fleeing violence and war. They should be ashamed. The cruel irony of this Government’s approach is that it’s weak on taking action against criminal gangs and brutal when it comes to orphaned children from war zones. As someone who has held the hands of frightened children and terrified parents working as a doctor in war torn areas such as the Rohingya and Palestine, I am appalled at the Government’s approach to protecting those in need of safety. On Sunday I had the great honour of presenting the medals and winners’ trophy to the Sinjun Grammarians under 12s cricket team - 2021 champions of the Surrey Tier Three League. Masterfully managed by Mukesh Dev, and captained with distinction by Rufus Ford, the team’s achievement is all the more remarkable on account of the club’s small size – with a membership of just over 50 junior players, Sinjun Grammarians rarely have enough players in the same age group to enter into league competitions. Their success is also astounding for the fact that the playing group, who were experiencing league competition for the first time, marched to the title unbeaten in all their 10 games. I could not be more proud of this group of talented young athletes, not only for overcoming the odds and taking the title so convincingly, but for the focus, determination, sportsmanship, and teamwork they showed along the way. This is what Tooting is all about: the players are truly a credit to themselves, their families, their club, and our community. I was absolutely bowled over by the Club’s decision to award me the title of Honorary President of Sinjun Grammarians Cricket Club. This success is undoubtedly the first of many such achievements for this passionate group of young cricketers, and I look forward to celebrating with them again in coming seasons. Well done, team! “Prior to 2017, no Government invested in or prioritised mental health services.”\nI couldn’t have put it better myself - and I didn’t need to, for these are not my words. They are the words of Nadine Dorries, the Mental Health Minister. The devastation left behind by the cuts to mental health services is staggering. And who was the architect of these cuts? No one other than the new Health Secretary during his time as a Treasury Minister. This matter cannot go unaddressed. That is why in Parliament today I asked the new Health Secretary to explain why a quarter of mental health beds have been cut since 2010, why 140,000 children were turned away from mental health services last year, and, finally, if he is ashamed of his track record. See here to view the video. On Sunday, I was back in A&E working in the run up to the England v Italy match. While, unfortunately, it did not come home, it was great to spend time with hard-working colleagues at St Georges. With infections and hospitalisations increasing, it’s still incredibly important for us all to look out for one another and play our part in stopping the spread of the virus. Earlier this week, the Prime Minister gave an update on moving to stage four of the coronavirus easing roadmap. This means that from 19 July, the following will apply:\nUnderstandably, many are worried about the repercussions of these eased restrictions. Indeed, many residents have been in touch regarding the use of face coverings on public transport and their anxieties surrounding this. On Wednesday, Sadiq Khan announced that face coverings will remain mandatory for all, unless exempt, when travelling on the TfL network. This will, no doubt, be a relief to many in the local area, and I pay tribute to the Mayor of London in taking a firm stand against the Government’s recklessness. Labour is calling for a controlled approach that keeps in place baseline measures that can push down infections, like mandatory face masks on public transport – which we know protect people, reduce the spread of the virus, and don’t harm the economy. By removing mask requirements - the Johnson Variant is being fast-tracked. Cases will soar, as will hospitalisations. Everyone in Tooting has been fantastic in reducing the spread of coronavirus. With one of the highest vaccination rates in London, I can only ask residents to continue looking out for one another. The future of Tooting Bec Athletics Track is still yet to be secured, with vital repairs still needing to be undertaken. Tooting Bec Athletics Track is a much-loved and well-utilised facility, both by local residents and the wider London community. The track is a home to schools, clubs such as Herne Hill Harriers, as well as aspiring athletes. To lose such a valuable asset would be a devastating blow to so many of our young people in our local area. Top British athletes are made at Tooting Bec Athletics Track - Jade Johnson, who represented Great Britain at two Olympics, trained at the track since childhood, as has Katie Snowden, who will represent Great Britain in Tokyo next month. By allowing the track to fall into disrepair, Wandsworth Tories are destroying the legacy of London 2012, and seriously damaging the chances of our next generation of Olympic hopefuls in the process. The deadline for the petition to save Tooting Bec Athletics Track has been extended until 1 August – click here to sign and show Wandsworth Tories how much our community cares about the future of our young people. This week, I was honoured to present Dons Local Action Group with the cheque of money raised through my Euro 2020 raffle. I’m so proud that our community has, once again, come together. The response was truly overwhelming, and in only four days we were able to raise £1,270 in much-needed funds for the Dons Local Action Group They’re an incredible local charity and I know they’ll be able to do a lot of good for so many families and young people with the money raised. A huge thank you to everyone who bought a ticket! |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

One of the most important steps we can take to stop the spread of the coronavirus is to get vaccinated as soon as possible. For this reason, a range of walk-in vaccination sites have been launched across South West London. People aged over 18 are invited to drop into the Tooting and Mitcham United F.C. vaccination centre on Saturday 19th or Sunday 20th 9am - 8pm, to receive their first or second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Unvaccinated over 40s and over 40s who have received their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine before mid-April can also head down to the Roehampton Vaccination Centre, located in the Queen Mary’s Hospital car park, on Sunday between 8am and 7.45pm to receive their second dose. Together we can stop the spread of Covid-19. Details of additional walk-in vaccine centres in South West London are available here. Today I had the pleasure of visiting the impressive walk-in vaccine clinic, based at St Boniface Church on Mitcham Road. It was great to have the opportunity to speak with their incredible team of staff and volunteers, as well as meet local residents receiving their coronavirus vaccines. In partnership with NHS England, to date Pearl Chemist have administered over 30,000 doses of the vaccines. This is an incredible achievement and a real credit to our community. For local residents aged 40+ who have not yet had their first vaccination, the AstraZeneca vaccine is available at the Pearl Chemist clinic on Mitcham Road. You can also receive your second dose (eight weeks after your first dose) if you are in cohorts 1-9. Simply bring along your card! All other age groups can book their doses via the NHS website here. As a reminder, before you receive your vaccine, it is important to have eaten and be hydrated. With coronavirus cases in Wandsworth rising, it has never been more important to ensure you are fully vaccinated as soon as possible. By getting vaccinated, you are not only protecting yourself, but your community too. Local favourite Mixed Blessings - our very own West Indian bakery on Mitcham Road - will soon be blessed with its very own blue plaque! The plaque will mark and celebrate TMC Studios (Tooting Music Centre), the recording studio that was once based above the bakery and frequented by glam rockers and reggae artists - local legend has it that Bob Marley scrawled his signature on a wall. It is so important that we shine a spotlight on Tooting’s rich musical roots and diverse cultural heritage. I will certainly be there later this summer when the plaque is revealed to share the love. A number of dogs have been reportedly infected with canine parvovirus on Tooting Common in recent times. Dog owners may be well aware that parvovirus is a highly infectious condition spread through contaminated faeces of affected dogs, and it can remain active in the environment for up to nine months. The virus causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea, leading to a dog or puppy becoming very weak and dehydrated. Sadly, many little pups do not recover. Thankfully, there are a number of steps that dog owners can take to protect their furry friends: Prevent your dog from meeting with other dogs to stop the spread of infection Ensure your dog’s vaccinations are up-to-date Notify your vet immediately if your dog displays any worrying symptoms. Click here to learn more about canine parvovirus. Good news - the Food Bus is coming to Tooting! The Food Bus – a converted bus stocked with affordable, healthy food – aims to improve Wandsworth residents’ access to fresh produce, while reducing the burden on household budgets. Much of its stock is obtained from retailers’ surpluses, and an ordinary shopping basket of goods will be available at a fraction of the normal price. The bus also features an on-board café. Head on down to All Saints Church on Brudenell Road on Thursday 10 June between 10:30am to 2:30pm to experience this wonderful initiative for yourself. Rites for Girls is a local group which aims aims to prepare girls for that all-important transition from primary to secondary school, focusing on their wellbeing and self-esteem. Girls in Year 6 and 7 are being offered the opportunity to participate in monthly sessions over the course of the year, in which they will be taught about puberty, and learn strategies to take charge of their emotional, social, and physical wellbeing. As we look to the end of Government lockdown measures, during which time many girls have reported feeling disconnected from family and friends, the support Rites for Girls offers girls is more important than ever. Sessions will be held at the Woodfield Pavilion, Tooting Bec Common. For more information see here, or to book a place for your daughter contact [email protected]. We have been blessed with wonderful sunshine throughout this week, which has undoubtedly brought out the best of our surroundings here in Tooting. Working in St George’s Hospital, I know what a real difference the green spaces in the grounds make to patients, visitors and staff alike. I would therefore like to express my sincere thanks to the hospital gardening team, in particular their Head of Gardening, John Greco, who have put their all into this wonderful display of spring blooms for us all to enjoy. The bright array of tulips and blossom trees will no doubt be a great comfort to what is an often anxious time for patients and visitors to the hospital. Thank you team! Following on from the BBC’s successful documentary in March last year, ‘Stacey Dooley: On The Psych Ward’, Stacey Dooley returned to Springfield in a moving programme aired on Tuesday (13th April 2021). Stacey Dooley: Back On The Psych Ward follows the dedicated mental health professionals working on the frontline at Springfield, as well as a number of brave patients who came forward to share their experiences of life at Springfield during lockdown. I am always exceptionally proud of everyone working in mental health across the country. As both the Shadow Minister for Mental Health and Member of Parliament for Tooting, I remain committed to ensuring that local mental health services receive the funding they deserve. Today Muslims across the UK and around the world mark the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan. As a proud Muslim, the period of reflection, prayer, and fasting is incredibly important to our Muslim community. Traditionally, Ramadan is a time for gathering and sharing Iftar with family and friends. Although, like last year, we are unable to come together and celebrate as we normally would, the spirit of Ramadan remains. To every Muslim nurse and doctor who have saved countless lives throughout this pandemic, to every volunteer and community leader in our Mosques and community centres who continue to support those most vulnerable, and to every Muslim in Tooting and across the country, I wish you all Ramadan Mubarak. For so many, our Tooting Bec Lido is a source of great local pride. During the most recent Government lockdown, I know residents have missed using Tooting Bec Lido and have felt the mental and physical pressure from not being able to swim regularly. I am so pleased that the Lido opened once again to the public from Monday 29th March and would like to thank volunteers from the South London Swimming Club for their efforts in preparation for its opening. As per previous rules, you will need to book to use the lido in advance and booking can be made via the Places Leisure app or website here: If you are going to enjoy a swim in the spring sunshine, please do make sure you follow the guidelines in place to keep everyone safe. Places Leisure have emphasised that there will be no lockers or changing facilities available at this time and that swimmers must stick to width-lane swimming only in order to abide by social distancing guidelines. As the weather gets warmer, I look forward to residents enjoying a safe, outdoor swim. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Across the UK, there are as many as 1.25 million people living with an eating disorder. Eating disorders have considerably high mortality rates, with anorexia claiming the most lives of any mental illness. Yet, with timely and appropriate treatment, people can go on to live healthy and fulfilling lives. We need a Government that will get serious on mental health and eating disorders. Labour will put prevention and early intervention at the forefront of our approach to mental health. We will place a mental health specialist in every school and place an open access hub for young people in every single community. The story of a Ukrainian family who wants to come to live in Furzedown recently made national news! Oksana and her young son Dmytro have a sponsor ready and willing to welcome them into their home in the local area, however Home Office delays have stopped them travelling to safety in the United Kingdom.\nIt is inspiring and heartwarming to see the generosity shown by the British public in welcoming Ukrainian refugees into their lives, however Oksana and Dmytro have been let down badly by the Home Office. They applied to come to the UK in September last year and, so far, the Home Office have refused to provide a timeframe for a decision to both myself and their sponsor's solicitors. This is simply not good enough and the Government must get a grip. Our latest research, shows that in 2021/22, the total number of days lost to poor mental health has doubled to more than 730,000 over the last decade. This comes at the same time that there has been a drop in the number of neighbourhood police officers by 6,000 and of Police Community Support Officers by 8,500.\nThese absences equate to over 2,000 police officers being off sick each day, last year alone, due to poor mental health. It is clear that this Conservative Government has presided over 13 years of neglect and staff shortages that have left our public services at breaking point. The next Labour Government will recruit 8,500 more mental health professionals, ensuring a million more patients get treated each year; and we will rebuild neighbourhood policing, delivering a package of 13,000 extra neighbourhood officers and PCSOs, putting police back on the beat. Read the full story here My thoughts and prayers went out to everyone affected by the recent tragic earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. I was very proud to see that Tooting Islamic Centre raised £16,000 for the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal for relief funds.\nIt is always incredibly touching to see the love, generosity and kindness demonstrated by our fantastic community - thank you to all those that donated and to Arshad Daud, imam at TIC, for all his hard work. Donations can still be made here Our exclusive data reveals that children in a mental health crisis spent more than 900,000 hours in A&E in England, last year. The total delays across England, in the past year alone, equate to 103 years of waiting time. This is a huge rise, up four-fold in the last decade.\nThe figures, made public through Freedom of Information requests, show the staggering number of hours that children have spent in a mental health crisis in Emergency Departments. With nowhere to turn, children with a mental illness are left to deteriorate – at which time A&E is the only place left for them to go. Emergency Departments are incredibly unsuitable settings for children in crisis, yet we’re witnessing increasingly younger children having to present to A&E in desperation. The next Labour Government will prioritise a truly preventative plan for mental health services and will put patient care first. We will ensure access to mental health professionals in every school and put an open access hub in every community, in addition to guaranteeing mental health treatment within a month for all who need it, by recruiting 8,500 new mental health staff to treat a million additional patients a year by Labour’s first term in office., funded by closing tax loopholes. Read the full article here For Children's Mental Health Week, I've written for LabourList about Labour's bold, transformative plan to deliver mental health care for children and young people. With children waiting days in A&E in a mental health crisis and more than one million people being turned away from mental health services without being seen, it is vital that we transform care by putting prevention at the heart of our plan.\nThis Government should not cut corners when it comes to young people’s mental health. Good mental health starts in childhood. Labour’s vision for future generations is one where mental health conditions are treated early. Adverse childhood experiences are the greatest driver of mental illness in adulthood – it’s just common sense to get mental health treatment right for young people in order to transform the future of the country’s mental health. The next Labour Government will ensure access to a mental health professional in every school, and we will put an open access mental health hub in every community. Every child should have the ability to raise concerns about their mental health with someone they trust, in an environment in which they feel safe. All of this will be funded by ending tax breaks for private schools. Read my full article here Last week, I asked the Government how many enquiries to the Home Office from MPs are outstanding and how many older than six months are awaiting a reply.\nIt was incredibly disheartening, although not surprising, to learn that over 10,000 case enquiries have not been answered by the Home Office with nearly 1,000 of those waiting longer than six months. These enquiries cover urgent and compassionate cases and it is simply unacceptable that the Government have allowed such a huge backlog to accumulate. These are people’s lives, with their family lives and jobs often dependent on Home Office decisions – the Government simply has to get a grip.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_all_36/content_743.html": "|\nI have received lots of correspondence from local residents regarding the changes that have been made to our roads as part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood and the Streetspace schemes on the A24 (Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road). As part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood schemes, many streets have had filters put in to close the road to all vehicles except cycles and some now have turning restrictions. As part of the Streetspace scheme, a number of changes have been made to Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road including the installation of wands to segregate cycle lanes, a number of turning restrictions as well as changes to bus stops.\nThese changes have come about as a result of statutory guidance that the Government issued in May, stating that local authorities were expected to make significant changes to their road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians “as swiftly as possible”. (If you would like to read more about this statutory guidance you can read it in full here.) As a result, TfL made £55m of funding available to the 33 councils in London as part of its “Streetspace for London” programme to urgently create new segregated cycle lanes, extend pavements and close roads to traffic. Wandsworth Council was given £1,923,500 by TfL and used this money to implement the LTNs. TfL has, in consultation with Wandsworth Council but acting separately, implemented changes to the A24. I am supportive of initiatives which reduce car usage, make our streets safer, encourage cycling and create a better local environment. But we must make it work for everyone in Tooting and Balham. I know that lots of local residents have concerns and comments about how the changes have affected our community. The only way to have your voice heard is to feed into the consultations that Wandsworth Council is running and to let TfL know what you think by emailing them. To respond to Wandsworth Council's consultation, click here. To provide feedback to TfL please email: [email protected] It is important to note that I was not consulted prior to the implementation of these changes to our roads and I have no control over the decisions that have been made. As the local MP, I can lobby the Government and the relevant Ministers, but I cannot make decisions for the Conservative Council. I am listening and engaging with local residents on this but I cannot make alterations to these changes. If you have already provided your feedback to Wandsworth Council's consultation and/or emailed TfL, and you want to raise your concerns with other officials, you may also wish to contact Wandsworth Council's Transport spokesperson Councillor John Locker via email at [email protected], or the Government's Minister of State with responsibility for cycling and walking Chris Heaton-Harris MP via email at [email protected] Even before the pandemic hit, the case for investing in this kind of support was clear. Coronavirus has exacerbated the existing crisis in mental health. Many NHS and social care staff have been scared of going to work, and they have lost patients and colleagues. It has been heartbreaking to witness the toll this virus has taken on staff mental health. Current support is not good enough, and without a tailored, fast-tracked service for staff who have faced death and despair every day for over three months, our frontline heroes will continue to be failed. We need to care for our carers. It is time for the Government to give back to those who have sacrificed so much to keep our loved ones safe. Unless our staff are protected, they cannot continue their vital work of keeping us all safe. The consequences of not having adequate personal protective equipment for NHS staff are devastatingBarely a day goes by without pictures online of frontline staff fashioning protection out of clinical waste bags. We need to ensure NHS staff are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients.\nThe challenge that coronavirus poses to our society is unprecedented. It is a scary and worrying time, especially for our NHS. Having worked as a frontline A&E doctor this weekend, in my local hospital, I am increasingly concerned that our health service may buckle under the increased strain that Covid-19 has brought. Our only priority must be to protect lives. Every possible resource we have should be dedicated to that single objective. Crucially, our NHS and healthcare workers on the frontlines must be given whatever resources they need to tackle this and to save lives. It’s disheartening then, that basic resources are in short supply. Full personal protective equipment (PPE) is vital to not only protect frontline staff, but also to limit the spread of infection to our loved ones and to our patients. The Government have known this crisis was coming for weeks, and yet they still have not been fully prepared for it. A country like the UK should not be having to ask manufacturing companies to switch production to provide emergency ventilators, or for NHS workers to have to go without PPE. The first part of my shift this weekend was spent looking for the correct masks and aprons - this is happening to frontline workers ahead of every shift, across the country. While we would all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. The consequences of this for NHS staff are devastating. There’s a feeling amongst many frontline staff that protective equipment is already being rationed. A few weeks ago, the guidance for healthcare staff treating people with confirmed cases of Covid-19 was to wear a full FFP3 mask as well as gloves and a full apron - now, that guidance has changed and we are told to only wear gloves and a basic surgical mask. Barely a day goes by without pictures online of frontline staff fashioning protection out of clinical waste bags. We need full transparency on decisions and changes to guidance, otherwise concerns will only grow. As this virus spreads, and as more and more people are forced into hospital, NHS workers are going to have to start making very difficult choices because of the limited resources they have available. They are going to have to start deciding who can access the most urgent care, including who is given priority for the last available ventilator - they’ll be making impossible choices about whose lives can be saved. We have already seen this happening in Italy, and it is an unimaginable tragedy for medics who are dedicated to saving lives above all else. The best way to help frontline staff who go to work to save lives, is for everyone else to stay home. We will get through this, together. The Government must take responsibility for providing all the resources and equipment the NHS needs, including vital PPE, for communicating the message on social distancing clearly to the public, and for enforcing it robustly. I welcome the new, more stringent measures announced yesterday – however, as Mike Ashley has shown, there’s still room for people to exploit it. As a country, we must do what will save the most lives. That’s true of the Government, people across the country, and medics on the frontline. The faster we get on top of this disease, the faster our society will be able to tackle this virus, and fewer lives will be lost. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can and we will save lives. Sports Direct has shown exactly what not to do during this pandemic. If we’re to beat coronavirus, we have to be selflessThere seems to be a view amongst some under-70s, that coronavirus doesn’t really affect them and they don’t need to worry too much about it. I’ve listened to 69-year-olds tell me that because they themselves are fit and healthy, that it couldn’t possibly happen to them. Having just done a shift as a doctor in A&E over the weekend, I want to take this opportunity to warn people that this virus does not discriminate by age.\nIt was deeply, deeply eye-opening. Previously healthy people in their thirties and forties were seriously ill, some of them on ventilators. Being young does not grant you immunity to this disease. The symptoms of Covid-19 at its worst, are horrific. There can be no room for complacency. Our health service is facing an unprecedented crisis. There is a limited amount of vital equipment, including personal protective equipment for healthcare workers and precious ventilators. Every extra person in hospital requiring treatment means there are fewer resources available for others. London Covid-19 doctor says soon staff will be forced to choose whose life to saveRosena Allin-Khan, a Labour MP and A&E doctor, reveals ‘heart-wrenching’ decisions facing hospital workers\nRosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting and an A&E doctor, is still working regular shifts. On Sunday she worked at St George’s hospital in her south London constituency. She explains how the coronavirus pandemic has affected staff: I’ve been an A&E doctor for 15 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this before. The departments are quieter because people are staying away from hospital, but the patients are sicker. We’re seeing a distinct rise in the numbers coming in with respiratory symptoms, who are testing Covid-19 positive. On Sunday, very early in the morning, the entire resuscitation department, where the absolute sickest patients go, was full to capacity with patients with breathing difficulties. We had to move other very ill patients to the paediatric resuscitation area to keep them safe. This is only set to get worse. We’re seeing patients now who would have only contracted the virus two weeks ago. In the coming 10 days we expect the entire A&E department will be taken up with suspected Covid-19 patients. Doctors and nurses are brave, and the A&E department is known for being on the frontline and high risk, but there’s a palpable fear among staff for three reasons. Firstly, they’re frightened for their own health and those of the people they love. When I finished my shift yesterday, which was Mother’s Day, I came back to the house and I couldn’t touch or hug my two little girls until I put all my clothes in the wash and had a shower. The second reason is that staff expect, very soon, potentially to have to make heart-wrenching choices about whose life can be saved if we don’t have enough ventilators. That goes counter to everything you’ve ever learned as a doctor or nurse – to make life-and-death decisions, where we could possibly have saved every one of those people, is unimaginable. This is what our colleagues in Italy are living through now. Third, the patterns described thus far for symptoms of coronavirus are not what we’re now seeing in the emergency department. We’re seeing young, previously very healthy people, who are ill in hospital. Some are in their 30s, and they need ventilators to stay alive. Some patients are presenting with abdominal pain, which we hadn’t heard of before. A person can come in and say they have a stomach pain, and they’re put in the “green” area of the department – but then they mention they also have a cough. Everybody should be assumed to be Covid-positive until proven otherwise at this point. There’s also a real concern among staff around the country about personal protective equipment. They either don’t have any, or if they do many feel it’s being rationed. It’s very hard to listen to some colleagues say that as a result of there not being enough equipment to go round, they’re resigned to catching the virus – it’s just a matter of when. On social distancing, the messaging from the government hasn’t been clear enough. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has banned public gatherings of more than two people. It’s clear and easy to understand. There has to be no ambiguity in the language because people’s lives depend on it. Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives. The MP for Tooting has been working in her local hospital where doctors and nurses are already dealing with cases of covid-19. She warns that many of those being treated are in their 30s and 40s.\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan is the MP for Tooting but she is also a practising doctor in A&E. She regularly goes in to do shifts in her local hospital St George's and has been in contact with her colleagues. This Sunday she took a record down for Mirror readers about the situation faced by nurses, doctors and others on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus. She said her latest shift had been a \"deeply, deeply eye-opening\" experience with previously fit and healthy people in their 30s and 40s \"attached to machines, fighting for their lives\". And she has been deeply critical of the approach taken by the government in tackling the spread of the deadly virus. \"The Prime Minister has been blase about this from the start, waiting for others to make decisions so he doesn't have to. It is costing lives,\" she said. Mirror Diary - Sunday 22 March6.30am – Leaving the HouseOn the way to work in A&E, to help out the real heroes of the frontline – the NHS staff who work day-in, day-out to keep us all safe. I am a bit apprehensive after seeing the stories that are being reported about Covid-19 and having spoken to colleagues across the country, but we need to come together at times like these for our communities. 7am – Reporting for DutyJust finished handover, which is when the day shift gets given notes on the patients who have come in overnight. There’s a very real sense that the number of cases are growing extremely quickly, something that will present a real challenge in the coming days and weeks. Some of the sickest patients that have been admitted have been young – they’re in their 30s and 40s, previously fit and well, but now fighting for their lives in Intensive Care (ICU). There was a lot of talk in January that this was a virus just like the flu that only affects older people – that simply isn’t the case. There’s a real sense of apprehension ahead of the shift – we’re all expecting a rocky road ahead in the coming days. 8am- Protective EquipmentThe first part of the shift was spent looking for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – these are masks and aprons that keep those working on the frontlines safe. While we’d all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. Frontline staff across the country are scared. We’re scared that we’re going to lose patients – we have spent years training to save every life that we can. We are scared of passing this deadly virus onto our loved ones because we don’t always have the PPE that we so desperately need. We’re scared that that if we aren’t properly protected, that we run the risk of spreading the virus between patients. It’s vital that people practice social distancing measures properly – crowded areas will only add to the number of cases, and the number of people being admitted into hospitals across the country. In the coming days and weeks, difficult decisions will be made by my colleagues in ICU about who gets a ventilator – it’s that serious. Midday – Resus overwhelmedThe whole of resus is full of patients with respiratory problems – this is the part of A&E where the sickest patients go. Patients are arriving breathless, with crackles so fine in their lungs, you can hardly hear them. Their X-rays show white lungs where normally, they would look clear and black, full of air. Major trauma, such as heart attacks and victims of car crashes, are now being moved into paediatric A&E. The situation around Covid-19 is clearly getting worse by the day. The talk amongst the team is that we feel that we will be overwhelmed in the coming days. I’m going for a refresher course on ventilators for staff – they’re also training new staff on how to use ventilators. The talk is, of course, feeling quite bleak as the day goes on – but this is what we’ve all been trained for. 4pm – Leaving A&EJust leaving A&E now – it’s been a difficult shift and a difficult Mother’s Day. At times like these, we must think about our loved ones - if we want to protect those dearest to us, we must stay indoors. I’ve just called my husband and asked him to let our daughters know that they won’t be able to cuddle me and give me their handmade presents when I get home. Instead, I’ll be getting straight in the shower and throwing my clothes in the washing machine – it is our duty to protect the ones we love. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can, and we will, save lives. Former Labour MEP SEB DANCE explains why he is supporting Rosena Allin-Khan in the Labour deputy leadership race.\nBritain has left the EU. As a former Labour Member of the European Parliament, as a Remainer, and as a proud pro-European, that’s still not an easy thing for me to say – but it’s the reality. There is no longer a campaign to remain. That doesn’t mean that Boris Johnson’s famous lie of “get Brexit done” has suddenly come true. The ongoing negotiations with the EU will continue to define our country’s future for years to come. Perhaps one day the fight to join the EU will come. How soon that time comes depends on what we do next. Pro-Europeans must now fight for a close relationship between the UK and our friends in the EU and ongoing rights for UK citizens. The Labour Party must play a crucial role in that fight. That’s why I’m supporting Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan to become the next deputy leader of Labour. Rosena was elected as the MP for Tooting the week before the EU referendum in 2016. Despite holding a shadow frontbench position, she refused to compromise on her principles or on the promises she’d made to her community, so she broke the whip and voted against triggering Article 50. Considering the shambles that followed Theresa May’s early triggering of Article 50, this has been conclusively demonstrated as the right decision. Rosena was also the first shadow frontbench minister to come out publicly and call for a People’s Vote. This was an incredibly brave thing to do, at a time when Labour MPs and shadow ministers were being pressured not to speak out against the leadership’s position on Brexit. At a time when the leadership of Labour needed a firm push in the right direction, Rosena was the one brave enough to stand up and do it. There are some voices in the Labour Party, who’ll try to convince you that Brexit was the only reason for Labour’s failure at the last general election – that backing a public vote cost us seats in the so-called ‘Red Wall’. But this analysis is deeply misleading, and is simply not supported by the facts. Yes, of course Brexit was a divisive issue, for Labour as much as for anyone else. The reality however, is that the overwhelming majority of Labour voters, members and supporters voted Remain, wanted us to stay in the EU and wanted a public vote on Brexit. That fact is as true of Labour voters in Redcar, Grimsby or Wakefield as it is of Labour voters in Oxford, Islington or Bristol – Labour’s share of the vote went down in 98% of all seats. Labour’s position on Brexit was fatally undermined not because supporting a public vote was the wrong position for our voters, but because the leadership of the party took so long to get to that position. We sat in the middle of the road on the biggest issue of our time and neither side trusted us. We lost trust among all our communities. Rosena knows this – she won’t stop standing up for our internationalist values. I joined the Labour Party because I believe in internationalism and solidarity across borders. So does Rosena. That’s why she’s worked across the world in conflict and disaster zones as a humanitarian doctor, and why she still does shifts in her local hospital as an A&E doctor alongside her work as an MP. So if you are like me – a proud pro-European, an internationalist and a Labour supporter – and if you want someone as deputy leader who’ll stand up for those values, and who’ll fight for our country to maintain the closest possible relationship with the EU, protecting our workers’ rights, our environmental protections, our food standards, our NHS, and most importantly the rights of EU citizens living in the UK – then vote for Doctor Rosena. Together, let’s take Labour forward. Rosena Allin-Khan MP: \"I want to inspire Asians to own their identity”A CANDIDATE in the race for Labour’s deputy leadership has admitted the party “lost trust with voters” following its crushing defeat in the December general election.\nTooting MP Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is up against fellow MPs Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler, Ian Murray and Angela Rayner in the race, triggered by Labour’s huge loss last year. Suffering one of its worst results since 1935, Labour lost dozens of seats which they had held for decades, including a number of constituencies in the Midlands and northern England, which historically tended to support the party. The loss was down to a lack of trust, Allin- Khan believes. “People, quite frankly, didn’t trust us to govern,” the MP told Eastern Eye. “We had a manifesto which I believe was full of good things, but voters didn’t trust us to deliver it.” The party’s stance on Brexit was an additional factor – “we didn’t seem decisive enough” – and the level of anti-Semitism in the party and the way it was subsequently handled “closed a lot of doors”. “I’ve been up and down the country talking to individuals, wondering why Labour lost, and I’ve been told by activists that people didn’t think we had our own house in order,” she said. Today, she said, the most common concern of voters is the NHS, the level of safety on the streets and housing. “We need to show that the hopes and dreams that people have for themselves are the ones that we (Labour) have for them,” the mother-of-two said. Next month’s contest will also see the unveiling of a new Labour leader, after Jeremy Corbyn announced he would be stepping down following the general election last year. Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey are in the running to lead the opposition party. Allin-Khan, however, will not be voicing her support for any of the candidates as she believes the party needs to “heal all divisions (and) unite” after it fared so badly in the election. “When I’m working in A&E and I see kids coming in with lung infections because of mouldy housing or I see kids who have to go to food banks (…) they don’t care if Labour is left, right or centre,” she explained. “So, the most important thing to move forward is to unite and I can show that by not nominating someone for leader.” On her role in the deputy leadership race, Allin-Khan said she was determined to use it as an opportunity to help “ethnic minorities own their identity and be proud of it”. “That is what I want people to feel I embody when they look at me,” she explained. “For me, being in this race, if that is the one thing I get out of this…that other young British Asians can look at me and say, ‘if she can do it, I can do it too’, then that is my job done.” Allin-Khan admitted she had faced prejudice due to her mixed Pakistani-Polish heritage and has received criticism that she “isn’t fully Asian”. In response to the comments, the MP is keen to highlight her mixed heritage does not make her Asian background any less “important, valuable or special.” “I identify with being an Asian woman, in the same way that I am proud to be Polish,” she said. “Some people in the Asian community wonder how Asian I feel because I’m mixed race, but I’m proud to wear my sari and embrace my heritage.” Some have even suggested that she change her forename to Rosie and take her husband’s surname to downplay her ethnicity. However, Allin-Khan is proud of her roots and is keen to emphasise it. “I went double barrelled because I didn’t want to lose the Asian part of my surname and that for me, is very important,” she said. “I am proud to say that this is who I am – a Polish and Pakistani, proudly British Muslim woman who loves the Labour party.” Born and brought up in Tooting in a working-class household, Allin-Khan described her young life as “tough”. Her mother worked three jobs to keep the family financially afloat, and Allin-Khan recalled there only being one heater in the house that they had to move from room to room to keep themselves warm. Allin-Khan failed her A-Levels, citing the difficulties at home as a factor. Despite the setbacks, she still had a desire to study medicine. However, she was told “it wasn’t for girls like (her)”, as it was financially prohibitive, and she didn’t come from the “right background”. Allin-Khan, who still works part-time as a doctor, knew she had to keep fighting if she wanted to pursue her dream career. “I think my upbringing led me to believe I had no choice but to sink or swim,” she said. After resitting her A-Levels, the then-24-year-old accepted a place to study medicine at Lucy Cavendish College, University of Cambridge, which was funded by scholarships. “I really believe that where you start off in life doesn’t need to dictate where you end up,” the A&E doctor said. Although she credited her own resilience for her success, Allin-Khan believes the Labour government gave her an opportunity to fulfil her potential when things looked bleak. “The Labour government turned my life around,” the 43-year-old claimed. “I redid my A-Levels, did a degree and went to Cambridge to study medicine and I’m afraid those possibilities aren’t going to be there for a new generation of kids under this Tory government.” Allin-Khan, the MP for Tooting since 2016, admitted the biggest challenge of her involvement in politics is racism. She often faces abuse on social media and is mostly targeted for her Muslim beliefs. “When I look at the order in which my abuse comes, it is Muslim first, then my Asian heritage comes second,” she admitted. “My gender is third. Without a doubt, the amount of abuse is a huge challenge.” It is a concern that young BAME women may be deterred from entering politics due to the abuse other politicians have faced, she said. In response, Allin-Khan regularly engages with schools and community groups to encourage young people to “keep going and not to lose faith”. There is also a level of racism in the House of Commons, she said, highlighting that she is the first Muslim person ever to make it on to the deputy leadership ballot. Although it is encouraging to see more women and ethnic minority politicians in parliament, Allin-Khan believes there is “still a ceiling on what we can achieve”. Recently, Allin-Khan approached a “prominent BAME politician” to ask them to consider nominating her in the deputy leadership contest. However, the politician responded: “I’m only in the game of backing winners and you don’t look like you’ve got any chance of winning.” “We can’t have that attitude towards people, and I’ve said in my grassroots revival plan that our BAME communities can’t be an afterthought when it comes to supporting people to hold public office,” she said. “We need to be seeing ethnic minorities at the top of our party, on the front benches. “I’ve smashed that ceiling, but I plan to throw the ladder down and say people ‘come up behind, you can do this.’ But I know it isn’t easy.” My pledge to rebuild confidence in LabourI never imagined that one day I’d become an MP, or now a candidate to become the next Deputy Leader of the Labour Party. Growing up, I was regularly told that ‘girls like me’ from ‘backgrounds like mine’ wouldn’t amount to anything. I never planned to go into politics - I always wanted to be a doctor. The last Labour Government gave me that chance, allowing me to study Medicine aged 24 after failing my A-Levels the first time around because of pressures at home. This shaped the person that I am today and has given me the fire in my belly to ensure that no other child feels that there is a ceiling on what they can achieve.\nWhen I work shifts as an A&E doctor at my local hospital, I see first-hand the issues facing our communities today. I treat young people who come to A&E after self-harming, I treat those who haven’t been able to access mental health services for years, and yes, I treat victims of violent crime. To see a young person breathe their last breath is a pain that never leaves you. Teenage boys, once full of bravado on the street, with the words “Born to die” tattooed on their chests, victims of horrific stab wounds, laying there crying out for their mothers. The sound of a parent grieving for their child is universal - it can’t be forgotten. As the MP for Tooting, I have worked incredibly closely with community groups and young people to try and tackle the rise of violent crime in our society. I’ve organised summits with representatives from local community organisations, charities, the police, the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Council and the Deputy Mayor for Policing, to start tackling this problem from a community perspective. Working with affected communities is paramount in order to resolve these critical issues once and for all. As a keen boxer myself, I have promoted the work of local boxing clubs to tackle violent crime. Boxing is far more than just a sport - for many, it’s family. Clubs offer an opportunity for local young ¬people to make friends, engage with sport and receive mentorship. So much of gang culture and violence is about a sense of belonging. We have a duty to show young people that, if you can gain respect in the ring, you do not have to get respect from violence on the street. One of the reasons I decided to run to become the next Deputy Leader of the Labour Party is because it would give me the platform to give a voice to the voiceless. Whether it’s children losing their lives to senseless violence, older people being unable to access safe and decent social care, or refugees fleeing violence and persecution, their voices must be amplified. A platform alone isn’t enough though - Labour needs to be in power to affect real change for the most vulnerable in our communities. As Deputy Leader, I will rebuild our movement into one people can vote for. A party people can trust. The door may have closed on 12 December for a generation’s hopes and ambitions, but with the right leadership team in place in the Labour Party, it will not be closed for good. We need to win the next General Election, and we must listen to our voters ahead of the Mayoral election in May. As Deputy Leader, it will be my responsibility to rebuild trust, not just with the grassroots of our party, but with voters. Together, we can take Labour forward. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is MP for Tooting and candidate for Deputy Leader of Labour NHS workers battling coronavirus are facing a “national shortage” of protective clothing, HuffPost UK has been told.Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan, a working doctor who still works shifts in A&E, said scientists had told her that there were not enough body suits in the right sizes, while some doctors were only now starting to receive protective clothing.\nIt came amid new official estimates suggesting 5,000 to 10,000 people in the UK have coronavirus, leaving many doctors, nurses and other health workers at risk of infection. Last month, the World Health Organisation also warned that there was a global shortage of protective masks and body suits. One NHS source who worked at a hospital where coronavirus patients were being treated told HuffPost UK: “There were staff forced to wear oversized suits because that’s all they had. “All we have left is XL. “There is a national shortage of suits but this was raised with the government at least three weeks ago so something should have been done.” Appearing on HuffPost UK’s Commons People podcast, Allin-Khan repeated the concerns. “I held a meeting today with some people from the scientific community and they said their concern was though they had been testing out various modes of protective clothing, it turns out that there is a lack of the clothing they need available, the sizes aren’t available,” she said. “Just yesterday - because people still contact me because I’m a doctor still, to let me know what’s going on - someone said they were a GP and had only started receiving the necessary protective clothing yesterday and this has been going on for a month now. The Labour deputy leadership candidate criticised the government for moving too slowly to tackle from coronavirus. In a departure from Labour’s broad support for the government, Allin-Khan called for tougher measures to tackle the outbreak, including testing those with symptoms for the virus as a matter of course. Allin-Khan said the government’s testing programme could be “more robust”, reporting that “friends in the NHS” said people were being given “really unclear messaging”. She gave an example of two people who returned from northern Italy who phoned NHS 111 and were told to wait for a call back which did not come for five days, during which time they self isolated. When they eventually spoke again to NHS staff, they had to give their details again and had to self-isolate for eight days before finally being tested for coronavirus. Test results are also taking three to five days to materialise. Allin-Khan said: “We need to be moving quicker, people need to have a better idea of how to access testing, what it means for their daily lives. “The messaging needs to be clearer and the testing needs to be more robust.” She added: “We should have moved into the delay phase sooner than now and I don’t think we should measure our performance compared to what other countries are doing. “I think we should be looking at what’s best for us and when you look at the fact that China had the same number of cases that we already have surpassed before implementing measures we do need to be listening to what the other scientific community, for example some eminent epidemiologists, listen to what they’re saying. “Because ultimately we can’t leave the scientific community to be scapegoated for the government making bad decisions if they are proven to be wrong.” Allin-Khan meanwhile sidestepped questions on whether she wants to be shadow health secretary under the next Labour leader. “I like to focus on one thing at a time, genuinely, and I don’t think you should ever have a plan B because that’s implying you’ve accepted that your plan A won’t work out,” she said. “So I am genuinely, steely focused on winning this deputy leadership bid.” Put to her that she would be a good fit for the job, she replied: “Well I am a practising NHS doctor and I have got a master’s degree in public health and I care about our party so that’s honestly for whoever is the leader to decide.” |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_previous_4/content_492.html": "|\nData from National Rail and the Rail Delivery Group has revealed a shocking rise in the number of late trains at Balham, Earlsfield, Tooting and Wandsworth Common stations. Trains in the morning evening peaks, to and from Central London, have all seen a worsening of their \"on-time percentage\" in the last six months compared to the same period of 2023. The full breakdown of delays at each station is below. It is shocking to see that, not only are trains late at some stations late half the time, but that there has been a steady decline from an already-unacceptable level of lateness last year. Particularly concerning are the figures at Tooting station, where over half of services were late despite there being only two services per hour on that line.\nSome of the worst performing services include: 8:05 from Balham (8:07 from Wandsworth Common) to Victoria - 88% late (Southern) 18:12 from Waterloo to Earlsfield - 81% late (South Western) 8:21 from Balham to Victoria - 79% late (Southern) 8:40 from Balham (8:42 from Wandsworth Common) to Victoria - 76% late (Southern) 8:13 from Tooting to London Blackfriars - 70% late (Thameslink) Local commuters deserve better than the shoddy service they are currently receiving from Southern, South Western and Thameslink. I look forward to the Government's plans to bring our local rail services back into public control, so that our trains are always run with the interests of the people who use them at heart.\nWe did it! I want to give a massive thank you to everyone who went out and voted yesterday.\nI am so proud to have been re-elected with an increased 19,487 majority. Wishing everyone a very Happy Pride today!\nWhile we celebrate the progress over the years, we must remember that there is still much work to be done to end hatred and discrimination against the LGBT+ community, at home and across the world.\nIf you're a postal voter, your ballot should arrive any day now, if it hasn’t already. It is short and easy. Remember don't delay and send it back and it would be an honour if you would re-elect me as your Member of Parliament.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Shamefully, the Minister refused to commit to funding. This is just further proof that this Tory Government couldn't care less about our NHS heroes.\nYesterday, I was delighted to join CEN for their Healing our Broken Village Black Mental Health Conference at the New Testament Assembly church in Tooting.\nWith continued racial disparities in sectioning and the use of community treatment orders, more must be done to bring about much-needed change.\nThe Tories' Rwanda Bill is one of the most shameful pieces of legislation in recent memory on both moral and practical grounds, which is why I voted 20 times against the Bill last night.\nAs part of my former role as Shadow Minister for Mental Health, I worked very closely with Melanie Leahy and other campaigners affected by the terrible deaths in Essex mental health hospitals.\nThe Terms of Reference for the inquiry into this scandal have now at long last been published. This inquiry has been beset by delays since the beginning, which is simply not good enough.\nOne of the most fulfilling parts of my role as your MP is helping local people solve problems and, in this case, save money.\nA Furzedown pensioner had been denied over £12,000 in backdated pension payments and Pension Credit, however following my intervention with the Department for Work and Pensions, this money was recouped.

My thoughts and prayers are especially with all those facing hardship and suffering at this time.\nMaking Wandsworth a greener and cleaner borough was a key policy in our campaign in the 2022 local elections, which is why I'm delighted that the new Labour administration in the Town Hall have now rolled out food waste recycling bins across the local area.\nIt is shameful that the Prime Minister continues to allow the sale of British weapons and military equipment to Israel.in breach of the UK's international commitments. I have been calling for a suspension of sales immediately and my comments can be read in the Independent here. Last week, I also signed a joint letter to the Foreign and Business Secretaries alongside a cross-party group of over 130 MPs, calling for the halting of UK arms sales to Israel. The full text of this letter can be read below.\nIt was fantastic to join Dermot and Alison on the This Morning medical segment again; this time to talk about rashes and what to look out for.\nRashes can be difficult to see on darker skin tones and this can lead to delayed treatment and poorer outcomes, which is why it's especially important to be aware of the different symptoms and nuances.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_local_7/content_678.html": "|\nFollowing reports from local residents of increased levels of speeding on Blackshaw Road, I am pleased that the police agreed to my suggestion of increased speed watches around the local area. Given that there is a nursery and St George's Hospital along this road, it is vital that speed levels are stringently enforced to ensure everyone's safety.\nI will continue to work with the police, Wandsworth Council and local councillors to keep our streets safe and accessible. To this end, I am very pleased to hear that the council is currently considering implementing a zebra crossing outside the nursery to protect both children and parents. Today, I have written to the Managing Director of the Southern Region of Network Rail calling for an investigation looking into improving accessibility and step-free access at Wandsworth Common Station.\nCurrently, there is step free access on Platform 1, but those wishing to travel on Platform 2 must cross an elevated footbridge, which is not accessible for wheelchair users, parents with young children, and the elderly. I have called for a feasibility study to be conducted, given the signifcant proportion of the local community that falls around the station. Read my full letter here: After cutting services through Earlsfield station for commuters since the pandemic, South Western Railway have announced that no services will run through Earlsfield from 19 December until 2 January, ostensibly due to industrial action. SWR is keeping 28 stations open in London through this period, of which 21 have lower passenger usage than Earlsfield. Only big hubs, such as Clapham Junction, Wimbledon and Waterloo, have higher passenger numbers than Earlsfield - this is simply not good enough! Add your name to my open letter calling for an immediate reconsideration of the decision not to run services through Earlsfield and a full explanation of why this decision was taken in the first place. Recently, I visited the fantastic team at Love Triangle, a brilliant pizza restaurant situated between Balham and Tooting Bec.\nThey’ve been selling pizza to the community for two and a half years now, but things are getting increasingly difficult. The cost-of-living crisis is hitting small businesses hard, with customers having less money to spend to things such as meals out, and the cost of energy and supplies rising astronomically. Will, who owns Love Triangle, told me that despite trying many different creative ways to stay afloat, things are only getting more difficult. Love Triangle have tried different opening times, and an array of different promotions and deals to help combat the challenges, but it is still far from easy, just to keep their head above water. The rising cost of food and energy, coupled with the reduction in disposable income for many is proving a difficult picture to navigate. Speaking to Will, and other business owners in our community, one message stands out. It is crucial to support local businesses where you can, or we risk losing more of our fantastic local businesses from Tooting, and across the country. Watch my visit to Love Triangle here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1599084624847642624?s=20&t=xq-atIy2mtAe0cDqI51dLw It was great to bring together local charities, faith leaders, and leader of Wandsworth Council, Simon Hogg who are all working tirelessly to support local families through the cost-of-living crisis.\nI have already been contacted by countless Tooting residents who are concerned about how they are going to pay their bills and put food on the table this winter, and I fear this will only get worse as we move further into the winter months. With so many households already feeling the squeeze, it’s crucial that we work together to tackle poverty. Representatives from Earlsfield and Wandsworth foodbanks as well as Dons Local Action Group and Little Village Tooting told me that they are seeing unprecedented demand at present, as more and more of those who were just-about-managing become unable to afford the basics. All the organisations represented spoke of the added difficulties the rise in energy prices have brought. The hike in energy prices has meant that even the local charities who are there to address the crisis are struggling to pay their bills, and this means they are less able to help those in need. This comes at the worst possible time, when demand is at it’s highest level for decades. Everyone at the event had numerous stories of people facing hardship, people in overcrowded accommodation, people not being able to put food on the table or buy school uniforms for their children. Many people are also concerned about how they will meet the additional cost of christmas. Despite heartbreaking stories, it was uplifting to see so many people who donate their time, energy and money into making things better for people in our community. I am always amazed by the generosity of people in Tooting. However, in Britain in 2022 these organisations and charitable schemes shouldn’t have to exist. It is imperative that the Government take action immediately to support people through the months ahead. It was great to attend and speak at the annual Balham and Tooting Community Association’s multi-faith peace ceremony in Tooting Broadway.\nLocal people of all faiths and none gathered to celebrate all that unites us. We heard prayers and moving speeches from leaders of six different faiths and school students. I love representing a community where so many faiths are represented. People of all faiths and none live and work alongside each other in our community and I was honoured to be part of such a joyous occasion that celebrates our diversity and our commitment to common values of tolerance and understanding. Leaders from Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh communities spoke and prayed in their own traditions. Senior school pupils from Al Risalah Girls Secondary School spoke of what their faith means to them and their hopes for peace. This event has taken place in Tooting for many years now and it’s always an inspiring and uplifting event that I look forward to attending. It’s always fantastic to see our community come together. Thank you to all who attending and to those who worked so hard to make this event a success. I've written to the Chief Executive of Bellway on behalf of residents at Fitzgerald and Fleming Houses on St George's Grove, many of whom have been left in limbo, unable to sell or re-mortgage their properties due to the flammable cladding that was installed by Bellway, when the houses were built. In May, London Fire Brigade instituted a waking watch on both of the buildings due to fire risk, which residents were forced to pay for themselves. I have been working alongside Bellway resident directors in good faith for months but have been met with delay and excuses while their properties remain without a suitable facade. My position is clear: Developers must fund remediations works on these properties and the replacement of the cladding to the new required standard. Leaseholders cannot be held liable for these costs. To add your name to the letter, sign below. There were so many fantastic events across Tooting to celebrate Black History Month, which is celebrated in October.\nIt was great to see Wandsworth Council celebrate the contributions of black business owners, and other influential members of the blakc community make to our borough. Many of our local libraries were host to brilliant events where black authors could share their stories with the community. A series of videos published online celebrated the brilliant contributions to local creative industries. I know that many residents particularly enjoyed the pop up street food event celebrating some of the best cuisine from across Africa and the Caribbean. My personal highlight was attending the Roots and Culture event in Tooting, where dancers, musicians, poetry, comedy, and fantastic street food stalls showed some of the best of African and Caribbean culture. It was great to see how well attended all these events were, and great to see our community coming together to celebrate the cultures of the black communities here in Tooting. Thank you to everyone who attended and helped to organise these events! I was deeply concerned to hear pupils at Graveney School in Tooting were being targeted in a recent spate of muggings. I have been in touch with local police leadership to insist on swift action to address this issue. I know that the police are actively working to identify and arrest those responsible.\nEvery child deserves to walk our streets without fear. I am therefore pleased to hear that the local police force are carrying out high visibility patrols and are carrying out regular weapon sweeps around the school. Police are also patrolling the area in unmarked cars to try and identify and arrest the suspects. Pupils at Graveney School have also received assemblies on how to keep safe and how to report a street crime. The local police have also liaised with local CCTV to ensure appropriate coverage. It is vital that all of these issues are reported to the police so they can bring these worrying incidents to an end as quickly as possible. Anyone who has been a victim of a street robbery in this area who is yet to report the incident to the police are advised to do so. Please be assured, I will continue to work with our local police team to resolve this issue as quickly as possible, and I will continue to follow this case as a matter of urgency. It is an honour to have been unanimously re-selected by all the local party branches and affiliated organisations to stand as Labour’s candidate for Tooting in the next general election.\nI want to say a huge thank you to all the members and affiliates who took part, and who continue to put their trust in me to represent our community. Serving as the Member of Parliament for the community I grew up in is an honour. From helping local residents with casework, playing a part in winning the council, defending our NHS and serving as the shadow Minister to Mental Health - I have the best job in the world. My job is made even greater by the fantastic support local members show me all year round, so I want to take this opportunity to say a big thank you to them all! The next election is make-or-break for our party, we simply must win. I’m looking forward to working hard to make this happen. The NHS is being dismantled, I see it every time I work a shift. More people than ever are relying on foodbanks, and the cost-of-living crisis is having a devastating impact on people locally and across the country. I will be absolutely committed to doing everything I can to put Labour into Government and make the changes this country so desperately needs. Thank you again to everyone who voted. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_previous_21/content_700.html": "|\nThere is a crisis in our universities up and down the country, with record numbers of students now seeking mental health support, according to our latest research. Through Freedom of Information requests, we found that over 200,000 students sought support for their mental health across the UK in 2020-2021 – a threefold increase, since 2010. The lack of mental health support for our young people is not only affecting their health, but it also having a knock-on impact on their future prospects.\nUniversities are struggling to cope with the rising demand for access to the mental health treatment students need. Every five days, a student takes their own life. That is why Labour has put forward a comprehensive plan, that will put prevention of the heart of mental health services. Under Labour’s plan, we will recruit 8,500 new mental health professionals by the end of our first term in office, to see an addition one million patients per year. See more about the crisis in mental health at universities, here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1579388728153604098?s=20&t=CcG6Wxm1iHr6xo0Cfsjyww Working with the MP for Bury South, we brought an Urgent Question to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care demanding a statement in response to BBC Panorama’s alarming reports of abuse, excessive restraint, segregation and seclusion at the Edenfield Centre in Prestwich. The episode aired on BBC over two weeks ago yet there has not been a single statement or response from the Secretary of State.\nToday in Parliament, I demanded that the Secretary of State provide patients, and their families, the much-needed answers they deserve into these alarming allegations. I also challenged the Secretary of State on this Government’s commitment to reducing the need for restraint and restrictive intervention as it had pledged to do in 2019. See my statement in Parliament here https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1580509847417917440?s=20&t=Gj2YhL3GB3Os4nSrRoGK7Q Parents arriving in A&E with ashen faces holding their children, whose bodies are skeletal and covered in cuts. Families are on suicide watch. Frontline NHS workers are at breaking point. This is the reality of Tory Britain in 2022.\nOur latest research has shown that more than a million patients referred to mental health services were turned away over the last 12 months, whilst the cost of mental illness to the British economy is £117 billion a year. This is the direct result of 12 years of Conservative mismanagement of our economy and public services. We need a growing economy to pay for modern, preventative sustainable healthcare, but we can only do this with a Labour Government that will put our public services back on track. The next Labour Government will transform our mental health services: new staff, new services, faster treatment, and prevention as our watchword. Better mental health for all. Read my latest piece in the Daily Mirror here. https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1579113927438663681?s=20&t=FTZA6bYs6BUjLJ-vVYAmzg The Prime Minister has been forced to abandon her unfunded tax cut for the 1% of highest earners.\nThis Government U-turn is too late for the families who will pay higher mortgages for years to come. It will also do nothing to help or to reassure the people in Tooting and beyond. The Tories have destroyed their economic credibility and damaged trust in the British economy. Twelve years of Tory government have left the economy in chaos, and the new Prime Minister continues to make it up as she goes along. Today’s U-turn does not mark a move away from disastrous Tory economics, it’s just some districation. The Government needs to reverse their trickle down strategy. It just doesn’t work. Instead, they need to offer a programme of measures that will offer real support to those struggling with rises in food and energy bills, and increases in rent and mortgage payments. Too many people will struggle to pay their bills and put food on the table this winter, and the Government must step in now. Labour will revolutionise mental health treatment – putting prevention front and centre.\nIf ever there was an argument that prevention is better than cure, it is with mental health. We know that the longer mental illnesses are left untreated, the harder and more costly they are to treat. This mental health crisis is wrecking the British economy. Last year, 18 million work days were lost to mental illness - more than industrial disputes, more than injuries. It costs the UK economy at least £117 billion a year. And who does the cost-of-living crisis hit the hardest? Those already living with mental illnesses. The next Labour Government will guarantee treatment within a month, recruit 8,500 new staff, put a specialist in every school and a hub in every community. Labour will transform our mental health services: New staff. New services. Faster treatment. Prevention as our watchword. Better mental health for all.

I will be absolutely committed to doing everything I can to put Labour into Government and make the changes this country so desperately needs. Thank you again to everyone who voted. Recently I visited the fantastic Balham Ballers holiday club, based at Ravensbourne Primary school.\nBalham Ballers provide a sports programme for young people aged five to twelve over the school holidays, focusing mainly on football but also giving young people a chance to enjoy a wide range of other sporting activities. I have loved working with the Balham Ballers team over the last few years and it has been fantastic to see them go from strength to strength. Balham Ballers are passionate about promoting a love of sports amongst both boys and girls. This is something that I am particularly supportive of. Following the Lionesses' fantastic win at the Euros earlier this month, the England football team have said \"every girl should be given the chance to play football at school.\" However, currently only 63% of schools offer equal access to football, a number that falls to just 44% at secondary schools. It was great to see so many young people in our community enjoying football, and I even took a penalty myself! To find out more about the Balham Ballers, click here. Fresh off the back of our trip to South Wales yesterday, Luke Pollard MP and I continued to take the fight to the Tories today, this time in Reading.\nWe kicked off the day with a doorknocking session in Reading West, another Tory-held marginal seat where it is essential Labour wins at the next general election. We were delighted to be joined by my colleague, Matt Rodda, MP for Reading East, who took us to a community-run cafe to show the empowering work that local people are doing on a daily basis. Reading is a great example of what Labour can do in power - the town's carbon emissions have been reduced by 70% in the last 12 years and the Council is currently investing £88 million in over 300 new social housing homes across Reading. Today, my friend Luke Pollard MP and I visited the lush landscape of South Wales in order to continue our fight to put Keir Starmer in 10 Downing Street.\nWe visited Barry Island (cue many Gavin and Stacey references!) in the Vale of Glamorgan seat and Chepstow in Monmouth - two vitally important areas that Labour needs to win to form a government. Labour took control of both Vale of Glamorgan & Monmouthshire Councils after the May elections and I greatly enjoyed campaigning with local members, building on that momentum in order to elect two new Labour MPs at the next election. Of course, a trip to Barry Island would not be complete without a wander down the beautiful seafront, complete with ice cream. Lloniannau! It was great to visit the wonderful volunteers at the White Eagle Club in Balham recently. The Tooting and Balham Community has rallied together to support the appeal for Ukraine since the Russian invasion in March. Since the appeal was launched, the White Eagle Club has sent 74 trucks, 112 vans, and a massive 1,800 tonnes of goods to Ukraine as part of their humanitarian aid mission. They have also provided many Ukrainian nationals who have recently fled to the UK with clothes, shoes, toiletries, and supplies for babies and infants. It’s always amazing to see the community come together to help those in need. There is however, still much more that the White Eagle Club needs, both for Ukrainian nationals arriving in the UK and to be sent to those still living in Ukraine. Items that are most in need include; medical supplies, toiletries, sanitary products and baby powder, as well as clothes for those who have recently arrived in the UK. You can donate items to 211 Balham High Street at the following times: Tuesdays: 11.00 - 20.00 Wednesday: 10.00 - 17.00 Thursday: 11.00-20.00 Friday: 10.00-17.00 Saturday 10.00-17.00 |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

It has been a year of change and renewal - full of ups and downs - but as I enter into my ninth year as your Member of Parliament for Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting, it remains the greatest honour of my life to represent the community in which I was born and raised. Entering the new year, I would like to pay tribute to the incredible frontline workers working around the clock to keep the country going through the festive period. From our NHS services to local hospitality staff to food bank volunteers - you all have my heartfelt gratitude for your tireless work this Christmas and throughout the year. A year for democracyWhat a year it has been for elections, both locally and across the country. We began the year with a fantastic win in the Tooting Broadway by-election, increasing the Labour vote share by nearly 7% to a whopping 58% majority. Then came the Mayoral elections in May, when we kept London red by electing my Tooting predecessor Sadiq Khan to a historic third term as Mayor of London. Finally - and most importantly - we finally elected a new Labour Government after 14 long years, with areas up and down the country voting Labour for the very first time. It was humbling to receive the most votes of any Labour MP and thanks must go to everyone who voted for me - your support means the world. £100m to fix Wandsworth PrisonAfter years of campaigning - and countless stories of mismanagement and scandal - the Ministry of Justice announced a £100 million funding package for HMP Wandsworth. This will go a long way to reduce the impact of overcrowding, repair crumbling cell blocks and facilities, and ensure that prison guards can work in a safe environment. Delivering for everyone in TootingThousands of local people have contacted me this year regarding a variety of issues, I have dealt with 15,000 cases. I reclaimed tens of thousands in unpaid pensions or benefits for local people, got decisions on hundreds of delayed passport or visa applications, and helped countless local residents get repairs to their homes. My door is always open and please get in touch if there is anything I can help with. On the NHS frontline\nSpeaking up for Gaza It has now been over a year since the horrific 7th October attacks and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza. The humanitarian disaster we have seen unfold there in the time since, has been truly heartwrenching. This year, I've raised the issue numerous times in Parliament, visited the region in the spring, and held evidence sessions with humanitarian experts. Revitalising Tooting town centre\nThis Morning and Loose Women Using my background as an NHS doctor, I have enjoyed trying my hand at being a TV medic this year! The lovely people at This Morning and Loose Women have had me on many times to talk about a range of topics from mental health to medical emergencies and even gave me space to open up about my own childhood challenges with speech, in a bid to end stigma and help others. Work in Parliament\nKeeping our streets safe in 2024, I successfully campaigned for a tripling of the Tooting neighbourhood policing team, putting more bobbies on our streets. In the summer, Operation Kenny run by the Metropolitan Police resulted in a 70% reduction in crime in Tooting town centre. This work will continue with the new Government's plans to recruit 13,000 new officers and return policing to communities. Cleaning up the local area I have never stopped campaigning for cleaner streets. This year saw a 15% reduction in fly-tipping in Wandsworth, with thousands of fines issued to people dumping their bulky rubbish on our streets. Meanwhile, Wandsworth Labour introduced food recycling for the first time ever in the borough. Free School Meals roll-out\nMental health reform Mental health is incredibly important to me and, for far too long, much-needed reforms were swept under the rug by a Conservative Government that simply wasn't interested. After much hard work, it was fantastic to see reform of the Mental Health Act announced in the King's Speech in July - this was long overdue.\nThe beginning of Mental Health Awareness week was marked by grim tidings that, for the first time in recorded history, the number of people on an waiting list for mental health treatment has hit 2 million.\nThis is more than the combined population of four major British cities and is a shocking indictment of the Tories' failed record on mental health.\nAs someone who grew up with and later overcame a stammer, I know all too well the difficulties and challenges that having one can bring. I was very glad and honoured to join Dermot and Alison on This Morning once again to talk about stammers and the wonderful work that Stamma charity do.\nAs someone who has had close friends and family members with eating disorders, I know just how damaging and dangerous they can be. I was proud to join my friend Hope Virgo at the Dump The Scales march to Parliament Square on Saturday with hundreds of campaigners and activists.\nThe Government’s attitude towards eating disorders must fundamentally change. They must listen to campaigners and experts, like Hope, to ensure everyone with an eating disorder gets the care they need. It was brilliant to speak at the Watercooler event in the ExCeL London today, for a discussion on mental health in Government and the NHS.\nRather than railing against a \"sick note\" culture as Rishi Sunak has done recently, we must be encouraging more openness and understanding around mental health.\nAs part of my previous work as Shadow Minister for Mental Health and in my capacity as an A&E doctor at St George's, I know firsthand the toll that working on the NHS frontline can take.\nToday, I asked the Government whether they will continue to fund mental health support services past the 12 months they've committed to. Shamefully, the Minister refused to commit to funding. This is just further proof that this Tory Government couldn't care less about our NHS heroes.\nYesterday, I was delighted to join CEN for their Healing our Broken Village Black Mental Health Conference at the New Testament Assembly church in Tooting.\nWith continued racial disparities in sectioning and the use of community treatment orders, more must be done to bring about much-needed change.\nAs part of my former role as Shadow Minister for Mental Health, I worked very closely with Melanie Leahy and other campaigners affected by the terrible deaths in Essex mental health hospitals.\nThe Terms of Reference for the inquiry into this scandal have now at long last been published. This inquiry has been beset by delays since the beginning, which is simply not good enough.\nAfter more than a year of waiting, the Government has finally responded to the Joint Committee report on the draft Mental Health Bill.\nIn that time, they kicked mental health into the long grass while patients continued to suffer. The Government response is poor - rejecting vital calls for a Mental Health Commissioner, refusing to ban discriminatory Community Treatment Orders and ignoring a right to culturally appropriate advocacy. Why make us wait so long and not provide any meaningful change? With waiting lists higher than ever, we need bold action on mental health. It is clear the Tories are simply not up to the job. A Labour Government must bring forward mental health reform with the recommendations of the committee at its core. Every year in Westminster, there is a debate on Children's Mental Health Awareness Week. Every year, politicians agree the children's mental health crisis must end. But nothing changes and children continue to be let down by inaction. Today, I led calls in Parliament for this to change. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

In October 2020, I organised and chaired a roundtable with leading trans charities to discuss mental health, discrimination, and how we can work together to tackle it. I will always be an ally of the trans community. As MP for Tooting and Shadow Minister for Mental Health, I want to be a voice for everyone - including the LGBTQ+ community - and I will continue to uphold LGBT+ Labour’s 10 pledges, which I signed up to during the 2020 Labour leadership race, outlined below. The ongoing pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we live our lives, and it is understandable that this will have an impact on our mental health.\nAs we enter a national lockdown, it is vital that we all take care of our mental health. There are many brilliant services available to offer advice and support, and there is never any shame in asking for help. If you are facing a mental health crisis, you can call the Samaritans on 116 123, any time, day or night. If you are not comfortable speaking over the phone, you can also text SHOUT to 85258. They also have an advice page offering tips on how to take care of your mental health during the pandemic. If you are aged between 13-25, you can call The Mix on 0808 808 4994, with any question. They will connect you with experts and peers who will give you the support and advice you need. You can also phone Childline on 0800 1111, or speak directly to a counsellor here. For the LGBT+ community, you can call Switchboard on 0300 330 0630 or email [email protected]. All phone operators identify as LGBT+. Stonewall are also available on 08000 50 2020 for advice on a range of issues. If you are facing domestic abuse, you can call Refuge on 0808 2000 247, or access their online chat feature here.

But the mental health crisis facing Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) is nothing new. CAMHS services are at breaking point. They were before the pandemic. Tens of thousands of children are being turned away from mental health services – support they vitally need. Parents have raised this issue. Doctors have raised this issue. The stats provide the evidence. When will the Government admit that CAMHS services need to be better resourced? “Prior to 2017, no Government invested in or prioritised mental health services.”\nI couldn’t have put it better myself - and I didn’t need to, for these are not my words. They are the words of Nadine Dorries, the Mental Health Minister. The devastation left behind by the cuts to mental health services is staggering. And who was the architect of these cuts? No one other than the new Health Secretary during his time as a Treasury Minister. This matter cannot go unaddressed. That is why in Parliament today I asked the new Health Secretary to explain why a quarter of mental health beds have been cut since 2010, why 140,000 children were turned away from mental health services last year, and, finally, if he is ashamed of his track record. See here to view the video. Following on from the BBC’s successful documentary in March last year, ‘Stacey Dooley: On The Psych Ward’, Stacey Dooley returned to Springfield in a moving programme aired on Tuesday (13th April 2021). Stacey Dooley: Back On The Psych Ward follows the dedicated mental health professionals working on the frontline at Springfield, as well as a number of brave patients who came forward to share their experiences of life at Springfield during lockdown. I am always exceptionally proud of everyone working in mental health across the country. As both the Shadow Minister for Mental Health and Member of Parliament for Tooting, I remain committed to ensuring that local mental health services receive the funding they deserve. It was a pleasure to join Basildon Councillor Gavin Callaghan as well as local Basildon organisations to talk about mental health this week. Coronavirus has had a profound impact on our mental health support services and it is always great to see a local authority listen to and work with local organisations on the front line providing help where it is most needed. We need to take inspiration from Basildon Council and create an environment at a national level where community organisations and peer support groups work in tandem with local authorities and local health services. A huge thank you to Kim Bailey of Purple Genie Life Coaching, Karen Pullen of Craig Tyler Trust, Jonathan Barrow of Sociability, and Alison Cunningham of The Listening Post, for taking part.

The latest NHS data shows that from July to September this year the number of urgent referrals for children and young people suffering with eating disorders has almost doubled from the same period in 2019.\nOn 9 December, Alex Norris MP and I spoke with Dr Agnes Ayton, Chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists Eating Disorder Faculty, mental health campaigner Hope Virgo, the Centre for Mental Health, Beat and Young Minds UK to discuss eating disorders and explore ways to alleviate them. We urgently need a public mental health strategy which supports people with eating disorders. Christmas can be an especially difficult period, and it is vital that we remain sensitive to the fact that the focus on food and indulgence can cause individuals suffering with eating disorders real distress. Young people struggling with their mental health need urgent support. Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government for it. I look forward to the New Year, where I will be looking to engage further with the sector as well as individuals with lived experience of eating disorders. Even before the pandemic hit, the case for investing in this kind of support was clear. Coronavirus has exacerbated the existing crisis in mental health. Many NHS and social care staff have been scared of going to work, and they have lost patients and colleagues. It has been heartbreaking to witness the toll this virus has taken on staff mental health. Current support is not good enough, and without a tailored, fast-tracked service for staff who have faced death and despair every day for over three months, our frontline heroes will continue to be failed. We need to care for our carers. It is time for the Government to give back to those who have sacrificed so much to keep our loved ones safe. Unless our staff are protected, they cannot continue their vital work of keeping us all safe. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

With so many households already feeling the squeeze, it’s crucial that we work together to tackle poverty. Representatives from Earlsfield and Wandsworth foodbanks as well as Dons Local Action Group and Little Village Tooting told me that they are seeing unprecedented demand at present, as more and more of those who were just-about-managing become unable to afford the basics. All the organisations represented spoke of the added difficulties the rise in energy prices have brought. The hike in energy prices has meant that even the local charities who are there to address the crisis are struggling to pay their bills, and this means they are less able to help those in need. This comes at the worst possible time, when demand is at it’s highest level for decades. Everyone at the event had numerous stories of people facing hardship, people in overcrowded accommodation, people not being able to put food on the table or buy school uniforms for their children. Many people are also concerned about how they will meet the additional cost of christmas. Despite heartbreaking stories, it was uplifting to see so many people who donate their time, energy and money into making things better for people in our community. I am always amazed by the generosity of people in Tooting. However, in Britain in 2022 these organisations and charitable schemes shouldn’t have to exist. It is imperative that the Government take action immediately to support people through the months ahead. Comments are closed.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

I have been calling for a suspension of sales immediately and my comments can be read in the Independent here. Last week, I also signed a joint letter to the Foreign and Business Secretaries alongside a cross-party group of over 130 MPs, calling for the halting of UK arms sales to Israel. The full text of this letter can be read below. Together with my friend and colleague Marsha De Cordova, Labour MP for Battersea, I attended the Viva Palestina Supper Club to raise funds for the Medical Aid for Palestinians charity.\nThe food and company were both excellent and all proceeds raised went towards a very worthy cause. If you are able to donate, please do visit the Medical Aid for Palestinians website here.\nThere was a huge turnout today for the Oxfam Lobby Day event calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. I was proud to join other MPs and charities calling for an unconditional, immediate ceasefire.\nThank you to the charities who helped support it and to all attendees, who brought a powerful energy to the room.\nUp to 86,000 people could die in Gaza in the next 6 months due to war, disease and starvation.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_archives_01-2021/content_354.html": "|\nEarlier this week I met with local small business owners to hear the issues affecting them.\nFrom the insufficient support available to businesses that are non-direct ratepayers, to a lack of flexibility from landlords regarding rental payments, it is clear that the challenges Tooting small business owners are experiencing are considerable. Their resilience in the face of adversity is a credit to our community. The concerns shared will inform my actions to ensure that small businesses remain the beating heart of Tooting. Please check back here for updates, and keep an eye on my Facebook and Twitter pages for announcements of further events. In light of the upcoming Fire Safety Bill, I would to thank every resident who has written to me with their concerns on this and for continuing to keep me updated on the cladding issues affecting their property. I recognise what an exceptionally difficult time this is and appreciate how much anxiety the cladding proposals are causing to many leaseholders.\nOn more than fifteen occasions, Ministers promised that leaseholders would not be landed with the costs of remedial works. Yet, people are still being put at risk, trapped in flammable buildings for a third lockdown, with leaseholders placed in an impossible position and promises broken. It is evident that the Government’s handling of the cladding crisis has lacked any sense of grip or urgency. For this reason, the Labour Party have tabled an Opposition Day Debate on cladding for Monday, which will subsequently bring forward a vote that will call for leaseholders to be protected from the costs of remediating their blocks with dangerous cladding. The party will also be tabling a number of amendments to the Fire Safety Bill that will aim to protect leaseholders from unfair costs through the power of the law. I am aware that many residents have been in touch to request that I support the McPartland and Smith amendment, which provides welcome clarity on the specific costs that would be prevented from being passed on to leaseholders. Labour has sought to go further on this. As currently drafted, the McPartland and Smith amendment would not have covered blocks like Grenfell - where flammable cladding has been added at some stage following the building of the block. It only applies to defects in the original design of buildings. The Labour Party’s amendment would ensure that the cost of fire safety problems from refurbishment jobs, like the cladding on Grenfell Tower, cannot be passed on to leaseholders. Labour’s amendments also include new clauses so that the Bill protects leaseholders from the day it comes into law, instead of an unknown date in the future. I would like to thank my colleagues in the Labour Party, Sarah Jones MP, Nick Thomas-Symonds MP, Thangam Debbonaire MP and Mike Amesbury MP for their hard work and commitment to addressing this large injustice on a national scale. If any residents have any further queries on this issue, please do not hesitate to get in touch to discuss this further. In the meantime, I hope this post assures you of the steps myself and the Labour Party are taking to protect tenants and leaseholders during this cladding crisis. I recently raised residents' concerns about damage to our beloved Tooting Common with Mr Neil Blackley, Head of Parks at Enable Leisure and Culture and have since received a response on this important issue I am told comprehensive is in plan to return the Common to its pre-pandemic state, while keeping as much as possible open for public use. Initial works will target the worst affected areas, and will see the soil replenished and grass seeds planted. While these works are scheduled to commence in the spring, it will be a number of years before this much-loved part of Tooting is restored.\nWandsworth Council is currently consulting local residents on its ‘Local Plan’ document on developments for the borough across the next 15 years. This plan identifies Tooting as a potential area for regeneration, where proposals include new sustainable transport, improvements to public realm, and contributions to the health and wellbeing of residents.\n3. 56 Tooting High Street on the west corner of the Garratt Lane and Tooting High Street junction: The Council are considering using this site for a development of sustainable architecture and urban design, as well as considering the planting of street trees on Garratt Lane.\nFurther information on these proposals can be found here. Whilst I hold no authority over Wandsworth Council, it is important to me that residents, businesses and organisations have their say on these proposals. If you would like to submit comments on the ‘Pre-Publication’ Draft Local Plan, you must do so before 11.59pm on Monday 1 March 2021 using the following link: https://www.wandsworth.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy/local-plan/draft-local-plan-pre-publication/\nA number of local residents have raised their concerns about people rough sleeping during this exceptionally cold spell, and of course amidst the pandemic.\nLike many, I believe the Government’s delay in housing rough sleepers during this third lockdown was completely irresponsible and lacked basic human compassion. In London alone, the Office for National Statistics estimates that 1 in 30 people have coronavirus, and we know that sleeping rough - without adequate shelter or access to basic hygiene facilities - leaves people more exposed to the virus. Today, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick MP announced that councils will collectively receive an additional £10 million in funding to house those currently sleeping rough, as well as an extension to the ban on bailiff evictions. Whilst I welcome this much-needed funding, this money will not help get everyone off the streets, and the ban on bailiffs fails to sufficiently protect renters. Many residents have contacted me with concerns for those who are sleeping rough outside Tooting Broadway tube station, Buzz Bingo and Sainsbury's. I want to reassure residents that I have recently written to the Head of Wandsworth Neighbourhood Policing Team to ensure these people are supported in the best way possible. Beyond the coronavirus emergency, there can be no return to business as usual. It is paramount that Ministers end rough sleeping for good. In a country as well-off as ours, we need to ensure that everyone has the right to a safe place to live. Throughout the ongoing pandemic I have been inundated with emails from parents, school staff, students, and residents alike who have taken the time to outline their views on school closures. Some are concerned about safety, with many teachers and students facing the very real and grave possibility of bringing the virus home to vulnerable family members. Some are concerned about the impact a further lockdown could have on children's wellbeing and their education. And some are concerned about the challenges school closures will cause for working families.\nAs I am sure you will agree, the current situation is incredibly serious. This virus is spreading exponentially across the country, many people are in hospital, and too many people are tragically losing their loved ones. We know how difficult another lockdown will be, but I believe that national measures are necessary. As the Shadow Minister for Mental Health and a working mother, it is safe to say the impact of extended school closures on children’s well-being and working families cannot be overstated. This is why Labour called on Government to do everything possible to avoid it. Boris Johnson must immediately set out clear plans for every child to return safely to school as soon as possible - and be honest with parents about the timetable for this. It is also critical that young people’s education is safeguarded throughout this period of remote learning, and every student must have access to the devices they need to learn. Schools and families can request free mobile data increases for students without broadband or who cannot afford extra data for devices. More information on this scheme can be found here: get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/about-increasing-mobile-data. It is vital the Government prevent disadvantaged families being priced out of education. As many families will agree, working parents face huge challenges in balancing work, childcare, and supporting their child’s education. They must have the support they need to do this. Nobody should have to choose between their job and supporting their children, so the Government - and employers - must clearly promote the use of the job retention scheme for those unable to work due to family commitments. Please rest assured that myself and Labour Party colleagues will continue to hold the Government to account on these issues as we all navigate the ongoing pandemic. Stay safe, Rosena. With the Officer for National Statistics estimating that 1 in 30 Londoners now have coronavirus, and the Mayor of London declaring a major incident across all London hospitals, the ongoing situation could not be more serious. NHS services in the capital are at risk of becoming overwhelmed in just a matter of days.\nWorking as a doctor in St George’s A&E department, I understand how emotionally drained healthcare workers are feeling. Indeed, ‘overwhelmed’ was the word used by nurses, consultants and registrars at our local hospital in Tooting when they were interviewed for a special report by the BBC, with one senior staff nurse saying she has “never felt so demoralised in her life.” The report conducted by BBC London's Political Correspondent, Karl Mercer, showed the heartbreaking situation in high dependency units at St George’s. The hospital has now had to increase intensive care capacity from 60 to 120, the vast majority of which are for coronavirus patients. Wandsworth alone recorded a further 2394 cases this week – the 13th highest in London. Whilst better times are on the horizon with the recent announcement of the approved Moderna vaccine, I can only implore residents to continue to follow latest public health advice on the virus to ensure we can protect as many lives as possible. On behalf of all my colleagues working on the frontline, please stay at home. The ongoing pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we live our lives, and it is understandable that this will have an impact on our mental health.\nAs we enter a national lockdown, it is vital that we all take care of our mental health. There are many brilliant services available to offer advice and support, and there is never any shame in asking for help. If you are facing a mental health crisis, you can call the Samaritans on 116 123, any time, day or night. If you are not comfortable speaking over the phone, you can also text SHOUT to 85258. They also have an advice page offering tips on how to take care of your mental health during the pandemic. If you are aged between 13-25, you can call The Mix on 0808 808 4994, with any question.

Plans to upgrade the site’s facilities and amenities – replacing the artificial football pitch with a modern surface, and building new changing rooms, public toilets, a children’s play area, and a café – are welcome. However, the proposal to fund the improvements via a 25-year lease of the new facilities to TFL Leisure – a private company – is more controversial.\nThe fence set to be constructed around the new football pitch, and the lack of clarity as to whether the upgraded children’s Stay & Play facility will remain free to use, have prompted concerns that the development will put public land behind a literal paywall. I am sure you will agree that if the recent lockdowns have taught us anything, it is that there is a need for more publicly accessible green spaces – not less. As it stands, the proposed development would see a reduction in the area available to the Balham Boxing Club compared with their current provision. Issues have also been raised regarding the smaller size of the female changing rooms compared to the men's, and the impact floodlighting could have on the Triangle’s resident bat population, among other things. I understand that discussions on the proposed development are ongoing. Please be assured that I am keeping a close eye on this evolving situation - we all want what's best for our local community. I have written to the Housing Secretary to outline residents concerns about EWS1 forms and cladding. The latest NHS data shows that from July to September this year the number of urgent referrals for children and young people suffering with eating disorders has almost doubled from the same period in 2019.\nOn 9 December, Alex Norris MP and I spoke with Dr Agnes Ayton, Chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists Eating Disorder Faculty, mental health campaigner Hope Virgo, the Centre for Mental Health, Beat and Young Minds UK to discuss eating disorders and explore ways to alleviate them. We urgently need a public mental health strategy which supports people with eating disorders. Christmas can be an especially difficult period, and it is vital that we remain sensitive to the fact that the focus on food and indulgence can cause individuals suffering with eating disorders real distress. Young people struggling with their mental health need urgent support. Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government for it. I look forward to the New Year, where I will be looking to engage further with the sector as well as individuals with lived experience of eating disorders.\nA number of local residents have reached out to ask me why my name was not included in a letter signed by 61 out of 650 MPs about the very concerning deportation flight to Jamaica. I wanted to explain how the process works.\nFirstly, let me say that this was an incredibly serious matter, which is why I was pleased to see my colleague, Holly Lynch MP, the Shadow Immigration Minister, send an urgent letter to the Government raising concerns. I added my voice to her letter by writing to Priti Patel myself - requesting that the points Holly Lynch raised were answered urgently. A copy of that letter is below:\nAs a member of the Labour Shadow Cabinet, my role is to intervene in matters related to mental health (because I am the Shadow Minister for Mental Health). Members of the Shadow Cabinet do not speak in debates, sign letters, sign EDMs or intervene in matters which are not related to their role. This rule has been in place for as long as I know, it was the same when Jeremy Corbyn was leader.\nI have noticed that my name was put on a list along with 12 colleagues, suggesting we were the only people not to sign this letter. No member of the Labour Shadow Cabinet signed the letter, indeed, almost three quarters of Labour MPs didn't sign the letter. Does that mean that they don't care? No, of course not. Sometimes they miss the deadline to sign, sometimes they can't sign, sometimes they make representations in different ways. It's very disappointing that some would single out me and 12 other colleagues, suggesting we were the only ones not to sign - simply to fit their political agenda. My background has seen me work in war torn countries, disaster zones and refugee camps helping the world's most marginalised and vulnerable people. I always care deeply about these issues and to suggest otherwise is incorrect. I'll continue to liaise with my colleagues in the Home Affairs team with regards to this, and other important issues. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_previous_3/content_95.html": "|\nThank you to everyone who has been in contact and shared their views on assisted dying in recent weeks. Before deciding how to vote, I have carefully considered the provisions of the legislation, taken into account the views of those in Tooting, as well as discussing this at length with experts.\nThere are deeply felt personal, spiritual, philosophical and moral opinions held by individuals on both sides of this debate. Death is always a difficult subject. Our own death and the loss of those we love is a sad fact of life that each and every one of us will deal with at some point. As a doctor, death is something that my colleagues and I must confront every day. As a daughter, the death of my father from a terminal illness was a very eye-opening and traumatic experience, one which I’d wish on no-one. After much thought, reflection and engagement with the community I represent, I have decided to vote against the Bill at its Second Reading. The concerns I hold with the current proposals are multifaceted. I have spoken to key organisations and charities who have detailed their concerns that this legislation will have a disproportionate impact on disabled and BAME individuals. I am further worried that the current legislation does not go far enough to eliminate risks of coercion. Currently neither of the two doctors that would sign off on the process need to know the patient or their family. Nor are they mandated to seek a specialist clinical assessment. It is also important to me that we ensure people considering ending their own lives have access to good quality, well-resourced end-of-life care. This is currently not the reality for much of the country owing to a lack of resources. As such, moving forward, I will continue to advocate for improvements to palliative care, which can empower many individuals at the end of their lives, to enjoy their last moments with loved ones in as much comfort as possible and with peace of mind. There is no doubt that my colleagues have decided their vote, regardless of which side, with the very best of intentions. It is right that this Bill is being considered under a free vote, where every MP can vote with their conscience, and I am pleased that this has been a largely respectful, measured debate. I would like to thank everyone who has contacted me regarding this deeply personal issue - I have really listened. If the legislation passes today, there will remain opportunities to amend the Bill. I will look at any potential changes to the legislation closely. While I cannot support the Bill at this stage, this debate was needed and the issue is very important to the public. Regardless of the outcome of the vote, I hope we can all continue to be as respectful and understanding towards one another as possible.\nToday marks one year since the horrific Hamas terrorist attacks of 7th October. We must remember those killed, demand the release of remaining hostages and push for a lasting ceasefire.\nThe murder and destruction that has followed in Gaza and beyond, is morally reprehensible and sickening. Hundreds of thousands of civilians in Gaza have been forcibly displaced and countless murdered. As evidence of crimes against humanity mounts, we must suspend all arms sales to Israel and hold those responsible to account. Following the fire at the waste centre on Weir Road, I have written to the Commissioner of the London Fire Brigade, the Chief Executive of the Environment Agency, as well as the Chief Executives of Merton and Wandsworth Councils to voice the concerns of local residents who were affected.\nThis letter can be found below: Today, my team has been out in the area affected by the recycling plant fire, knocking on doors and speaking to local residents. We have also been to visit the site of the fire and met with the Fire Brigade Commander who is leading at the scene.\nFurther, our team has met with Council Officers who have been proactively taking measurements of the air quality at local schools and on streets affected by smoke. Remember, keep your doors and windows closed. I would advise staying indoors. Local people will be aware that the fire at the Recycling plant on Weir Road is continuing to produce high volumes of smoke in the area. I have spoken to London Fire Brigade who has assured me that the fire remains in control and efforts are continuing to dampen out the remnants of the fire.\nI know many people will be concerned with the effects of the smoke on the air quality in the surrounding area. I am proactively engaging with Wandsworth Council to ensure steps are being taken to monitor the air quality. I understand that current advice is to keep doors and windows closed. I understand that a fire broke out at the Recycling Plant on Weir Road, just inside Merton yesterday evening. The Fire Brigade states that the fire is now under control, but efforts are now being taken to begin dampening out the fire.\nRest assured, I will continue to maintain contact with the Fire Brigade and monitor any developments closely. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_previous_20/content_697.html": "|\nToday, the Committee's Report on the Draft Mental Health Bill has been published - this is a once in a generation opportunity to improve the rights of patients experiencing a mental health crisis and to tackle the health inequalities enshrined in current legislation.\nOver the last six months, I've been proud to work with my committee colleagues, listening to patient voices and evidence from experts. We heard heartbreaking accounts from patients. Above all else, the legislation has to protect them and ensure they receiving appropriate care. For years, the Government kicked updating this legislation into the long grass, and now, the current draft bill still does not go far enough to tackle the racial disparity of those detained under the Mental Health Act. Patient voices must be at the heart of this legislation. Read the full report here: https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt5803/jtselect/jtmentalhealth/696/report.html After cutting services through Earlsfield station for commuters since the pandemic, South Western Railway have announced that no services will run through Earlsfield from 19 December until 2 January, ostensibly due to industrial action. SWR is keeping 28 stations open in London through this period, of which 21 have lower passenger usage than Earlsfield. Only big hubs, such as Clapham Junction, Wimbledon and Waterloo, have higher passenger numbers than Earlsfield - this is simply not good enough! Add your name to my open letter calling for an immediate reconsideration of the decision not to run services through Earlsfield and a full explanation of why this decision was taken in the first place. Today, Justin Madders MP and I met with the Retail trade union Usdaw and a group of retail workers in Westminster to talk about how the cost-of-living crisis, rising violence and abuse in stores, and the impact of Christmas holiday trade is affecting the mental health of customers and colleagues.\nFar too many people are facing this Christmas period worried about how to provide for their families. With so many Usdaw members having their mental health impacted as a result of the cost-of-living crisis and increased levels of abuse in the workplace, it is deeply important that we, as politicians, take the time to listen. Recently, I visited the fantastic team at Love Triangle, a brilliant pizza restaurant situated between Balham and Tooting Bec.\nThey’ve been selling pizza to the community for two and a half years now, but things are getting increasingly difficult. The cost-of-living crisis is hitting small businesses hard, with customers having less money to spend to things such as meals out, and the cost of energy and supplies rising astronomically. Will, who owns Love Triangle, told me that despite trying many different creative ways to stay afloat, things are only getting more difficult. Love Triangle have tried different opening times, and an array of different promotions and deals to help combat the challenges, but it is still far from easy, just to keep their head above water. The rising cost of food and energy, coupled with the reduction in disposable income for many is proving a difficult picture to navigate. Speaking to Will, and other business owners in our community, one message stands out. It is crucial to support local businesses where you can, or we risk losing more of our fantastic local businesses from Tooting, and across the country. Watch my visit to Love Triangle here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1599084624847642624?s=20&t=xq-atIy2mtAe0cDqI51dLw It was great to bring together local charities, faith leaders, and leader of Wandsworth Council, Simon Hogg who are all working tirelessly to support local families through the cost-of-living crisis.\nI have already been contacted by countless Tooting residents who are concerned about how they are going to pay their bills and put food on the table this winter, and I fear this will only get worse as we move further into the winter months. With so many households already feeling the squeeze, it’s crucial that we work together to tackle poverty. Representatives from Earlsfield and Wandsworth foodbanks as well as Dons Local Action Group and Little Village Tooting told me that they are seeing unprecedented demand at present, as more and more of those who were just-about-managing become unable to afford the basics. All the organisations represented spoke of the added difficulties the rise in energy prices have brought. The hike in energy prices has meant that even the local charities who are there to address the crisis are struggling to pay their bills, and this means they are less able to help those in need. This comes at the worst possible time, when demand is at it’s highest level for decades. Everyone at the event had numerous stories of people facing hardship, people in overcrowded accommodation, people not being able to put food on the table or buy school uniforms for their children. Many people are also concerned about how they will meet the additional cost of christmas. Despite heartbreaking stories, it was uplifting to see so many people who donate their time, energy and money into making things better for people in our community. I am always amazed by the generosity of people in Tooting. However, in Britain in 2022 these organisations and charitable schemes shouldn’t have to exist. It is imperative that the Government take action immediately to support people through the months ahead. It was great to attend and speak at the annual Balham and Tooting Community Association’s multi-faith peace ceremony in Tooting Broadway.\nLocal people of all faiths and none gathered to celebrate all that unites us. We heard prayers and moving speeches from leaders of six different faiths and school students. I love representing a community where so many faiths are represented. People of all faiths and none live and work alongside each other in our community and I was honoured to be part of such a joyous occasion that celebrates our diversity and our commitment to common values of tolerance and understanding. Leaders from Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh communities spoke and prayed in their own traditions. Senior school pupils from Al Risalah Girls Secondary School spoke of what their faith means to them and their hopes for peace. This event has taken place in Tooting for many years now and it’s always an inspiring and uplifting event that I look forward to attending. It’s always fantastic to see our community come together. Thank you to all who attending and to those who worked so hard to make this event a success. I've written to the Chief Executive of Bellway on behalf of residents at Fitzgerald and Fleming Houses on St George's Grove, many of whom have been left in limbo, unable to sell or re-mortgage their properties due to the flammable cladding that was installed by Bellway, when the houses were built. In May, London Fire Brigade instituted a waking watch on both of the buildings due to fire risk, which residents were forced to pay for themselves. I have been working alongside Bellway resident directors in good faith for months but have been met with delay and excuses while their properties remain without a suitable facade. My position is clear: Developers must fund remediations works on these properties and the replacement of the cladding to the new required standard. Leaseholders cannot be held liable for these costs. To add your name to the letter, sign below. An undercover joint investigation by Sky News and The Independent has raised serious concerns about the safety of patients at inpatient settings ran by the Huntercombe Group.\nThis is the third investigation into abuse in secure inpatient mental health settings, in four weeks. The system is broken. I previously wrote to Therese Coffey, the previous Health Secretary, to raise my concerns about other similar investigations highlighting allegations of abuse, by Channel 4 Dispatches and BBC Panorama, but did not receive a response. The Government has been silent over these allegations and for weeks there wasn’t even a functioning Mental Health Minister. Patients, and their families, deserve answers. They deserve dignity, respect and access to high quality treatment, which is why I have called for a rapid review into mental health services and the way patients are treated in inpatient settings. See my statement in Parliament here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1587420289662492672?s=20&t=Gj2YhL3GB3Os4nSrRoGK7Q There were so many fantastic events across Tooting to celebrate Black History Month, which is celebrated in October.\nIt was great to see Wandsworth Council celebrate the contributions of black business owners, and other influential members of the blakc community make to our borough. Many of our local libraries were host to brilliant events where black authors could share their stories with the community. A series of videos published online celebrated the brilliant contributions to local creative industries. I know that many residents particularly enjoyed the pop up street food event celebrating some of the best cuisine from across Africa and the Caribbean. My personal highlight was attending the Roots and Culture event in Tooting, where dancers, musicians, poetry, comedy, and fantastic street food stalls showed some of the best of African and Caribbean culture. It was great to see how well attended all these events were, and great to see our community coming together to celebrate the cultures of the black communities here in Tooting. Thank you to everyone who attended and helped to organise these events! I was deeply concerned to hear pupils at Graveney School in Tooting were being targeted in a recent spate of muggings. I have been in touch with local police leadership to insist on swift action to address this issue. I know that the police are actively working to identify and arrest those responsible.\nEvery child deserves to walk our streets without fear. I am therefore pleased to hear that the local police force are carrying out high visibility patrols and are carrying out regular weapon sweeps around the school. Police are also patrolling the area in unmarked cars to try and identify and arrest the suspects. Pupils at Graveney School have also received assemblies on how to keep safe and how to report a street crime. The local police have also liaised with local CCTV to ensure appropriate coverage. It is vital that all of these issues are reported to the police so they can bring these worrying incidents to an end as quickly as possible. Anyone who has been a victim of a street robbery in this area who is yet to report the incident to the police are advised to do so. Please be assured, I will continue to work with our local police team to resolve this issue as quickly as possible, and I will continue to follow this case as a matter of urgency. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

This can't go on. The Government urgently needs to get a grip on the crisis in our prison system instead of pretending that nothing is wrong. Wandsworth is bursting with creativity and culture. Our art, food and history are what makes our community such a great place to live.\nToday, Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney, and Marsha de Cordova, MP for Battersea, and I have written to Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, to support Wandsworth’s bid to be London Borough of Culture 2025.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_previous_38/content_740.html": "|\nNothing prepares you for seeing a colleague in tears over antisemitism.\nLabour deputy leadership hopeful, Rosena Allin-Khan, speaks about her heritage informing her fight against Jew-hate, and her commitment to mending ties with the community. “There is nothing that prepares you for seeing a colleague in tears,” says Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, one of five hopefuls standing for Labour’s deputy-leadership. Committed to winning back the trust of the community – and standing up for MPs such as Luciana Berger and Ruth Smeeth who are no longer in Westminster – Allin-Khan, currently the MP for Tooting, seems sincere in her battle against hate. She grew up as the daughter of immigrants – her father hailing from Pakistan, her mother from Poland, herself the descendent of resistance fighters killed by the Nazis. But she’s aware that hate and prejudice won’t be solved over a chat with tea and biscuits. Before her career in politics, she was a humanitarian doctor, working on the ground with Palestinians, while her mother’s family from Poland were killed by the Nazis. It’s these experiences which allow her to reconcile speaking out against Israeli policies, while committing herself to the fight against antisemitism, drawing praise from the community in carefully balancing these issues. The first of her pledges is to meet with the Jewish Labour Movement, should she get elected. It would be “essential to the restructuring” of relations, and “how we rebuild trust.” She is also keen on an education program, saying “people use antisemitic tropes and they don’t even realise what they’re doing and they repeatedly do so.” While indicating she would speak with “any group that was looking to acknowledge there was a problem, and work towards coming up with a solution to fix it” she adds that she is the “only deputy leader candidate who hasn’t nominated a leader”. She’s willing to “work with whomever the leader is” on rebuilding trust. Calling the demise in relations between the community and the party “sad” and “terrible”, she opens up about “people I know that I am very close to, who have been really brave and speaking out antisemitism in the party.” “They have received torrents of abuse and nothing’s been done about it”. “Any leader seeing something like this unfolding needs to be all over it”, she says. But was Corbyn’s team responsible? She says they were not the “cause of the antisemitic problem in Labour, I think they didn’t deal with the problem, well enough”. Yet, she’s under no illusions as to the extent of the problem, saying it must be tackled “from a grassroots membership level first and take it all the way to MPs themselves”. “The complaints process wasn’t dealt with properly”, Allin-Khan says, adding: “As people began to show antisemitic abuse .. the more they saw it wasn’t being dealt with the more they felt able to do so.” On mending ties, she wants an “independent” process for tackling complaints with “outstanding cases to be dealt with within a particular time”, and “automatic expulsion” for antisemitism, though she wouldn’t be drawn on whether she would intervene, like Tom Watson, who she is trying to succeed. Her drive to fight antisemitism is in part inspired by her heritage. “My mum’s Polish and I lost lots of family during the war. They were not Jewish, but they fought alongside Jewish friends and my great uncle died during that time, my grandma was pregnant in the Warsaw ghetto with my uncle.” “That whole experience is a very real part of my history, and it is a shared history that I understand deeply and I’m very saddened about with the Jewish community. She was embroiled in a dispute with the Israeli Deputy Ambassador in 2016, following a radio discussion about Palestinians’ access to medical aid. After revealing the two had met in person to discuss the issue, she was accused of being “bought by Zionists”, facing significant online abuse. Her response drew praise, with Dave Rich from the Community Security Trust saying it “illustrated the difference between pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist”. She says: “I am a doctor, and have been a humanitarian doctor for my whole professional life.” “It is possible, and fair, to identify areas where there could be improvement to somebody’s life and health and not to conflate that with a whole antisemitic issue. “ I will always be proud to stand up for people’s basic human rights, and I’m also very aware of my history and my shared history with the Jewish community. I feel it’s perfectly possible to manage the two.” Many former Labour voters feel unrepresented. That has to change\nThe Labour party has shaped who I am today. It has helped provide me with the opportunity to train as a doctor and has given me and my family life chances we otherwise would not have had. I want everyone to experience these opportunities. It deeply saddens me to see a lost generation for whom the door closed on their dreams and ambitions on 12 December. Growing up poor and cold while my single mum worked three jobs to support me and my brother taught me the reality of day-to-day life for many people in the UK. My mother always told me, even through our darkest moments, that there were people worse off than us – and I have never forgotten that. The Labour party changed my life. Despite failing my A-levels due to difficult circumstances at home, I was finally able to go to Cambridge University at the age of 24 to study medicine because of reforms the Labour party made in government. People did not know what we stood for – the Tories had three simple words Working on the A&E frontline has shown me the best and worst of society. A&E is a microcosm of real life. I hold parents as they say goodbye to their children who have died through senseless violence. I talk to nurses who tell me they can’t afford to feed their children and are having to use foodbanks. I treat older people who just want the dignity of accessing social care in their homes. But I also see hope. The UK is full of people pushing through barriers to serve their communities. Our NHS provided me with the skills to give back to society – it spurred me on to work as a humanitarian aid doctor in disaster zones across the world, something that I have been proud to continue during my time as an MP. I am proud of the internationalist views of the Labour party – we must never turn our backs on the world’s most vulnerable. On the border of Myanmar, it was shocking to listen to the stories of Rohingya refugees speaking of having to make the impossible decision of whether to save their child who was thrown alive on to a burning fire, or escape with their surviving child. We must not turn our backs on those who are living through the absolute worst of human atrocities. In Palestine, I was heartbroken to meet children who were undergoing cancer treatment utterly alone because their parents were unable to obtain permits to accompany them. Humanity should have no borders. Only with a Labour government can the UK have a truly outward, internationalist approach, ensuring that we are there for people in their times of greatest need. In order to be in government, we must get our house in order, and as deputy leader this would be my priority. We cannot look to champion equality abroad, while turning a blind eye to racism in our party. This needs to end. As deputy leader, my first major meeting would be with the Jewish Labour Movement – they are our official Jewish affiliate; we must listen. I want JLM to be at the forefront of this fight against antisemitism, especially when it comes to education at the grassroots level. I will separate the complaints process from HQ, making it independent and asking the new team to immediately review all cases, acting swiftly and expelling antisemites. There must also be a strict time limit by which cases need to be resolved. I commit to adopt every recommendation proposed by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, without hesitation. Enough is enough. Only then will we be able to start rebuilding trust. Communities across the country have turned away from Labour, thinking that we do not represent them. We must listen with humility to people across our country and across our movement to assess why we’ve lost the last four elections, and how we can win people back. From speaking to people in seats that we lost in December, I have been told that trust in us has gone. People did not know what we stood for – there appeared to be new policies announced every day and voters did not trust that we had a plan for how to deliver them. The Tories had three simple words. To win, we need to be able to communicate our messages, not just internally, but with the public. I will focus on grassroots campaigners being armed with the information and messaging that they need to talk to voters on the doorstep. I will equip candidates and their local Labour parties with the resources that they so desperately need. I will introduce reduced membership rates to our emergency service workers so they can have a say within Labour on the NHS at this vital time. We need to build our movement into one people can vote for. A party people can trust. Under this government, which has chosen to block child refugees from reunification with their families, I worry for the future of our children. I worry for the future of tolerance. I worry for the future of compassion. We have a wonderful society, which has welcomed so many people from across the world, but the hostile environment this government is imposing on our country is restricting the ability to hope. Hope for a brighter future. Hope for a tolerant society. The door may have closed on 12 December for a generation’s hopes and ambitions, but with the right leadership team in place in the Labour party, it will not be closed for good. We need to win the next general election, and we must start rebuilding trust ahead of local elections in May. As deputy leader, it will be my responsibility to rebuild trust, not just with the grassroots of our party, but with voters. Together, we can take Labour forward. As a doctor, I know that before a patient can be diagnosed, it is vital to first take a detailed history and examine them thoroughly. That’s the challenge we now face in revitalising the Labour Party and taking it off life-support. This is also why, when I decided to run for Deputy Leader, the first thing I did was contact every single Labour councillor I could find an email address for, as well as every single prospective parliamentary candidate who stood for Labour in the last General Election and lost.\nI’m not a leader-in-waiting, I’ll be a campaigner-in-chief, and you can be too. I’ve been travelling across the country, to seats where we won, seats where we lost, and even seats we’ve never held, to talk to activists and members on the ground - because I want to hear from the grassroots directly to truly understand what went wrong, what went right, and what we must do better. Using that detailed feedback, I am now publishing a manifesto called Grassroots Revival – a campaigning action plan that I will immediately start implementing if I’m elected as the next Labour Deputy Leader. **Download Grassroots revival**It starts with changes we must make to our internal organisation. We must overhaul the complaints process. I’ll remove the team from HQ and make it independent, put a time limit on reviewing complaints, and ensure those involved with each case are kept informed of its progress. I also want to start unlocking Labour’s membership talent. It’s not all about delivering leaflets and knocking on doors - we have social media experts, journalists, policy gurus, videographers and many other talents in our ranks. Let’s start making the most of that! For new members, attending meetings can feel daunting - we need to make them more enjoyable and accessible for all. We can ensure party democracy and due process are followed, while making meetings a more enjoyable experience. For example, some CLPs still spend up to an hour arguing about the minutes of the last meeting - which turns off new members. We need to streamline the procedural matters and get more political debate into our local meetings. We can be sociable too! I want to help local groups organise regional social events that break even, instead of looking to make a profit. Quiz nights, continuing the great work of Stand Up For Labour, pub nights, coffee mornings - let’s bring our movement together and celebrate all that we have to offer. Let’s look at how to grow and diversify our movement even further. I’ll offer reduced membership rates to emergency service workers, to encourage them to join the Party and have their say over how we fight to save our NHS. I would support BAME members to hold elected office - I will produce literature to be made available to BAME officers to distribute to new members, “how to be a councillor” meetings will be offered in each borough - not as an afterthought - and I will work with BAME officers to listen to what resources they need. We must start upgrading our technology and infrastructure - we’re running campaigns in 2020 with two colour printers from the 80s and 90s. I’d ensure every CLP has access to a full colour RISO printer (or similar). We can also boost data driven testing of our methods. Comparisons of leaflets, direct mails, e-newsletters, social media and canvassing will allow us to be so much more targeted and effective. A significant amount of dedicated time went into creating software and apps to revolutionise our digital campaigning in recent years but the party didn’t have the resources to fully roll them out - the doorknocking app, dialogue and chatter could have really helped us but members didn’t know how to use them or didn’t know they existed. Contact Creator regularly broke down during the General Election and the user interface hasn’t changed for over a decade. This must all change. Let’s also have a digital team at HQ who goes to every target seat, showing them how to make the most of Facebook ads, emails, Twitter, creating graphics and videos. Let’s also start looking at how to produce more personalised and localised content. The party produces some great literature and supplies it to key seats, but the vast majority of it is national with no localisation. Some leaflets and letters just didn’t arrive in 2019 for some seats, which left them in the dark, and adequate support was not available to deal with it, because staff were already overstretched. We must be better prepared. The manifesto came out weeks after the print deadlines for seats to order their leaflets and letters. I will ensure the necessary information is available to candidates in good time. The Labour Party must do better at supporting our candidates – I’ll make sure they all get adequate briefings and lines for use in their own leaflets, letters, emails and press releases. Candidates and their teams are superheroes, but they aren’t invincible, and campaigns can take their toll both financially, physically and mentally - This is why I’ll set up a dedicated team to offer mental health support and advice during difficult times. Too often, local organisers and staff have contracts that end at 10pm on polling day - this culture needs to change. Organisers put in endless hours to help our campaigns succeed and to dump them when polls close is just simply wrong. I’ll ensure no staff contracts end on Election Day, giving them vital time to find new employment. I also want to establish a system of sharing best practice amongst CLPs and boroughs. Campaigns shouldn’t have borders - we don’t have to operate solely within our constituency or ward boundaries. We need proper twinning with key seats. There’s no sugar-coating it – the Labour Party is in a critical condition right now. But with the right treatment, the right approach and the right support from the leadership team, we can get it back to fighting fitness. With the local elections coming up in May, there’s no time to waste. Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan MP for Tooting There is absolutely no place for antisemitism within the Labour Party, and I will put all my energy into rebuilding trust with the Jewish community.\nMy first major meeting will be with Jewish Labour Movement - they are Labour's official Jewish affiliate and we must trust them. I’ll separate the complaints process from head office, making it truly independent - to begin the process of rebuilding the trust. Once that new team is in place, I'll immediately get them to review all cases, acting swiftly and expelling antisemites. For future, I'll put a time limit on when cases need to be resolved by (for now and in future). The investigation from the Equality and Human Rights Commission is not an optional piece of diversity training, it's an embarrassment that this issue has gone so far without real action. The report they produce and the actions they want Labour to take are not optional - they are legally binding. I promise to fully adopt, without hesitation - every single one of their proposed steps. We are an open party, who welcome everyone from every background, no longer can we kick these issues into the long grass and offer the bare minimum in support and process. As Deputy Leader no form of racism will be accepted in our party. Front-line workers in the NHS have felt ignored by the Government - and now the Tories look set to give up the NHS for profit.\nThis Christmas I’ve been proud to support my hard-working colleagues on the front line by doing shifts in my local A&E. We’re all touched by the NHS at some point in our lives. For over 70 years it has been our lifeline, the glue holding our society together, often forgotten about, but there in our times of greatest need. The NHS is there to bring life, to offer care and dignity when we leave the world, and to support our loved ones when tragedy hits. But front-line workers in the NHS have felt ignored and that the Government does not recognise the day-to-day pressures they face. It didn’t start with claims on the side of a bus during the European referendum campaign in 2016 but, since then, using the NHS for political gain certainly picked up pace. Throughout the election, Boris Johnson repeatedly denied that the NHS would be up for sale. Just two weeks after the election, it was revealed that NHS cancer care and children’s treatments are up for grabs in a stealth Tory sell-off. Cardiology, gynaecology, paediatrics and oncology are among the services being offered to companies. As an A&E doctor, when someone is rushed into A&E having a heart attack, we work to patch someone up before sending them off to heart specialists. How will it feel knowing that those services are now being provided by a private company? Where is the trust? Allowing hospital trusts to outsource treatment to private companies could lead to a postcode lottery of health care, further widening the health divide. We need to be bringing the UK together, not tearing it apart, turning communities against each other. On top of this, discussions are taking place with tech giants on how to make money from patient data. While we must do everything possible to look for cures and ensure a better patient journey, we need to know how our own data is being used. The last decade has shown us that we must exercise caution with tech giants. The Government does not have the money or expertise needed to create an anonymised patient database, which is exactly why Amazon and Microsoft have been approached. Trust in our NHS cannot be destroyed because without trust, everything else could be up for grabs. I was stunned and heartbroken after the election result and bereft at what it would mean for our NHS. Our hospitals, treatments and dedicated staff cannot simply be sold off to the highest bidder. These aren’t the principles our NHS was founded and built on and I will continue fighting, standing side by side with our hospital workers, to protect our NHS from those who wish to destroy it. Shadow minister launches deputy leadership bid with a unifying pitch\nLabour must move past the factionalism and “ideological purity” that has alienated voters across the country, the shadow minister Rosena Allin-Khan has said as she set out her pitch to become the party’s deputy leader. The A&E doctor who has served on Jeremy Corbyn’s frontbench is the latest party figure to officially throw their hat in the ring for the deputy leadership, alongside the shadow cabinet members Angela Rayner and Richard Burgon. Allin-Khan, 43, said that for too long the party had been weighted down by infighting and described her politics as being inspired by public service, which she said was not based within soft- or hard-left identities. “I’ve got the campaigning experience but also the life experience to help rebuild the party again,” said Allin-Khan, who has been a shadow minister for sport since 2016 and still works hospital shifts. “We need to move beyond the last few years where nasty internal debates about faction and ideological purity have too often alienated people outside our movement. “Public service isn’t about identifying who sits on which side of the Labour party. I am Labour because of my values, my life experiences and the fact that I’m a doctor. We must communicate how we are going to change people’s lives in a way they can understand.” Her pitch as a unifying figure across Labour’s political spectrum would involve trying to make inroads in Scotland and Wales and other heartland areas that went Conservative, by holding town hall events, as well as meetings in synagogues, churches, mosques and temples. She said to rebuild the party’s base Labour must listen far more to councillors, who she says are the experts in their communities. The Tooting MP, who has a Pakistani father and Polish mother, dismissed concerns that Labour must have a leadership team that is drawn from northern constituencies. “I grew up poor with a single mum working three jobs to support me and my brother. That taught me the reality of day to day life for people across this country,” she said. “There’s no regional distinction to hunger. Loss of hope lives across the UK. London is used to mean ‘metropolitan elite’ but we also have some of the highest levels of deprivation. “Growing up in poverty. Understanding what it was like to get a job really young to supplement household income, to being careful in supermarkets with food, to feel there was no hope for someone from your background – that experience gives me a fire in my stomach to fight for all people around the country that have to go through that.” The mother of two studied medicine at Cambridge through Labour-initiated scholarships after initially failing her A-levels during a period of difficult family circumstances. After qualifying as a doctor she has worked as an A&E specialist in London hospitals and as a humanitarian aid doctor in the Middle East, Africa and Asia for a decade. She won the Tooting seat in a 2016 by-election after Sadiq Khan quit to run as mayor of London. In parliament she has highlighted the difficulty Palestinian children in Gaza have in accessing healthcare in Israeli hospitals because their parents are not allowed to accompany them through a restrictive permit system. As part of her sports brief she has fought for the return of safe standing at football clubs, as well as being an advocate for the women’s game both in parliament and as a player herself. She was also a vociferous campaigner for the People’s Vote campaign on a second referendum but said she accepted the country was leaving the EU, even though she had fought so hard against it because she did not believe the deal would work for her constituents. As for rejoining the bloc, she said that would have to be looked at if it should ever come up but was not a priority. Despite Corbyn being rejected at the election, she pointed out positive changes he made for the party, including a more welcoming immigration policy, and said she was proud of his strong anti-austerity message and the party’s continued support for the NHS. But on the defeat, she said: “We threw everything out there and nothing had time to land effectively. In comparison the Tories used three words and a few repeated soundbites which ultimately proved effective.” She said she would be happy to work with any leadership candidate should they be elected. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_previous_17/content_685.html": "|\nIt was my pleasure to open the Quirky Dovetail Market. There was such a fantastic display of local arts and crafts on sale, which demonstrated the truly incredible talents that local people have to offer.\nLondon UNISON members have fought hard for some amazing victories over the last year. I was proud to meet with some of our fantastic reps working in local healthcare when I addressed UNISON’s conference last month.\nOur local NHS board have announced that Trinity Medical Centre will close on 31st July. The decision to close the surgery is deeply disappointing and I am concerned that it will leave thousands of local residents scrambling to find another GP, including vulnerable patients.\nAt a time when local residents are already waiting weeks to see a GP, this decision is a shocking, short-sighted solution for users of the surgery. People will find themselves trying to squeeze onto the books of existing practices, travelling further to see a GP, losing the strong and trusted relationships with their GPs they've built over time. The blame for this decision lies squarely with this Conservative Government who have imposed 13 years of underfunding and neglect on our local NHS services. I have already called on the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, to meet with the community to see the impact of this decision first-hand and to reverse this disastrous decision. I've always been a proud supporter of Palestinian rights, which is why it was great to sit down and catch-up with the Palestinian Ambassador to the UK, Husam Zumot, in Parliament today.\nToday, I proudly led Labour's opposition debate on mental health and put forward our plan to transform mental health services across the country. It includes more staff, specialists in schools, hubs in communities, treatment within a month. Today, I called on the Health Secretary to get his act together on our failing mental health services. Across mental health services, children are being failed, police are spending hours waiting with children in crisis in A&E, staff are overworked are under-resourced. It's time for the Health Secretary to get a grip or get out of the way. Some businesses take their workplace mental health responsibilities very seriously. It was extremely insightful to talk to leaders of Talon, JCDecaux, Clear Channel Outdoor, Ocean Outdoor today, about what they’re doing to support employees’ mental health.\nToday, I wrote to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, calling on him to listen to concerns expressed by local residents about the proposed closure of Trinity Medical Centre.\nAt a time when waiting times are at record levels, these plans by the NHS and Government will make it harder for local residents to access a local GP. That's why, alongside our local Labour Councillors, I'm campaigning to keep GP services at this site. Please add your name to the petition here Read my letter below: Today, I wrote to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, regarding my growing concerns about the limited powers of the ongoing inquiry into the deaths of up to 2,000 patients in mental health hospitals in Essex Partnership University Trust over the past 20 years.\nThe inquiry has only received the co-operation of less than 30% of named staff, who are essential witnesses in the deaths that are being investigated, leaving families in limbo and further compounding their grief. I have called on the Health Secretary to give the inquiry the full statutory powers required to ensure families get answers and that lessons can be learned for the future. Read my full letter here: The children's cancer centre at St George's Hospital is at risk of closure.\nThis is deeply concerning. The St George's children's cancer centre has more than 25 years of expertise delivering the highest quality care for patients, which will be lost if the services are moved away from Tooting. Under these plans, patients will be forced to travel to a site in central London. Parents have made it very clear that it is easier, cheaper, safer, and more comfortable to take their children to St George's. There is also a huge added cost. The plans to relocate services will cost an estimated £90 million, more than three times the cost to redevelop facilities at St George's Hospital. Today, I've launched a petition calling on the Government and NHS England to keep the children’s cancer service at St George's Hospital. Add your name and share the petition with friends and family here |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_archives_07-2021/content_232.html": "|\nChildren and young people have suffered immensely during the pandemic. But the mental health crisis facing Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) is nothing new. CAMHS services are at breaking point. They were before the pandemic. Tens of thousands of children are being turned away from mental health services – support they vitally need. Parents have raised this issue. Doctors have raised this issue. The stats provide the evidence. When will the Government admit that CAMHS services need to be better resourced? On the eve of Tokyo 2020, Tooting is preparing to celebrate a hero of the Antwerp Games a century earlier - champion middle-distance runner Albert Hill. Hill, who took gold at the 1920 Olympics, was born and raised in Tooting. A blue plaque commemorating his outstanding achievements is now set to be erected outside his former home. The plaque was funded through community donations, and is the result of the tireless efforts of the students of Fircroft Primary School, who campaigned for its creation. Local historian Geoff Simmons said, “It’s great that Great Britain’s Olympic past is being honoured, but its future is under threat. Tooting Bec Athletics Track, home to the historic athletics club Herne Hill Harriers, and used by 80,000 young people every year, has been ruled unfit for competition and is in need of repair.” Click here to sign the petition calling on Wandsworth Tories to fund vital repairs to Tooting Track. Balham has a long and proud history, and its architecture is of real importance to the local community; and Balham Railway Bridge is a prominent and important feature of this historical architecture. Unfortunately in recent years, the bridge’s grandeur has sadly faded beyond all recognition. I recently spoke with the local community group Beautify Balham who have made suggestions, such as painting the bridge an attractive colour, re-painting the metal columns, and installing up-lighting to showcase the bridge. I am wholly supportive of these suggestions. As such, I wrote to Network Rail, asking them to consider incorporating these simple yet impactful improvements as part of the £2.6 million investment they have committed to restore Balham Station. Swift action was taken and I was delighted to hear that the Bridge has had its first coat of paint! It has been a pleasure to support the wonderful Beautify Balham volunteers with this campaign and I would like to especially thank Councillor Clare Fraser, who works so hard to support local residents. Today, I voted against the Nationality and Borders Bill, a piece of legislation that risks breaking international law and turns our backs on unaccompanied children fleeing war and persecution. The Conservatives just voted to make it harder to give a safe haven to children fleeing violence and war. They should be ashamed. The cruel irony of this Government’s approach is that it’s weak on taking action against criminal gangs and brutal when it comes to orphaned children from war zones. As someone who has held the hands of frightened children and terrified parents working as a doctor in war torn areas such as the Rohingya and Palestine, I am appalled at the Government’s approach to protecting those in need of safety. On Sunday I had the great honour of presenting the medals and winners’ trophy to the Sinjun Grammarians under 12s cricket team - 2021 champions of the Surrey Tier Three League. Masterfully managed by Mukesh Dev, and captained with distinction by Rufus Ford, the team’s achievement is all the more remarkable on account of the club’s small size – with a membership of just over 50 junior players, Sinjun Grammarians rarely have enough players in the same age group to enter into league competitions. Their success is also astounding for the fact that the playing group, who were experiencing league competition for the first time, marched to the title unbeaten in all their 10 games. I could not be more proud of this group of talented young athletes, not only for overcoming the odds and taking the title so convincingly, but for the focus, determination, sportsmanship, and teamwork they showed along the way. This is what Tooting is all about: the players are truly a credit to themselves, their families, their club, and our community. I was absolutely bowled over by the Club’s decision to award me the title of Honorary President of Sinjun Grammarians Cricket Club. This success is undoubtedly the first of many such achievements for this passionate group of young cricketers, and I look forward to celebrating with them again in coming seasons. Well done, team! “Prior to 2017, no Government invested in or prioritised mental health services.”\nI couldn’t have put it better myself - and I didn’t need to, for these are not my words. They are the words of Nadine Dorries, the Mental Health Minister. The devastation left behind by the cuts to mental health services is staggering. And who was the architect of these cuts? No one other than the new Health Secretary during his time as a Treasury Minister. This matter cannot go unaddressed. That is why in Parliament today I asked the new Health Secretary to explain why a quarter of mental health beds have been cut since 2010, why 140,000 children were turned away from mental health services last year, and, finally, if he is ashamed of his track record. See here to view the video. On Sunday, I was back in A&E working in the run up to the England v Italy match. While, unfortunately, it did not come home, it was great to spend time with hard-working colleagues at St Georges. With infections and hospitalisations increasing, it’s still incredibly important for us all to look out for one another and play our part in stopping the spread of the virus. Earlier this week, the Prime Minister gave an update on moving to stage four of the coronavirus easing roadmap. This means that from 19 July, the following will apply:\nUnderstandably, many are worried about the repercussions of these eased restrictions. Indeed, many residents have been in touch regarding the use of face coverings on public transport and their anxieties surrounding this. On Wednesday, Sadiq Khan announced that face coverings will remain mandatory for all, unless exempt, when travelling on the TfL network. This will, no doubt, be a relief to many in the local area, and I pay tribute to the Mayor of London in taking a firm stand against the Government’s recklessness. Labour is calling for a controlled approach that keeps in place baseline measures that can push down infections, like mandatory face masks on public transport – which we know protect people, reduce the spread of the virus, and don’t harm the economy. By removing mask requirements - the Johnson Variant is being fast-tracked. Cases will soar, as will hospitalisations. Everyone in Tooting has been fantastic in reducing the spread of coronavirus. With one of the highest vaccination rates in London, I can only ask residents to continue looking out for one another. The future of Tooting Bec Athletics Track is still yet to be secured, with vital repairs still needing to be undertaken. Tooting Bec Athletics Track is a much-loved and well-utilised facility, both by local residents and the wider London community. The track is a home to schools, clubs such as Herne Hill Harriers, as well as aspiring athletes. To lose such a valuable asset would be a devastating blow to so many of our young people in our local area. Top British athletes are made at Tooting Bec Athletics Track - Jade Johnson, who represented Great Britain at two Olympics, trained at the track since childhood, as has Katie Snowden, who will represent Great Britain in Tokyo next month. By allowing the track to fall into disrepair, Wandsworth Tories are destroying the legacy of London 2012, and seriously damaging the chances of our next generation of Olympic hopefuls in the process. The deadline for the petition to save Tooting Bec Athletics Track has been extended until 1 August – click here to sign and show Wandsworth Tories how much our community cares about the future of our young people. This week, I was honoured to present Dons Local Action Group with the cheque of money raised through my Euro 2020 raffle. I’m so proud that our community has, once again, come together. The response was truly overwhelming, and in only four days we were able to raise £1,270 in much-needed funds for the Dons Local Action Group They’re an incredible local charity and I know they’ll be able to do a lot of good for so many families and young people with the money raised. A huge thank you to everyone who bought a ticket! Worryingly, coronavirus rates are soaring once again across London. The vaccine is our best defence. If you are yet to receive either your first or second dose, please do so as soon as possible. To help get Tooting vaccinated, the Pearl Chemist Vaccination Centre is now offering a walk-in clinic for those aged 18+ at St Boniface Church on Mitcham Road (Monday to Saturday 9-5pm). Appointments are available for first doses as well as second doses. Second doses can be given eight weeks after the first.

Given that there is a nursery and St George's Hospital along this road, it is vital that speed levels are stringently enforced to ensure everyone's safety.\nI will continue to work with the police, Wandsworth Council and local councillors to keep our streets safe and accessible. To this end, I am very pleased to hear that the council is currently considering implementing a zebra crossing outside the nursery to protect both children and parents. Today, I have written to the Managing Director of the Southern Region of Network Rail calling for an investigation looking into improving accessibility and step-free access at Wandsworth Common Station.\nCurrently, there is step free access on Platform 1, but those wishing to travel on Platform 2 must cross an elevated footbridge, which is not accessible for wheelchair users, parents with young children, and the elderly. I have called for a feasibility study to be conducted, given the signifcant proportion of the local community that falls around the station. Read my full letter here: Today, the Committee's Report on the Draft Mental Health Bill has been published - this is a once in a generation opportunity to improve the rights of patients experiencing a mental health crisis and to tackle the health inequalities enshrined in current legislation.\nOver the last six months, I've been proud to work with my committee colleagues, listening to patient voices and evidence from experts. We heard heartbreaking accounts from patients. Above all else, the legislation has to protect them and ensure they receiving appropriate care. For years, the Government kicked updating this legislation into the long grass, and now, the current draft bill still does not go far enough to tackle the racial disparity of those detained under the Mental Health Act. Patient voices must be at the heart of this legislation.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_home-affairs_2/content_471.html": "|\nToday, I voted against the Nationality and Borders Bill, a piece of legislation that risks breaking international law and turns our backs on unaccompanied children fleeing war and persecution. The Conservatives just voted to make it harder to give a safe haven to children fleeing violence and war. They should be ashamed. The cruel irony of this Government’s approach is that it’s weak on taking action against criminal gangs and brutal when it comes to orphaned children from war zones. As someone who has held the hands of frightened children and terrified parents working as a doctor in war torn areas such as the Rohingya and Palestine, I am appalled at the Government’s approach to protecting those in need of safety. On Tuesday, I was alerted to a team of Met Police officers stopping fast food delivery drivers and carrying out immigration checks on Mitcham Road. The only concerns I have received from local residents (which authorities were copied into) were about social distancing, for which an operation of this size seems excessive. However, the police say it was 'a road safety policing operation'. The Home Office say it was in relation to 'suspected immigration offences'. This looks like racial profiling - and under the Equalities Act 2010, this may amount to indirect discrimination due to its disproportionate impact on ethnic minority groups. If it's not unlawful, then it's definitely immoral and I cannot defend it. Our community here in Tooting is inclusive, diverse and welcoming. The celebratory nature of the police’s response to any arrests is not in line with our local values. I have met with the police since and encouraged them to focus their time on fighting crime – not targeting people at work. The recent vigil on Clapham Common was our chance to come together and grieve the loss of Sarah Everard's life. Our chance to mourn the lives of the women lost to violence. And it was a chance to mourn our own lived experiences. I share the frustrations and disappointment felt over police action taken that day. In light of events at Clapham Common, I know many are concerned about the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, and what this divisive law would mean for the right to protest. I want to be clear: Tonight, I will be voting against this Bill. I believe that the Government has undermined this Bill through draconian measures that impose disproportionate controls on free expression and the right to protest. I believe these measures will have an unfair impact on Black, Asian, and ethnic minority people. I also believe 10 year sentences for crimes against statues – significantly longer than the sentences for crimes which disproportionately impact women – is a worrying priority. Under this Government, rape convictions have fallen to an all-time low, delays in the Crown Courts are at an all-time high, and justice is not being served for thousands of women and girls. This is now the time for the Government to correct their woeful record and commit to putting in place long overdue protections for women.\nA number of local residents have reached out to ask me why my name was not included in a letter signed by 61 out of 650 MPs about the very concerning deportation flight to Jamaica. I wanted to explain how the process works.\nFirstly, let me say that this was an incredibly serious matter, which is why I was pleased to see my colleague, Holly Lynch MP, the Shadow Immigration Minister, send an urgent letter to the Government raising concerns. I added my voice to her letter by writing to Priti Patel myself - requesting that the points Holly Lynch raised were answered urgently. A copy of that letter is below:\nAs a member of the Labour Shadow Cabinet, my role is to intervene in matters related to mental health (because I am the Shadow Minister for Mental Health). Members of the Shadow Cabinet do not speak in debates, sign letters, sign EDMs or intervene in matters which are not related to their role. This rule has been in place for as long as I know, it was the same when Jeremy Corbyn was leader.\nI have noticed that my name was put on a list along with 12 colleagues, suggesting we were the only people not to sign this letter. No member of the Labour Shadow Cabinet signed the letter, indeed, almost three quarters of Labour MPs didn't sign the letter. Does that mean that they don't care? No, of course not. Sometimes they miss the deadline to sign, sometimes they can't sign, sometimes they make representations in different ways. It's very disappointing that some would single out me and 12 other colleagues, suggesting we were the only ones not to sign - simply to fit their political agenda. My background has seen me work in war torn countries, disaster zones and refugee camps helping the world's most marginalised and vulnerable people. I always care deeply about these issues and to suggest otherwise is incorrect. I'll continue to liaise with my colleagues in the Home Affairs team with regards to this, and other important issues. Brexit Might Be Done But The Fight Against Boris Johnson's Destruction Must ContinueAlthough the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback.\nWhen the UK leaves the EU this Friday, 31 January 2020, after 47 years of membership, it will be a sombre day for many of us. For others, it will be a day of celebration. For most people, I suspect they will simply hope we can now move on from talking about Brexit at the expense of everything else. As someone who campaigned with all my heart to stay in the EU, and as the first person on Labour’s front bench to publicly call for a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal, I am desperately sad to see us leaving our friends and allies in Europe. But we are leaving. The disastrous result of the General Election has settled that. This is no longer an argument about Leave or Remain, it’s about what kind of future we want for our country and for our children. That’s where the new fight begins. Boris Johnson wants to pretend he’s now “Got Brexit Done”, and we no longer need to worry about the details. He wants us to simply trust him to sort it all out. Well, I don’t trust him. Neither should you. He talks about “Global Britain” whilst turning his back on vulnerable child refugees. He talks about “Taking Back Control” while reducing parliament’s ability to scrutinise his decisions. He talks about attracting “Global Talent” to the UK while creating huge distress and uncertainty for EU citizens, many of whom have been here for years and who have made their lives in this country. The fight for our internationalist values starts now. It will be long, and it will be difficult, because Boris Johnson has a large majority – but that’s why it’s so important. When it feels like hope is lost, that’s when those of us who believe in progressive values and internationalism need to stand up and fight. If we don’t, no-one else is going to do it for us. We need to stand up and fight for our hard-won workers’ rights. We need to stand up and fight for our environmental protections. Most importantly, we need to stand up and fight for the rights of EU citizens living in this country. They are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues, our family. I work side-by-side with many of them in the NHS, when I work shifts as a doctor in my local A&E department. Under the draconian new immigration laws being bandied around by this government, my own Polish mother might not have been able to move to this country and make a life for herself. Although the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback. That’s one of the main reasons I am running to become the next Deputy Leader. We have huge organisational strength through our membership, through our links with the trade unions and through our MPs and councillors embedded in their local communities. Now is the time to deploy those strengths to maximum effect, to hold the Government to account and ensure that we fight back against every attempt to undercut our rights and freedoms at work, every attempt to weaken our environmental safeguards, every attempt to inject privatisation into our National Health Service. The slogan “Get Brexit Done” might have helped win the election for Boris Johnson, but for those of us who stand against his destructive vision for the future of our country, this fight isn’t done. It’s just getting started. My responses to the questions provided by the Labour Campaign for Free Movement 1. Defend and extend free movement: opposing any reduction in the freedoms of UK and EU citizens to live, work, and access social security in each others’ countries, and any immigration system based on incomes, migrants’ utility to business, and number caps or targets.I am the very embodiment of the benefits free movement has brought – my mother is Polish and was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Under the draconian new immigration policies being discussed by this Tory government, she might never have been able to do that. Protecting and extending free movement is at the very heart of my internationalist Labour principles. I believe our country is stronger and better because of free movement. When I work shifts as an A&E doctor in my local hospital, I work with NHS staff from across Europe and it breaks my heart to see many of them feeling unwanted or undervalued because of Brexit. As Deputy Leader, I pledge to do everything in my power to promote the core Labour values of internationalism and solidarity across borders, because I believe human life has the same value no matter where someone comes from. That means defending and extending free movement, and it means fighting to protect the human rights of migrants from this hostile Tory government. 2. Close every detention centreHolding migrants in detention centres, often in substandard conditions, is incredibly cruel and degrading. These are often vulnerable people, fleeing from a variety of horrific circumstances such as war, trafficking and poverty. They have the right to be treated with dignity, as human beings, as we would want ourselves or our family to be treated in such horrendous circumstances. When working abroad as a humanitarian doctor, I’ve seen first-hand some of the terrible conditions people are forced to endure in detention centres and it horrified me. We must fight back against the hostile environment the Tories have created for migrants – the Labour Party has always stood for international solidarity and openness to the world – we need a Labour government to bring those principles back into the core of our approach to immigration. I would want to listen to expert opinion on how to do this in a responsible way, but I certainly would want to close as many detention centres as possible and make sure we have an overall approach to immigration that means a concept as cruel as detention centres are not required in the first place. 3. Unconditional rights to family reunionYes, I fully support this. The unconditional right to family reunion is a fundamental element of treating migrants as human beings with dignity and equal value, rather than the Tory approach of seeing migrants as a problem to be managed. When I’ve worked as a humanitarian doctor in conflict zones across the world, it was always horrendous to see so many families ripped apart or prevented from seeing each other again. When I visited Palestine on a humanitarian mission, I saw sick children alone in hospital because the permit system meant their parents weren’t allowed to visit them. I immediately began working on ways to resolve this. It’s not enough to just talk about this – we need to be working every day to deliver a Labour government so we can fix these kinds of injustices. That’s what I’d do as Deputy Leader. 4. End “no recourse to public funds” policiesI support ending such policies, yes. This is another case of a Tory government treating migrants not as human beings with human dignity and equal value, but instead as a problem to be managed through cruelty. I want to deliver a Labour government with internationalism at its core, which would allow us to change our entire approach to migration, and begin seeing human life as equally valuable and equally dignified no matter where that person was born or where they’ve come from. 5. Oppose all Hostile Environment measures, use of landlords and public service providers as border guards, and restrictions on migrants’ NHS accessThe Tory Hostile Environment approach to immigration is a stain on the soul of their party, and they should be ashamed of it. Tragedies such as the Windrush scandal are a horrendous demonstration of where this approach leads, and I worry a similar scandal could occur with EU citizens who’ve made their lives in this country. I want a Labour government so we can end the Hostile Environment immediately and start treating migrants with the human dignity and respect they deserve. 6. Equal voting rights for all UK residents I am certainly interested in all ideas for how to revitalise our democracy and increase the level of engagement with our political process. Indeed, prior to the General Election in 2019, I publicly called for EU citizens to get the right to vote. Our Labour values of openness and internationalism must be at the core of everything we do. 7. Please share your thoughts on these wider issues that our supporters also feel strongly about:Even after Brexit, the UK government looks set to participate in Frontex (the European border agency) and its “Fortress Europe” policies. Will you challenge these policies? I certainly think the EU has often failed dismally to strike the right balance between border security and solidarity with people fleeing from war, poverty and the effects of global climate change. I am a proud pro-European, but that doesn’t mean my view of the EU is uncritical and I’ve never been afraid to say so. My values of international solidarity and openness don’t stop at the borders of Europe – they extend across the whole world. Human life always has equal value, no matter where that person comes from. Will you support an amnesty for undocumented migrants resident in the UK? We should always treat people with compassion and dignity, and we must place those values at the heart of everything we do when it comes to immigration. People in this country without documentation are often asylum seekers fleeing from horrific conditions and I want to see them treated with the human dignity they deserve. I would want to listen in more detail to expert opinion and feedback on the specific question of whether an amnesty is the right approach, but the principles of human dignity and compassion must always guide everything we do. Anything else you’d like Labour members, supporters and affiliates to know about what your leadership/deputy leadership would mean for migrants and migration policy? I am the living, breathing proof that free movement is a wonderful benefit to our country. My Polish mother was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Working on the frontlines of the NHS as an A&E doctor, I work alongside colleagues from across Europe and the rest of the world, and they are a credit to our country. It makes me proud to be British. But years of Tory government has created a literal Hostile Environment for migrants in this country. The drawbridge is being pulled up, and the rights of a whole generation of people to travel freely and live, love and work across Europe is being taken away. That is a tragedy, but it also means those of us who are proud of our outward-looking, progressive, internationalist values must fight even harder to protect and extend them. The fight starts now, and as your Deputy Leader (or even if I’m not!), I promise I will always be there fighting alongside you for those values with everything I’ve got. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_tooting_9/content_670.html": "|\nLast week the Balham and Tooting Community Association (BATCA) celebrated its 15th anniversary.\nBATCA is a network of diverse individuals and organisations committed to creating a cohesive, thriving community in Balham and Tooting. Their annual events – the Fun Day on Broadwater Road, the Tooting Broadway Peace Ceremony, and the Community Heroes Awards – are local institutions. BATCA have continued their good works throughout the pandemic, moving events online and acting as a platform for groups to share news and information. BATCA are always looking to welcome new members to help them further the organisation’s aims. Click here to find out more, and to join this wonderful collective. In light of the recent tragic events, many residents have been in touch to share their concerns about the lighting in Tooting and Wandsworth Commons. Indeed, many women feel unable to use the Commons in the evening due to the poor lighting, whereby many of the paths are unlit. All our local residents, including women, should feel safe to access these vital green spaces, which is why I have written to Paul Chadwick, Director Environment and Community Services at Wandsworth Council, and Neil Blackley, Head of Parks at Enable, who manage Wandsworth’s green spaces on the Council’s behalf, calling for action to improve the lighting across both sites as quickly as possible. Please check back here for updates on the Council’s response.\nWhen the water has been turned off, the water flow can disturb sediment in the pipes, which can then cause the water to appear to be dark in colour. I have been in contact with Thames Water regarding this and they have assured me that it is not harmful.\nWith the colder weather, Thames Water have also advised the following to help prevent water leaks: • Check pipes – thaw frozen pipes with a hot water bottle or a towel soaked in water • Bleed the radiators – use a radiator key to open the valve and release trapped air • Look after your central heating – get your boiler serviced often and keep the heating on low when not at home • Find your stop tap – these are usually found under the kitchen sink. Turn right to tighten and left to loosen • Keep a plumber on hand – keep details of a reputable plumber on hand and make sure to check home insurance cover In the instance that you see a leak, you can report it to Thames Water here, then phone a plumber immediately. Please do keep an eye on my Twitter, where I am posting updates on the water issues as they arise.\nTeachers and school teams are doing a phenomenal job, and I know that digital poverty is a real worry for them, as well as for families across Tooting. Early on in the pandemic, Labour called for a set of measures that would see a mass roll-out of devices and internet access to students currently struggling to learn online, alongside steps such as ‘zero-rating’ of educational websites to ensure data charges are not putting barriers on access to education during lockdown.\nThe digital divide risks failing a generation. I am so pleased to have been able to help close this gap. As puppy prices soar across the UK, I am aware of concerns with the recent rise of dog thefts in our community, with incidents taking place particularly on and around Tooting Common. Perpetrators have been using a number of tactics, including snatching leads from dog owners’ hands, using dog whistles to attract dogs roaming off-lead, and impersonating RSPCA employees to gain access to dogs. One strategy involves approaching people walking their dogs and informing them that their dog resembles an animal that has been reported lost, before asking to scan the dog’s microchip in their van. Once near the van, dogs are being separated from their unsuspecting owners before driving away. The RSPCA reminds that their officers will always be wearing uniforms bearing the charity’s logo and will be carrying identification, and asks that any member of the public who believes someone is impersonating an officer report the incident to the RSPCA and to local police. Suspicious activity – including being approached with questions about your dog, asking for photographs to be taken of your dog – should also be reported. I have written to Inspector Barrie Capper, Head of Wandsworth Neighbourhood Policing Team, asking them to take action to protect our pets and tackle this awful crime. In the meantime, Blue Cross have provided a helpful list of actions you can take to help keep your dog safe.\nClick here for more information. As you will know, a South African variant of Covid-19 has arrived in the UK. This new Covid variant has now been detected in CR4 (Merton). Residents in CR4 are no different to us in neighbouring Tooting (SW16 and SW17). We use the same shops, the same hospital, and the same parks, so if it’s there, it could very easily be here. This will be the same across all affected areas. As a matter of urgency, the Government needs to launch widespread testing in neighbouring postcodes. This is the only way to see how widespread these new variants are. I have written to the Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock MP, the Director of Public Health at Wandsworth Council, Shannon Katiyo, and the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Council, Paul Martin, to ask about plans to launch testing in neighbouring postcodes. While I press for action on this, we need to make sure we’re all doing everything we can to keep ourselves and each other safe. It’s absolutely vital that we minimise our social contact to prevent the spread of this new variant within our community. Please think twice before leaving home, and when you do leave, please continue to adhere to social distancing. Together, we will get through this. Earlier this week I met with local small business owners to hear the issues affecting them.\nFrom the insufficient support available to businesses that are non-direct ratepayers, to a lack of flexibility from landlords regarding rental payments, it is clear that the challenges Tooting small business owners are experiencing are considerable. Their resilience in the face of adversity is a credit to our community. The concerns shared will inform my actions to ensure that small businesses remain the beating heart of Tooting. Please check back here for updates, and keep an eye on my Facebook and Twitter pages for announcements of further events. In light of the upcoming Fire Safety Bill, I would to thank every resident who has written to me with their concerns on this and for continuing to keep me updated on the cladding issues affecting their property. I recognise what an exceptionally difficult time this is and appreciate how much anxiety the cladding proposals are causing to many leaseholders.\nOn more than fifteen occasions, Ministers promised that leaseholders would not be landed with the costs of remedial works. Yet, people are still being put at risk, trapped in flammable buildings for a third lockdown, with leaseholders placed in an impossible position and promises broken. It is evident that the Government’s handling of the cladding crisis has lacked any sense of grip or urgency. For this reason, the Labour Party have tabled an Opposition Day Debate on cladding for Monday, which will subsequently bring forward a vote that will call for leaseholders to be protected from the costs of remediating their blocks with dangerous cladding. The party will also be tabling a number of amendments to the Fire Safety Bill that will aim to protect leaseholders from unfair costs through the power of the law. I am aware that many residents have been in touch to request that I support the McPartland and Smith amendment, which provides welcome clarity on the specific costs that would be prevented from being passed on to leaseholders. Labour has sought to go further on this. As currently drafted, the McPartland and Smith amendment would not have covered blocks like Grenfell - where flammable cladding has been added at some stage following the building of the block. It only applies to defects in the original design of buildings. The Labour Party’s amendment would ensure that the cost of fire safety problems from refurbishment jobs, like the cladding on Grenfell Tower, cannot be passed on to leaseholders. Labour’s amendments also include new clauses so that the Bill protects leaseholders from the day it comes into law, instead of an unknown date in the future. I would like to thank my colleagues in the Labour Party, Sarah Jones MP, Nick Thomas-Symonds MP, Thangam Debbonaire MP and Mike Amesbury MP for their hard work and commitment to addressing this large injustice on a national scale. If any residents have any further queries on this issue, please do not hesitate to get in touch to discuss this further. In the meantime, I hope this post assures you of the steps myself and the Labour Party are taking to protect tenants and leaseholders during this cladding crisis. I recently raised residents' concerns about damage to our beloved Tooting Common with Mr Neil Blackley, Head of Parks at Enable Leisure and Culture and have since received a response on this important issue I am told comprehensive is in plan to return the Common to its pre-pandemic state, while keeping as much as possible open for public use. Initial works will target the worst affected areas, and will see the soil replenished and grass seeds planted. While these works are scheduled to commence in the spring, it will be a number of years before this much-loved part of Tooting is restored.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

It was brilliant to welcome residents from Tooting and Furzedown. I am really grateful to everyone who attended, including some local organisations and charities who do invaluable work in the community. Tonight, I held a peace vigil at Tooting Broadway station to bring our community together to remember all those who have died in Israel and Gaza recently. I want to pay a huge thanks to the representatives from our local religious groups who said a prayer for peace.\nDuring some of our darkest hours, Tooting reminds us that there is always hope.\nTonight, I invited Wandsworth Police to join our community to discuss how they’re working with Wandsworth Council to tackle violence against women and girls.\nMaking our community safe is a key priority for me. My door is always open. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch.\nIn recent weeks, thousands of people across south London and south-east England have signed my petition calling on NHS England to keep children's cancer services at St George's Hospital, including many parents who have told me how worried they are about this proposed closure.\nLast week, NHS England launched its consultation on the future of services at St George’s Hospital and I want to make sure that we have every chance to defend and protect our local services. Keeping services at St George's is best for our patients and best for the NHS, but this can only happen with the support of people in the community who will be affected by this decision. Please spare a few minutes to complete to consultation questionnaire and share your views with the NHS. The consultation is running until Monday 18 December. See full details of the consultation here and please share this as widely as possible with friends and family here.\nVisiting Earlsfield Primary, I saw first-hand how universal free school meals are working to produce a level playing field in schools and provide all children with a delicious and nutritious lunch.\nLunch should never be a struggle for families or a time of stress and stigma for children – and Labour Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan’s funding means it won’t be here in London. The verdict from the judges that matter: the Red Velvet cake with beetroot was a hit.\nIt was an absolute pleasure to take part in Wimbledon Sustainable Fashion Week with Wimbledon Go Inspire. I was so inspired by the incredible panel talking about sustainable fashion. I even got to wear some incredible sustainable knitwear. With 80 prison officers unavailable on the day Daniel Khalife escaped from Wandsworth Prison - it beggars belief that he was even allowed to work in the kitchen. The Government need to explain themselves. This morning, I've been out and about in Tooting with Wandsworth Police Officers. We've been talking to residents who are concerned about rising street drinking and anti-social behaviour.\nTogether we're now working to increase the number of patrols in the area and ensure that resident's concerns are being addressed. London to Brighton? Completed it.\nFleur Anderson and I absolutely smashed a 55-mile bike ride, raising money for the brilliant St George's Hospital Charity. I can't believe just how challenging it was and I want to thank everyone who helped us to smash our fundraising target. You can still donate here Today, I've been speaking about the very serious concerns I have regarding the prisoner escape from Wandsworth Prison. The Government need to provide answers regarding how this was allowed to happen.

Read my piece in the New Statesman here.\nRishi Sunak's inaction while a humanitarian disaster has unfolded in Gaza is nothing short of shameful. Today I challenged him at Prime Minister's Questions on why he continues to stand idly by while innocent civilians suffer in their hundreds of thousands.\nFollowing the decision to relocate children's cancer services in South East England away from St George's Hospital, I met with the Health Secretary with a cross-party group of MPs to raise our concerns.\nWhen I visited the Pinckney Ward where this care is conducted, I met with Jackson, a former patient there, and his parents, who told me that such a move would be detrimental for parents, children and the hospital alike. I have urged the Secretary to review and reconsider NHS England's decision as soon as possible. Eight years ago today, I was selected as the Tooting Labour candidate for the by-election caused by Sadiq becoming a candidate for Mayor of London.\nIt has been a huge honour and privilege to serve as the representative for the community in which I was born and raised. My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has supported me on this incredible journey. The beginning of Mental Health Awareness week was marked by grim tidings that, for the first time in recorded history, the number of people on an waiting list for mental health treatment has hit 2 million.\nThis is more than the combined population of four major British cities and is a shocking indictment of the Tories' failed record on mental health.\nFollowing a recent spot inspection of HMP Wandsworth by the Chief Inspector of Prisons. an Urgent Notification was issued to the Secretary of State for Justice, meaning that the Chief Inspector has serious and immediate concerns about the day-to-day operation of the prison.\nThe report was damning and laid the blame for the deficiencies squarely at the Government's door, citing a lack of leadership at the very highest levels. I have been raising these issues for years now and my concerns have gone unheeded by this Tory Government, even after a high-profile alleged escape last autumn. Read my Twitter thread on the subject below:\nNew data published by the Environment Agency recently revealed that sewage was pumped in our local rivers, the Graveney and Wandle, for over 700 hours last year. This is equivalent to the entire month of February and demonstrates this Tory Government's complete disregard for our natural environment.\nOnly Labour has a plan to clean up our waterways and hold water companies to account by fines for illegal discharges, blocking bonuses for bosses of companies that violate the rules and holding these bosses personally criminally liable for any violations. History was made last Thursday as my friend and predecessor as MP for Tooting, Sadiq Khan, was re-elected for an unprecedented third term as Mayor of London.\nAfter weeks of hard graft, the result was a decisive victory for Sadiq and Labour with our wonderful capital rejecting the divisive, toxic politics of the Tory candidate. I look forward to continuing to work with Sadiq to make Tooting and our wider city a greener, cleaner, safer and more prosperous place to live.\nAs someone who grew up with and later overcame a stammer, I know all too well the difficulties and challenges that having one can bring. I was very glad and honoured to join Dermot and Alison on This Morning once again to talk about stammers and the wonderful work that Stamma charity do.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

I really enjoyed talking to the staff about the work they do: representing individuals and groups, helping people through disputes, and pushing for legislative change that keeps the UK’s workplaces reflective of our values and aspirations. If you haven’t already: join a union – they are there for you.\nAll too often, children are stuck on long waiting lists for mental health treatment and thousands of people are having their referrals closed before an appointment.\nThis Tory Government caused the crisis in mental health services - when will they fix it?\nToday, I appeared on BBC Question Time, where I held the Government to account on the shameful Rwanda policy, their neglect of the NHS, and the issues surrounding Thames Water.\nFor Pride month, Anneliese Dodds MP, Shadow Women and Equalities Secretary, and I brought together mental health and LGBT+ organisations to discuss the challenges facing the mental health of LGBT+ people.\nJoining Billy Bragg’s ‘Left Field’ stage at Glastonbury, I spoke about the importance of protecting our NHS. It’s crucial that NHS staff are supported in their work and that patients can access timely treatment.\nIt was great to join Nish Kumar and Coco Khan on Pod Save the UK. We spoke about working on the frontline during the pandemic, Labour’s bold mental health plan, and pitying Matt Hancock.\nSee a clip of the Podcast here:\nLondon UNISON members have fought hard for some amazing victories over the last year. I was proud to meet with some of our fantastic reps working in local healthcare when I addressed UNISON’s conference last month.\nToday, I proudly led Labour's opposition debate on mental health and put forward our plan to transform mental health services across the country. It includes more staff, specialists in schools, hubs in communities, treatment within a month. Today, I called on the Health Secretary to get his act together on our failing mental health services. Across mental health services, children are being failed, police are spending hours waiting with children in crisis in A&E, staff are overworked are under-resourced. It's time for the Health Secretary to get a grip or get out of the way. Some businesses take their workplace mental health responsibilities very seriously. It was extremely insightful to talk to leaders of Talon, JCDecaux, Clear Channel Outdoor, Ocean Outdoor today, about what they’re doing to support employees’ mental health.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

If you are yet to receive either your first or second dose, please do so as soon as possible. To help get Tooting vaccinated, the Pearl Chemist Vaccination Centre is now offering a walk-in clinic for those aged 18+ at St Boniface Church on Mitcham Road (Monday to Saturday 9-5pm). Appointments are available for first doses as well as second doses. Second doses can be given eight weeks after the first. Any questions can be directed to Pearl Chemist on 0208 049 6640. As you will most likely be aware, coronavirus cases are currently rising exponentially due to the Delta variant. The situation in Wandsworth remains serious. We currently have a local rate of 238.7 cases per 100,000 people - well above the national average. While the vaccine is giving added protection by reducing deaths and hospitalisations, it is important to bear in mind that it does not eradicate transmission and those who have been vaccinated can still become unwell with coronavirus. Data available from the Government suggests that some areas within Tooting have a higher infection rate than the Wandsworth average of 238.7 cases per 100,000 and these are:\nWhile we need not panic, we should remain careful. A reminder that symptoms of coronavirus include: loss of taste or smell; temperature exceeding 37 degrees; new and persistent cough. Other common symptoms also include feeling tired and a headache. Those experiencing these symptoms should book a free PCR test as soon as possible here. Those aged 18 or over are encouraged to take up the offer of a vaccine. Appointments can be booked here. Information about local walk-in clinics is available here. Unlike previously, second doses of the vaccine are available after eight weeks and many walk-in centres will vaccinate those who bring along their vaccination card. 1 in 3 people who have coronavirus are asymptomatic, so twice weekly testing is another way to keep ourselves and others safe. Lateral flow tests can be ordered for free here. I am in regular contact with NHS England and South West London CCG, who oversee the local coronavirus response. If you are a Tooting resident in need of assistance, please do not hesitate to email [email protected] and please keep an eye on my website and social media pages for further updates. On Saturday, the official UEFA Euro 2020 cup came to the Kings Head in Tooting Bec, the day of England’s historic 4-0 quarter-final win against Ukraine. It was my pleasure to offer two lucky people, plus five guests each, the chance to win VIP access and the opportunity to have their photo taken with the trophy, with raffle ticket proceeds going to Dons Local Action Group. Of all the places UEFA could choose to send the trophy, it’s fantastic that they chose here in Tooting! This tournament has brought much needed positivity and togetherness to our community, and it was fantastic to see the excitement of those lucky enough to meet the trophy. Fingers crossed for a win at the semi-final on Tuesday. We are all rooting for you, England! On 21st June it was announced that Balham Station would be closed to outbound passengers at peak travel times until December 2021, to undertake essential escalator repairs at the station. I met with Transport for London to outline my significant concerns. As a result of this, it was agreed there would be a week-long trial at Balham Station, with the staircase remaining open for use throughout the day, permitting onward travel from the station. This trial began on Monday 28th June. I am thrilled to say this trial was successful and TfL have now confirmed that Balham Station is to remain open while these essential works are ongoing! While this is undoubtedly great news and will ease the worries of the many local residents and commuters who regularly use this station, it is important to remember that - with only one staircase available - social distancing at peak travel times remains a valid concern. As such, to ensure that Balham Station remains open, and we keep ourselves and each other safe, please allow extra time for travel through the station. It is with a massive smile that I offer my congratulations to Kim Leadbeater on being elected as Member of Parliament for Batley and Spen! Kim’s campaign has been marred by bitterness and threatening behaviour. As a woman in politics, I know first-hand the impact this can have. As such, I would like to pay tribute to Kim for her resilient and positive campaigning. I would also like to say a huge thank you to all the Labour staffers and activists who have worked so hard in Batley in the face of such intimidation. We owe them so much. I look forward to welcoming Kim Leadbeater MP to Parliament. With the re-opening of non-essential retail, I took the opportunity to shine a spotlight on the local businesses/business owners that make our vibrant community such a fantastic place to live and work. The easing of national Government restrictions marks an important point in our recovery - our community and high street have so much to offer, so for six weeks I showcased the stores, restaurants, cafes, and other small businesses that make Tooting what it is! A huge thank you to every single business, business owner, employee, and customer who got behind the campaign. The past year has been challenging, so to see our community come together to support the local economy has been truly heartwarming. While this week marks the final instalment (for now) of Spotlight Saturdays, I will continue to find new ways to shine a bright light on Tooting and our wonderful community. Wandsworth is in the top 5 for vaccination rates across London! This is a great step forward and I am proud of everyone here in Tooting who has taken the steps to protect themselves and others by receiving their jab. However, we still have a way to go before everyone is protected against coronavirus. We need to keep pushing to ensure that those who can do so, are vaccinated as soon as possible. Information on how to book your vaccination appointment can be found here. It is also vital that if, for any reason, you have to change or cancel your vaccine appointment that you let the GP surgery or vaccination centre that you appointment is booked with know. You can manage your vaccination appointment here. If you are still unsure about having the jab or have any questions, more information can be found on the vaccine and answers to many common concerns on Wandsworth Council’s website here. I was deeply concerned - as I know many local residents were - to hear of plans to close Balham station to outward passengers from next Monday until December 2021. While I recognise the scheduled repairs to the escalator are essential works, it is important to me that residents are not inconvenienced by the planned updates. Indeed, I also appreciate that it was alarming for many to learn that the closure was to begin in less than a week, lasting for such an extended period of time. It is my understanding that the decision to close Balham station to outward travelling passengers was taken after a trial closure of the downward escalator indicated that use of the staircase at peak travel times was resulting in over-crowding and therefore social distancing was difficult. I called a meeting with Transport for London to outline my concerns and discuss alternatives, such as more staff at the station to support social distancing at peak travel times. I am pleased to announce that as a result of this meeting, TfL have agreed to undertake a week-long trial at Balham Station, which will see the staircase open for use throughout the day and outward travel therefore possible from the station. The trial will commence on Monday 28th June and last 3-4 days. Following the trial, TfL will assess whether outward travel from Balham during the planned escalator repairs is viable. During this time - and beyond should the trial prove successful - I would recommend additional time is allowed for travel through Balham Station. By doing so, we increase the likelihood of a successful trial. More importantly, we can all play our part to ensure all residents can travel safely. Please check back for further updates on this situation. The work of biomedical scientists and laboratory staff is incredibly valuable - and this has never been clearer than since the outset of the coronavirus pandemic. Often overlooked as a profession, I was pleased to join others in thanking those working in healthcare sciences. For every coronavirus test conducted, a biomedical scientist has been behind it, working hard to ensure PCR tests are returned safely. I would like to thank, in particular, our incredible microbiology team at St George’s. Working in A&E, I know just how much our NHS relies on the incredible efforts of lab staff. I have included photos of the microbiology team at St George’s, featuring Chris James, a Specialist Biomedical Scientist in Biochemistry who has worked at St George’s for 9 years, and Silva, a Specialist Biomedical Scientist in Medical Microbiology and Virology who has worked St George’s Hospital for the past 4 years, after moving to the UK from Portugal. Silva’s words about her work as a biomedical scientist are impactful and I hope everyone is able to recognise the incredible work they do. “Being a biomedical scientist is an extremely impactful role in healthcare. Even though it’s not patient facing, our work and the speed and accuracy with which we can produce results is essential for patient care.” As you will no doubt be aware, the Covid-19 situation remains serious, with the Delta variant spreading rapidly throughout the country. One of the most important steps we can take to stop the spread of the coronavirus is to get vaccinated as soon as possible. For this reason, a range of walk-in vaccination sites have been launched across South West London. People aged over 18 are invited to drop into the Tooting and Mitcham United F.C. vaccination centre on Saturday 19th or Sunday 20th 9am - 8pm, to receive their first or second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Unvaccinated over 40s and over 40s who have received their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine before mid-April can also head down to the Roehampton Vaccination Centre, located in the Queen Mary’s Hospital car park, on Sunday between 8am and 7.45pm to receive their second dose. Together we can stop the spread of Covid-19. Details of additional walk-in vaccine centres in South West London are available here. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

However, this list is not exhaustive and anyone who is severely affected by a mental health problem is encouraged to contact their GP if they have not yet been invited to receive the vaccine. If you are a carer for a person with a severe mental illness, you could also be eligible. Click here for more information on eligibility or contact your GP. If you are eligible, to book or manage an existing vaccination appointment, click here. The inability to afford everyday hygiene and personal grooming essentials is sadly a growing problem. With people and families hit hard by the ongoing pandemic, hygiene poverty is a bigger problem than ever before - many are struggling to afford essential products like soap, shampoo, toothpaste, period products, and hand sanitiser. Here in Wandsworth, a new hygiene bank has opened to tackle this growing problem and alleviate the issue of hygiene poverty in our local area. As a volunteer-run project, all the money raised by the hygiene bank goes directly towards providing much-needed essentials for local residents, with all donated products distributed to local frontline organisations in the borough. To find out more about the Hygiene Bank Wandsworth, or to make a donation, see here. The issue of litter in our local area is not a new problem. Indeed, back in 2019 I provided Wandsworth Council with a number of solutions to this issue, which were not acknowledged or enacted upon. I have recently been inundated with complaints from residents who have received Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs). As you may know, FPNs cannot be appealed, and I am concerned about the lack of oversight and accountability this procedure affords. It is clear from the litter on our streets that fining residents for putting out their household waste is not defeating the issue of fly-tipping. Fly-tipping fines need to be issued to the right people, for the right reasons – to deter genuine incidences of fly-tipping. Instead of being a deterrent, I am concerned that these fly-tipping fines are being misused as a Council cash-grab – making money from hardworking residents under the guise of keeping our streets clean. I have written to Paul Martin, Chief Executive at Wandsworth Council, and Paul Chadwick, Director of Environment and Community Services, to ask what action they will take to address these concerns. Keep an eye out for updates here.\nWhen the water has been turned off, the water flow can disturb sediment in the pipes, which can then cause the water to appear to be dark in colour. I have been in contact with Thames Water regarding this and they have assured me that it is not harmful.\nWith the colder weather, Thames Water have also advised the following to help prevent water leaks: • Check pipes – thaw frozen pipes with a hot water bottle or a towel soaked in water • Bleed the radiators – use a radiator key to open the valve and release trapped air • Look after your central heating – get your boiler serviced often and keep the heating on low when not at home • Find your stop tap – these are usually found under the kitchen sink. Turn right to tighten and left to loosen • Keep a plumber on hand – keep details of a reputable plumber on hand and make sure to check home insurance cover In the instance that you see a leak, you can report it to Thames Water here, then phone a plumber immediately. Please do keep an eye on my Twitter, where I am posting updates on the water issues as they arise. The end of 2020 brought the news that we’d been waiting for - the first vaccine was approved for use in the UK. I’m hugely grateful to all the scientists who have made this happen. Around the world they’ve been working non-stop – just like our frontline healthcare professionals and key workers - to put a stop to this virus and allow us to get on with life as normal. Now another milestone in the vaccination programme is happening on our doorstep. St George’s is one of four sites participating in a new study to assess the safety and immune response of the Oxford-AstraZenaca jab in healthy children aged 6-17 years old. Building on previous trials of the vaccine, which have shown that it is safe, produces strong immune system responses, and has high efficacy in all adults, this trial will assess if children and young adults make a good immune response with the vaccine. I recognise that some have concerns about the vaccine, and dangerous myths circulate on social media – it’s simply not good enough to just ignore them and hope they go away. Labour has offered to work with ministers to tackle online harms. And we can all play our part in putting friends and family members at ease by reminding them that we can trust the NHS to take care of us in these difficult times. If the vaccine is good enough for scientists and the regulator, it’s good enough for my family and I. Indeed, I have joined together with a cross-party group of MPs, encouraging everyone to take up the vaccine. The video can be viewed here. We won’t see changes overnight and we still need to look out for our communities. Let's regain the spirit of coming together like we did in the first days of the pandemic and work to eradicate this virus.\nTeachers and school teams are doing a phenomenal job, and I know that digital poverty is a real worry for them, as well as for families across Tooting. Early on in the pandemic, Labour called for a set of measures that would see a mass roll-out of devices and internet access to students currently struggling to learn online, alongside steps such as ‘zero-rating’ of educational websites to ensure data charges are not putting barriers on access to education during lockdown.\nThe digital divide risks failing a generation. I am so pleased to have been able to help close this gap. I know that the Climate and Ecological Emergency (CEE) Bill is one of interest to many people here in Tooting. On 9th February, the CEE Bill was debated in a thirty-minute adjournment debate. Adjournment debates are spaces at the end of the Parliamentary day when MPs can debate a specific topic. As you may know, the CEE Bill is a Private Members Bill (Presentation Bill), meaning that it does not involve a debate or a vote in Parliament, but rather it is a way of drawing attention to an issue. I support the principles of this Bill and will therefore continue to support Parliamentary measures that seek to implement many of the principles laid out in the Bill. Indeed, I have already supported several amendments to the Environment Bill in order to improve it, such as Clause 2 for environmental targets on particulate matter and Clause 7 for Environmental Improvement Plans. I will absolutely continue to support strong and effective amendments to the Environment Bill when it returns to the House of Commons in due course. The climate crisis is an imminent threat to current and future generations. Please know that I am committed to holding the Government to account on their approach to climate change. As puppy prices soar across the UK, I am aware of concerns with the recent rise of dog thefts in our community, with incidents taking place particularly on and around Tooting Common. Perpetrators have been using a number of tactics, including snatching leads from dog owners’ hands, using dog whistles to attract dogs roaming off-lead, and impersonating RSPCA employees to gain access to dogs. One strategy involves approaching people walking their dogs and informing them that their dog resembles an animal that has been reported lost, before asking to scan the dog’s microchip in their van. Once near the van, dogs are being separated from their unsuspecting owners before driving away. The RSPCA reminds that their officers will always be wearing uniforms bearing the charity’s logo and will be carrying identification, and asks that any member of the public who believes someone is impersonating an officer report the incident to the RSPCA and to local police. Suspicious activity – including being approached with questions about your dog, asking for photographs to be taken of your dog – should also be reported. I have written to Inspector Barrie Capper, Head of Wandsworth Neighbourhood Policing Team, asking them to take action to protect our pets and tackle this awful crime. In the meantime, Blue Cross have provided a helpful list of actions you can take to help keep your dog safe.\nClick here for more information. Local residents living or passing through Rackham Mews in Furzedown may have seen the large fly-tip that occurred earlier in the week. Understandably, this is very unpleasant for those who live near this area and I have therefore written to Paul Chadwick, Director of Environment and Community Services at Wandsworth Council, as well as notifying the local councillors of the issue in the hope that this can be rectified as soon as possible. Please be assured that I will keep local resident updated of the progress on this. Furzedown Police are currently appealing for witnesses, so if you have any information about this fly-tip, please do email [email protected] or message them via Twitter. As you will know, a South African variant of Covid-19 has arrived in the UK. This new Covid variant has now been detected in CR4 (Merton). Residents in CR4 are no different to us in neighbouring Tooting (SW16 and SW17). We use the same shops, the same hospital, and the same parks, so if it’s there, it could very easily be here. This will be the same across all affected areas. As a matter of urgency, the Government needs to launch widespread testing in neighbouring postcodes. This is the only way to see how widespread these new variants are. I have written to the Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock MP, the Director of Public Health at Wandsworth Council, Shannon Katiyo, and the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Council, Paul Martin, to ask about plans to launch testing in neighbouring postcodes. While I press for action on this, we need to make sure we’re all doing everything we can to keep ourselves and each other safe. It’s absolutely vital that we minimise our social contact to prevent the spread of this new variant within our community. Please think twice before leaving home, and when you do leave, please continue to adhere to social distancing. Together, we will get through this. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has supported me on this incredible journey. One of the most fulfilling parts of my role as your MP is helping local people solve problems and, in this case, save money.\nA Furzedown pensioner had been denied over £12,000 in backdated pension payments and Pension Credit, however following my intervention with the Department for Work and Pensions, this money was recouped. If you have a problem with your state benefits or pension, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me and I'd be happy to help. Wandsworth Labour are freezing council tax for another year to help families through the cost-of-living crisis.\nAt the same time, we're improving services and building a better Wandsworth. My South London Press column is out today! As it was Valentine's Day this week, I wrote a love letter to my local area.\nAcross Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting, there is such an amazing range of people and culture locally. Read my article here👇 https://londonnewsonline.co.uk/ Wandsworth is bursting with creativity and culture. Our art, food and history are what makes our community such a great place to live.\nToday, Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney, and Marsha de Cordova, MP for Battersea, and I have written to Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, to support Wandsworth’s bid to be London Borough of Culture 2025. As the MP for Tooting, the safety of our community is my top priority. I am delighted that more than 100 local businesses have already signed up to become a Safe Space.\nFor more details, head to the Safe Space here It was wonderful to attend the Furzedown Project Christmas Party with a great carol performance from local children from Penwortham Primary School. Truly brilliant to see the community come together ahead of Christmas.\nOne of the most important jobs I do as your local Member of Parliament is ensuring that our wonderful communities in Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown, Tooting and Wandsworth Common remain safe and welcoming places to live.\nTo this end, I have recently hosted public meetings with local police leadership in Balham and Furzedown, conducted a walkaround with the Borough Superintendent around the local area, and written to the police on behalf of local residents on a wide range of issues. Please do let me know if you have any concerns regarding crime issues in the local area - my door is always open. It was great to bring together local charities, faith leaders, and leader of Wandsworth Council, Simon Hogg who are all working tirelessly to support local families through the cost-of-living crisis.\nI have already been contacted by countless Tooting residents who are concerned about how they are going to pay their bills and put food on the table this winter, and I fear this will only get worse as we move further into the winter months. With so many households already feeling the squeeze, it’s crucial that we work together to tackle poverty. Representatives from Earlsfield and Wandsworth foodbanks as well as Dons Local Action Group and Little Village Tooting told me that they are seeing unprecedented demand at present, as more and more of those who were just-about-managing become unable to afford the basics. All the organisations represented spoke of the added difficulties the rise in energy prices have brought. The hike in energy prices has meant that even the local charities who are there to address the crisis are struggling to pay their bills, and this means they are less able to help those in need. This comes at the worst possible time, when demand is at it’s highest level for decades. Everyone at the event had numerous stories of people facing hardship, people in overcrowded accommodation, people not being able to put food on the table or buy school uniforms for their children. Many people are also concerned about how they will meet the additional cost of christmas. Despite heartbreaking stories, it was uplifting to see so many people who donate their time, energy and money into making things better for people in our community. I am always amazed by the generosity of people in Tooting. However, in Britain in 2022 these organisations and charitable schemes shouldn’t have to exist. It is imperative that the Government take action immediately to support people through the months ahead. I was deeply concerned to hear pupils at Graveney School in Tooting were being targeted in a recent spate of muggings. I have been in touch with local police leadership to insist on swift action to address this issue. I know that the police are actively working to identify and arrest those responsible.\nEvery child deserves to walk our streets without fear. I am therefore pleased to hear that the local police force are carrying out high visibility patrols and are carrying out regular weapon sweeps around the school. Police are also patrolling the area in unmarked cars to try and identify and arrest the suspects. Pupils at Graveney School have also received assemblies on how to keep safe and how to report a street crime. The local police have also liaised with local CCTV to ensure appropriate coverage. It is vital that all of these issues are reported to the police so they can bring these worrying incidents to an end as quickly as possible. Anyone who has been a victim of a street robbery in this area who is yet to report the incident to the police are advised to do so. Please be assured, I will continue to work with our local police team to resolve this issue as quickly as possible, and I will continue to follow this case as a matter of urgency. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

The brutal murder of innocent civilians in their own homes, killing innocent festivalgoers, raping women and taking children hostage must be condemned in the strongest possible terms - nothing can justify it. Those who planned and carried out the attacks must face justice.\nWe have not been close to peace in the region, but there is no doubt that these attacks, and the response from Israel, will set us back many years. This will be devastating for the many innocent people in Israel and Palestine who just want peace. I fear it will be innocent men, women and children from Gaza who are going to pay the price for Hamas' attacks. I have been very critical of Netanyahu throughout the years, and I really do worry about what the next few days and weeks will bring. The cutting off of water, gas and electricity supplies breaches a whole host of internationally recognised laws. Refusing to allow aid in and stopping food supplies will hit the most vulnerable the hardest. Countless innocent lives will be lost and the international community must work on a resolution that de-escalates the conflict as soon as possible. The discourse I've seen on Twitter has appalled me in recent days, which is why I have decided to post this on my website, instead of there. I have worked as a humanitarian doctor in the region, spanning a period of over a decade. I've always sought the recognition of a sovereign Palestinian state, and my views have not changed, I believe it is the only way to achieve peace in the region. But I will also call out barbaric attacks when they occur. The rape and murder of innocent civilians should be called out and I'm sure the vast majority of people will share my disgust.\nIn recent weeks, thousands of people across south London and south-east England have signed my petition calling on NHS England to keep children's cancer services at St George's Hospital, including many parents who have told me how worried they are about this proposed closure.\nLast week, NHS England launched its consultation on the future of services at St George’s Hospital and I want to make sure that we have every chance to defend and protect our local services. Keeping services at St George's is best for our patients and best for the NHS, but this can only happen with the support of people in the community who will be affected by this decision.

The brutal murder of innocent civilians in their own homes, killing innocent festivalgoers, raping women and taking children hostage must be condemned in the strongest possible terms - nothing can justify it. Those who planned and carried out the attacks must face justice.\nWe have not been close to peace in the region, but there is no doubt that these attacks, and the response from Israel, will set us back many years. This will be devastating for the many innocent people in Israel and Palestine who just want peace. I fear it will be innocent men, women and children from Gaza who are going to pay the price for Hamas' attacks. I have been very critical of Netanyahu throughout the years, and I really do worry about what the next few days and weeks will bring. The cutting off of water, gas and electricity supplies breaches a whole host of internationally recognised laws. Refusing to allow aid in and stopping food supplies will hit the most vulnerable the hardest. Countless innocent lives will be lost and the international community must work on a resolution that de-escalates the conflict as soon as possible. The discourse I've seen on Twitter has appalled me in recent days, which is why I have decided to post this on my website, instead of there. I have worked as a humanitarian doctor in the region, spanning a period of over a decade. I've always sought the recognition of a sovereign Palestinian state, and my views have not changed, I believe it is the only way to achieve peace in the region. But I will also call out barbaric attacks when they occur. The rape and murder of innocent civilians should be called out and I'm sure the vast majority of people will share my disgust.\nIn recent weeks, thousands of people across south London and south-east England have signed my petition calling on NHS England to keep children's cancer services at St George's Hospital, including many parents who have told me how worried they are about this proposed closure.\nLast week, NHS England launched its consultation on the future of services at St George’s Hospital and I want to make sure that we have every chance to defend and protect our local services. Keeping services at St George's is best for our patients and best for the NHS, but this can only happen with the support of people in the community who will be affected by this decision. Please spare a few minutes to complete to consultation questionnaire and share your views with the NHS. The consultation is running until Monday 18 December.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_personal-protective-equipment-for-nhs-staff/content_519.html": "|\nThe consequences of not having adequate personal protective equipment for NHS staff are devastatingBarely a day goes by without pictures online of frontline staff fashioning protection out of clinical waste bags. We need to ensure NHS staff are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients.\nThe challenge that coronavirus poses to our society is unprecedented. It is a scary and worrying time, especially for our NHS. Having worked as a frontline A&E doctor this weekend, in my local hospital, I am increasingly concerned that our health service may buckle under the increased strain that Covid-19 has brought. Our only priority must be to protect lives. Every possible resource we have should be dedicated to that single objective. Crucially, our NHS and healthcare workers on the frontlines must be given whatever resources they need to tackle this and to save lives. It’s disheartening then, that basic resources are in short supply. Full personal protective equipment (PPE) is vital to not only protect frontline staff, but also to limit the spread of infection to our loved ones and to our patients. The Government have known this crisis was coming for weeks, and yet they still have not been fully prepared for it. A country like the UK should not be having to ask manufacturing companies to switch production to provide emergency ventilators, or for NHS workers to have to go without PPE. The first part of my shift this weekend was spent looking for the correct masks and aprons - this is happening to frontline workers ahead of every shift, across the country. While we would all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. The consequences of this for NHS staff are devastating. There’s a feeling amongst many frontline staff that protective equipment is already being rationed. A few weeks ago, the guidance for healthcare staff treating people with confirmed cases of Covid-19 was to wear a full FFP3 mask as well as gloves and a full apron - now, that guidance has changed and we are told to only wear gloves and a basic surgical mask. Barely a day goes by without pictures online of frontline staff fashioning protection out of clinical waste bags. We need full transparency on decisions and changes to guidance, otherwise concerns will only grow. As this virus spreads, and as more and more people are forced into hospital, NHS workers are going to have to start making very difficult choices because of the limited resources they have available. They are going to have to start deciding who can access the most urgent care, including who is given priority for the last available ventilator - they’ll be making impossible choices about whose lives can be saved. We have already seen this happening in Italy, and it is an unimaginable tragedy for medics who are dedicated to saving lives above all else. The best way to help frontline staff who go to work to save lives, is for everyone else to stay home. We will get through this, together. The Government must take responsibility for providing all the resources and equipment the NHS needs, including vital PPE, for communicating the message on social distancing clearly to the public, and for enforcing it robustly. I welcome the new, more stringent measures announced yesterday – however, as Mike Ashley has shown, there’s still room for people to exploit it. As a country, we must do what will save the most lives. That’s true of the Government, people across the country, and medics on the frontline. The faster we get on top of this disease, the faster our society will be able to tackle this virus, and fewer lives will be lost. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can and we will save lives. Comments are closed.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_labour-must-ditch-ideological-purity/content_152.html": "|\nShadow minister launches deputy leadership bid with a unifying pitch\nLabour must move past the factionalism and “ideological purity” that has alienated voters across the country, the shadow minister Rosena Allin-Khan has said as she set out her pitch to become the party’s deputy leader. The A&E doctor who has served on Jeremy Corbyn’s frontbench is the latest party figure to officially throw their hat in the ring for the deputy leadership, alongside the shadow cabinet members Angela Rayner and Richard Burgon. Allin-Khan, 43, said that for too long the party had been weighted down by infighting and described her politics as being inspired by public service, which she said was not based within soft- or hard-left identities. “I’ve got the campaigning experience but also the life experience to help rebuild the party again,” said Allin-Khan, who has been a shadow minister for sport since 2016 and still works hospital shifts. “We need to move beyond the last few years where nasty internal debates about faction and ideological purity have too often alienated people outside our movement. “Public service isn’t about identifying who sits on which side of the Labour party. I am Labour because of my values, my life experiences and the fact that I’m a doctor. We must communicate how we are going to change people’s lives in a way they can understand.” Her pitch as a unifying figure across Labour’s political spectrum would involve trying to make inroads in Scotland and Wales and other heartland areas that went Conservative, by holding town hall events, as well as meetings in synagogues, churches, mosques and temples. She said to rebuild the party’s base Labour must listen far more to councillors, who she says are the experts in their communities. The Tooting MP, who has a Pakistani father and Polish mother, dismissed concerns that Labour must have a leadership team that is drawn from northern constituencies. “I grew up poor with a single mum working three jobs to support me and my brother. That taught me the reality of day to day life for people across this country,” she said. “There’s no regional distinction to hunger. Loss of hope lives across the UK. London is used to mean ‘metropolitan elite’ but we also have some of the highest levels of deprivation. “Growing up in poverty. Understanding what it was like to get a job really young to supplement household income, to being careful in supermarkets with food, to feel there was no hope for someone from your background – that experience gives me a fire in my stomach to fight for all people around the country that have to go through that.” The mother of two studied medicine at Cambridge through Labour-initiated scholarships after initially failing her A-levels during a period of difficult family circumstances. After qualifying as a doctor she has worked as an A&E specialist in London hospitals and as a humanitarian aid doctor in the Middle East, Africa and Asia for a decade. She won the Tooting seat in a 2016 by-election after Sadiq Khan quit to run as mayor of London. In parliament she has highlighted the difficulty Palestinian children in Gaza have in accessing healthcare in Israeli hospitals because their parents are not allowed to accompany them through a restrictive permit system. As part of her sports brief she has fought for the return of safe standing at football clubs, as well as being an advocate for the women’s game both in parliament and as a player herself. She was also a vociferous campaigner for the People’s Vote campaign on a second referendum but said she accepted the country was leaving the EU, even though she had fought so hard against it because she did not believe the deal would work for her constituents. As for rejoining the bloc, she said that would have to be looked at if it should ever come up but was not a priority. Despite Corbyn being rejected at the election, she pointed out positive changes he made for the party, including a more welcoming immigration policy, and said she was proud of his strong anti-austerity message and the party’s continued support for the NHS. But on the defeat, she said: “We threw everything out there and nothing had time to land effectively. In comparison the Tories used three words and a few repeated soundbites which ultimately proved effective.” She said she would be happy to work with any leadership candidate should they be elected.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_local_14/content_703.html": "|\nRites for Girls is a local group which aims aims to prepare girls for that all-important transition from primary to secondary school, focusing on their wellbeing and self-esteem. Girls in Year 6 and 7 are being offered the opportunity to participate in monthly sessions over the course of the year, in which they will be taught about puberty, and learn strategies to take charge of their emotional, social, and physical wellbeing. As we look to the end of Government lockdown measures, during which time many girls have reported feeling disconnected from family and friends, the support Rites for Girls offers girls is more important than ever. Sessions will be held at the Woodfield Pavilion, Tooting Bec Common. For more information see here, or to book a place for your daughter contact [email protected]. As the backdrop for the BAFTA winning series 24 Hours in A&E, St Georges is now opening their doors to the Fetal Medicine Unit in Channel 4’s new series ‘Baby Surgeons: Delivering Miracles’. The documentary follows obstetrician Professor Basky Thilaganathan and his team as they work to save the lives of unborn babies with complex medical conditions. In one moving episode, Professor Thilaganathan was seen helping parents Becky and Richard, who were told that their baby had no chance of surviving. At Becky’s nineteen week scan, baby Annie was showing signs of congenital heart failure due to pressures from a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung. In simpler terms, this meant that Annie had a tumour on her lung the size of a malteaser. Owing to developments in medicine, Professor Thilaganathan was able to complete a non-invasive operation immediately on Becky and Annie by placing a tube near the mass, and feeding a laser through it, to zap and kill a rogue blood vessel. Remarkably, despite the parents being told that Annie’s heart could stop at any time, the procedure was successful and Becky gave birth to Annie several months later, with no signs of the surgery she had undergone before she was born. This is, yet again, proof of what amazing talent and humanity we have here in Tooting. It was a pleasure to get out on the doorstep with our Greater London Authority candidate for South London, Candice Atterton, today! Alongside Candice and Ruth Cadbury MP for Brentford and Isleworth, it was a privilege to visit Hounslow Youth Counselling Service. The post-pandemic recovery must have young people at its heart, so it was fantastic to spend the morning hearing about the great work taking place in Hounslow to support and champion young people’s mental health. With her background in youth work and youth justice, Candice is determined to focus on support and opportunities for young people. I have no doubt that she will be a great addition to Mayor Sadiq Khan’s Labour Team in City Hall! The Bike Project - a wonderful local charity which supplies refugees with old, unloved, and abandoned bicycles – is looking for someone to provide a new Tooting drop-off point. A drop-off point is a place where local residents can leave their unwanted bikes to be collected by the charity, who repairs them before they are donated to refugees and asylum seekers. With just £37.75 a week to live on, these bikes can make an enormous difference to the lives of refugees. If you are able to volunteer a space to act as a new drop-off point in our area, or to arrange a time to donate a bike, email Julia from The Bike Project at [email protected]. We have been blessed with wonderful sunshine throughout this week, which has undoubtedly brought out the best of our surroundings here in Tooting. Working in St George’s Hospital, I know what a real difference the green spaces in the grounds make to patients, visitors and staff alike. I would therefore like to express my sincere thanks to the hospital gardening team, in particular their Head of Gardening, John Greco, who have put their all into this wonderful display of spring blooms for us all to enjoy. The bright array of tulips and blossom trees will no doubt be a great comfort to what is an often anxious time for patients and visitors to the hospital. Thank you team! Several cases of the South African variant of Covid-19 has been found in Wandsworth, and the Council is encouraging everyone over the age of 11 who lives, works in, or travels through Wandsworth to book a PCR test – including those of us who have had the vaccine, even if you are not showing any symptoms.\nPCR testing sites have opened across Wandsworth, including one at Tooting Leisure Centre by appointment only. Tests can also be ordered online, or collected without an appointment at Wandsworth Town Hall. Tests are also available on a strictly appointment-only basis at many local pharmacies. It is necessary to book a PCR test because although the widely available rapid lateral flow test can determine positivity for Covid-19, only the PCR test is able to detect specific variants. It is important that we are all tested because one-in-three people who have Covid-19 are asymptomatic, and could be spreading the virus without knowing it. Let’s all do our part to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 variant. Click here to order a home testing kit, or to book an appointment at a testing centre or local pharmacy. Following on from the BBC’s successful documentary in March last year, ‘Stacey Dooley: On The Psych Ward’, Stacey Dooley returned to Springfield in a moving programme aired on Tuesday (13th April 2021). Stacey Dooley: Back On The Psych Ward follows the dedicated mental health professionals working on the frontline at Springfield, as well as a number of brave patients who came forward to share their experiences of life at Springfield during lockdown. I am always exceptionally proud of everyone working in mental health across the country. As both the Shadow Minister for Mental Health and Member of Parliament for Tooting, I remain committed to ensuring that local mental health services receive the funding they deserve. Today Muslims across the UK and around the world mark the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan. As a proud Muslim, the period of reflection, prayer, and fasting is incredibly important to our Muslim community. Traditionally, Ramadan is a time for gathering and sharing Iftar with family and friends. Although, like last year, we are unable to come together and celebrate as we normally would, the spirit of Ramadan remains. To every Muslim nurse and doctor who have saved countless lives throughout this pandemic, to every volunteer and community leader in our Mosques and community centres who continue to support those most vulnerable, and to every Muslim in Tooting and across the country, I wish you all Ramadan Mubarak. With the easing of Government restrictions, The Share Community are seeking volunteer befrienders to help local residents with learning disabilities get back out into the community. Share is a registered charity with a site in Tooting providing support to adults with learning disabilities and/or autism. Their befriending project matches people with similar interests to go for walks, bike rides, or coffee. Befriending is incredibly rewarding, providing companionship to those who are socially isolated and regular contact with a friendly face outside their usual circle. I am told that reliability and being a good listener are the only prerequisites to be a volunteer befriender. If this sounds like you, Share would love to hear from you! Click here to find out more. Here in South West London, over half a million residents have received their first vaccine dose so far! Although this is a pivotal milestone, the percentage of vaccinated persons still remains lower among all ethnic minority groups compared with the White British population. I recognise that many within the BAME community may be unfamiliar with vaccines and feel unsure. However, I can assure you that the vaccines have all been rigorously tested and declared safe by doctors around the world. I continue to urge everyone eligible to book their vaccine appointment as soon as possible. The sooner the vaccine is rolled out, the sooner we can begin to rebuild. Together we can do this. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

I was lucky to be able to experience the absolutely electric atmosphere at Wembley as the Lionesses roared to an inspirational victory which was one of many sensational memories from the tournament, from Russo’s backheel to Toone’s winner, I know so many young girls will be inspired to continue the wonderful legacy left by this team. The Commonwealth Games have also had a more local hero. Eden Cheng won a silver medal in the 10m synchro platform competition along with Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix. Eden is a brilliant example of our community producing talented athletes, and I am sure many will aspire to reach Eden’s success. Congratulations to Eden, and all the medal winners at the Games! Tooting Bec Athletics Track reopened this summer after a successful community campaign against its closure. It was great to be at their official reopening along with local Councillor Judi Gasser.\nIt was great to meet some young athletes and see the wide range of facilities that they offer, including a seven-a-side football pitch, an eight lane track, and a state of the art fitness centre. I am so grateful we have this brilliant resource on our doorstep in Tooting. The fantastic facilities at Tooting Bec Athletics Track will be vital in helping Tooting’s children become the Olympians of tomorrow. I have no doubt that future Team GB medalists are already training here and I look forward to seeing what they all go on to achieve. Yesterday, my friend Rex Osborn was elected to Wandsworth Council for Tooting Broadway with a whopping 62% of the vote!\nRex has been a constant in my political life – he was the Labour leader on the council when I was elected in 2014 and I served as his deputy. Rex was the one who urged me to run for selection as an MP and has been with me every step of the way since. Tooting has gained a fantastic voice on the council, who will prioritise our town centres, ensure a fairer deal for renters and push for increased cost-of-living support. This election took place under tragic circumstances, following the sad passing of Councillor Andy Gibbons, who served this area faithfully for 28 years. However, I could not think of a better person to represent Tooting in the Town Hall in Andy’s stead and I look forward to working closely with Rex to honour Andy’s legacy. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

We began the year with a fantastic win in the Tooting Broadway by-election, increasing the Labour vote share by nearly 7% to a whopping 58% majority. Then came the Mayoral elections in May, when we kept London red by electing my Tooting predecessor Sadiq Khan to a historic third term as Mayor of London. Finally - and most importantly - we finally elected a new Labour Government after 14 long years, with areas up and down the country voting Labour for the very first time. It was humbling to receive the most votes of any Labour MP and thanks must go to everyone who voted for me - your support means the world. £100m to fix Wandsworth PrisonAfter years of campaigning - and countless stories of mismanagement and scandal - the Ministry of Justice announced a £100 million funding package for HMP Wandsworth. This will go a long way to reduce the impact of overcrowding, repair crumbling cell blocks and facilities, and ensure that prison guards can work in a safe environment. Delivering for everyone in TootingThousands of local people have contacted me this year regarding a variety of issues, I have dealt with 15,000 cases. I reclaimed tens of thousands in unpaid pensions or benefits for local people, got decisions on hundreds of delayed passport or visa applications, and helped countless local residents get repairs to their homes. My door is always open and please get in touch if there is anything I can help with. On the NHS frontline\nSpeaking up for Gaza It has now been over a year since the horrific 7th October attacks and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza. The humanitarian disaster we have seen unfold there in the time since, has been truly heartwrenching. This year, I've raised the issue numerous times in Parliament, visited the region in the spring, and held evidence sessions with humanitarian experts. Revitalising Tooting town centre\nThis Morning and Loose Women Using my background as an NHS doctor, I have enjoyed trying my hand at being a TV medic this year! The lovely people at This Morning and Loose Women have had me on many times to talk about a range of topics from mental health to medical emergencies and even gave me space to open up about my own childhood challenges with speech, in a bid to end stigma and help others. Work in Parliament\nKeeping our streets safe in 2024, I successfully campaigned for a tripling of the Tooting neighbourhood policing team, putting more bobbies on our streets. In the summer, Operation Kenny run by the Metropolitan Police resulted in a 70% reduction in crime in Tooting town centre. This work will continue with the new Government's plans to recruit 13,000 new officers and return policing to communities. Cleaning up the local area I have never stopped campaigning for cleaner streets. This year saw a 15% reduction in fly-tipping in Wandsworth, with thousands of fines issued to people dumping their bulky rubbish on our streets. Meanwhile, Wandsworth Labour introduced food recycling for the first time ever in the borough. Free School Meals roll-out\nMental health reform Mental health is incredibly important to me and, for far too long, much-needed reforms were swept under the rug by a Conservative Government that simply wasn't interested. After much hard work, it was fantastic to see reform of the Mental Health Act announced in the King's Speech in July - this was long overdue.\nData from National Rail and the Rail Delivery Group has revealed a shocking rise in the number of late trains at Balham, Earlsfield, Tooting and Wandsworth Common stations. Trains in the morning evening peaks, to and from Central London, have all seen a worsening of their \"on-time percentage\" in the last six months compared to the same period of 2023. The full breakdown of delays at each station is below. It is shocking to see that, not only are trains late at some stations late half the time, but that there has been a steady decline from an already-unacceptable level of lateness last year. Particularly concerning are the figures at Tooting station, where over half of services were late despite there being only two services per hour on that line.\nSome of the worst performing services include: 8:05 from Balham (8:07 from Wandsworth Common) to Victoria - 88% late (Southern) 18:12 from Waterloo to Earlsfield - 81% late (South Western) 8:21 from Balham to Victoria - 79% late (Southern) 8:40 from Balham (8:42 from Wandsworth Common) to Victoria - 76% late (Southern) 8:13 from Tooting to London Blackfriars - 70% late (Thameslink) Local commuters deserve better than the shoddy service they are currently receiving from Southern, South Western and Thameslink. I look forward to the Government's plans to bring our local rail services back into public control, so that our trains are always run with the interests of the people who use them at heart. Following the decision to relocate children's cancer services in South East England away from St George's Hospital, I met with the Health Secretary with a cross-party group of MPs to raise our concerns.\nWhen I visited the Pinckney Ward where this care is conducted, I met with Jackson, a former patient there, and his parents, who told me that such a move would be detrimental for parents, children and the hospital alike. I have urged the Secretary to review and reconsider NHS England's decision as soon as possible. Eight years ago today, I was selected as the Tooting Labour candidate for the by-election caused by Sadiq becoming a candidate for Mayor of London.\nIt has been a huge honour and privilege to serve as the representative for the community in which I was born and raised. My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has supported me on this incredible journey. New data published by the Environment Agency recently revealed that sewage was pumped in our local rivers, the Graveney and Wandle, for over 700 hours last year. This is equivalent to the entire month of February and demonstrates this Tory Government's complete disregard for our natural environment.\nOnly Labour has a plan to clean up our waterways and hold water companies to account by fines for illegal discharges, blocking bonuses for bosses of companies that violate the rules and holding these bosses personally criminally liable for any violations. Yesterday, I was delighted to join CEN for their Healing our Broken Village Black Mental Health Conference at the New Testament Assembly church in Tooting.\nWith continued racial disparities in sectioning and the use of community treatment orders, more must be done to bring about much-needed change. One of the most fulfilling parts of my role as your MP is helping local people solve problems and, in this case, save money.\nA Furzedown pensioner had been denied over £12,000 in backdated pension payments and Pension Credit, however following my intervention with the Department for Work and Pensions, this money was recouped. If you have a problem with your state benefits or pension, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me and I'd be happy to help. I wish everyone in Tooting and beyond a peaceful and blessed Eid. My thoughts and prayers are especially with all those facing hardship and suffering at this time.\nThis morning, I invited residents from Tooting to share a cup of tea and a biscuit at my local coffee morning. As the local MP, I am here to help and my door is always open.\nToday's announcement by NHS England that children's cancer services will be moved away from the world-class unit at St George's Hospital is profoundly disappointing.\nAs a doctor, I am clear that this decision has not been made in the interests of patients or their families and we're losing more than 25 years of expertise in the field of children's cancer care. I'm calling on the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Victoria Atkins to immediately review this decision. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

I went on a humanitarian mission with MedGlobalOrg, who are helping support hospitals to prepare for the darkest days of this conflict. We worked with the most amazing people and met patients with the most heart-breaking stories. I was honoured to be able to help Ukrainian victims in the midst of the heart breaking turmoil they are experiencing. Let’s do all that we can to help support Ukraine.\nThis week, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan announced London will be welcoming 150 families from Afghanistan. To each and every family coming to Tooting - you are so welcome here. Want to help those arriving from Afghanistan? Here is what you can do: Little Village: Urgently in need of warm baby clothes, 9 months - 2 years and 4 - 6 years (specifically pyjamas, snow suits, jumpers and coats). Moses baskets, muslins, small toys and activity packs also needed. Regular collections are being held at Chancery Mews, SW17 7TD and Chillerton Road, SW17 9BE. Please do check their Facebook page for more information. Tooting Community Kitchen: Urgently in need of jogging bottoms and jeans in sizes 26-34 waist, jumpers, t-shirts, coats and trainers in sizes 38-45. Donations can be dropped off Friday 9-1pm and Saturday 3-5pm at Price Close (entrance at 104 Upper Tooting Road). I was also pleased to write to the Leader of Wandsworth Council alongside my colleagues, Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney, and Marshsa De Cordova, MP for Battersea, to call on Wandsworth Council to welcome in refugees from Afghanistan and provide them with a safe place to live. The situation which has unfolded in Afghanistan is shocking and terribly regrettable. It is simply not good enough for world leaders to say the speed of the Taliban advance took them by surprise, when many have been warning of this for months. There has either been a monumental failing of our intelligence services or an unacceptable lack of transparency. Either way the Government has reacted too late. In 2010, I worked (pictured) as a Humanitarian Aid Doctor in the North West Frontier Province, on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan, following the flood crisis. I met many people who had suffered unimaginable pain at the hands of the Taliban. I am continuing to receive a high volume of emails from local residents concerned about loved ones in Afghanistan. Myself and my team are working to respond as quickly as possible. If you are worried about someone, please do not hesitate to get in touch by emailing their details to [email protected]. Please include the following information so I can take action quickly:\nWe must not allow history to repeat itself. Careless leadership from the Prime Minister enabled this tragedy to happen on his watch, while he had taken his eye off the ball. The world must not turn its back on the Afghan people. Following the recall of Parliament on Wednesday, I remain in close contact with my colleagues in the Shadow Foreign Team and will continue to be on hand to support local residents through this. Former Labour MEP SEB DANCE explains why he is supporting Rosena Allin-Khan in the Labour deputy leadership race.\nBritain has left the EU. As a former Labour Member of the European Parliament, as a Remainer, and as a proud pro-European, that’s still not an easy thing for me to say – but it’s the reality. There is no longer a campaign to remain. That doesn’t mean that Boris Johnson’s famous lie of “get Brexit done” has suddenly come true. The ongoing negotiations with the EU will continue to define our country’s future for years to come. Perhaps one day the fight to join the EU will come. How soon that time comes depends on what we do next. Pro-Europeans must now fight for a close relationship between the UK and our friends in the EU and ongoing rights for UK citizens. The Labour Party must play a crucial role in that fight. That’s why I’m supporting Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan to become the next deputy leader of Labour. Rosena was elected as the MP for Tooting the week before the EU referendum in 2016. Despite holding a shadow frontbench position, she refused to compromise on her principles or on the promises she’d made to her community, so she broke the whip and voted against triggering Article 50. Considering the shambles that followed Theresa May’s early triggering of Article 50, this has been conclusively demonstrated as the right decision. Rosena was also the first shadow frontbench minister to come out publicly and call for a People’s Vote. This was an incredibly brave thing to do, at a time when Labour MPs and shadow ministers were being pressured not to speak out against the leadership’s position on Brexit. At a time when the leadership of Labour needed a firm push in the right direction, Rosena was the one brave enough to stand up and do it. There are some voices in the Labour Party, who’ll try to convince you that Brexit was the only reason for Labour’s failure at the last general election – that backing a public vote cost us seats in the so-called ‘Red Wall’. But this analysis is deeply misleading, and is simply not supported by the facts. Yes, of course Brexit was a divisive issue, for Labour as much as for anyone else. The reality however, is that the overwhelming majority of Labour voters, members and supporters voted Remain, wanted us to stay in the EU and wanted a public vote on Brexit. That fact is as true of Labour voters in Redcar, Grimsby or Wakefield as it is of Labour voters in Oxford, Islington or Bristol – Labour’s share of the vote went down in 98% of all seats. Labour’s position on Brexit was fatally undermined not because supporting a public vote was the wrong position for our voters, but because the leadership of the party took so long to get to that position. We sat in the middle of the road on the biggest issue of our time and neither side trusted us. We lost trust among all our communities. Rosena knows this – she won’t stop standing up for our internationalist values. I joined the Labour Party because I believe in internationalism and solidarity across borders. So does Rosena. That’s why she’s worked across the world in conflict and disaster zones as a humanitarian doctor, and why she still does shifts in her local hospital as an A&E doctor alongside her work as an MP. So if you are like me – a proud pro-European, an internationalist and a Labour supporter – and if you want someone as deputy leader who’ll stand up for those values, and who’ll fight for our country to maintain the closest possible relationship with the EU, protecting our workers’ rights, our environmental protections, our food standards, our NHS, and most importantly the rights of EU citizens living in the UK – then vote for Doctor Rosena. Together, let’s take Labour forward. Rosena Allin-Khan kicks off Labour deputy leader campaign in Putney with ‘fire in her belly’\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan launched her deputy Labour leadership campaign in Putney last night. The campaign, held in the ballroom of the Star & Garter pub, brought together an eclectic crowd, including some young first-time voters. Tooting MP Dr Allin-Khan, who is running with the slogan ‘Taking Labour Forward’, is a qualified A&E front-line doctor and has provided humanitarian aid to refugees in Syria. Describing her determination to be the next deputy leader, she said: “Expertise in building trust in communities and shared life experience has put fire in my belly to achieve for others.” She set out her ‘internationalist’ vision of Britain’s future after Brexit and brought attention to the importance of social care reform, the significance of a grassroots revival and updating technology within the Labour Party. Labour’s Putney MP Fleur Anderson said that Dr Allin-Khan would be a ‘campaigner-in-chief’ and not a ‘leader-in-waiting’ if elected as deputy leader in a PoliticsHome article last week. The Musician’s Union has given their endorsement to Dr Allin-Khan and to Sir Keir Starmer for leader. Voting takes place from February 24 to April 2 and results will be announced on the April 4. Labour needs to become a party of progressive internationalism once againLast Tuesday, a boat capsized and sank in the Bay of Bengal. There were 138 Rohingya refugees crammed on the boat, fleeing from camps in Bangladesh. At least 15 bodies were found, including four children, with 50 more missing.\nI’ve been campaigning for the rights of the Rohingya since the recent crisis unfolded in 2017. I’ve been involved in humanitarian matters long before entering politics and standing to be Labour deputy leader. Stories such as those of the Rohingya do not often have a light shined upon them here in the UK. They happen far away and it feels as if they’re outside of our control. The UK has a proud history of humanitarian assistance and we must ensure that this continues. We must never allow ourselves to turn a blind eye. Every single human life has equal value, no matter where that person was born, what language they speak or what they look like. Humanity has no borders. This isn’t just something I believe in principle — I act on it. My work as a humanitarian doctor has taken me to the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, where grieving mothers told me accounts of their babies being ripped from their arms and murdered before their eyes. The guilt of coming home to my own three- and five-year-olds left me unable to sleep at night. Why should their lives be of more value to the world than those of the Rohingya children who are slaughtered without a dignified burial? I have seen how human life is not valued equally around the world. It lit a fire in my belly to continue fighting such injustice, no matter where it takes place. At the very heart of my Labour principles is internationalism. I believe this spirit of internationalism must drive everything we do as a party. We must always stand in unwavering opposition to any effort to restrict freedoms, whether here or globally. We’ve seen where this mentality leads — whether it is the tragedy of Windrush, the cruelty of detention centres like Yarl’s Wood, or the inhumanity of a government that votes against protection for vulnerable child refugees. Now is the time for all of us who believe in progressive, internationalist values to fight back. It is our duty to ensure that the Rohingya and other victims are not forgotten by the world. One of the reasons I decided to stand to become the next deputy leader of Labour is because I believe our party has a unique chance to become a global beacon of internationalism, as it has been before. We have arguably the largest grassroots membership of any political party in Europe. If we are able to unite behind a truly internationalist vision for our party and our country, we could be a force for change on a global scale. We have a wonderful society, which has welcomed so many people from across the world, but this government’s hostile environment is diminishing hope — hope for a brighter future, hope for a tolerant society. I first entered politics in order to shed light on humanitarian efforts around the world and give a voice to the voiceless. I still believe we can, and I want to help rebuild the Labour Party so that it becomes a powerful force for good. As a party we need to rebuild trust with our communities, with the British people and the international community. Let’s do this together. Rosena Allin-Khan is Labour MP for Tooting and candidate for the deputy leadership Brexit Might Be Done But The Fight Against Boris Johnson's Destruction Must ContinueAlthough the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback.\nWhen the UK leaves the EU this Friday, 31 January 2020, after 47 years of membership, it will be a sombre day for many of us. For others, it will be a day of celebration. For most people, I suspect they will simply hope we can now move on from talking about Brexit at the expense of everything else. As someone who campaigned with all my heart to stay in the EU, and as the first person on Labour’s front bench to publicly call for a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal, I am desperately sad to see us leaving our friends and allies in Europe. But we are leaving. The disastrous result of the General Election has settled that. This is no longer an argument about Leave or Remain, it’s about what kind of future we want for our country and for our children. That’s where the new fight begins. Boris Johnson wants to pretend he’s now “Got Brexit Done”, and we no longer need to worry about the details. He wants us to simply trust him to sort it all out. Well, I don’t trust him. Neither should you. He talks about “Global Britain” whilst turning his back on vulnerable child refugees. He talks about “Taking Back Control” while reducing parliament’s ability to scrutinise his decisions. He talks about attracting “Global Talent” to the UK while creating huge distress and uncertainty for EU citizens, many of whom have been here for years and who have made their lives in this country. The fight for our internationalist values starts now. It will be long, and it will be difficult, because Boris Johnson has a large majority – but that’s why it’s so important. When it feels like hope is lost, that’s when those of us who believe in progressive values and internationalism need to stand up and fight. If we don’t, no-one else is going to do it for us. We need to stand up and fight for our hard-won workers’ rights. We need to stand up and fight for our environmental protections. Most importantly, we need to stand up and fight for the rights of EU citizens living in this country. They are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues, our family. I work side-by-side with many of them in the NHS, when I work shifts as a doctor in my local A&E department. Under the draconian new immigration laws being bandied around by this government, my own Polish mother might not have been able to move to this country and make a life for herself. Although the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback. That’s one of the main reasons I am running to become the next Deputy Leader. We have huge organisational strength through our membership, through our links with the trade unions and through our MPs and councillors embedded in their local communities. Now is the time to deploy those strengths to maximum effect, to hold the Government to account and ensure that we fight back against every attempt to undercut our rights and freedoms at work, every attempt to weaken our environmental safeguards, every attempt to inject privatisation into our National Health Service. The slogan “Get Brexit Done” might have helped win the election for Boris Johnson, but for those of us who stand against his destructive vision for the future of our country, this fight isn’t done. It’s just getting started. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_previous_36/content_736.html": "|\nI have received lots of correspondence from local residents regarding the changes that have been made to our roads as part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood and the Streetspace schemes on the A24 (Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road). As part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood schemes, many streets have had filters put in to close the road to all vehicles except cycles and some now have turning restrictions. As part of the Streetspace scheme, a number of changes have been made to Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road including the installation of wands to segregate cycle lanes, a number of turning restrictions as well as changes to bus stops.\nThese changes have come about as a result of statutory guidance that the Government issued in May, stating that local authorities were expected to make significant changes to their road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians “as swiftly as possible”. (If you would like to read more about this statutory guidance you can read it in full here.) As a result, TfL made £55m of funding available to the 33 councils in London as part of its “Streetspace for London” programme to urgently create new segregated cycle lanes, extend pavements and close roads to traffic. Wandsworth Council was given £1,923,500 by TfL and used this money to implement the LTNs. TfL has, in consultation with Wandsworth Council but acting separately, implemented changes to the A24. I am supportive of initiatives which reduce car usage, make our streets safer, encourage cycling and create a better local environment. But we must make it work for everyone in Tooting and Balham. I know that lots of local residents have concerns and comments about how the changes have affected our community. The only way to have your voice heard is to feed into the consultations that Wandsworth Council is running and to let TfL know what you think by emailing them. To respond to Wandsworth Council's consultation, click here. To provide feedback to TfL please email: [email protected] It is important to note that I was not consulted prior to the implementation of these changes to our roads and I have no control over the decisions that have been made. As the local MP, I can lobby the Government and the relevant Ministers, but I cannot make decisions for the Conservative Council. I am listening and engaging with local residents on this but I cannot make alterations to these changes. If you have already provided your feedback to Wandsworth Council's consultation and/or emailed TfL, and you want to raise your concerns with other officials, you may also wish to contact Wandsworth Council's Transport spokesperson Councillor John Locker via email at [email protected], or the Government's Minister of State with responsibility for cycling and walking Chris Heaton-Harris MP via email at [email protected] Even before the pandemic hit, the case for investing in this kind of support was clear. Coronavirus has exacerbated the existing crisis in mental health. Many NHS and social care staff have been scared of going to work, and they have lost patients and colleagues. It has been heartbreaking to witness the toll this virus has taken on staff mental health. Current support is not good enough, and without a tailored, fast-tracked service for staff who have faced death and despair every day for over three months, our frontline heroes will continue to be failed. We need to care for our carers. It is time for the Government to give back to those who have sacrificed so much to keep our loved ones safe. Unless our staff are protected, they cannot continue their vital work of keeping us all safe. The consequences of not having adequate personal protective equipment for NHS staff are devastatingBarely a day goes by without pictures online of frontline staff fashioning protection out of clinical waste bags. We need to ensure NHS staff are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients.\nThe challenge that coronavirus poses to our society is unprecedented. It is a scary and worrying time, especially for our NHS. Having worked as a frontline A&E doctor this weekend, in my local hospital, I am increasingly concerned that our health service may buckle under the increased strain that Covid-19 has brought. Our only priority must be to protect lives. Every possible resource we have should be dedicated to that single objective. Crucially, our NHS and healthcare workers on the frontlines must be given whatever resources they need to tackle this and to save lives. It’s disheartening then, that basic resources are in short supply. Full personal protective equipment (PPE) is vital to not only protect frontline staff, but also to limit the spread of infection to our loved ones and to our patients. The Government have known this crisis was coming for weeks, and yet they still have not been fully prepared for it. A country like the UK should not be having to ask manufacturing companies to switch production to provide emergency ventilators, or for NHS workers to have to go without PPE. The first part of my shift this weekend was spent looking for the correct masks and aprons - this is happening to frontline workers ahead of every shift, across the country. While we would all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. The consequences of this for NHS staff are devastating. There’s a feeling amongst many frontline staff that protective equipment is already being rationed. A few weeks ago, the guidance for healthcare staff treating people with confirmed cases of Covid-19 was to wear a full FFP3 mask as well as gloves and a full apron - now, that guidance has changed and we are told to only wear gloves and a basic surgical mask. Barely a day goes by without pictures online of frontline staff fashioning protection out of clinical waste bags. We need full transparency on decisions and changes to guidance, otherwise concerns will only grow. As this virus spreads, and as more and more people are forced into hospital, NHS workers are going to have to start making very difficult choices because of the limited resources they have available. They are going to have to start deciding who can access the most urgent care, including who is given priority for the last available ventilator - they’ll be making impossible choices about whose lives can be saved. We have already seen this happening in Italy, and it is an unimaginable tragedy for medics who are dedicated to saving lives above all else. The best way to help frontline staff who go to work to save lives, is for everyone else to stay home. We will get through this, together. The Government must take responsibility for providing all the resources and equipment the NHS needs, including vital PPE, for communicating the message on social distancing clearly to the public, and for enforcing it robustly. I welcome the new, more stringent measures announced yesterday – however, as Mike Ashley has shown, there’s still room for people to exploit it. As a country, we must do what will save the most lives. That’s true of the Government, people across the country, and medics on the frontline. The faster we get on top of this disease, the faster our society will be able to tackle this virus, and fewer lives will be lost. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can and we will save lives. Sports Direct has shown exactly what not to do during this pandemic. If we’re to beat coronavirus, we have to be selflessThere seems to be a view amongst some under-70s, that coronavirus doesn’t really affect them and they don’t need to worry too much about it. I’ve listened to 69-year-olds tell me that because they themselves are fit and healthy, that it couldn’t possibly happen to them. Having just done a shift as a doctor in A&E over the weekend, I want to take this opportunity to warn people that this virus does not discriminate by age.\nIt was deeply, deeply eye-opening. Previously healthy people in their thirties and forties were seriously ill, some of them on ventilators. Being young does not grant you immunity to this disease. The symptoms of Covid-19 at its worst, are horrific. There can be no room for complacency. Our health service is facing an unprecedented crisis. There is a limited amount of vital equipment, including personal protective equipment for healthcare workers and precious ventilators. Every extra person in hospital requiring treatment means there are fewer resources available for others. London Covid-19 doctor says soon staff will be forced to choose whose life to saveRosena Allin-Khan, a Labour MP and A&E doctor, reveals ‘heart-wrenching’ decisions facing hospital workers\nRosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting and an A&E doctor, is still working regular shifts. On Sunday she worked at St George’s hospital in her south London constituency. She explains how the coronavirus pandemic has affected staff: I’ve been an A&E doctor for 15 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this before. The departments are quieter because people are staying away from hospital, but the patients are sicker. We’re seeing a distinct rise in the numbers coming in with respiratory symptoms, who are testing Covid-19 positive. On Sunday, very early in the morning, the entire resuscitation department, where the absolute sickest patients go, was full to capacity with patients with breathing difficulties. We had to move other very ill patients to the paediatric resuscitation area to keep them safe. This is only set to get worse. We’re seeing patients now who would have only contracted the virus two weeks ago. In the coming 10 days we expect the entire A&E department will be taken up with suspected Covid-19 patients. Doctors and nurses are brave, and the A&E department is known for being on the frontline and high risk, but there’s a palpable fear among staff for three reasons. Firstly, they’re frightened for their own health and those of the people they love. When I finished my shift yesterday, which was Mother’s Day, I came back to the house and I couldn’t touch or hug my two little girls until I put all my clothes in the wash and had a shower. The second reason is that staff expect, very soon, potentially to have to make heart-wrenching choices about whose life can be saved if we don’t have enough ventilators. That goes counter to everything you’ve ever learned as a doctor or nurse – to make life-and-death decisions, where we could possibly have saved every one of those people, is unimaginable. This is what our colleagues in Italy are living through now. Third, the patterns described thus far for symptoms of coronavirus are not what we’re now seeing in the emergency department. We’re seeing young, previously very healthy people, who are ill in hospital. Some are in their 30s, and they need ventilators to stay alive. Some patients are presenting with abdominal pain, which we hadn’t heard of before. A person can come in and say they have a stomach pain, and they’re put in the “green” area of the department – but then they mention they also have a cough. Everybody should be assumed to be Covid-positive until proven otherwise at this point. There’s also a real concern among staff around the country about personal protective equipment. They either don’t have any, or if they do many feel it’s being rationed. It’s very hard to listen to some colleagues say that as a result of there not being enough equipment to go round, they’re resigned to catching the virus – it’s just a matter of when. On social distancing, the messaging from the government hasn’t been clear enough. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has banned public gatherings of more than two people. It’s clear and easy to understand. There has to be no ambiguity in the language because people’s lives depend on it. Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives. The MP for Tooting has been working in her local hospital where doctors and nurses are already dealing with cases of covid-19. She warns that many of those being treated are in their 30s and 40s.\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan is the MP for Tooting but she is also a practising doctor in A&E. She regularly goes in to do shifts in her local hospital St George's and has been in contact with her colleagues. This Sunday she took a record down for Mirror readers about the situation faced by nurses, doctors and others on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus. She said her latest shift had been a \"deeply, deeply eye-opening\" experience with previously fit and healthy people in their 30s and 40s \"attached to machines, fighting for their lives\". And she has been deeply critical of the approach taken by the government in tackling the spread of the deadly virus. \"The Prime Minister has been blase about this from the start, waiting for others to make decisions so he doesn't have to. It is costing lives,\" she said. Mirror Diary - Sunday 22 March6.30am – Leaving the HouseOn the way to work in A&E, to help out the real heroes of the frontline – the NHS staff who work day-in, day-out to keep us all safe. I am a bit apprehensive after seeing the stories that are being reported about Covid-19 and having spoken to colleagues across the country, but we need to come together at times like these for our communities. 7am – Reporting for DutyJust finished handover, which is when the day shift gets given notes on the patients who have come in overnight. There’s a very real sense that the number of cases are growing extremely quickly, something that will present a real challenge in the coming days and weeks. Some of the sickest patients that have been admitted have been young – they’re in their 30s and 40s, previously fit and well, but now fighting for their lives in Intensive Care (ICU). There was a lot of talk in January that this was a virus just like the flu that only affects older people – that simply isn’t the case. There’s a real sense of apprehension ahead of the shift – we’re all expecting a rocky road ahead in the coming days. 8am- Protective EquipmentThe first part of the shift was spent looking for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – these are masks and aprons that keep those working on the frontlines safe. While we’d all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. Frontline staff across the country are scared. We’re scared that we’re going to lose patients – we have spent years training to save every life that we can. We are scared of passing this deadly virus onto our loved ones because we don’t always have the PPE that we so desperately need. We’re scared that that if we aren’t properly protected, that we run the risk of spreading the virus between patients. It’s vital that people practice social distancing measures properly – crowded areas will only add to the number of cases, and the number of people being admitted into hospitals across the country. In the coming days and weeks, difficult decisions will be made by my colleagues in ICU about who gets a ventilator – it’s that serious. Midday – Resus overwhelmedThe whole of resus is full of patients with respiratory problems – this is the part of A&E where the sickest patients go. Patients are arriving breathless, with crackles so fine in their lungs, you can hardly hear them. Their X-rays show white lungs where normally, they would look clear and black, full of air. Major trauma, such as heart attacks and victims of car crashes, are now being moved into paediatric A&E. The situation around Covid-19 is clearly getting worse by the day. The talk amongst the team is that we feel that we will be overwhelmed in the coming days. I’m going for a refresher course on ventilators for staff – they’re also training new staff on how to use ventilators. The talk is, of course, feeling quite bleak as the day goes on – but this is what we’ve all been trained for. 4pm – Leaving A&EJust leaving A&E now – it’s been a difficult shift and a difficult Mother’s Day. At times like these, we must think about our loved ones - if we want to protect those dearest to us, we must stay indoors. I’ve just called my husband and asked him to let our daughters know that they won’t be able to cuddle me and give me their handmade presents when I get home. Instead, I’ll be getting straight in the shower and throwing my clothes in the washing machine – it is our duty to protect the ones we love. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can, and we will, save lives. Former Labour MEP SEB DANCE explains why he is supporting Rosena Allin-Khan in the Labour deputy leadership race.\nBritain has left the EU. As a former Labour Member of the European Parliament, as a Remainer, and as a proud pro-European, that’s still not an easy thing for me to say – but it’s the reality. There is no longer a campaign to remain. That doesn’t mean that Boris Johnson’s famous lie of “get Brexit done” has suddenly come true. The ongoing negotiations with the EU will continue to define our country’s future for years to come. Perhaps one day the fight to join the EU will come. How soon that time comes depends on what we do next. Pro-Europeans must now fight for a close relationship between the UK and our friends in the EU and ongoing rights for UK citizens. The Labour Party must play a crucial role in that fight. That’s why I’m supporting Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan to become the next deputy leader of Labour. Rosena was elected as the MP for Tooting the week before the EU referendum in 2016. Despite holding a shadow frontbench position, she refused to compromise on her principles or on the promises she’d made to her community, so she broke the whip and voted against triggering Article 50. Considering the shambles that followed Theresa May’s early triggering of Article 50, this has been conclusively demonstrated as the right decision. Rosena was also the first shadow frontbench minister to come out publicly and call for a People’s Vote. This was an incredibly brave thing to do, at a time when Labour MPs and shadow ministers were being pressured not to speak out against the leadership’s position on Brexit. At a time when the leadership of Labour needed a firm push in the right direction, Rosena was the one brave enough to stand up and do it. There are some voices in the Labour Party, who’ll try to convince you that Brexit was the only reason for Labour’s failure at the last general election – that backing a public vote cost us seats in the so-called ‘Red Wall’. But this analysis is deeply misleading, and is simply not supported by the facts. Yes, of course Brexit was a divisive issue, for Labour as much as for anyone else. The reality however, is that the overwhelming majority of Labour voters, members and supporters voted Remain, wanted us to stay in the EU and wanted a public vote on Brexit. That fact is as true of Labour voters in Redcar, Grimsby or Wakefield as it is of Labour voters in Oxford, Islington or Bristol – Labour’s share of the vote went down in 98% of all seats. Labour’s position on Brexit was fatally undermined not because supporting a public vote was the wrong position for our voters, but because the leadership of the party took so long to get to that position. We sat in the middle of the road on the biggest issue of our time and neither side trusted us. We lost trust among all our communities. Rosena knows this – she won’t stop standing up for our internationalist values. I joined the Labour Party because I believe in internationalism and solidarity across borders. So does Rosena. That’s why she’s worked across the world in conflict and disaster zones as a humanitarian doctor, and why she still does shifts in her local hospital as an A&E doctor alongside her work as an MP. So if you are like me – a proud pro-European, an internationalist and a Labour supporter – and if you want someone as deputy leader who’ll stand up for those values, and who’ll fight for our country to maintain the closest possible relationship with the EU, protecting our workers’ rights, our environmental protections, our food standards, our NHS, and most importantly the rights of EU citizens living in the UK – then vote for Doctor Rosena. Together, let’s take Labour forward. Rosena Allin-Khan MP: \"I want to inspire Asians to own their identity”A CANDIDATE in the race for Labour’s deputy leadership has admitted the party “lost trust with voters” following its crushing defeat in the December general election.\nTooting MP Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is up against fellow MPs Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler, Ian Murray and Angela Rayner in the race, triggered by Labour’s huge loss last year. Suffering one of its worst results since 1935, Labour lost dozens of seats which they had held for decades, including a number of constituencies in the Midlands and northern England, which historically tended to support the party. The loss was down to a lack of trust, Allin- Khan believes. “People, quite frankly, didn’t trust us to govern,” the MP told Eastern Eye. “We had a manifesto which I believe was full of good things, but voters didn’t trust us to deliver it.” The party’s stance on Brexit was an additional factor – “we didn’t seem decisive enough” – and the level of anti-Semitism in the party and the way it was subsequently handled “closed a lot of doors”. “I’ve been up and down the country talking to individuals, wondering why Labour lost, and I’ve been told by activists that people didn’t think we had our own house in order,” she said. Today, she said, the most common concern of voters is the NHS, the level of safety on the streets and housing. “We need to show that the hopes and dreams that people have for themselves are the ones that we (Labour) have for them,” the mother-of-two said. Next month’s contest will also see the unveiling of a new Labour leader, after Jeremy Corbyn announced he would be stepping down following the general election last year. Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey are in the running to lead the opposition party. Allin-Khan, however, will not be voicing her support for any of the candidates as she believes the party needs to “heal all divisions (and) unite” after it fared so badly in the election. “When I’m working in A&E and I see kids coming in with lung infections because of mouldy housing or I see kids who have to go to food banks (…) they don’t care if Labour is left, right or centre,” she explained. “So, the most important thing to move forward is to unite and I can show that by not nominating someone for leader.” On her role in the deputy leadership race, Allin-Khan said she was determined to use it as an opportunity to help “ethnic minorities own their identity and be proud of it”. “That is what I want people to feel I embody when they look at me,” she explained. “For me, being in this race, if that is the one thing I get out of this…that other young British Asians can look at me and say, ‘if she can do it, I can do it too’, then that is my job done.” Allin-Khan admitted she had faced prejudice due to her mixed Pakistani-Polish heritage and has received criticism that she “isn’t fully Asian”. In response to the comments, the MP is keen to highlight her mixed heritage does not make her Asian background any less “important, valuable or special.” “I identify with being an Asian woman, in the same way that I am proud to be Polish,” she said. “Some people in the Asian community wonder how Asian I feel because I’m mixed race, but I’m proud to wear my sari and embrace my heritage.” Some have even suggested that she change her forename to Rosie and take her husband’s surname to downplay her ethnicity. However, Allin-Khan is proud of her roots and is keen to emphasise it. “I went double barrelled because I didn’t want to lose the Asian part of my surname and that for me, is very important,” she said. “I am proud to say that this is who I am – a Polish and Pakistani, proudly British Muslim woman who loves the Labour party.” Born and brought up in Tooting in a working-class household, Allin-Khan described her young life as “tough”. Her mother worked three jobs to keep the family financially afloat, and Allin-Khan recalled there only being one heater in the house that they had to move from room to room to keep themselves warm. Allin-Khan failed her A-Levels, citing the difficulties at home as a factor. Despite the setbacks, she still had a desire to study medicine. However, she was told “it wasn’t for girls like (her)”, as it was financially prohibitive, and she didn’t come from the “right background”. Allin-Khan, who still works part-time as a doctor, knew she had to keep fighting if she wanted to pursue her dream career. “I think my upbringing led me to believe I had no choice but to sink or swim,” she said. After resitting her A-Levels, the then-24-year-old accepted a place to study medicine at Lucy Cavendish College, University of Cambridge, which was funded by scholarships. “I really believe that where you start off in life doesn’t need to dictate where you end up,” the A&E doctor said. Although she credited her own resilience for her success, Allin-Khan believes the Labour government gave her an opportunity to fulfil her potential when things looked bleak. “The Labour government turned my life around,” the 43-year-old claimed. “I redid my A-Levels, did a degree and went to Cambridge to study medicine and I’m afraid those possibilities aren’t going to be there for a new generation of kids under this Tory government.” Allin-Khan, the MP for Tooting since 2016, admitted the biggest challenge of her involvement in politics is racism. She often faces abuse on social media and is mostly targeted for her Muslim beliefs. “When I look at the order in which my abuse comes, it is Muslim first, then my Asian heritage comes second,” she admitted. “My gender is third. Without a doubt, the amount of abuse is a huge challenge.” It is a concern that young BAME women may be deterred from entering politics due to the abuse other politicians have faced, she said. In response, Allin-Khan regularly engages with schools and community groups to encourage young people to “keep going and not to lose faith”. There is also a level of racism in the House of Commons, she said, highlighting that she is the first Muslim person ever to make it on to the deputy leadership ballot. Although it is encouraging to see more women and ethnic minority politicians in parliament, Allin-Khan believes there is “still a ceiling on what we can achieve”. Recently, Allin-Khan approached a “prominent BAME politician” to ask them to consider nominating her in the deputy leadership contest. However, the politician responded: “I’m only in the game of backing winners and you don’t look like you’ve got any chance of winning.” “We can’t have that attitude towards people, and I’ve said in my grassroots revival plan that our BAME communities can’t be an afterthought when it comes to supporting people to hold public office,” she said. “We need to be seeing ethnic minorities at the top of our party, on the front benches. “I’ve smashed that ceiling, but I plan to throw the ladder down and say people ‘come up behind, you can do this.’ But I know it isn’t easy.” My pledge to rebuild confidence in LabourI never imagined that one day I’d become an MP, or now a candidate to become the next Deputy Leader of the Labour Party. Growing up, I was regularly told that ‘girls like me’ from ‘backgrounds like mine’ wouldn’t amount to anything. I never planned to go into politics - I always wanted to be a doctor. The last Labour Government gave me that chance, allowing me to study Medicine aged 24 after failing my A-Levels the first time around because of pressures at home. This shaped the person that I am today and has given me the fire in my belly to ensure that no other child feels that there is a ceiling on what they can achieve.\nWhen I work shifts as an A&E doctor at my local hospital, I see first-hand the issues facing our communities today. I treat young people who come to A&E after self-harming, I treat those who haven’t been able to access mental health services for years, and yes, I treat victims of violent crime. To see a young person breathe their last breath is a pain that never leaves you. Teenage boys, once full of bravado on the street, with the words “Born to die” tattooed on their chests, victims of horrific stab wounds, laying there crying out for their mothers. The sound of a parent grieving for their child is universal - it can’t be forgotten. As the MP for Tooting, I have worked incredibly closely with community groups and young people to try and tackle the rise of violent crime in our society. I’ve organised summits with representatives from local community organisations, charities, the police, the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Council and the Deputy Mayor for Policing, to start tackling this problem from a community perspective. Working with affected communities is paramount in order to resolve these critical issues once and for all. As a keen boxer myself, I have promoted the work of local boxing clubs to tackle violent crime. Boxing is far more than just a sport - for many, it’s family. Clubs offer an opportunity for local young ¬people to make friends, engage with sport and receive mentorship. So much of gang culture and violence is about a sense of belonging. We have a duty to show young people that, if you can gain respect in the ring, you do not have to get respect from violence on the street. One of the reasons I decided to run to become the next Deputy Leader of the Labour Party is because it would give me the platform to give a voice to the voiceless. Whether it’s children losing their lives to senseless violence, older people being unable to access safe and decent social care, or refugees fleeing violence and persecution, their voices must be amplified. A platform alone isn’t enough though - Labour needs to be in power to affect real change for the most vulnerable in our communities. As Deputy Leader, I will rebuild our movement into one people can vote for. A party people can trust. The door may have closed on 12 December for a generation’s hopes and ambitions, but with the right leadership team in place in the Labour Party, it will not be closed for good. We need to win the next General Election, and we must listen to our voters ahead of the Mayoral election in May. As Deputy Leader, it will be my responsibility to rebuild trust, not just with the grassroots of our party, but with voters. Together, we can take Labour forward. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is MP for Tooting and candidate for Deputy Leader of Labour NHS workers battling coronavirus are facing a “national shortage” of protective clothing, HuffPost UK has been told.Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan, a working doctor who still works shifts in A&E, said scientists had told her that there were not enough body suits in the right sizes, while some doctors were only now starting to receive protective clothing.\nIt came amid new official estimates suggesting 5,000 to 10,000 people in the UK have coronavirus, leaving many doctors, nurses and other health workers at risk of infection. Last month, the World Health Organisation also warned that there was a global shortage of protective masks and body suits. One NHS source who worked at a hospital where coronavirus patients were being treated told HuffPost UK: “There were staff forced to wear oversized suits because that’s all they had. “All we have left is XL. “There is a national shortage of suits but this was raised with the government at least three weeks ago so something should have been done.” Appearing on HuffPost UK’s Commons People podcast, Allin-Khan repeated the concerns. “I held a meeting today with some people from the scientific community and they said their concern was though they had been testing out various modes of protective clothing, it turns out that there is a lack of the clothing they need available, the sizes aren’t available,” she said. “Just yesterday - because people still contact me because I’m a doctor still, to let me know what’s going on - someone said they were a GP and had only started receiving the necessary protective clothing yesterday and this has been going on for a month now. The Labour deputy leadership candidate criticised the government for moving too slowly to tackle from coronavirus. In a departure from Labour’s broad support for the government, Allin-Khan called for tougher measures to tackle the outbreak, including testing those with symptoms for the virus as a matter of course. Allin-Khan said the government’s testing programme could be “more robust”, reporting that “friends in the NHS” said people were being given “really unclear messaging”. She gave an example of two people who returned from northern Italy who phoned NHS 111 and were told to wait for a call back which did not come for five days, during which time they self isolated. When they eventually spoke again to NHS staff, they had to give their details again and had to self-isolate for eight days before finally being tested for coronavirus. Test results are also taking three to five days to materialise. Allin-Khan said: “We need to be moving quicker, people need to have a better idea of how to access testing, what it means for their daily lives. “The messaging needs to be clearer and the testing needs to be more robust.” She added: “We should have moved into the delay phase sooner than now and I don’t think we should measure our performance compared to what other countries are doing. “I think we should be looking at what’s best for us and when you look at the fact that China had the same number of cases that we already have surpassed before implementing measures we do need to be listening to what the other scientific community, for example some eminent epidemiologists, listen to what they’re saying. “Because ultimately we can’t leave the scientific community to be scapegoated for the government making bad decisions if they are proven to be wrong.” Allin-Khan meanwhile sidestepped questions on whether she wants to be shadow health secretary under the next Labour leader. “I like to focus on one thing at a time, genuinely, and I don’t think you should ever have a plan B because that’s implying you’ve accepted that your plan A won’t work out,” she said. “So I am genuinely, steely focused on winning this deputy leadership bid.” Put to her that she would be a good fit for the job, she replied: “Well I am a practising NHS doctor and I have got a master’s degree in public health and I care about our party so that’s honestly for whoever is the leader to decide.” |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Before deciding how to vote, I have carefully considered the provisions of the legislation, taken into account the views of those in Tooting, as well as discussing this at length with experts.\nThere are deeply felt personal, spiritual, philosophical and moral opinions held by individuals on both sides of this debate. Death is always a difficult subject. Our own death and the loss of those we love is a sad fact of life that each and every one of us will deal with at some point. As a doctor, death is something that my colleagues and I must confront every day. As a daughter, the death of my father from a terminal illness was a very eye-opening and traumatic experience, one which I’d wish on no-one. After much thought, reflection and engagement with the community I represent, I have decided to vote against the Bill at its Second Reading. The concerns I hold with the current proposals are multifaceted. I have spoken to key organisations and charities who have detailed their concerns that this legislation will have a disproportionate impact on disabled and BAME individuals. I am further worried that the current legislation does not go far enough to eliminate risks of coercion. Currently neither of the two doctors that would sign off on the process need to know the patient or their family. Nor are they mandated to seek a specialist clinical assessment. It is also important to me that we ensure people considering ending their own lives have access to good quality, well-resourced end-of-life care. This is currently not the reality for much of the country owing to a lack of resources. As such, moving forward, I will continue to advocate for improvements to palliative care, which can empower many individuals at the end of their lives, to enjoy their last moments with loved ones in as much comfort as possible and with peace of mind. There is no doubt that my colleagues have decided their vote, regardless of which side, with the very best of intentions. It is right that this Bill is being considered under a free vote, where every MP can vote with their conscience, and I am pleased that this has been a largely respectful, measured debate. I would like to thank everyone who has contacted me regarding this deeply personal issue - I have really listened. If the legislation passes today, there will remain opportunities to amend the Bill. I will look at any potential changes to the legislation closely. While I cannot support the Bill at this stage, this debate was needed and the issue is very important to the public. Regardless of the outcome of the vote, I hope we can all continue to be as respectful and understanding towards one another as possible.

Pleasure to invite local residents to share a cuppa and hear about their local issues. Thanks to local organisations and the police for coming along and listening to residents.\nToday, I brought together officials from Wandsworth Council and Wandsworth Police to discuss what we can do to make Tooting Broadway a safer, cleaner and more vibrant place to live and work.\nTonight I joined Andrew Marr on LBC to talk about the appalling hospital conditions doctors face in Palestinian hospitals.\nThe Tories have scrapped the Mental Health Act - failing thousands of patients.\nLabour must seize the opportunity to modernise mental health legislation, with the Joint Committee's recommendations in mind. Read my piece in New Statesman here.\nTonight, I voted on an amendment to the King's Speech to support a ceasefire in Gaza.\nRead my full statement here:\nTonight, I joined with representatives of all faiths and none at the BATCA annual peace ceremony in Tooting.\nThank you to everyone for their prayers of peace. They are needed now more than ever and I am so proud to represent such a wonderful, caring community.\nToday, I read out the names of the fallen and laid a wreath at St Nicholas Church in Tooting with local councillors, Rex Osborn, Kate Forbes and Kemi Akinola and members of our emergency services.\nSince the horrific terrorist attacks on Israel in October, more than 1,000 incidents of antisemitic hate crimes have been reported to Community Secure Trust.\nToday, I visited their headquarters in London to see the work they are doing to tackle antisemitism. It is a stain on our society. It must be combatted and those who perpetrate it must face the full force of the law.\nToday, the Government have scrapped their pledge to reform the Mental Health Act.\nMore than six years of reports, campaigning and hard work has gone down the drain. Last year, I sat on the Joint Committee on the Draft Mental Health Bill. There was overwhelming cross-party support for reforming the Act. To this day, the Government has failed to respond to the committee's recommendations. Earlier this year, the Conservatives scrapped their own 10-year mental health plan. Dither, delay and failure is on form with the Tories' approach to tackling the crisis in mental health services. Black people are five times more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act. The Tories have scrapped a once in a generation opportunity to tackle this burning injustice. Last month, I challenged the Health Minister to commit to reforming the Mental Health Act, her response was less than insightful. It is disappointing that the Tories continue to bury their heads in the sand and neglect mental health services. They are out of ideas and it's costing patients their lives. Only Labour can provide the transformation needed to improve services.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

The team here do incredible work in supporting those families most in need across Earlsfield. In a country as well off as ours, the fact we have so many who rely on foodbanks is nothing short of outrageous. We discussed our shared aim to end this. If you’d like to support Earlsfield Foodbank, you can donate here or add to the foodbank collection points at Sainsburys Local (Earlsfield) or Co-op on Garratt Lane. If you need support from the Earlsfield Foodbank and would like to collect some food or arrange a delivery, email or call on 07585064428. Earlsfield Foodbank is open at St Andrew’s Church (on Garratt Lane) Thursdays 9.30am - 12pm. Tooting Foodival is back! As Transition Tooting’s annual sustainable community festival, this is a wonderful opportunity for local residents to come together to celebrate all things locally grown, cooked, re-created and re-imagined. Led by local volunteers, the event will run from 11- 5pm on Saturday 4th September and is free and open to all! To find out more, see here. The situation which has unfolded in Afghanistan is shocking and terribly regrettable. It is simply not good enough for world leaders to say the speed of the Taliban advance took them by surprise, when many have been warning of this for months. There has either been a monumental failing of our intelligence services or an unacceptable lack of transparency. Either way the Government has reacted too late. In 2010, I worked (pictured) as a Humanitarian Aid Doctor in the North West Frontier Province, on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan, following the flood crisis. I met many people who had suffered unimaginable pain at the hands of the Taliban. I am continuing to receive a high volume of emails from local residents concerned about loved ones in Afghanistan. Myself and my team are working to respond as quickly as possible. If you are worried about someone, please do not hesitate to get in touch by emailing their details to [email protected]. Please include the following information so I can take action quickly:\nWe must not allow history to repeat itself. Careless leadership from the Prime Minister enabled this tragedy to happen on his watch, while he had taken his eye off the ball. The world must not turn its back on the Afghan people. Following the recall of Parliament on Wednesday, I remain in close contact with my colleagues in the Shadow Foreign Team and will continue to be on hand to support local residents through this. Calling all dog lovers! The Friends of Tooting Common are planning to run their annual Fun Dog Show on Saturday 11 September. Last year's virtual event was a huge success – dogs competed across a range of categories, including Best Puppy, Best Rescue, Best Veteran, Best Trick, and – my personal favourite – Dog That Looks Most Like its Owner. An incredible £475 was raised for St George’s Hospital Charity’s Coronavirus Appeal in the process. Barring any unexpected developments, the Friends are looking forward to bringing this year’s event back to its rightful home on Tooting Common. For more information about this wonderful event, including how to get involved, email the Friends of Tooting Common on [email protected]. Today, the BBC revealed that in 2018 4,500 people in mental health crisis were unlawfully held in police custody due to a lack of mental health beds.\nI spoke about this matter on BBC News earlier today. There is no question that the system must change immediately. This is nothing short of a scandal. Rest assured I will be pressing the Government on this issue. Today, I spoke with GMB and Royal College of Nursing frontline NHS staff at St George’s Hospital to hear their views on the Government’s latest pay offer. The last 18 months has impacted our beloved NHS immeasurably, and staff have made significant sacrifices in order to save lives. I stand in solidarity with my NHS colleagues. They deserve far more than just claps. They need a proper pay rise. It was a pleasure to, once again, attend the annual Nicholas Stewart Project Community Day on the Henry Prince Estate in Earlsfield. It was a real honour to have been asked to lay flowers in memory of Nicholas, who tragically lost his life seven years ago. The Nicholas Stewart Project was founded in the wake of Nicholas Stewart’s murder and encourages young people to reject negative influences in their life and turn away from knife crime. It is always so inspiring to hear the work of the NSP in supporting young people and be part of our community standing together in hope. Tooting Community Kitchen is a wonderful organisation that serves hot food to those vulnerable in our community. And they need volunteers! If you have a few hours to spare, please consider lending a hand to help out this brilliant local organisation. You can find out more about how to get involved here. There was significant concern locally about Wandsworth Council’s decision to extend Controlled Parking Zone restrictions in areas of Earlsfield and Tooting from 9:30am to 9:30pm each day. Over 1400 local residents completed my consultation on the change. I am pleased that, following our pressure, Wandsworth Council have U-turned on their plans to extend CPZ restrictions. Instead, Event Day only restrictions are planned from 1 October - a far more sensible solution, and something which other councils with stadiums do. I received more than double the number of responses to Wandsworth Council’s rushed, ill-thought out consultation. In fact, over 93% of respondents were not happy with the council’s plans. This should never have happened. But I am pleased the Council finally listened and have U-turned on their attempt to rush through restrictions that would simply act as another cash-grab on hardworking local residents. It is so important that those living with sight loss in our community are supported when using public transport. That is why I recently wrote to South Western Rail and Southern Rail to enquire as to when warning tactile - a vital safety and accessibility tool for those travelling by train - will be installed at Earlsfield and Wandsworth Stations. I am happy to say that Southern Rail have now confirmed that warning tactile has been installed on surface platforms at Wandsworth Common Station. And, although tactile is yet to be installed at Earlsfield Station, South West Railway have stated that Network Rail is working hard to deliver these accessibility improvements. Rest assured I will continue to press for accessibility for local residents living with sight loss. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

I'm proud to work side-by-side with the team.\nOne of the most important jobs I do as your local Member of Parliament is ensuring that our wonderful communities in Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown, Tooting and Wandsworth Common remain safe and welcoming places to live.\nTo this end, I have recently hosted public meetings with local police leadership in Balham and Furzedown, conducted a walkaround with the Borough Superintendent around the local area, and written to the police on behalf of local residents on a wide range of issues. Please do let me know if you have any concerns regarding crime issues in the local area - my door is always open.\nThe annual BATCA Fun Day is always good fun - and this year was no exception. I was delighted to celebrate the helpers, heroes and happy Tooting residents at this wonderful community event.\nIt was my pleasure to open the Quirky Dovetail Market. There was such a fantastic display of local arts and crafts on sale, which demonstrated the truly incredible talents that local people have to offer.\nThe children's cancer centre at St George's Hospital is at risk of closure.\nThis is deeply concerning. The St George's children's cancer centre has more than 25 years of expertise delivering the highest quality care for patients, which will be lost if the services are moved away from Tooting. Under these plans, patients will be forced to travel to a site in central London. Parents have made it very clear that it is easier, cheaper, safer, and more comfortable to take their children to St George's. There is also a huge added cost. The plans to relocate services will cost an estimated £90 million, more than three times the cost to redevelop facilities at St George's Hospital. Today, I've launched a petition calling on the Government and NHS England to keep the children’s cancer service at St George's Hospital. Add your name and share the petition with friends and family here Today, I asked Wandsworth Police officers to join me on a walk about in Tooting Bec.\nWe spoke to local residents and discussed tackling anti-social behaviour in the area. I know local residents have raised a number of concerns - about incidents targeting children and public safety in the area. I addressed these matters with the police, along with strategies already put in place aimed specifically at reducing worrying incidents of this kind and crime. Over recent months, I have taken the following action on anti-social behaviour and crime on the Heaver Estate:\nTooting has so much to offer as a community and I was delighted to visit my friends in Tooting Market yesterday to talk about their businesses. From food to clothes to art, crafts and activities, there is a wonderful array of businesses in the market Next time you're in the area, make sure to pop in and sample the market's delights, whether you need freshly squeezed juice3 or freshly stitched jeans. To hear from the traders themselves (and to see me in a funky hat!). Following reports from local residents of increased levels of speeding on Blackshaw Road, I am pleased that the police agreed to my suggestion of increased speed watches around the local area. Given that there is a nursery and St George's Hospital along this road, it is vital that speed levels are stringently enforced to ensure everyone's safety.\nI will continue to work with the police, Wandsworth Council and local councillors to keep our streets safe and accessible. To this end, I am very pleased to hear that the council is currently considering implementing a zebra crossing outside the nursery to protect both children and parents. Recently, I visited the fantastic team at Love Triangle, a brilliant pizza restaurant situated between Balham and Tooting Bec.\nThey’ve been selling pizza to the community for two and a half years now, but things are getting increasingly difficult. The cost-of-living crisis is hitting small businesses hard, with customers having less money to spend to things such as meals out, and the cost of energy and supplies rising astronomically. Will, who owns Love Triangle, told me that despite trying many different creative ways to stay afloat, things are only getting more difficult. Love Triangle have tried different opening times, and an array of different promotions and deals to help combat the challenges, but it is still far from easy, just to keep their head above water. The rising cost of food and energy, coupled with the reduction in disposable income for many is proving a difficult picture to navigate. Speaking to Will, and other business owners in our community, one message stands out. It is crucial to support local businesses where you can, or we risk losing more of our fantastic local businesses from Tooting, and across the country. Watch my visit to Love Triangle here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1599084624847642624?s=20&t=xq-atIy2mtAe0cDqI51dLw |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

She warns that many of those being treated are in their 30s and 40s.\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan is the MP for Tooting but she is also a practising doctor in A&E. She regularly goes in to do shifts in her local hospital St George's and has been in contact with her colleagues. This Sunday she took a record down for Mirror readers about the situation faced by nurses, doctors and others on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus. She said her latest shift had been a \"deeply, deeply eye-opening\" experience with previously fit and healthy people in their 30s and 40s \"attached to machines, fighting for their lives\". And she has been deeply critical of the approach taken by the government in tackling the spread of the deadly virus. \"The Prime Minister has been blase about this from the start, waiting for others to make decisions so he doesn't have to. It is costing lives,\" she said. Mirror Diary - Sunday 22 March6.30am – Leaving the HouseOn the way to work in A&E, to help out the real heroes of the frontline – the NHS staff who work day-in, day-out to keep us all safe. I am a bit apprehensive after seeing the stories that are being reported about Covid-19 and having spoken to colleagues across the country, but we need to come together at times like these for our communities. 7am – Reporting for DutyJust finished handover, which is when the day shift gets given notes on the patients who have come in overnight. There’s a very real sense that the number of cases are growing extremely quickly, something that will present a real challenge in the coming days and weeks. Some of the sickest patients that have been admitted have been young – they’re in their 30s and 40s, previously fit and well, but now fighting for their lives in Intensive Care (ICU). There was a lot of talk in January that this was a virus just like the flu that only affects older people – that simply isn’t the case. There’s a real sense of apprehension ahead of the shift – we’re all expecting a rocky road ahead in the coming days. 8am- Protective EquipmentThe first part of the shift was spent looking for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – these are masks and aprons that keep those working on the frontlines safe. While we’d all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. Frontline staff across the country are scared. We’re scared that we’re going to lose patients – we have spent years training to save every life that we can. We are scared of passing this deadly virus onto our loved ones because we don’t always have the PPE that we so desperately need. We’re scared that that if we aren’t properly protected, that we run the risk of spreading the virus between patients. It’s vital that people practice social distancing measures properly – crowded areas will only add to the number of cases, and the number of people being admitted into hospitals across the country. In the coming days and weeks, difficult decisions will be made by my colleagues in ICU about who gets a ventilator – it’s that serious. Midday – Resus overwhelmedThe whole of resus is full of patients with respiratory problems – this is the part of A&E where the sickest patients go. Patients are arriving breathless, with crackles so fine in their lungs, you can hardly hear them. Their X-rays show white lungs where normally, they would look clear and black, full of air. Major trauma, such as heart attacks and victims of car crashes, are now being moved into paediatric A&E. The situation around Covid-19 is clearly getting worse by the day. The talk amongst the team is that we feel that we will be overwhelmed in the coming days. I’m going for a refresher course on ventilators for staff – they’re also training new staff on how to use ventilators. The talk is, of course, feeling quite bleak as the day goes on – but this is what we’ve all been trained for. 4pm – Leaving A&EJust leaving A&E now – it’s been a difficult shift and a difficult Mother’s Day. At times like these, we must think about our loved ones - if we want to protect those dearest to us, we must stay indoors. I’ve just called my husband and asked him to let our daughters know that they won’t be able to cuddle me and give me their handmade presents when I get home. Instead, I’ll be getting straight in the shower and throwing my clothes in the washing machine – it is our duty to protect the ones we love. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can, and we will, save lives. Comments are closed.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_tooting-heroes-awards/content_211.html": "|\nOn Monday 13 June, I was delighted to welcome organisations and individuals from across Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting to Parliament, in order to recognise their fantastic contributions to society in the face of adversity in the last few years. It was a sheer joy to see the pillars of our communities together in one place and I look forward to continuing to collaborate and support the inspiring people who do so much for the local area.\nI presented the following organisations and individuals with trophies for truly exceptional services in the community: Councillor Andy Gibbons, for his dedicated public service over the last three decades.

I have been calling for a suspension of sales immediately and my comments can be read in the Independent here. Last week, I also signed a joint letter to the Foreign and Business Secretaries alongside a cross-party group of over 130 MPs, calling for the halting of UK arms sales to Israel. The full text of this letter can be read below.\nI was thrilled to join Dermot O'Leary and Josie Gibson for the health segment on This Morning today to talk about working as an emergency doctor in the NHS and when to seek help.\nYes, A&E departments are under huge strain and pressure, but always remember - if you need help, we are here.\nAfter more than a year of waiting, the Government has finally responded to the Joint Committee report on the draft Mental Health Bill.\nIn that time, they kicked mental health into the long grass while patients continued to suffer. The Government response is poor - rejecting vital calls for a Mental Health Commissioner, refusing to ban discriminatory Community Treatment Orders and ignoring a right to culturally appropriate advocacy. Why make us wait so long and not provide any meaningful change? With waiting lists higher than ever, we need bold action on mental health. It is clear the Tories are simply not up to the job. A Labour Government must bring forward mental health reform with the recommendations of the committee at its core.\nToday, I joined Politics Live to discuss the Tories' botched Rwanda plan. The policy is an inhumane, unworkable gimmick - now they have blocked plans to protect victims of human trafficking and individuals who have supported our armed forces.\nIt's all done to appease the right of the party.\nThere was a huge turnout today for the Oxfam Lobby Day event calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. I was proud to join other MPs and charities calling for an unconditional, immediate ceasefire.\nThank you to the charities who helped support it and to all attendees, who brought a powerful energy to the room.\nTonight, I joined Robert Peston on ITV alongside Conservative MP, Paul Scully, Government Minister, Kevin Hollinrake and environmental campaigner, Fergal Sharkey to discuss the hot topics of the day. We chatted about the appalling comments made by a Tory donor about Diane Abbott and extremism in the UK.\nUp to 86,000 people could die in Gaza in the next 6 months due to war, disease and starvation. There’s one latrine for every 500 people and only 4 trucks of aid per day.\nAt the International Development Select Committee, we heard evidence about the appalling humanitarian situation from experts working on the ground. The Committee published our report on the ongoing crisis. You can read more about it here\nToday I met with the Prison Officers Assocation from Wandsworth Prison and Battersea and Wandsworth TUC to discuss the brutal conditions officers face.\nThey told me about appalling conditions with three assaults on staff every day. This simply can’t go on - the Govt must get a grip on the crisis in our prisons. Sunak pledged to grow the economy but instead we entered recession.\nHe can no longer credibly claim that his plan is working. It’s time for a fresh start under a Labour Government. Tonight, I spoke to Channel 4 News about the appalling conditions faced by staff and inmates in Wandsworth Prison. This can't go on. The Government urgently needs to get a grip on the crisis in our prison system instead of pretending that nothing is wrong. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Every year, politicians agree the children's mental health crisis must end. But nothing changes and children continue to be let down by inaction. Today, I led calls in Parliament for this to change.\nThis morning, I joined the panel on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg alongside former Conservative MP, Nadine Dorries and More in Common's Luke Tryl. We chatted about trust in politics and the situation in the Middle East.\nStatement on the International Court of Justice interim judgement on situation in Israel and Gaza26/1/2024\nIt was great to speak at the King's Fund Circles Series focusing on women in leadership, where I shared my experience as a women working in healthcare and politics.\nIt's vital that we get more women in leadership roles across society. It's important that we meet our net zero obligations - it'll save lives here and around the world. With 65 million people living on vulnerable, low-lying island nations, susceptible to flooding and extreme weather, we need climate action now. In today's Guardian, my latest figures reveal that thousands of people are re-admitted to mental health hospitals within days or weeks of leaving it, wreaking havoc on people's lives.\nWhy? Because the Tories cut a quarter of mental health beds and patients don't get the care they deserve. Read the full story here\nChildren eating weeds, 1000 children already losing their legs and enduring amputations without anaesthesia. This is the daily living hell for the children of Gaza.\nToday in Prime Minister Questions, I implored the Prime Minister to act to end this bloodshed.\nToday, I asked Dr Ghada Al Jabda, Chief of Health in Gaza for UNRWA about the dire situation facing hospitals in Gaza.\nAccording to the latest reports, 64% of hospitals in Gaza are non-operational and many are struggling to provide effective care.\nIn Parliament, I renewed my calls to the Foreign Secretary for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nPalestinian parents in Gaza love their children as much as we love ours, but theirs are buried under rubble. Millions are facing starvation. How many more need to die before the Government call for a ceasefire?\nWe have heard lots about the Government's heartless Rwanda scheme. This circus is the latest saga in the Tory melodrama, but it is the most vulnerable people whose lives they're playing with. Britain is better than this cruel, cynical Tory Government. I have worked with refugees for more than a decade. I have heard their experiences of war, violence and terror. Nobody leaves their homes, communities and livelihoods unless they must. That is why I will always stand against the inhumane Rwanda Bill. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

She warns that many of those being treated are in their 30s and 40s.\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan is the MP for Tooting but she is also a practising doctor in A&E. She regularly goes in to do shifts in her local hospital St George's and has been in contact with her colleagues. This Sunday she took a record down for Mirror readers about the situation faced by nurses, doctors and others on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus. She said her latest shift had been a \"deeply, deeply eye-opening\" experience with previously fit and healthy people in their 30s and 40s \"attached to machines, fighting for their lives\". And she has been deeply critical of the approach taken by the government in tackling the spread of the deadly virus. \"The Prime Minister has been blase about this from the start, waiting for others to make decisions so he doesn't have to. It is costing lives,\" she said. Mirror Diary - Sunday 22 March6.30am – Leaving the HouseOn the way to work in A&E, to help out the real heroes of the frontline – the NHS staff who work day-in, day-out to keep us all safe. I am a bit apprehensive after seeing the stories that are being reported about Covid-19 and having spoken to colleagues across the country, but we need to come together at times like these for our communities. 7am – Reporting for DutyJust finished handover, which is when the day shift gets given notes on the patients who have come in overnight. There’s a very real sense that the number of cases are growing extremely quickly, something that will present a real challenge in the coming days and weeks. Some of the sickest patients that have been admitted have been young – they’re in their 30s and 40s, previously fit and well, but now fighting for their lives in Intensive Care (ICU). There was a lot of talk in January that this was a virus just like the flu that only affects older people – that simply isn’t the case. There’s a real sense of apprehension ahead of the shift – we’re all expecting a rocky road ahead in the coming days. 8am- Protective EquipmentThe first part of the shift was spent looking for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – these are masks and aprons that keep those working on the frontlines safe. While we’d all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. Frontline staff across the country are scared. We’re scared that we’re going to lose patients – we have spent years training to save every life that we can. We are scared of passing this deadly virus onto our loved ones because we don’t always have the PPE that we so desperately need. We’re scared that that if we aren’t properly protected, that we run the risk of spreading the virus between patients. It’s vital that people practice social distancing measures properly – crowded areas will only add to the number of cases, and the number of people being admitted into hospitals across the country. In the coming days and weeks, difficult decisions will be made by my colleagues in ICU about who gets a ventilator – it’s that serious. Midday – Resus overwhelmedThe whole of resus is full of patients with respiratory problems – this is the part of A&E where the sickest patients go. Patients are arriving breathless, with crackles so fine in their lungs, you can hardly hear them. Their X-rays show white lungs where normally, they would look clear and black, full of air. Major trauma, such as heart attacks and victims of car crashes, are now being moved into paediatric A&E. The situation around Covid-19 is clearly getting worse by the day. The talk amongst the team is that we feel that we will be overwhelmed in the coming days. I’m going for a refresher course on ventilators for staff – they’re also training new staff on how to use ventilators. The talk is, of course, feeling quite bleak as the day goes on – but this is what we’ve all been trained for. 4pm – Leaving A&EJust leaving A&E now – it’s been a difficult shift and a difficult Mother’s Day. At times like these, we must think about our loved ones - if we want to protect those dearest to us, we must stay indoors. I’ve just called my husband and asked him to let our daughters know that they won’t be able to cuddle me and give me their handmade presents when I get home. Instead, I’ll be getting straight in the shower and throwing my clothes in the washing machine – it is our duty to protect the ones we love. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can, and we will, save lives. NHS workers battling coronavirus are facing a “national shortage” of protective clothing, HuffPost UK has been told.Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan, a working doctor who still works shifts in A&E, said scientists had told her that there were not enough body suits in the right sizes, while some doctors were only now starting to receive protective clothing.\nIt came amid new official estimates suggesting 5,000 to 10,000 people in the UK have coronavirus, leaving many doctors, nurses and other health workers at risk of infection. Last month, the World Health Organisation also warned that there was a global shortage of protective masks and body suits. One NHS source who worked at a hospital where coronavirus patients were being treated told HuffPost UK: “There were staff forced to wear oversized suits because that’s all they had. “All we have left is XL. “There is a national shortage of suits but this was raised with the government at least three weeks ago so something should have been done.” Appearing on HuffPost UK’s Commons People podcast, Allin-Khan repeated the concerns. “I held a meeting today with some people from the scientific community and they said their concern was though they had been testing out various modes of protective clothing, it turns out that there is a lack of the clothing they need available, the sizes aren’t available,” she said. “Just yesterday - because people still contact me because I’m a doctor still, to let me know what’s going on - someone said they were a GP and had only started receiving the necessary protective clothing yesterday and this has been going on for a month now. The Labour deputy leadership candidate criticised the government for moving too slowly to tackle from coronavirus. In a departure from Labour’s broad support for the government, Allin-Khan called for tougher measures to tackle the outbreak, including testing those with symptoms for the virus as a matter of course. Allin-Khan said the government’s testing programme could be “more robust”, reporting that “friends in the NHS” said people were being given “really unclear messaging”. She gave an example of two people who returned from northern Italy who phoned NHS 111 and were told to wait for a call back which did not come for five days, during which time they self isolated. When they eventually spoke again to NHS staff, they had to give their details again and had to self-isolate for eight days before finally being tested for coronavirus. Test results are also taking three to five days to materialise. Allin-Khan said: “We need to be moving quicker, people need to have a better idea of how to access testing, what it means for their daily lives. “The messaging needs to be clearer and the testing needs to be more robust.” She added: “We should have moved into the delay phase sooner than now and I don’t think we should measure our performance compared to what other countries are doing. “I think we should be looking at what’s best for us and when you look at the fact that China had the same number of cases that we already have surpassed before implementing measures we do need to be listening to what the other scientific community, for example some eminent epidemiologists, listen to what they’re saying. “Because ultimately we can’t leave the scientific community to be scapegoated for the government making bad decisions if they are proven to be wrong.” Allin-Khan meanwhile sidestepped questions on whether she wants to be shadow health secretary under the next Labour leader. “I like to focus on one thing at a time, genuinely, and I don’t think you should ever have a plan B because that’s implying you’ve accepted that your plan A won’t work out,” she said. “So I am genuinely, steely focused on winning this deputy leadership bid.” Put to her that she would be a good fit for the job, she replied: “Well I am a practising NHS doctor and I have got a master’s degree in public health and I care about our party so that’s honestly for whoever is the leader to decide.” |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

We need to ensure NHS staff are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients.\nThe challenge that coronavirus poses to our society is unprecedented. It is a scary and worrying time, especially for our NHS. Having worked as a frontline A&E doctor this weekend, in my local hospital, I am increasingly concerned that our health service may buckle under the increased strain that Covid-19 has brought. Our only priority must be to protect lives. Every possible resource we have should be dedicated to that single objective. Crucially, our NHS and healthcare workers on the frontlines must be given whatever resources they need to tackle this and to save lives. It’s disheartening then, that basic resources are in short supply. Full personal protective equipment (PPE) is vital to not only protect frontline staff, but also to limit the spread of infection to our loved ones and to our patients. The Government have known this crisis was coming for weeks, and yet they still have not been fully prepared for it. A country like the UK should not be having to ask manufacturing companies to switch production to provide emergency ventilators, or for NHS workers to have to go without PPE. The first part of my shift this weekend was spent looking for the correct masks and aprons - this is happening to frontline workers ahead of every shift, across the country. While we would all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. The consequences of this for NHS staff are devastating. There’s a feeling amongst many frontline staff that protective equipment is already being rationed. A few weeks ago, the guidance for healthcare staff treating people with confirmed cases of Covid-19 was to wear a full FFP3 mask as well as gloves and a full apron - now, that guidance has changed and we are told to only wear gloves and a basic surgical mask. Barely a day goes by without pictures online of frontline staff fashioning protection out of clinical waste bags. We need full transparency on decisions and changes to guidance, otherwise concerns will only grow. As this virus spreads, and as more and more people are forced into hospital, NHS workers are going to have to start making very difficult choices because of the limited resources they have available. They are going to have to start deciding who can access the most urgent care, including who is given priority for the last available ventilator - they’ll be making impossible choices about whose lives can be saved. We have already seen this happening in Italy, and it is an unimaginable tragedy for medics who are dedicated to saving lives above all else. The best way to help frontline staff who go to work to save lives, is for everyone else to stay home. We will get through this, together. The Government must take responsibility for providing all the resources and equipment the NHS needs, including vital PPE, for communicating the message on social distancing clearly to the public, and for enforcing it robustly. I welcome the new, more stringent measures announced yesterday – however, as Mike Ashley has shown, there’s still room for people to exploit it. As a country, we must do what will save the most lives. That’s true of the Government, people across the country, and medics on the frontline. The faster we get on top of this disease, the faster our society will be able to tackle this virus, and fewer lives will be lost. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can and we will save lives.

Coronavirus has exacerbated the existing crisis in mental health. Many NHS and social care staff have been scared of going to work, and they have lost patients and colleagues. It has been heartbreaking to witness the toll this virus has taken on staff mental health. Current support is not good enough, and without a tailored, fast-tracked service for staff who have faced death and despair every day for over three months, our frontline heroes will continue to be failed. We need to care for our carers. It is time for the Government to give back to those who have sacrificed so much to keep our loved ones safe. Unless our staff are protected, they cannot continue their vital work of keeping us all safe. The consequences of not having adequate personal protective equipment for NHS staff are devastatingBarely a day goes by without pictures online of frontline staff fashioning protection out of clinical waste bags. We need to ensure NHS staff are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients.\nThe challenge that coronavirus poses to our society is unprecedented. It is a scary and worrying time, especially for our NHS. Having worked as a frontline A&E doctor this weekend, in my local hospital, I am increasingly concerned that our health service may buckle under the increased strain that Covid-19 has brought. Our only priority must be to protect lives. Every possible resource we have should be dedicated to that single objective. Crucially, our NHS and healthcare workers on the frontlines must be given whatever resources they need to tackle this and to save lives. It’s disheartening then, that basic resources are in short supply. Full personal protective equipment (PPE) is vital to not only protect frontline staff, but also to limit the spread of infection to our loved ones and to our patients. The Government have known this crisis was coming for weeks, and yet they still have not been fully prepared for it. A country like the UK should not be having to ask manufacturing companies to switch production to provide emergency ventilators, or for NHS workers to have to go without PPE. The first part of my shift this weekend was spent looking for the correct masks and aprons - this is happening to frontline workers ahead of every shift, across the country. While we would all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. The consequences of this for NHS staff are devastating. There’s a feeling amongst many frontline staff that protective equipment is already being rationed. A few weeks ago, the guidance for healthcare staff treating people with confirmed cases of Covid-19 was to wear a full FFP3 mask as well as gloves and a full apron - now, that guidance has changed and we are told to only wear gloves and a basic surgical mask. Barely a day goes by without pictures online of frontline staff fashioning protection out of clinical waste bags. We need full transparency on decisions and changes to guidance, otherwise concerns will only grow. As this virus spreads, and as more and more people are forced into hospital, NHS workers are going to have to start making very difficult choices because of the limited resources they have available. They are going to have to start deciding who can access the most urgent care, including who is given priority for the last available ventilator - they’ll be making impossible choices about whose lives can be saved. We have already seen this happening in Italy, and it is an unimaginable tragedy for medics who are dedicated to saving lives above all else. The best way to help frontline staff who go to work to save lives, is for everyone else to stay home. We will get through this, together. The Government must take responsibility for providing all the resources and equipment the NHS needs, including vital PPE, for communicating the message on social distancing clearly to the public, and for enforcing it robustly. I welcome the new, more stringent measures announced yesterday – however, as Mike Ashley has shown, there’s still room for people to exploit it. As a country, we must do what will save the most lives. That’s true of the Government, people across the country, and medics on the frontline. The faster we get on top of this disease, the faster our society will be able to tackle this virus, and fewer lives will be lost. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can and we will save lives. London Covid-19 doctor says soon staff will be forced to choose whose life to saveRosena Allin-Khan, a Labour MP and A&E doctor, reveals ‘heart-wrenching’ decisions facing hospital workers\nRosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting and an A&E doctor, is still working regular shifts. On Sunday she worked at St George’s hospital in her south London constituency. She explains how the coronavirus pandemic has affected staff: I’ve been an A&E doctor for 15 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this before. The departments are quieter because people are staying away from hospital, but the patients are sicker. We’re seeing a distinct rise in the numbers coming in with respiratory symptoms, who are testing Covid-19 positive. On Sunday, very early in the morning, the entire resuscitation department, where the absolute sickest patients go, was full to capacity with patients with breathing difficulties. We had to move other very ill patients to the paediatric resuscitation area to keep them safe. This is only set to get worse. We’re seeing patients now who would have only contracted the virus two weeks ago. In the coming 10 days we expect the entire A&E department will be taken up with suspected Covid-19 patients. Doctors and nurses are brave, and the A&E department is known for being on the frontline and high risk, but there’s a palpable fear among staff for three reasons. Firstly, they’re frightened for their own health and those of the people they love. When I finished my shift yesterday, which was Mother’s Day, I came back to the house and I couldn’t touch or hug my two little girls until I put all my clothes in the wash and had a shower. The second reason is that staff expect, very soon, potentially to have to make heart-wrenching choices about whose life can be saved if we don’t have enough ventilators. That goes counter to everything you’ve ever learned as a doctor or nurse – to make life-and-death decisions, where we could possibly have saved every one of those people, is unimaginable. This is what our colleagues in Italy are living through now. Third, the patterns described thus far for symptoms of coronavirus are not what we’re now seeing in the emergency department. We’re seeing young, previously very healthy people, who are ill in hospital. Some are in their 30s, and they need ventilators to stay alive. Some patients are presenting with abdominal pain, which we hadn’t heard of before. A person can come in and say they have a stomach pain, and they’re put in the “green” area of the department – but then they mention they also have a cough. Everybody should be assumed to be Covid-positive until proven otherwise at this point. There’s also a real concern among staff around the country about personal protective equipment. They either don’t have any, or if they do many feel it’s being rationed. It’s very hard to listen to some colleagues say that as a result of there not being enough equipment to go round, they’re resigned to catching the virus – it’s just a matter of when. On social distancing, the messaging from the government hasn’t been clear enough. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has banned public gatherings of more than two people. It’s clear and easy to understand. There has to be no ambiguity in the language because people’s lives depend on it. Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives. The MP for Tooting has been working in her local hospital where doctors and nurses are already dealing with cases of covid-19. She warns that many of those being treated are in their 30s and 40s.\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan is the MP for Tooting but she is also a practising doctor in A&E. She regularly goes in to do shifts in her local hospital St George's and has been in contact with her colleagues. This Sunday she took a record down for Mirror readers about the situation faced by nurses, doctors and others on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus. She said her latest shift had been a \"deeply, deeply eye-opening\" experience with previously fit and healthy people in their 30s and 40s \"attached to machines, fighting for their lives\". And she has been deeply critical of the approach taken by the government in tackling the spread of the deadly virus. \"The Prime Minister has been blase about this from the start, waiting for others to make decisions so he doesn't have to. It is costing lives,\" she said. Mirror Diary - Sunday 22 March6.30am – Leaving the HouseOn the way to work in A&E, to help out the real heroes of the frontline – the NHS staff who work day-in, day-out to keep us all safe. I am a bit apprehensive after seeing the stories that are being reported about Covid-19 and having spoken to colleagues across the country, but we need to come together at times like these for our communities. 7am – Reporting for DutyJust finished handover, which is when the day shift gets given notes on the patients who have come in overnight. There’s a very real sense that the number of cases are growing extremely quickly, something that will present a real challenge in the coming days and weeks. Some of the sickest patients that have been admitted have been young – they’re in their 30s and 40s, previously fit and well, but now fighting for their lives in Intensive Care (ICU). There was a lot of talk in January that this was a virus just like the flu that only affects older people – that simply isn’t the case. There’s a real sense of apprehension ahead of the shift – we’re all expecting a rocky road ahead in the coming days. 8am- Protective EquipmentThe first part of the shift was spent looking for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – these are masks and aprons that keep those working on the frontlines safe. While we’d all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. Frontline staff across the country are scared. We’re scared that we’re going to lose patients – we have spent years training to save every life that we can. We are scared of passing this deadly virus onto our loved ones because we don’t always have the PPE that we so desperately need. We’re scared that that if we aren’t properly protected, that we run the risk of spreading the virus between patients. It’s vital that people practice social distancing measures properly – crowded areas will only add to the number of cases, and the number of people being admitted into hospitals across the country. In the coming days and weeks, difficult decisions will be made by my colleagues in ICU about who gets a ventilator – it’s that serious. Midday – Resus overwhelmedThe whole of resus is full of patients with respiratory problems – this is the part of A&E where the sickest patients go. Patients are arriving breathless, with crackles so fine in their lungs, you can hardly hear them. Their X-rays show white lungs where normally, they would look clear and black, full of air. Major trauma, such as heart attacks and victims of car crashes, are now being moved into paediatric A&E. The situation around Covid-19 is clearly getting worse by the day. The talk amongst the team is that we feel that we will be overwhelmed in the coming days. I’m going for a refresher course on ventilators for staff – they’re also training new staff on how to use ventilators. The talk is, of course, feeling quite bleak as the day goes on – but this is what we’ve all been trained for. 4pm – Leaving A&EJust leaving A&E now – it’s been a difficult shift and a difficult Mother’s Day. At times like these, we must think about our loved ones - if we want to protect those dearest to us, we must stay indoors. I’ve just called my husband and asked him to let our daughters know that they won’t be able to cuddle me and give me their handmade presents when I get home. Instead, I’ll be getting straight in the shower and throwing my clothes in the washing machine – it is our duty to protect the ones we love. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can, and we will, save lives. Front-line workers in the NHS have felt ignored by the Government - and now the Tories look set to give up the NHS for profit.\nThis Christmas I’ve been proud to support my hard-working colleagues on the front line by doing shifts in my local A&E. We’re all touched by the NHS at some point in our lives. For over 70 years it has been our lifeline, the glue holding our society together, often forgotten about, but there in our times of greatest need. The NHS is there to bring life, to offer care and dignity when we leave the world, and to support our loved ones when tragedy hits. But front-line workers in the NHS have felt ignored and that the Government does not recognise the day-to-day pressures they face. It didn’t start with claims on the side of a bus during the European referendum campaign in 2016 but, since then, using the NHS for political gain certainly picked up pace. Throughout the election, Boris Johnson repeatedly denied that the NHS would be up for sale. Just two weeks after the election, it was revealed that NHS cancer care and children’s treatments are up for grabs in a stealth Tory sell-off. Cardiology, gynaecology, paediatrics and oncology are among the services being offered to companies. As an A&E doctor, when someone is rushed into A&E having a heart attack, we work to patch someone up before sending them off to heart specialists. How will it feel knowing that those services are now being provided by a private company? Where is the trust? Allowing hospital trusts to outsource treatment to private companies could lead to a postcode lottery of health care, further widening the health divide. We need to be bringing the UK together, not tearing it apart, turning communities against each other. On top of this, discussions are taking place with tech giants on how to make money from patient data. While we must do everything possible to look for cures and ensure a better patient journey, we need to know how our own data is being used. The last decade has shown us that we must exercise caution with tech giants. The Government does not have the money or expertise needed to create an anonymised patient database, which is exactly why Amazon and Microsoft have been approached. Trust in our NHS cannot be destroyed because without trust, everything else could be up for grabs. I was stunned and heartbroken after the election result and bereft at what it would mean for our NHS. Our hospitals, treatments and dedicated staff cannot simply be sold off to the highest bidder. These aren’t the principles our NHS was founded and built on and I will continue fighting, standing side by side with our hospital workers, to protect our NHS from those who wish to destroy it. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

This simply can’t go on - the Govt must get a grip on the crisis in our prisons. At the start of August I hosted GMB Southern in Parliament.\nUnions play such a crucial role in supporting workers and ensuring our workplaces maintain the highest standards for safety, pay and conditions. I really enjoyed talking to the staff about the work they do: representing individuals and groups, helping people through disputes, and pushing for legislative change that keeps the UK’s workplaces reflective of our values and aspirations. If you haven’t already: join a union – they are there for you.\nLondon UNISON members have fought hard for some amazing victories over the last year. I was proud to meet with some of our fantastic reps working in local healthcare when I addressed UNISON’s conference last month.\nToday, Justin Madders MP and I met with the Retail trade union Usdaw and a group of retail workers in Westminster to talk about how the cost-of-living crisis, rising violence and abuse in stores, and the impact of Christmas holiday trade is affecting the mental health of customers and colleagues.\nFar too many people are facing this Christmas period worried about how to provide for their families. With so many Usdaw members having their mental health impacted as a result of the cost-of-living crisis and increased levels of abuse in the workplace, it is deeply important that we, as politicians, take the time to listen. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_climate-change/content_73.html": "|\nIt's important that we meet our net zero obligations - it'll save lives here and around the world. With 65 million people living on vulnerable, low-lying island nations, susceptible to flooding and extreme weather, we need climate action now. It was an absolute pleasure to take part in Wimbledon Sustainable Fashion Week with Wimbledon Go Inspire. I was so inspired by the incredible panel talking about sustainable fashion. I even got to wear some incredible sustainable knitwear. Recently, I have received many emails about the climate emergency and how a potential Labour government would respond to it. We are facing a climate crisis and urgent action needs to be taken to avoid it. UN reports have shown that existing policies are not doing enough to avert cataclysmic climate related events, and we are already seeing historic weather activities causing floods, wildfires and droughts around the world.\nA Labour government would put climate change at the heart of our agenda to help build a better Britain. Labour would deliver zero-carbon power by 2030, insulate 19 million homes and establish a National Wealth Fund to help create over a million jobs in green industry. Labour will make the UK a clean energy superpower to cut energy bills and improve national energy security. As an A&E doctor and mother, I am incredibly concerned about the impact of poor air quality in our local area. I see many people attending hospital with breathing difficulties directly linked to toxic air, which contributes to thousands of premature deaths every year. It is my belief that it is the right thing to do to adopt enforceable targets and bring in preventative measures to tackle air pollution. As such, I am supportive of the ULEZ expansion coming to Tooting.\nHowever, I also acknowledge its impact on people’s budgets. I called on Sadiq to expand the scrappage scheme support – which he delivered on without Government support despite money being provided for similar schemes in other cities. Furthermore, I am pleased that he has further expanded the scheme, and information about the scrappage scheme can be found here. Wandsworth Council have also announced support through the Wandsworth Sustainable Travel Fund, details of which can be found here. The expansion of ULEZ was also mandated by the Government as part of the TfL bailout deal during the height of the pandemic – so they wanted the expansion to go ahead as well. Many local residents have been in touch regarding the expansion of the Cambo Oil Field, 75 miles to the west of the Shetland Islands in Scotland. I want to be clear in the fact that I oppose the expansion of the Cambo Oil Field. The climate crisis is the defining issue of our generation and should be treated with the urgency required. By expanding oil and gas exploration, we are abandoning our obligations to end the ongoing climate crisis. Ahead of COP26, we must support the end of oil and gas exploration whilst protecting our communities and jobs. I know that the Climate and Ecological Emergency (CEE) Bill is one of interest to many people here in Tooting. On 9th February, the CEE Bill was debated in a thirty-minute adjournment debate. Adjournment debates are spaces at the end of the Parliamentary day when MPs can debate a specific topic. As you may know, the CEE Bill is a Private Members Bill (Presentation Bill), meaning that it does not involve a debate or a vote in Parliament, but rather it is a way of drawing attention to an issue. I support the principles of this Bill and will therefore continue to support Parliamentary measures that seek to implement many of the principles laid out in the Bill. Indeed, I have already supported several amendments to the Environment Bill in order to improve it, such as Clause 2 for environmental targets on particulate matter and Clause 7 for Environmental Improvement Plans. I will absolutely continue to support strong and effective amendments to the Environment Bill when it returns to the House of Commons in due course. The climate crisis is an imminent threat to current and future generations. Please know that I am committed to holding the Government to account on their approach to climate change. Today Wandsworth Council has announced that it is suspending the Low Traffic Neighbourhoods that it implemented across our community. Wandsworth Council failed from the start to communicate the implementation of LTNs to local residents, and instead of listening and reviewing they have now decided to pull them out because do not want the fuss.\nAs I have said before, I was not consulted and nor were local residents on these changes. They were brought in overnight and pitted neighbour against neighbour, causing fierce rows and division. The Council should be ashamed. When the going got tough, they tried to pass the buck, and now Wandsworth Council is wasting tens of thousands of pounds by scrapping the LTNs entirely. The Conservative Cabinet Member for Transport's position is untenable. Attention will now turn to the TfL Streetspace scheme on Upper Tooting Road, Balham High Road and Tooting High Street. I know that this is a scheme that has its issues and needs reviewing. However, I am confident that TfL want to make it work for our local environment. Contrast TfL's response with that of Wandsworth Council. TfL is taking feedback on board, they are hosting a virtual public meeting next week to gather feedback from local people and I am meeting with a TfL representative next week to discuss the scheme. I will be taking him to meet some of the affected businesses and discussing the issues emergency services have had. TfL evidently want the scheme to work and they deserve credit for trying. I have been clear from the start that I am supportive of schemes which encourage cycling and make our streets safer. We do that by engaging in polite and respectful discussion to bring about changes collectively. I have received lots of correspondence from local residents regarding the changes that have been made to our roads as part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood and the Streetspace schemes on the A24 (Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road). As part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood schemes, many streets have had filters put in to close the road to all vehicles except cycles and some now have turning restrictions. As part of the Streetspace scheme, a number of changes have been made to Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road including the installation of wands to segregate cycle lanes, a number of turning restrictions as well as changes to bus stops.\nThese changes have come about as a result of statutory guidance that the Government issued in May, stating that local authorities were expected to make significant changes to their road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians “as swiftly as possible”. (If you would like to read more about this statutory guidance you can read it in full here.) As a result, TfL made £55m of funding available to the 33 councils in London as part of its “Streetspace for London” programme to urgently create new segregated cycle lanes, extend pavements and close roads to traffic. Wandsworth Council was given £1,923,500 by TfL and used this money to implement the LTNs. TfL has, in consultation with Wandsworth Council but acting separately, implemented changes to the A24. I am supportive of initiatives which reduce car usage, make our streets safer, encourage cycling and create a better local environment. But we must make it work for everyone in Tooting and Balham. I know that lots of local residents have concerns and comments about how the changes have affected our community. The only way to have your voice heard is to feed into the consultations that Wandsworth Council is running and to let TfL know what you think by emailing them. To respond to Wandsworth Council's consultation, click here. To provide feedback to TfL please email: [email protected] It is important to note that I was not consulted prior to the implementation of these changes to our roads and I have no control over the decisions that have been made. As the local MP, I can lobby the Government and the relevant Ministers, but I cannot make decisions for the Conservative Council. I am listening and engaging with local residents on this but I cannot make alterations to these changes. If you have already provided your feedback to Wandsworth Council's consultation and/or emailed TfL, and you want to raise your concerns with other officials, you may also wish to contact Wandsworth Council's Transport spokesperson Councillor John Locker via email at [email protected], or the Government's Minister of State with responsibility for cycling and walking Chris Heaton-Harris MP via email at [email protected] |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Our art, food and history are what makes our community such a great place to live.\nToday, Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney, and Marsha de Cordova, MP for Battersea, and I have written to Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, to support Wandsworth’s bid to be London Borough of Culture 2025.

I’ve launched my Safe Space campaign, where local businesses can sign up to offer a place of safety.\nFor businesses that would like to sign-up, head to drrosena.co.uk/safespace\nOn Small Business Saturday, I’m at the local family-run business, Lark in Earlsfield, to showcase small businesses, who are the beating heart of our community.\nThis year, make sure you show our small businesses some love and buy local.\nIt was my pleasure to open the Quirky Dovetail Market. There was such a fantastic display of local arts and crafts on sale, which demonstrated the truly incredible talents that local people have to offer.\nSome businesses take their workplace mental health responsibilities very seriously. It was extremely insightful to talk to leaders of Talon, JCDecaux, Clear Channel Outdoor, Ocean Outdoor today, about what they’re doing to support employees’ mental health.\nTooting has so much to offer as a community and I was delighted to visit my friends in Tooting Market yesterday to talk about their businesses. From food to clothes to art, crafts and activities, there is a wonderful array of businesses in the market Next time you're in the area, make sure to pop in and sample the market's delights, whether you need freshly squeezed juice3 or freshly stitched jeans. To hear from the traders themselves (and to see me in a funky hat!). Today, Justin Madders MP and I met with the Retail trade union Usdaw and a group of retail workers in Westminster to talk about how the cost-of-living crisis, rising violence and abuse in stores, and the impact of Christmas holiday trade is affecting the mental health of customers and colleagues.\nFar too many people are facing this Christmas period worried about how to provide for their families. With so many Usdaw members having their mental health impacted as a result of the cost-of-living crisis and increased levels of abuse in the workplace, it is deeply important that we, as politicians, take the time to listen. Recently, I visited the fantastic team at Love Triangle, a brilliant pizza restaurant situated between Balham and Tooting Bec.\nThey’ve been selling pizza to the community for two and a half years now, but things are getting increasingly difficult. The cost-of-living crisis is hitting small businesses hard, with customers having less money to spend to things such as meals out, and the cost of energy and supplies rising astronomically. Will, who owns Love Triangle, told me that despite trying many different creative ways to stay afloat, things are only getting more difficult. Love Triangle have tried different opening times, and an array of different promotions and deals to help combat the challenges, but it is still far from easy, just to keep their head above water. The rising cost of food and energy, coupled with the reduction in disposable income for many is proving a difficult picture to navigate. Speaking to Will, and other business owners in our community, one message stands out. It is crucial to support local businesses where you can, or we risk losing more of our fantastic local businesses from Tooting, and across the country. Watch my visit to Love Triangle here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1599084624847642624?s=20&t=xq-atIy2mtAe0cDqI51dLw This week, we celebrated our fantastic women business owners in Tooting. Over the last two years, many women have felt a disproportionate economic hit. Women hold the key to supercharging our economy as we recover from the pandemic. Today I was delighted to welcome Anneliese Dodds MP to Tooting and meet with women business owners. I believe it is essential that we recognise the significant contribution women make and commit to tackling the challenges that they still face today. Also, we welcomed some of our community's many impressive business women and community leaders to Parliament. Tooting is home to so many - it's only right we back women in business. Lastly, a big thank you to Sir Keir Starmer MP for hosting. Today is Small Business Saturday and it is important to me to understand what it's like to run a local business, and the challenges and successes that people in our local community experience. So I rolled up my sleeves and got stuck into a shift at Tooting's famous flower stall with local legend Chris. Chris was absolutely wonderful! Thank you for teaching me a few things about the flower industry! I’m looking forward to learning more. Earlier this week I met with local small business owners to hear the issues affecting them.\nFrom the insufficient support available to businesses that are non-direct ratepayers, to a lack of flexibility from landlords regarding rental payments, it is clear that the challenges Tooting small business owners are experiencing are considerable. Their resilience in the face of adversity is a credit to our community. The concerns shared will inform my actions to ensure that small businesses remain the beating heart of Tooting. Please check back here for updates, and keep an eye on my Facebook and Twitter pages for announcements of further events. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

And finally, speaking to students South Thames College, I spoke about my role as Shadow Cabinet Minister for Mental Health, holding the Government to account for failure in Mental Health services across England. On polling day, I joined Labour Party candidates standing for council seats in Dover, Medway and Gravesham. Across the country, Labour won more than 600 local council seats in Stoke-on-Trent, Plymouth, Dover, Medway, and many other areas that we will need to win, if we are to form a Labour majority at the next General Election.\nTalking to voters in these seats, it's clear that people right across the country have turned their back on the Conservatives, looking to Labour to deal with the cost-of-living crisis, tackle NHS waiting lists, and improving safety in our communities. The road to Labour in Government runs through our local councils, and I am hopeful this local victory will be the springboard to Labour’s general election victory. Patients experiencing a mental health crisis often find themselves stuck in A&E.\nThe Health Secretary should be ashamed. Today, I asked the Health Secretary when will he finally get his act together and back Labour's plans to recruit thousands of additional staff to bring down waiting times? See my question here It was fantastic to be out in the gorgeous Peak District to support my friend and High Peak's next Labour MP, Jon Pearce. We first visited the Glossop Arts Project to see the amazing work they do, using art to support young people's mental health - of course, we had to indulge in the offer of a free toastie and cuppa too!\nOn the doorstep afterwards, we spoke to so many people fed up with the Tories, both locally and in Westminster. There are council elections coming up in May and Labour has every chance to take full control of the council here! The views were incredible, the people lovely, and I can't wait to be back! Today marks World Bipolar Day, which raises awareness and reduces the stigma surrounding bipolar disorder. One-in-fifty people in the UK live with bipolar disorder yet many struggle to access the services they need to get a proper diagnosis. Living with bipolar disorder can have a devastating impact on the people struggling with the illness as well as an impact on their loved ones, which is why it is vital that people are able to get a diagnosis early. We need a Government that will get serious on bipolar disorder. Labour will put prevention and early intervention at the forefront of our approach to mental health. The next Labour Government will recruit 8,500 new staff to ensure mental health treatment within a month for all who need it.\nBaroness Casey's independent findings of racist, misogynistic, and homophobic abuses of power within the Met Police are deeply shocking and will leave many residents in Tooting concerned that the trust between the police and our community has been shattered.\nIt is clear that there is a failure of leadership from the Home Office and today's report lays bare the scale of the challenge needed to reform the Met Police. The rot runs right through the force, so no stone can be left unturned in the push for change. I welcome the work that Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has already begun with the new Commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, in addressing these deep-rooted issues and regaining the trust of residents and victims of crime in Tooting. However, under this Home Secretary and this Conservative Government, the Met Police are lacking the leadership, ambition and resources needed to grasp the scale of this challenge. Over the last 13 years, neighbourhood policing has been decimated, whilst prosecutions for violent and sexual crimes have hit the lowest levels on record, and victims of crime are now unsure that if they report a crime, the police will even turn up. It is clear we need a Government with a plan to overhaul policing in London which will deliver cultural and systematic change. Under a Labour Government, we will overhaul policing and raise standards, with strengthened training and mandatory vetting, and the restoration of neighbourhood policing. I would like to thank our hardworking neighbourhood police officers who have always worked constructively with me and for their continuing efforts to keep our local community safe. On Eating Disorder Awareness Week, I spoke a debate in Westminster Hall on challenging the stereotypes and assumptions around eating disorders. Across the UK, there are as many as 1.25 million people living with an eating disorder. Eating disorders have considerably high mortality rates, with anorexia claiming the most lives of any mental illness. Yet, with timely and appropriate treatment, people can go on to live healthy and fulfilling lives. We need a Government that will get serious on mental health and eating disorders. Labour will put prevention and early intervention at the forefront of our approach to mental health. We will place a mental health specialist in every school and place an open access hub for young people in every single community. Our latest research, shows that in 2021/22, the total number of days lost to poor mental health has doubled to more than 730,000 over the last decade. This comes at the same time that there has been a drop in the number of neighbourhood police officers by 6,000 and of Police Community Support Officers by 8,500.\nThese absences equate to over 2,000 police officers being off sick each day, last year alone, due to poor mental health. It is clear that this Conservative Government has presided over 13 years of neglect and staff shortages that have left our public services at breaking point. The next Labour Government will recruit 8,500 more mental health professionals, ensuring a million more patients get treated each year; and we will rebuild neighbourhood policing, delivering a package of 13,000 extra neighbourhood officers and PCSOs, putting police back on the beat. Read the full story here Our exclusive data reveals that children in a mental health crisis spent more than 900,000 hours in A&E in England, last year. The total delays across England, in the past year alone, equate to 103 years of waiting time. This is a huge rise, up four-fold in the last decade.\nThe figures, made public through Freedom of Information requests, show the staggering number of hours that children have spent in a mental health crisis in Emergency Departments. With nowhere to turn, children with a mental illness are left to deteriorate – at which time A&E is the only place left for them to go. Emergency Departments are incredibly unsuitable settings for children in crisis, yet we’re witnessing increasingly younger children having to present to A&E in desperation. The next Labour Government will prioritise a truly preventative plan for mental health services and will put patient care first. We will ensure access to mental health professionals in every school and put an open access hub in every community, in addition to guaranteeing mental health treatment within a month for all who need it, by recruiting 8,500 new mental health staff to treat a million additional patients a year by Labour’s first term in office., funded by closing tax loopholes.

Pleasure to invite local residents to share a cuppa and hear about their local issues. Thanks to local organisations and the police for coming along and listening to residents.\nToday, I brought together officials from Wandsworth Council and Wandsworth Police to discuss what we can do to make Tooting Broadway a safer, cleaner and more vibrant place to live and work.\nTonight, I joined with representatives of all faiths and none at the BATCA annual peace ceremony in Tooting.\nThank you to everyone for their prayers of peace. They are needed now more than ever and I am so proud to represent such a wonderful, caring community.\nToday, I read out the names of the fallen and laid a wreath at St Nicholas Church in Tooting with local councillors, Rex Osborn, Kate Forbes and Kemi Akinola and members of our emergency services.\nI am very pleased to see that Labour-run Wandsworth Council will be introducing a landlord licensing pilot scheme in Tooting and Furzedown. Private renters make up a significant proportion of local residents and a key part of our campaign in the local elections last year was to ensure that they get a fair deal.\nThis scheme will strengthen protections and rights for private tenants and I look forward to its successful trial in Tooting before a wider roll-out across the borough.\nIt was wonderful to host a coffee morning for local residents today at Tooting United Reform Church. It was brilliant to welcome residents from Tooting and Furzedown. I am really grateful to everyone who attended, including some local organisations and charities who do invaluable work in the community. Tonight, I held a peace vigil at Tooting Broadway station to bring our community together to remember all those who have died in Israel and Gaza recently. I want to pay a huge thanks to the representatives from our local religious groups who said a prayer for peace.\nDuring some of our darkest hours, Tooting reminds us that there is always hope.\nTonight, I invited Wandsworth Police to join our community to discuss how they’re working with Wandsworth Council to tackle violence against women and girls.\nMaking our community safe is a key priority for me. My door is always open. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch.\nIn recent weeks, thousands of people across south London and south-east England have signed my petition calling on NHS England to keep children's cancer services at St George's Hospital, including many parents who have told me how worried they are about this proposed closure.\nLast week, NHS England launched its consultation on the future of services at St George’s Hospital and I want to make sure that we have every chance to defend and protect our local services. Keeping services at St George's is best for our patients and best for the NHS, but this can only happen with the support of people in the community who will be affected by this decision. Please spare a few minutes to complete to consultation questionnaire and share your views with the NHS. The consultation is running until Monday 18 December. See full details of the consultation here and please share this as widely as possible with friends and family here.\nThis morning, I've been out and about in Tooting with Wandsworth Police Officers. We've been talking to residents who are concerned about rising street drinking and anti-social behaviour.\nTogether we're now working to increase the number of patrols in the area and ensure that resident's concerns are being addressed. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Share is a registered charity with a site in Tooting providing support to adults with learning disabilities and/or autism. Their befriending project matches people with similar interests to go for walks, bike rides, or coffee. Befriending is incredibly rewarding, providing companionship to those who are socially isolated and regular contact with a friendly face outside their usual circle. I am told that reliability and being a good listener are the only prerequisites to be a volunteer befriender. If this sounds like you, Share would love to hear from you! Click here to find out more. Here in South West London, over half a million residents have received their first vaccine dose so far! Although this is a pivotal milestone, the percentage of vaccinated persons still remains lower among all ethnic minority groups compared with the White British population. I recognise that many within the BAME community may be unfamiliar with vaccines and feel unsure. However, I can assure you that the vaccines have all been rigorously tested and declared safe by doctors around the world. I continue to urge everyone eligible to book their vaccine appointment as soon as possible. The sooner the vaccine is rolled out, the sooner we can begin to rebuild. Together we can do this. It was a pleasure to join Basildon Councillor Gavin Callaghan as well as local Basildon organisations to talk about mental health this week. Coronavirus has had a profound impact on our mental health support services and it is always great to see a local authority listen to and work with local organisations on the front line providing help where it is most needed. We need to take inspiration from Basildon Council and create an environment at a national level where community organisations and peer support groups work in tandem with local authorities and local health services. A huge thank you to Kim Bailey of Purple Genie Life Coaching, Karen Pullen of Craig Tyler Trust, Jonathan Barrow of Sociability, and Alison Cunningham of The Listening Post, for taking part. For those unaware, latest Government guidance states that those with a serious mental health illness are now eligible to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.\nSerious mental health illnesses include those such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. However, this list is not exhaustive and anyone who is severely affected by a mental health problem is encouraged to contact their GP if they have not yet been invited to receive the vaccine. If you are a carer for a person with a severe mental illness, you could also be eligible. Click here for more information on eligibility or contact your GP. If you are eligible, to book or manage an existing vaccination appointment, click here. The inability to afford everyday hygiene and personal grooming essentials is sadly a growing problem. With people and families hit hard by the ongoing pandemic, hygiene poverty is a bigger problem than ever before - many are struggling to afford essential products like soap, shampoo, toothpaste, period products, and hand sanitiser. Here in Wandsworth, a new hygiene bank has opened to tackle this growing problem and alleviate the issue of hygiene poverty in our local area. As a volunteer-run project, all the money raised by the hygiene bank goes directly towards providing much-needed essentials for local residents, with all donated products distributed to local frontline organisations in the borough. To find out more about the Hygiene Bank Wandsworth, or to make a donation, see here. The end of 2020 brought the news that we’d been waiting for - the first vaccine was approved for use in the UK. I’m hugely grateful to all the scientists who have made this happen. Around the world they’ve been working non-stop – just like our frontline healthcare professionals and key workers - to put a stop to this virus and allow us to get on with life as normal. Now another milestone in the vaccination programme is happening on our doorstep. St George’s is one of four sites participating in a new study to assess the safety and immune response of the Oxford-AstraZenaca jab in healthy children aged 6-17 years old. Building on previous trials of the vaccine, which have shown that it is safe, produces strong immune system responses, and has high efficacy in all adults, this trial will assess if children and young adults make a good immune response with the vaccine. I recognise that some have concerns about the vaccine, and dangerous myths circulate on social media – it’s simply not good enough to just ignore them and hope they go away. Labour has offered to work with ministers to tackle online harms. And we can all play our part in putting friends and family members at ease by reminding them that we can trust the NHS to take care of us in these difficult times. If the vaccine is good enough for scientists and the regulator, it’s good enough for my family and I. Indeed, I have joined together with a cross-party group of MPs, encouraging everyone to take up the vaccine. The video can be viewed here. We won’t see changes overnight and we still need to look out for our communities. Let's regain the spirit of coming together like we did in the first days of the pandemic and work to eradicate this virus. As you will know, a South African variant of Covid-19 has arrived in the UK. This new Covid variant has now been detected in CR4 (Merton). Residents in CR4 are no different to us in neighbouring Tooting (SW16 and SW17). We use the same shops, the same hospital, and the same parks, so if it’s there, it could very easily be here. This will be the same across all affected areas. As a matter of urgency, the Government needs to launch widespread testing in neighbouring postcodes. This is the only way to see how widespread these new variants are. I have written to the Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock MP, the Director of Public Health at Wandsworth Council, Shannon Katiyo, and the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Council, Paul Martin, to ask about plans to launch testing in neighbouring postcodes. While I press for action on this, we need to make sure we’re all doing everything we can to keep ourselves and each other safe. It’s absolutely vital that we minimise our social contact to prevent the spread of this new variant within our community. Please think twice before leaving home, and when you do leave, please continue to adhere to social distancing. Together, we will get through this. With the Officer for National Statistics estimating that 1 in 30 Londoners now have coronavirus, and the Mayor of London declaring a major incident across all London hospitals, the ongoing situation could not be more serious. NHS services in the capital are at risk of becoming overwhelmed in just a matter of days.\nWorking as a doctor in St George’s A&E department, I understand how emotionally drained healthcare workers are feeling. Indeed, ‘overwhelmed’ was the word used by nurses, consultants and registrars at our local hospital in Tooting when they were interviewed for a special report by the BBC, with one senior staff nurse saying she has “never felt so demoralised in her life.” The report conducted by BBC London's Political Correspondent, Karl Mercer, showed the heartbreaking situation in high dependency units at St George’s. The hospital has now had to increase intensive care capacity from 60 to 120, the vast majority of which are for coronavirus patients. Wandsworth alone recorded a further 2394 cases this week – the 13th highest in London. Whilst better times are on the horizon with the recent announcement of the approved Moderna vaccine, I can only implore residents to continue to follow latest public health advice on the virus to ensure we can protect as many lives as possible. On behalf of all my colleagues working on the frontline, please stay at home. The ongoing pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we live our lives, and it is understandable that this will have an impact on our mental health.\nAs we enter a national lockdown, it is vital that we all take care of our mental health. There are many brilliant services available to offer advice and support, and there is never any shame in asking for help. If you are facing a mental health crisis, you can call the Samaritans on 116 123, any time, day or night. If you are not comfortable speaking over the phone, you can also text SHOUT to 85258. They also have an advice page offering tips on how to take care of your mental health during the pandemic. If you are aged between 13-25, you can call The Mix on 0808 808 4994, with any question. They will connect you with experts and peers who will give you the support and advice you need. You can also phone Childline on 0800 1111, or speak directly to a counsellor here. For the LGBT+ community, you can call Switchboard on 0300 330 0630 or email [email protected]. All phone operators identify as LGBT+. Stonewall are also available on 08000 50 2020 for advice on a range of issues. If you are facing domestic abuse, you can call Refuge on 0808 2000 247, or access their online chat feature here. Women’s Aid live chat feature is also open here. Both of these websites have an option to quickly exit their sites and wipe them from your browser history. The latest NHS data shows that from July to September this year the number of urgent referrals for children and young people suffering with eating disorders has almost doubled from the same period in 2019.\nOn 9 December, Alex Norris MP and I spoke with Dr Agnes Ayton, Chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists Eating Disorder Faculty, mental health campaigner Hope Virgo, the Centre for Mental Health, Beat and Young Minds UK to discuss eating disorders and explore ways to alleviate them. We urgently need a public mental health strategy which supports people with eating disorders. Christmas can be an especially difficult period, and it is vital that we remain sensitive to the fact that the focus on food and indulgence can cause individuals suffering with eating disorders real distress. Young people struggling with their mental health need urgent support. Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government for it. I look forward to the New Year, where I will be looking to engage further with the sector as well as individuals with lived experience of eating disorders. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

For so many local residents this is a vital service. The closure would cause real difficulties for people accessing their local GP. Many local residents already have to wait weeks for a GP appointment and waiting lists for treatment are at record highs. This closure is a result of 13 years of government underfunding of our NHS. The local Integrated Care Board for South West London has been forced into making huge cuts to their budget and the impact of these cuts is now being felt by our community. In recent weeks, I've been contacted by numerous local residents extremely concerned about the impact of this closure. That's why I am urging the Health Secretary to intervene, listen to patients and staff alike, and keep a GP surgery open at Trinity Medical Centre.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_mental-health_4/content_629.html": "|\nFor Children's Mental Health Week, I've written for LabourList about Labour's bold, transformative plan to deliver mental health care for children and young people. With children waiting days in A&E in a mental health crisis and more than one million people being turned away from mental health services without being seen, it is vital that we transform care by putting prevention at the heart of our plan.\nThis Government should not cut corners when it comes to young people’s mental health. Good mental health starts in childhood. Labour’s vision for future generations is one where mental health conditions are treated early. Adverse childhood experiences are the greatest driver of mental illness in adulthood – it’s just common sense to get mental health treatment right for young people in order to transform the future of the country’s mental health. The next Labour Government will ensure access to a mental health professional in every school, and we will put an open access mental health hub in every community. Every child should have the ability to raise concerns about their mental health with someone they trust, in an environment in which they feel safe. All of this will be funded by ending tax breaks for private schools. Read my full article here Today, the Committee's Report on the Draft Mental Health Bill has been published - this is a once in a generation opportunity to improve the rights of patients experiencing a mental health crisis and to tackle the health inequalities enshrined in current legislation.\nOver the last six months, I've been proud to work with my committee colleagues, listening to patient voices and evidence from experts. We heard heartbreaking accounts from patients. Above all else, the legislation has to protect them and ensure they receiving appropriate care. For years, the Government kicked updating this legislation into the long grass, and now, the current draft bill still does not go far enough to tackle the racial disparity of those detained under the Mental Health Act. Patient voices must be at the heart of this legislation. Read the full report here: https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt5803/jtselect/jtmentalhealth/696/report.html Today, Justin Madders MP and I met with the Retail trade union Usdaw and a group of retail workers in Westminster to talk about how the cost-of-living crisis, rising violence and abuse in stores, and the impact of Christmas holiday trade is affecting the mental health of customers and colleagues.\nFar too many people are facing this Christmas period worried about how to provide for their families. With so many Usdaw members having their mental health impacted as a result of the cost-of-living crisis and increased levels of abuse in the workplace, it is deeply important that we, as politicians, take the time to listen. An undercover joint investigation by Sky News and The Independent has raised serious concerns about the safety of patients at inpatient settings ran by the Huntercombe Group.\nThis is the third investigation into abuse in secure inpatient mental health settings, in four weeks. The system is broken. I previously wrote to Therese Coffey, the previous Health Secretary, to raise my concerns about other similar investigations highlighting allegations of abuse, by Channel 4 Dispatches and BBC Panorama, but did not receive a response. The Government has been silent over these allegations and for weeks there wasn’t even a functioning Mental Health Minister. Patients, and their families, deserve answers. They deserve dignity, respect and access to high quality treatment, which is why I have called for a rapid review into mental health services and the way patients are treated in inpatient settings. See my statement in Parliament here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1587420289662492672?s=20&t=Gj2YhL3GB3Os4nSrRoGK7Q There is a crisis in our universities up and down the country, with record numbers of students now seeking mental health support, according to our latest research. Through Freedom of Information requests, we found that over 200,000 students sought support for their mental health across the UK in 2020-2021 – a threefold increase, since 2010. The lack of mental health support for our young people is not only affecting their health, but it also having a knock-on impact on their future prospects.\nUniversities are struggling to cope with the rising demand for access to the mental health treatment students need. Every five days, a student takes their own life. That is why Labour has put forward a comprehensive plan, that will put prevention of the heart of mental health services. Under Labour’s plan, we will recruit 8,500 new mental health professionals by the end of our first term in office, to see an addition one million patients per year. See more about the crisis in mental health at universities, here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1579388728153604098?s=20&t=CcG6Wxm1iHr6xo0Cfsjyww Parents arriving in A&E with ashen faces holding their children, whose bodies are skeletal and covered in cuts. Families are on suicide watch. Frontline NHS workers are at breaking point. This is the reality of Tory Britain in 2022.\nOur latest research has shown that more than a million patients referred to mental health services were turned away over the last 12 months, whilst the cost of mental illness to the British economy is £117 billion a year. This is the direct result of 12 years of Conservative mismanagement of our economy and public services. We need a growing economy to pay for modern, preventative sustainable healthcare, but we can only do this with a Labour Government that will put our public services back on track. The next Labour Government will transform our mental health services: new staff, new services, faster treatment, and prevention as our watchword. Better mental health for all. Read my latest piece in the Daily Mirror here. https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1579113927438663681?s=20&t=FTZA6bYs6BUjLJ-vVYAmzg Labour will revolutionise mental health treatment – putting prevention front and centre.\nIf ever there was an argument that prevention is better than cure, it is with mental health. We know that the longer mental illnesses are left untreated, the harder and more costly they are to treat. This mental health crisis is wrecking the British economy. Last year, 18 million work days were lost to mental illness - more than industrial disputes, more than injuries. It costs the UK economy at least £117 billion a year. And who does the cost-of-living crisis hit the hardest? Those already living with mental illnesses. The next Labour Government will guarantee treatment within a month, recruit 8,500 new staff, put a specialist in every school and a hub in every community. Labour will transform our mental health services: New staff. New services. Faster treatment. Prevention as our watchword. Better mental health for all. Watch my full speech here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1575177559943581696?s=20&t=wn3hxvRyskYM3JmyFl3dlg It was great to visit Mount Carmel Rehabilitation centre again recently. I’ve enjoyed working with this fantastic organisation over the last few years. Mount Carmel offers residential and day programmes to people struggling with addictions. Their Counsellors provide a series of programmes, including a range of talking therapy groups, art therapy and equine therapy, to help people overcome their addiction issues. The pandemic has left Mount Carmel more stretched than ever, with many people seeking help after relapsing or struggling with new addiction problems during the lockdowns. Despite the increased demand, the team at Mount Carmel continue to provide first class care to all their clients. I look forward to continuing to work with the team at Mount Carmel, and seeing all that they go on to achieve. If you would like to support the work they do in our community, you can donate to their Just Giving page below It was a privilege to speak at the 13th Annual Black Mental Health Conference, hosted by Wandsworth Community Empowerment Network. As a society, we have to understand the role cultural contact and intersecting identities play when working to support those struggling with their mental health. And we must continue to push back against stigma and foster an open and honest dialogue around mental health in our communities. Thank you for having me. On Monday 6 September, I’ll be live on Riverside Radio diving into why mental health matters and, perhaps most importantly, all your mental health matters. The last 18 months have been incredibly challenging for so many of us and have highlighted the importance of mental health care. We need true parity of esteem between physical and mental health. One step we can take towards reducing any stigma is by being open in our conversations around mental health. Join me for an honest, straight-talking hour, 6-7pm next Monday! And if you have any questions about mental health that you want to ask on air, please email [email protected]. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

The Scheme helps schools install heat pumps, solar panels and other technologies to assist with schools hitting environmental targets.\nSustainability and green initiatives are absolutely vital in tackling climate change, and I am very pleased that local schools have been selected to help lead the way. With the ceasefire in Gaza in tatters, the devastation and human suffering there will only continue. In Parliament, I pushed the Foreign Secretary, David Lammy MP, to confirm whether his department holds any evidence that international law has been violated. I joined Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper MP at St George's Hospital to see the impact of their new knife amnesty bin.\nSince December, 47 weapons have already been handed in. It is great to see so many dangerous weapons being taken off our streets. Over the past months, I have heard from many local people who have been experiencing shocking delays to their post. Today, I went down to the local sorting office to meet with Royal Mail directors and pushed them to urgently rectify this issue. I am pleased to say that they have agreed to turn it around in 4 weeks. If you've been affected, please share your experience here: http://drrosena.co.uk/postdelays During these troubling times, we have never needed our EU friends and allies more.\nTogether, we can face down the threat of Putin and stand united to protect democracy. This week, I was in Brussels meeting MEPs to learn how we can work together in our shared defence interests. Today marks the fifth anniversary of the World Health Organisation declaring COVID-19 a pandemic. Our lives would change monumentally in the weeks and months that followed and, sadly, many of us would lose loved ones. Now is the time to remember all who lost their lives and celebrate the NHS heroes who did everything they could. The Environment Agency has provided another update following the weekend's work on the River Wandle to clean up last week's oil spill.\nI am pleased to hear that the majority of the pollution appears to have been cleared. The specialist contractors managing the clean-up report that the river is looking much better today, with very little visible oil sheen remaining and no further oil being washed from vegetation along the riverbanks. The Environment Agency tells me that, due to the swift response of multiple agencies, including the emergency services, local authorities, and charities, the impact on the environment around the Wandle appears to be minimal. Thankfully, the number of affected wildlife remains low. The few wild birds that have been impacted are being cared for by the RSPCA. No fish mortalities have been reported, and the fish populations in the Wandle appear to remain healthy. Investigations into this incident are ongoing, and options for enforcement are being considered by the Environment Agency and its partners. People are still urged to be cautious and keep pets away from the water and angling is not recommended for the time being. If you see any further signs of diesel around the Wandle, please contact the Environment Agency on its 24/7 incident number: 0800 807060 or via email at [email protected]. The Environment Agency continue to keep me updated about the recent oil spill into the River Wandle. The Environment Agency, along with emergency services, Thames Water, the RSPB, and local authorities, are actively working on containment and clean-up efforts.\nKey Points:\nMy office will continue to monitor the situation and I will provide any updates as they come in. Yesterday, I became aware that an incident had occurred on the River Wandle where diesel oil had spilled from a bus depot in Thornton Heath into the river.\nThe Wandle is a vital ecosystem, and is home to a range of wildbirds, fish, frogs and toads. It is critical to protect this pocket of wildlife and to ensure the progress made in bringing the river back to life is not allowed to slide backwards. I have been in contact with the Environment Agency who tell me that they are working to assess the impact of the oil on water quality and wildlife along the course of the river, as well as putting in place plans to extract the oil from the river. This remedial work will continue over the coming days. The Environment Agency advises local residents to report any oil spotted in the river to the Environment Agency's emergency hotline by phone 0800 807060 or email [email protected] Today, in Parliament, I launched the All Party Parliamentary Group on Emergency Care. As a doctor at the A&E in St George's, I know my colleagues up and down the country work tirelessly to provide the highest standards of care for their patients in some of the most difficult of circumstances.\nOur group of Parliamentarians is committed to fighting to improve emergency care at every level. We will be hearing from experts, publishing reports and making sure that the importance of emergency care is highlighted in Government policy. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_previous_35/content_735.html": "|\nThroughout the ongoing pandemic I have been inundated with emails from parents, school staff, students, and residents alike who have taken the time to outline their views on school closures. Some are concerned about safety, with many teachers and students facing the very real and grave possibility of bringing the virus home to vulnerable family members. Some are concerned about the impact a further lockdown could have on children's wellbeing and their education. And some are concerned about the challenges school closures will cause for working families.\nAs I am sure you will agree, the current situation is incredibly serious. This virus is spreading exponentially across the country, many people are in hospital, and too many people are tragically losing their loved ones. We know how difficult another lockdown will be, but I believe that national measures are necessary. As the Shadow Minister for Mental Health and a working mother, it is safe to say the impact of extended school closures on children’s well-being and working families cannot be overstated. This is why Labour called on Government to do everything possible to avoid it. Boris Johnson must immediately set out clear plans for every child to return safely to school as soon as possible - and be honest with parents about the timetable for this. It is also critical that young people’s education is safeguarded throughout this period of remote learning, and every student must have access to the devices they need to learn. Schools and families can request free mobile data increases for students without broadband or who cannot afford extra data for devices. More information on this scheme can be found here: get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/about-increasing-mobile-data. It is vital the Government prevent disadvantaged families being priced out of education. As many families will agree, working parents face huge challenges in balancing work, childcare, and supporting their child’s education. They must have the support they need to do this. Nobody should have to choose between their job and supporting their children, so the Government - and employers - must clearly promote the use of the job retention scheme for those unable to work due to family commitments. Please rest assured that myself and Labour Party colleagues will continue to hold the Government to account on these issues as we all navigate the ongoing pandemic. Stay safe, Rosena. With the Officer for National Statistics estimating that 1 in 30 Londoners now have coronavirus, and the Mayor of London declaring a major incident across all London hospitals, the ongoing situation could not be more serious. NHS services in the capital are at risk of becoming overwhelmed in just a matter of days.\nWorking as a doctor in St George’s A&E department, I understand how emotionally drained healthcare workers are feeling. Indeed, ‘overwhelmed’ was the word used by nurses, consultants and registrars at our local hospital in Tooting when they were interviewed for a special report by the BBC, with one senior staff nurse saying she has “never felt so demoralised in her life.” The report conducted by BBC London's Political Correspondent, Karl Mercer, showed the heartbreaking situation in high dependency units at St George’s. The hospital has now had to increase intensive care capacity from 60 to 120, the vast majority of which are for coronavirus patients. Wandsworth alone recorded a further 2394 cases this week – the 13th highest in London. Whilst better times are on the horizon with the recent announcement of the approved Moderna vaccine, I can only implore residents to continue to follow latest public health advice on the virus to ensure we can protect as many lives as possible. On behalf of all my colleagues working on the frontline, please stay at home. The ongoing pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we live our lives, and it is understandable that this will have an impact on our mental health.\nAs we enter a national lockdown, it is vital that we all take care of our mental health. There are many brilliant services available to offer advice and support, and there is never any shame in asking for help. If you are facing a mental health crisis, you can call the Samaritans on 116 123, any time, day or night. If you are not comfortable speaking over the phone, you can also text SHOUT to 85258. They also have an advice page offering tips on how to take care of your mental health during the pandemic. If you are aged between 13-25, you can call The Mix on 0808 808 4994, with any question. They will connect you with experts and peers who will give you the support and advice you need. You can also phone Childline on 0800 1111, or speak directly to a counsellor here. For the LGBT+ community, you can call Switchboard on 0300 330 0630 or email [email protected]. All phone operators identify as LGBT+. Stonewall are also available on 08000 50 2020 for advice on a range of issues. If you are facing domestic abuse, you can call Refuge on 0808 2000 247, or access their online chat feature here. Women’s Aid live chat feature is also open here. Both of these websites have an option to quickly exit their sites and wipe them from your browser history. I am aware that many local residents are concerned about the proposed Tooting Triangle development. Plans to upgrade the site’s facilities and amenities – replacing the artificial football pitch with a modern surface, and building new changing rooms, public toilets, a children’s play area, and a café – are welcome. However, the proposal to fund the improvements via a 25-year lease of the new facilities to TFL Leisure – a private company – is more controversial.\nThe fence set to be constructed around the new football pitch, and the lack of clarity as to whether the upgraded children’s Stay & Play facility will remain free to use, have prompted concerns that the development will put public land behind a literal paywall. I am sure you will agree that if the recent lockdowns have taught us anything, it is that there is a need for more publicly accessible green spaces – not less. As it stands, the proposed development would see a reduction in the area available to the Balham Boxing Club compared with their current provision. Issues have also been raised regarding the smaller size of the female changing rooms compared to the men's, and the impact floodlighting could have on the Triangle’s resident bat population, among other things. I understand that discussions on the proposed development are ongoing. Please be assured that I am keeping a close eye on this evolving situation - we all want what's best for our local community. I have written to the Housing Secretary to outline residents concerns about EWS1 forms and cladding. The latest NHS data shows that from July to September this year the number of urgent referrals for children and young people suffering with eating disorders has almost doubled from the same period in 2019.\nOn 9 December, Alex Norris MP and I spoke with Dr Agnes Ayton, Chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists Eating Disorder Faculty, mental health campaigner Hope Virgo, the Centre for Mental Health, Beat and Young Minds UK to discuss eating disorders and explore ways to alleviate them. We urgently need a public mental health strategy which supports people with eating disorders. Christmas can be an especially difficult period, and it is vital that we remain sensitive to the fact that the focus on food and indulgence can cause individuals suffering with eating disorders real distress. Young people struggling with their mental health need urgent support. Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government for it. I look forward to the New Year, where I will be looking to engage further with the sector as well as individuals with lived experience of eating disorders.\nA number of local residents have reached out to ask me why my name was not included in a letter signed by 61 out of 650 MPs about the very concerning deportation flight to Jamaica. I wanted to explain how the process works.\nFirstly, let me say that this was an incredibly serious matter, which is why I was pleased to see my colleague, Holly Lynch MP, the Shadow Immigration Minister, send an urgent letter to the Government raising concerns. I added my voice to her letter by writing to Priti Patel myself - requesting that the points Holly Lynch raised were answered urgently. A copy of that letter is below:\nAs a member of the Labour Shadow Cabinet, my role is to intervene in matters related to mental health (because I am the Shadow Minister for Mental Health). Members of the Shadow Cabinet do not speak in debates, sign letters, sign EDMs or intervene in matters which are not related to their role. This rule has been in place for as long as I know, it was the same when Jeremy Corbyn was leader.\nI have noticed that my name was put on a list along with 12 colleagues, suggesting we were the only people not to sign this letter. No member of the Labour Shadow Cabinet signed the letter, indeed, almost three quarters of Labour MPs didn't sign the letter. Does that mean that they don't care? No, of course not. Sometimes they miss the deadline to sign, sometimes they can't sign, sometimes they make representations in different ways. It's very disappointing that some would single out me and 12 other colleagues, suggesting we were the only ones not to sign - simply to fit their political agenda. My background has seen me work in war torn countries, disaster zones and refugee camps helping the world's most marginalised and vulnerable people. I always care deeply about these issues and to suggest otherwise is incorrect. I'll continue to liaise with my colleagues in the Home Affairs team with regards to this, and other important issues. The creation of EWS1 forms and concerns about cladding are issues I know a lot of Tooting residents are facing. Everyone deserves the safety and security of home and I am shocked that so many local residents have found themselves in this situation. Following discussions with local people, I have written to the Financial Conduct Authority, Aviva, the National Housing and Building Council and the Shadow Secretary of State for Housing. You can see these letters below. Today Wandsworth Council has announced that it is suspending the Low Traffic Neighbourhoods that it implemented across our community. Wandsworth Council failed from the start to communicate the implementation of LTNs to local residents, and instead of listening and reviewing they have now decided to pull them out because do not want the fuss.\nAs I have said before, I was not consulted and nor were local residents on these changes. They were brought in overnight and pitted neighbour against neighbour, causing fierce rows and division. The Council should be ashamed. When the going got tough, they tried to pass the buck, and now Wandsworth Council is wasting tens of thousands of pounds by scrapping the LTNs entirely. The Conservative Cabinet Member for Transport's position is untenable. Attention will now turn to the TfL Streetspace scheme on Upper Tooting Road, Balham High Road and Tooting High Street. I know that this is a scheme that has its issues and needs reviewing. However, I am confident that TfL want to make it work for our local environment. Contrast TfL's response with that of Wandsworth Council. TfL is taking feedback on board, they are hosting a virtual public meeting next week to gather feedback from local people and I am meeting with a TfL representative next week to discuss the scheme. I will be taking him to meet some of the affected businesses and discussing the issues emergency services have had. TfL evidently want the scheme to work and they deserve credit for trying. I have been clear from the start that I am supportive of schemes which encourage cycling and make our streets safer. We do that by engaging in polite and respectful discussion to bring about changes collectively. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_nhs-workers-battling-coronavirus-face-national-shortage-of-protective-clothing/content_398.html": "|\nNHS workers battling coronavirus are facing a “national shortage” of protective clothing, HuffPost UK has been told.Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan, a working doctor who still works shifts in A&E, said scientists had told her that there were not enough body suits in the right sizes, while some doctors were only now starting to receive protective clothing.\nIt came amid new official estimates suggesting 5,000 to 10,000 people in the UK have coronavirus, leaving many doctors, nurses and other health workers at risk of infection. Last month, the World Health Organisation also warned that there was a global shortage of protective masks and body suits. One NHS source who worked at a hospital where coronavirus patients were being treated told HuffPost UK: “There were staff forced to wear oversized suits because that’s all they had. “All we have left is XL. “There is a national shortage of suits but this was raised with the government at least three weeks ago so something should have been done.” Appearing on HuffPost UK’s Commons People podcast, Allin-Khan repeated the concerns. “I held a meeting today with some people from the scientific community and they said their concern was though they had been testing out various modes of protective clothing, it turns out that there is a lack of the clothing they need available, the sizes aren’t available,” she said. “Just yesterday - because people still contact me because I’m a doctor still, to let me know what’s going on - someone said they were a GP and had only started receiving the necessary protective clothing yesterday and this has been going on for a month now. The Labour deputy leadership candidate criticised the government for moving too slowly to tackle from coronavirus. In a departure from Labour’s broad support for the government, Allin-Khan called for tougher measures to tackle the outbreak, including testing those with symptoms for the virus as a matter of course. Allin-Khan said the government’s testing programme could be “more robust”, reporting that “friends in the NHS” said people were being given “really unclear messaging”. She gave an example of two people who returned from northern Italy who phoned NHS 111 and were told to wait for a call back which did not come for five days, during which time they self isolated. When they eventually spoke again to NHS staff, they had to give their details again and had to self-isolate for eight days before finally being tested for coronavirus. Test results are also taking three to five days to materialise. Allin-Khan said: “We need to be moving quicker, people need to have a better idea of how to access testing, what it means for their daily lives. “The messaging needs to be clearer and the testing needs to be more robust.” She added: “We should have moved into the delay phase sooner than now and I don’t think we should measure our performance compared to what other countries are doing. “I think we should be looking at what’s best for us and when you look at the fact that China had the same number of cases that we already have surpassed before implementing measures we do need to be listening to what the other scientific community, for example some eminent epidemiologists, listen to what they’re saying. “Because ultimately we can’t leave the scientific community to be scapegoated for the government making bad decisions if they are proven to be wrong.” Allin-Khan meanwhile sidestepped questions on whether she wants to be shadow health secretary under the next Labour leader. “I like to focus on one thing at a time, genuinely, and I don’t think you should ever have a plan B because that’s implying you’ve accepted that your plan A won’t work out,” she said. “So I am genuinely, steely focused on winning this deputy leadership bid.” Put to her that she would be a good fit for the job, she replied: “Well I am a practising NHS doctor and I have got a master’s degree in public health and I care about our party so that’s honestly for whoever is the leader to decide.” Comments are closed.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_earlsfield_3/content_606.html": "|\nThere was significant concern locally about Wandsworth Council’s decision to extend Controlled Parking Zone restrictions in areas of Earlsfield and Tooting from 9:30am to 9:30pm each day. Over 1400 local residents completed my consultation on the change. I am pleased that, following our pressure, Wandsworth Council have U-turned on their plans to extend CPZ restrictions. Instead, Event Day only restrictions are planned from 1 October - a far more sensible solution, and something which other councils with stadiums do. I received more than double the number of responses to Wandsworth Council’s rushed, ill-thought out consultation. In fact, over 93% of respondents were not happy with the council’s plans. This should never have happened. But I am pleased the Council finally listened and have U-turned on their attempt to rush through restrictions that would simply act as another cash-grab on hardworking local residents. It is so important that those living with sight loss in our community are supported when using public transport. That is why I recently wrote to South Western Rail and Southern Rail to enquire as to when warning tactile - a vital safety and accessibility tool for those travelling by train - will be installed at Earlsfield and Wandsworth Stations. I am happy to say that Southern Rail have now confirmed that warning tactile has been installed on surface platforms at Wandsworth Common Station. And, although tactile is yet to be installed at Earlsfield Station, South West Railway have stated that Network Rail is working hard to deliver these accessibility improvements. Rest assured I will continue to press for accessibility for local residents living with sight loss. Today Muslims across the UK and around the world mark the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan. As a proud Muslim, the period of reflection, prayer, and fasting is incredibly important to our Muslim community. Traditionally, Ramadan is a time for gathering and sharing Iftar with family and friends. Although, like last year, we are unable to come together and celebrate as we normally would, the spirit of Ramadan remains. To every Muslim nurse and doctor who have saved countless lives throughout this pandemic, to every volunteer and community leader in our Mosques and community centres who continue to support those most vulnerable, and to every Muslim in Tooting and across the country, I wish you all Ramadan Mubarak. As you will know, a South African variant of Covid-19 has arrived in the UK. This new Covid variant has now been detected in CR4 (Merton). Residents in CR4 are no different to us in neighbouring Tooting (SW16 and SW17). We use the same shops, the same hospital, and the same parks, so if it’s there, it could very easily be here. This will be the same across all affected areas. As a matter of urgency, the Government needs to launch widespread testing in neighbouring postcodes. This is the only way to see how widespread these new variants are. I have written to the Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock MP, the Director of Public Health at Wandsworth Council, Shannon Katiyo, and the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Council, Paul Martin, to ask about plans to launch testing in neighbouring postcodes. While I press for action on this, we need to make sure we’re all doing everything we can to keep ourselves and each other safe. It’s absolutely vital that we minimise our social contact to prevent the spread of this new variant within our community. Please think twice before leaving home, and when you do leave, please continue to adhere to social distancing. Together, we will get through this. In light of the upcoming Fire Safety Bill, I would to thank every resident who has written to me with their concerns on this and for continuing to keep me updated on the cladding issues affecting their property. I recognise what an exceptionally difficult time this is and appreciate how much anxiety the cladding proposals are causing to many leaseholders.\nOn more than fifteen occasions, Ministers promised that leaseholders would not be landed with the costs of remedial works. Yet, people are still being put at risk, trapped in flammable buildings for a third lockdown, with leaseholders placed in an impossible position and promises broken. It is evident that the Government’s handling of the cladding crisis has lacked any sense of grip or urgency. For this reason, the Labour Party have tabled an Opposition Day Debate on cladding for Monday, which will subsequently bring forward a vote that will call for leaseholders to be protected from the costs of remediating their blocks with dangerous cladding. The party will also be tabling a number of amendments to the Fire Safety Bill that will aim to protect leaseholders from unfair costs through the power of the law. I am aware that many residents have been in touch to request that I support the McPartland and Smith amendment, which provides welcome clarity on the specific costs that would be prevented from being passed on to leaseholders. Labour has sought to go further on this. As currently drafted, the McPartland and Smith amendment would not have covered blocks like Grenfell - where flammable cladding has been added at some stage following the building of the block. It only applies to defects in the original design of buildings. The Labour Party’s amendment would ensure that the cost of fire safety problems from refurbishment jobs, like the cladding on Grenfell Tower, cannot be passed on to leaseholders. Labour’s amendments also include new clauses so that the Bill protects leaseholders from the day it comes into law, instead of an unknown date in the future. I would like to thank my colleagues in the Labour Party, Sarah Jones MP, Nick Thomas-Symonds MP, Thangam Debbonaire MP and Mike Amesbury MP for their hard work and commitment to addressing this large injustice on a national scale. If any residents have any further queries on this issue, please do not hesitate to get in touch to discuss this further. In the meantime, I hope this post assures you of the steps myself and the Labour Party are taking to protect tenants and leaseholders during this cladding crisis. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_archives_01-2020/content_65.html": "Labour Campaign for International Development endorses Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan for Deputy Leader30/1/2020\nI am hugely proud and honoured to be nominated for Deputy Leader by the Labour Campaign for International Development.\nAs someone who has worked as an humanitarian doctor in conflict zones across the world, their progressive approach to international development and promotion of global justice is an inspiration. My priority will always be to put human rights and international solidarity at the core of everything I do. Human life should have equal value, no matter where someone comes from. These principles shouldn't just apply to our international development policies, they should be applied to everything we do as the Labour Party. I want to thank the Labour Campaign for International Development for their support and their endorsement. Let's take Labour forward, together. Thank you Doctor Rosena Brexit Might Be Done But The Fight Against Boris Johnson's Destruction Must ContinueAlthough the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback.\nWhen the UK leaves the EU this Friday, 31 January 2020, after 47 years of membership, it will be a sombre day for many of us. For others, it will be a day of celebration. For most people, I suspect they will simply hope we can now move on from talking about Brexit at the expense of everything else. As someone who campaigned with all my heart to stay in the EU, and as the first person on Labour’s front bench to publicly call for a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal, I am desperately sad to see us leaving our friends and allies in Europe. But we are leaving. The disastrous result of the General Election has settled that. This is no longer an argument about Leave or Remain, it’s about what kind of future we want for our country and for our children. That’s where the new fight begins. Boris Johnson wants to pretend he’s now “Got Brexit Done”, and we no longer need to worry about the details. He wants us to simply trust him to sort it all out. Well, I don’t trust him. Neither should you. He talks about “Global Britain” whilst turning his back on vulnerable child refugees. He talks about “Taking Back Control” while reducing parliament’s ability to scrutinise his decisions. He talks about attracting “Global Talent” to the UK while creating huge distress and uncertainty for EU citizens, many of whom have been here for years and who have made their lives in this country. The fight for our internationalist values starts now. It will be long, and it will be difficult, because Boris Johnson has a large majority – but that’s why it’s so important. When it feels like hope is lost, that’s when those of us who believe in progressive values and internationalism need to stand up and fight. If we don’t, no-one else is going to do it for us. We need to stand up and fight for our hard-won workers’ rights. We need to stand up and fight for our environmental protections. Most importantly, we need to stand up and fight for the rights of EU citizens living in this country. They are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues, our family. I work side-by-side with many of them in the NHS, when I work shifts as a doctor in my local A&E department. Under the draconian new immigration laws being bandied around by this government, my own Polish mother might not have been able to move to this country and make a life for herself. Although the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback. That’s one of the main reasons I am running to become the next Deputy Leader. We have huge organisational strength through our membership, through our links with the trade unions and through our MPs and councillors embedded in their local communities. Now is the time to deploy those strengths to maximum effect, to hold the Government to account and ensure that we fight back against every attempt to undercut our rights and freedoms at work, every attempt to weaken our environmental safeguards, every attempt to inject privatisation into our National Health Service. The slogan “Get Brexit Done” might have helped win the election for Boris Johnson, but for those of us who stand against his destructive vision for the future of our country, this fight isn’t done. It’s just getting started. My responses to the questions provided by the Labour Campaign for Free Movement 1. Defend and extend free movement: opposing any reduction in the freedoms of UK and EU citizens to live, work, and access social security in each others’ countries, and any immigration system based on incomes, migrants’ utility to business, and number caps or targets.I am the very embodiment of the benefits free movement has brought – my mother is Polish and was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Under the draconian new immigration policies being discussed by this Tory government, she might never have been able to do that. Protecting and extending free movement is at the very heart of my internationalist Labour principles. I believe our country is stronger and better because of free movement. When I work shifts as an A&E doctor in my local hospital, I work with NHS staff from across Europe and it breaks my heart to see many of them feeling unwanted or undervalued because of Brexit. As Deputy Leader, I pledge to do everything in my power to promote the core Labour values of internationalism and solidarity across borders, because I believe human life has the same value no matter where someone comes from. That means defending and extending free movement, and it means fighting to protect the human rights of migrants from this hostile Tory government. 2. Close every detention centreHolding migrants in detention centres, often in substandard conditions, is incredibly cruel and degrading. These are often vulnerable people, fleeing from a variety of horrific circumstances such as war, trafficking and poverty. They have the right to be treated with dignity, as human beings, as we would want ourselves or our family to be treated in such horrendous circumstances. When working abroad as a humanitarian doctor, I’ve seen first-hand some of the terrible conditions people are forced to endure in detention centres and it horrified me. We must fight back against the hostile environment the Tories have created for migrants – the Labour Party has always stood for international solidarity and openness to the world – we need a Labour government to bring those principles back into the core of our approach to immigration. I would want to listen to expert opinion on how to do this in a responsible way, but I certainly would want to close as many detention centres as possible and make sure we have an overall approach to immigration that means a concept as cruel as detention centres are not required in the first place. 3. Unconditional rights to family reunionYes, I fully support this. The unconditional right to family reunion is a fundamental element of treating migrants as human beings with dignity and equal value, rather than the Tory approach of seeing migrants as a problem to be managed. When I’ve worked as a humanitarian doctor in conflict zones across the world, it was always horrendous to see so many families ripped apart or prevented from seeing each other again. When I visited Palestine on a humanitarian mission, I saw sick children alone in hospital because the permit system meant their parents weren’t allowed to visit them. I immediately began working on ways to resolve this. It’s not enough to just talk about this – we need to be working every day to deliver a Labour government so we can fix these kinds of injustices. That’s what I’d do as Deputy Leader. 4. End “no recourse to public funds” policiesI support ending such policies, yes. This is another case of a Tory government treating migrants not as human beings with human dignity and equal value, but instead as a problem to be managed through cruelty. I want to deliver a Labour government with internationalism at its core, which would allow us to change our entire approach to migration, and begin seeing human life as equally valuable and equally dignified no matter where that person was born or where they’ve come from. 5. Oppose all Hostile Environment measures, use of landlords and public service providers as border guards, and restrictions on migrants’ NHS accessThe Tory Hostile Environment approach to immigration is a stain on the soul of their party, and they should be ashamed of it. Tragedies such as the Windrush scandal are a horrendous demonstration of where this approach leads, and I worry a similar scandal could occur with EU citizens who’ve made their lives in this country. I want a Labour government so we can end the Hostile Environment immediately and start treating migrants with the human dignity and respect they deserve. 6. Equal voting rights for all UK residents I am certainly interested in all ideas for how to revitalise our democracy and increase the level of engagement with our political process. Indeed, prior to the General Election in 2019, I publicly called for EU citizens to get the right to vote. Our Labour values of openness and internationalism must be at the core of everything we do. 7. Please share your thoughts on these wider issues that our supporters also feel strongly about:Even after Brexit, the UK government looks set to participate in Frontex (the European border agency) and its “Fortress Europe” policies. Will you challenge these policies? I certainly think the EU has often failed dismally to strike the right balance between border security and solidarity with people fleeing from war, poverty and the effects of global climate change. I am a proud pro-European, but that doesn’t mean my view of the EU is uncritical and I’ve never been afraid to say so. My values of international solidarity and openness don’t stop at the borders of Europe – they extend across the whole world. Human life always has equal value, no matter where that person comes from. Will you support an amnesty for undocumented migrants resident in the UK? We should always treat people with compassion and dignity, and we must place those values at the heart of everything we do when it comes to immigration. People in this country without documentation are often asylum seekers fleeing from horrific conditions and I want to see them treated with the human dignity they deserve. I would want to listen in more detail to expert opinion and feedback on the specific question of whether an amnesty is the right approach, but the principles of human dignity and compassion must always guide everything we do. Anything else you’d like Labour members, supporters and affiliates to know about what your leadership/deputy leadership would mean for migrants and migration policy? I am the living, breathing proof that free movement is a wonderful benefit to our country. My Polish mother was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Working on the frontlines of the NHS as an A&E doctor, I work alongside colleagues from across Europe and the rest of the world, and they are a credit to our country. It makes me proud to be British. But years of Tory government has created a literal Hostile Environment for migrants in this country. The drawbridge is being pulled up, and the rights of a whole generation of people to travel freely and live, love and work across Europe is being taken away. That is a tragedy, but it also means those of us who are proud of our outward-looking, progressive, internationalist values must fight even harder to protect and extend them. The fight starts now, and as your Deputy Leader (or even if I’m not!), I promise I will always be there fighting alongside you for those values with everything I’ve got. Nothing prepares you for seeing a colleague in tears over antisemitism.\nLabour deputy leadership hopeful, Rosena Allin-Khan, speaks about her heritage informing her fight against Jew-hate, and her commitment to mending ties with the community. “There is nothing that prepares you for seeing a colleague in tears,” says Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, one of five hopefuls standing for Labour’s deputy-leadership. Committed to winning back the trust of the community – and standing up for MPs such as Luciana Berger and Ruth Smeeth who are no longer in Westminster – Allin-Khan, currently the MP for Tooting, seems sincere in her battle against hate. She grew up as the daughter of immigrants – her father hailing from Pakistan, her mother from Poland, herself the descendent of resistance fighters killed by the Nazis. But she’s aware that hate and prejudice won’t be solved over a chat with tea and biscuits. Before her career in politics, she was a humanitarian doctor, working on the ground with Palestinians, while her mother’s family from Poland were killed by the Nazis. It’s these experiences which allow her to reconcile speaking out against Israeli policies, while committing herself to the fight against antisemitism, drawing praise from the community in carefully balancing these issues. The first of her pledges is to meet with the Jewish Labour Movement, should she get elected. It would be “essential to the restructuring” of relations, and “how we rebuild trust.” She is also keen on an education program, saying “people use antisemitic tropes and they don’t even realise what they’re doing and they repeatedly do so.” While indicating she would speak with “any group that was looking to acknowledge there was a problem, and work towards coming up with a solution to fix it” she adds that she is the “only deputy leader candidate who hasn’t nominated a leader”. She’s willing to “work with whomever the leader is” on rebuilding trust. Calling the demise in relations between the community and the party “sad” and “terrible”, she opens up about “people I know that I am very close to, who have been really brave and speaking out antisemitism in the party.” “They have received torrents of abuse and nothing’s been done about it”. “Any leader seeing something like this unfolding needs to be all over it”, she says. But was Corbyn’s team responsible? She says they were not the “cause of the antisemitic problem in Labour, I think they didn’t deal with the problem, well enough”. Yet, she’s under no illusions as to the extent of the problem, saying it must be tackled “from a grassroots membership level first and take it all the way to MPs themselves”. “The complaints process wasn’t dealt with properly”, Allin-Khan says, adding: “As people began to show antisemitic abuse .. the more they saw it wasn’t being dealt with the more they felt able to do so.” On mending ties, she wants an “independent” process for tackling complaints with “outstanding cases to be dealt with within a particular time”, and “automatic expulsion” for antisemitism, though she wouldn’t be drawn on whether she would intervene, like Tom Watson, who she is trying to succeed. Her drive to fight antisemitism is in part inspired by her heritage. “My mum’s Polish and I lost lots of family during the war. They were not Jewish, but they fought alongside Jewish friends and my great uncle died during that time, my grandma was pregnant in the Warsaw ghetto with my uncle.” “That whole experience is a very real part of my history, and it is a shared history that I understand deeply and I’m very saddened about with the Jewish community. She was embroiled in a dispute with the Israeli Deputy Ambassador in 2016, following a radio discussion about Palestinians’ access to medical aid. After revealing the two had met in person to discuss the issue, she was accused of being “bought by Zionists”, facing significant online abuse. Her response drew praise, with Dave Rich from the Community Security Trust saying it “illustrated the difference between pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist”. She says: “I am a doctor, and have been a humanitarian doctor for my whole professional life.” “It is possible, and fair, to identify areas where there could be improvement to somebody’s life and health and not to conflate that with a whole antisemitic issue. “ I will always be proud to stand up for people’s basic human rights, and I’m also very aware of my history and my shared history with the Jewish community. I feel it’s perfectly possible to manage the two.” Many former Labour voters feel unrepresented. That has to change\nThe Labour party has shaped who I am today. It has helped provide me with the opportunity to train as a doctor and has given me and my family life chances we otherwise would not have had. I want everyone to experience these opportunities. It deeply saddens me to see a lost generation for whom the door closed on their dreams and ambitions on 12 December. Growing up poor and cold while my single mum worked three jobs to support me and my brother taught me the reality of day-to-day life for many people in the UK. My mother always told me, even through our darkest moments, that there were people worse off than us – and I have never forgotten that. The Labour party changed my life. Despite failing my A-levels due to difficult circumstances at home, I was finally able to go to Cambridge University at the age of 24 to study medicine because of reforms the Labour party made in government. People did not know what we stood for – the Tories had three simple words Working on the A&E frontline has shown me the best and worst of society. A&E is a microcosm of real life. I hold parents as they say goodbye to their children who have died through senseless violence. I talk to nurses who tell me they can’t afford to feed their children and are having to use foodbanks. I treat older people who just want the dignity of accessing social care in their homes. But I also see hope. The UK is full of people pushing through barriers to serve their communities. Our NHS provided me with the skills to give back to society – it spurred me on to work as a humanitarian aid doctor in disaster zones across the world, something that I have been proud to continue during my time as an MP. I am proud of the internationalist views of the Labour party – we must never turn our backs on the world’s most vulnerable. On the border of Myanmar, it was shocking to listen to the stories of Rohingya refugees speaking of having to make the impossible decision of whether to save their child who was thrown alive on to a burning fire, or escape with their surviving child. We must not turn our backs on those who are living through the absolute worst of human atrocities. In Palestine, I was heartbroken to meet children who were undergoing cancer treatment utterly alone because their parents were unable to obtain permits to accompany them. Humanity should have no borders. Only with a Labour government can the UK have a truly outward, internationalist approach, ensuring that we are there for people in their times of greatest need. In order to be in government, we must get our house in order, and as deputy leader this would be my priority. We cannot look to champion equality abroad, while turning a blind eye to racism in our party. This needs to end. As deputy leader, my first major meeting would be with the Jewish Labour Movement – they are our official Jewish affiliate; we must listen. I want JLM to be at the forefront of this fight against antisemitism, especially when it comes to education at the grassroots level. I will separate the complaints process from HQ, making it independent and asking the new team to immediately review all cases, acting swiftly and expelling antisemites. There must also be a strict time limit by which cases need to be resolved. I commit to adopt every recommendation proposed by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, without hesitation. Enough is enough. Only then will we be able to start rebuilding trust. Communities across the country have turned away from Labour, thinking that we do not represent them. We must listen with humility to people across our country and across our movement to assess why we’ve lost the last four elections, and how we can win people back. From speaking to people in seats that we lost in December, I have been told that trust in us has gone. People did not know what we stood for – there appeared to be new policies announced every day and voters did not trust that we had a plan for how to deliver them. The Tories had three simple words. To win, we need to be able to communicate our messages, not just internally, but with the public. I will focus on grassroots campaigners being armed with the information and messaging that they need to talk to voters on the doorstep. I will equip candidates and their local Labour parties with the resources that they so desperately need. I will introduce reduced membership rates to our emergency service workers so they can have a say within Labour on the NHS at this vital time. We need to build our movement into one people can vote for. A party people can trust. Under this government, which has chosen to block child refugees from reunification with their families, I worry for the future of our children. I worry for the future of tolerance. I worry for the future of compassion. We have a wonderful society, which has welcomed so many people from across the world, but the hostile environment this government is imposing on our country is restricting the ability to hope. Hope for a brighter future. Hope for a tolerant society. The door may have closed on 12 December for a generation’s hopes and ambitions, but with the right leadership team in place in the Labour party, it will not be closed for good. We need to win the next general election, and we must start rebuilding trust ahead of local elections in May. As deputy leader, it will be my responsibility to rebuild trust, not just with the grassroots of our party, but with voters. Together, we can take Labour forward. As a doctor, I know that before a patient can be diagnosed, it is vital to first take a detailed history and examine them thoroughly. That’s the challenge we now face in revitalising the Labour Party and taking it off life-support. This is also why, when I decided to run for Deputy Leader, the first thing I did was contact every single Labour councillor I could find an email address for, as well as every single prospective parliamentary candidate who stood for Labour in the last General Election and lost.\nI’m not a leader-in-waiting, I’ll be a campaigner-in-chief, and you can be too. I’ve been travelling across the country, to seats where we won, seats where we lost, and even seats we’ve never held, to talk to activists and members on the ground - because I want to hear from the grassroots directly to truly understand what went wrong, what went right, and what we must do better. Using that detailed feedback, I am now publishing a manifesto called Grassroots Revival – a campaigning action plan that I will immediately start implementing if I’m elected as the next Labour Deputy Leader. **Download Grassroots revival**It starts with changes we must make to our internal organisation. We must overhaul the complaints process. I’ll remove the team from HQ and make it independent, put a time limit on reviewing complaints, and ensure those involved with each case are kept informed of its progress. I also want to start unlocking Labour’s membership talent. It’s not all about delivering leaflets and knocking on doors - we have social media experts, journalists, policy gurus, videographers and many other talents in our ranks. Let’s start making the most of that! For new members, attending meetings can feel daunting - we need to make them more enjoyable and accessible for all. We can ensure party democracy and due process are followed, while making meetings a more enjoyable experience. For example, some CLPs still spend up to an hour arguing about the minutes of the last meeting - which turns off new members. We need to streamline the procedural matters and get more political debate into our local meetings. We can be sociable too! I want to help local groups organise regional social events that break even, instead of looking to make a profit. Quiz nights, continuing the great work of Stand Up For Labour, pub nights, coffee mornings - let’s bring our movement together and celebrate all that we have to offer. Let’s look at how to grow and diversify our movement even further. I’ll offer reduced membership rates to emergency service workers, to encourage them to join the Party and have their say over how we fight to save our NHS. I would support BAME members to hold elected office - I will produce literature to be made available to BAME officers to distribute to new members, “how to be a councillor” meetings will be offered in each borough - not as an afterthought - and I will work with BAME officers to listen to what resources they need. We must start upgrading our technology and infrastructure - we’re running campaigns in 2020 with two colour printers from the 80s and 90s. I’d ensure every CLP has access to a full colour RISO printer (or similar). We can also boost data driven testing of our methods. Comparisons of leaflets, direct mails, e-newsletters, social media and canvassing will allow us to be so much more targeted and effective. A significant amount of dedicated time went into creating software and apps to revolutionise our digital campaigning in recent years but the party didn’t have the resources to fully roll them out - the doorknocking app, dialogue and chatter could have really helped us but members didn’t know how to use them or didn’t know they existed. Contact Creator regularly broke down during the General Election and the user interface hasn’t changed for over a decade. This must all change. Let’s also have a digital team at HQ who goes to every target seat, showing them how to make the most of Facebook ads, emails, Twitter, creating graphics and videos. Let’s also start looking at how to produce more personalised and localised content. The party produces some great literature and supplies it to key seats, but the vast majority of it is national with no localisation. Some leaflets and letters just didn’t arrive in 2019 for some seats, which left them in the dark, and adequate support was not available to deal with it, because staff were already overstretched. We must be better prepared. The manifesto came out weeks after the print deadlines for seats to order their leaflets and letters. I will ensure the necessary information is available to candidates in good time. The Labour Party must do better at supporting our candidates – I’ll make sure they all get adequate briefings and lines for use in their own leaflets, letters, emails and press releases. Candidates and their teams are superheroes, but they aren’t invincible, and campaigns can take their toll both financially, physically and mentally - This is why I’ll set up a dedicated team to offer mental health support and advice during difficult times. Too often, local organisers and staff have contracts that end at 10pm on polling day - this culture needs to change. Organisers put in endless hours to help our campaigns succeed and to dump them when polls close is just simply wrong. I’ll ensure no staff contracts end on Election Day, giving them vital time to find new employment. I also want to establish a system of sharing best practice amongst CLPs and boroughs. Campaigns shouldn’t have borders - we don’t have to operate solely within our constituency or ward boundaries. We need proper twinning with key seats. There’s no sugar-coating it – the Labour Party is in a critical condition right now. But with the right treatment, the right approach and the right support from the leadership team, we can get it back to fighting fitness. With the local elections coming up in May, there’s no time to waste. Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan MP for Tooting There is absolutely no place for antisemitism within the Labour Party, and I will put all my energy into rebuilding trust with the Jewish community.\nMy first major meeting will be with Jewish Labour Movement - they are Labour's official Jewish affiliate and we must trust them. I’ll separate the complaints process from head office, making it truly independent - to begin the process of rebuilding the trust. Once that new team is in place, I'll immediately get them to review all cases, acting swiftly and expelling antisemites. For future, I'll put a time limit on when cases need to be resolved by (for now and in future). The investigation from the Equality and Human Rights Commission is not an optional piece of diversity training, it's an embarrassment that this issue has gone so far without real action. The report they produce and the actions they want Labour to take are not optional - they are legally binding. I promise to fully adopt, without hesitation - every single one of their proposed steps. We are an open party, who welcome everyone from every background, no longer can we kick these issues into the long grass and offer the bare minimum in support and process. As Deputy Leader no form of racism will be accepted in our party. Front-line workers in the NHS have felt ignored by the Government - and now the Tories look set to give up the NHS for profit.\nThis Christmas I’ve been proud to support my hard-working colleagues on the front line by doing shifts in my local A&E. We’re all touched by the NHS at some point in our lives. For over 70 years it has been our lifeline, the glue holding our society together, often forgotten about, but there in our times of greatest need. The NHS is there to bring life, to offer care and dignity when we leave the world, and to support our loved ones when tragedy hits. But front-line workers in the NHS have felt ignored and that the Government does not recognise the day-to-day pressures they face. It didn’t start with claims on the side of a bus during the European referendum campaign in 2016 but, since then, using the NHS for political gain certainly picked up pace. Throughout the election, Boris Johnson repeatedly denied that the NHS would be up for sale. Just two weeks after the election, it was revealed that NHS cancer care and children’s treatments are up for grabs in a stealth Tory sell-off. Cardiology, gynaecology, paediatrics and oncology are among the services being offered to companies. As an A&E doctor, when someone is rushed into A&E having a heart attack, we work to patch someone up before sending them off to heart specialists. How will it feel knowing that those services are now being provided by a private company? Where is the trust? Allowing hospital trusts to outsource treatment to private companies could lead to a postcode lottery of health care, further widening the health divide. We need to be bringing the UK together, not tearing it apart, turning communities against each other. On top of this, discussions are taking place with tech giants on how to make money from patient data. While we must do everything possible to look for cures and ensure a better patient journey, we need to know how our own data is being used. The last decade has shown us that we must exercise caution with tech giants. The Government does not have the money or expertise needed to create an anonymised patient database, which is exactly why Amazon and Microsoft have been approached. Trust in our NHS cannot be destroyed because without trust, everything else could be up for grabs. I was stunned and heartbroken after the election result and bereft at what it would mean for our NHS. Our hospitals, treatments and dedicated staff cannot simply be sold off to the highest bidder. These aren’t the principles our NHS was founded and built on and I will continue fighting, standing side by side with our hospital workers, to protect our NHS from those who wish to destroy it. Shadow minister launches deputy leadership bid with a unifying pitch\nLabour must move past the factionalism and “ideological purity” that has alienated voters across the country, the shadow minister Rosena Allin-Khan has said as she set out her pitch to become the party’s deputy leader. The A&E doctor who has served on Jeremy Corbyn’s frontbench is the latest party figure to officially throw their hat in the ring for the deputy leadership, alongside the shadow cabinet members Angela Rayner and Richard Burgon. Allin-Khan, 43, said that for too long the party had been weighted down by infighting and described her politics as being inspired by public service, which she said was not based within soft- or hard-left identities. “I’ve got the campaigning experience but also the life experience to help rebuild the party again,” said Allin-Khan, who has been a shadow minister for sport since 2016 and still works hospital shifts. “We need to move beyond the last few years where nasty internal debates about faction and ideological purity have too often alienated people outside our movement. “Public service isn’t about identifying who sits on which side of the Labour party. I am Labour because of my values, my life experiences and the fact that I’m a doctor. We must communicate how we are going to change people’s lives in a way they can understand.” Her pitch as a unifying figure across Labour’s political spectrum would involve trying to make inroads in Scotland and Wales and other heartland areas that went Conservative, by holding town hall events, as well as meetings in synagogues, churches, mosques and temples. She said to rebuild the party’s base Labour must listen far more to councillors, who she says are the experts in their communities. The Tooting MP, who has a Pakistani father and Polish mother, dismissed concerns that Labour must have a leadership team that is drawn from northern constituencies. “I grew up poor with a single mum working three jobs to support me and my brother. That taught me the reality of day to day life for people across this country,” she said. “There’s no regional distinction to hunger. Loss of hope lives across the UK. London is used to mean ‘metropolitan elite’ but we also have some of the highest levels of deprivation. “Growing up in poverty. Understanding what it was like to get a job really young to supplement household income, to being careful in supermarkets with food, to feel there was no hope for someone from your background – that experience gives me a fire in my stomach to fight for all people around the country that have to go through that.” The mother of two studied medicine at Cambridge through Labour-initiated scholarships after initially failing her A-levels during a period of difficult family circumstances. After qualifying as a doctor she has worked as an A&E specialist in London hospitals and as a humanitarian aid doctor in the Middle East, Africa and Asia for a decade. She won the Tooting seat in a 2016 by-election after Sadiq Khan quit to run as mayor of London. In parliament she has highlighted the difficulty Palestinian children in Gaza have in accessing healthcare in Israeli hospitals because their parents are not allowed to accompany them through a restrictive permit system. As part of her sports brief she has fought for the return of safe standing at football clubs, as well as being an advocate for the women’s game both in parliament and as a player herself. She was also a vociferous campaigner for the People’s Vote campaign on a second referendum but said she accepted the country was leaving the EU, even though she had fought so hard against it because she did not believe the deal would work for her constituents. As for rejoining the bloc, she said that would have to be looked at if it should ever come up but was not a priority. Despite Corbyn being rejected at the election, she pointed out positive changes he made for the party, including a more welcoming immigration policy, and said she was proud of his strong anti-austerity message and the party’s continued support for the NHS. But on the defeat, she said: “We threw everything out there and nothing had time to land effectively. In comparison the Tories used three words and a few repeated soundbites which ultimately proved effective.” She said she would be happy to work with any leadership candidate should they be elected. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

It’s a time to celebrate all the brilliant women who make our community, the incredible place it is.\nToday, I brought together a group of fantastic leading women in business and community organisations. Their stories were inspiring and shows what women can do when we support each other. It was great to speak at the King's Fund Circles Series focusing on women in leadership, where I shared my experience as a women working in healthcare and politics.\nIt's vital that we get more women in leadership roles across society. As the MP for Tooting, the safety of our community is my top priority. I am delighted that more than 100 local businesses have already signed up to become a Safe Space.\nFor more details, head to the Safe Space here\nWith the nights getting longer and recent rise in crime, some people feel uncomfortable walking in public alone. I’ve launched my Safe Space campaign, where local businesses can sign up to offer a place of safety.\nFor businesses that would like to sign-up, head to drrosena.co.uk/safespace\nIn today’s Guardian, I reveal the scandal of new mothers being turned away from mental health services.\nFor some time, I’ve been concerned that new mothers are being left to suffer in silence. My figures show that last year, nearly 20,000 new mothers were turned away from mental health services. Maternal mental health services are being rationed. This is despite maternal illness costing the whole of society £8.1 billion a year. It is an absolute scandal. The 8,500 new staff Labour will recruit are vital to solving this crisis. Read the full article here\nTonight, I invited Wandsworth Police to join our community to discuss how they’re working with Wandsworth Council to tackle violence against women and girls.\nMaking our community safe is a key priority for me. My door is always open. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch.\nToday, I am marking International Women's Day 2023 by celebrating some of the inspiring women who make Tooting the best place to work and live.\nHere are just some of Tooting's amazing women: Sahar Beg - Sahar, and her amazing team of volunteers, run the Tooting Community Kitchen, which has provided hot meals, toiletries, and care packages to those in need since 2018. Sophie Livingstone - Sophie, and the team at Little Village, are hardworking local activists providing vital support at their baby bank in Tooting. Kate Allan - Kate is a leading member of the Balham and Tooting Community Association (BATCA). BATCA works to organise community events, celebreate the local heroes in our area and bring people of all backgrounds together. Cllr Sarmila Varatharaj - Sarmila was elected to serve our community as a councillor last May and is now Wandsworth's Deputy Mayor. She is a volunteer for Global Human Rights Defence and has been the spokesperson to the United Nations Human Rights Council. Cllr Lizzy Dobres - Lizzy has been a dedicated councillor since being elected last May and has led on fighting inequality and violence against women. Charlotte White - Charlotte is part of the fantastic team at Earlsfield Foodbank. During the most difficult of times, she has worked tirelessly to support those in need of our community. Natasha Best - Natasha, and the team at Tooting Works, provide fantastic community and work space for many local businesses and start ups. To all the countless other amazing women who do so much for our community, thank you. This week, we celebrated our fantastic women business owners in Tooting. Over the last two years, many women have felt a disproportionate economic hit. Women hold the key to supercharging our economy as we recover from the pandemic. Today I was delighted to welcome Anneliese Dodds MP to Tooting and meet with women business owners. I believe it is essential that we recognise the significant contribution women make and commit to tackling the challenges that they still face today. Also, we welcomed some of our community's many impressive business women and community leaders to Parliament. Tooting is home to so many - it's only right we back women in business. Lastly, a big thank you to Sir Keir Starmer MP for hosting. Tooting Women’s Institute is looking for new members of all ages and backgrounds to join them in their monthly activities and events. Meeting on the second Wednesday of each month, this wonderful organisation provides a place for members to learn new skills, meet others in the community, discuss topical issues, and share interests. Previous sessions have involved everything from career mentoring and coding, to craftivism and calligraphy, while a variety of smaller groups meet to engage in more niche interests, including a supper club, which visits a new restaurant in Tooting each month, a book club, and a craft club, to name a few.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_wandsworth-town_3/content_222.html": "|\nIt is so important that those living with sight loss in our community are supported when using public transport. That is why I recently wrote to South Western Rail and Southern Rail to enquire as to when warning tactile - a vital safety and accessibility tool for those travelling by train - will be installed at Earlsfield and Wandsworth Stations. I am happy to say that Southern Rail have now confirmed that warning tactile has been installed on surface platforms at Wandsworth Common Station. And, although tactile is yet to be installed at Earlsfield Station, South West Railway have stated that Network Rail is working hard to deliver these accessibility improvements. Rest assured I will continue to press for accessibility for local residents living with sight loss. Wandsworth is in the top 5 for vaccination rates across London! This is a great step forward and I am proud of everyone here in Tooting who has taken the steps to protect themselves and others by receiving their jab. However, we still have a way to go before everyone is protected against coronavirus. We need to keep pushing to ensure that those who can do so, are vaccinated as soon as possible. Information on how to book your vaccination appointment can be found here. It is also vital that if, for any reason, you have to change or cancel your vaccine appointment that you let the GP surgery or vaccination centre that you appointment is booked with know. You can manage your vaccination appointment here. If you are still unsure about having the jab or have any questions, more information can be found on the vaccine and answers to many common concerns on Wandsworth Council’s website here. Several cases of the South African variant of Covid-19 has been found in Wandsworth, and the Council is encouraging everyone over the age of 11 who lives, works in, or travels through Wandsworth to book a PCR test – including those of us who have had the vaccine, even if you are not showing any symptoms.\nPCR testing sites have opened across Wandsworth, including one at Tooting Leisure Centre by appointment only. Tests can also be ordered online, or collected without an appointment at Wandsworth Town Hall. Tests are also available on a strictly appointment-only basis at many local pharmacies. It is necessary to book a PCR test because although the widely available rapid lateral flow test can determine positivity for Covid-19, only the PCR test is able to detect specific variants. It is important that we are all tested because one-in-three people who have Covid-19 are asymptomatic, and could be spreading the virus without knowing it. Let’s all do our part to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 variant. Click here to order a home testing kit, or to book an appointment at a testing centre or local pharmacy. Today Muslims across the UK and around the world mark the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan. As a proud Muslim, the period of reflection, prayer, and fasting is incredibly important to our Muslim community. Traditionally, Ramadan is a time for gathering and sharing Iftar with family and friends. Although, like last year, we are unable to come together and celebrate as we normally would, the spirit of Ramadan remains. To every Muslim nurse and doctor who have saved countless lives throughout this pandemic, to every volunteer and community leader in our Mosques and community centres who continue to support those most vulnerable, and to every Muslim in Tooting and across the country, I wish you all Ramadan Mubarak. In light of the recent tragic events, many residents have been in touch to share their concerns about the lighting in Tooting and Wandsworth Commons. Indeed, many women feel unable to use the Commons in the evening due to the poor lighting, whereby many of the paths are unlit. All our local residents, including women, should feel safe to access these vital green spaces, which is why I have written to Paul Chadwick, Director Environment and Community Services at Wandsworth Council, and Neil Blackley, Head of Parks at Enable, who manage Wandsworth’s green spaces on the Council’s behalf, calling for action to improve the lighting across both sites as quickly as possible. Please check back here for updates on the Council’s response. The inability to afford everyday hygiene and personal grooming essentials is sadly a growing problem. With people and families hit hard by the ongoing pandemic, hygiene poverty is a bigger problem than ever before - many are struggling to afford essential products like soap, shampoo, toothpaste, period products, and hand sanitiser. Here in Wandsworth, a new hygiene bank has opened to tackle this growing problem and alleviate the issue of hygiene poverty in our local area. As a volunteer-run project, all the money raised by the hygiene bank goes directly towards providing much-needed essentials for local residents, with all donated products distributed to local frontline organisations in the borough. To find out more about the Hygiene Bank Wandsworth, or to make a donation, see here. As you will know, a South African variant of Covid-19 has arrived in the UK. This new Covid variant has now been detected in CR4 (Merton). Residents in CR4 are no different to us in neighbouring Tooting (SW16 and SW17). We use the same shops, the same hospital, and the same parks, so if it’s there, it could very easily be here. This will be the same across all affected areas. As a matter of urgency, the Government needs to launch widespread testing in neighbouring postcodes. This is the only way to see how widespread these new variants are. I have written to the Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock MP, the Director of Public Health at Wandsworth Council, Shannon Katiyo, and the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Council, Paul Martin, to ask about plans to launch testing in neighbouring postcodes. While I press for action on this, we need to make sure we’re all doing everything we can to keep ourselves and each other safe. It’s absolutely vital that we minimise our social contact to prevent the spread of this new variant within our community. Please think twice before leaving home, and when you do leave, please continue to adhere to social distancing. Together, we will get through this. In light of the upcoming Fire Safety Bill, I would to thank every resident who has written to me with their concerns on this and for continuing to keep me updated on the cladding issues affecting their property. I recognise what an exceptionally difficult time this is and appreciate how much anxiety the cladding proposals are causing to many leaseholders.\nOn more than fifteen occasions, Ministers promised that leaseholders would not be landed with the costs of remedial works. Yet, people are still being put at risk, trapped in flammable buildings for a third lockdown, with leaseholders placed in an impossible position and promises broken. It is evident that the Government’s handling of the cladding crisis has lacked any sense of grip or urgency. For this reason, the Labour Party have tabled an Opposition Day Debate on cladding for Monday, which will subsequently bring forward a vote that will call for leaseholders to be protected from the costs of remediating their blocks with dangerous cladding. The party will also be tabling a number of amendments to the Fire Safety Bill that will aim to protect leaseholders from unfair costs through the power of the law. I am aware that many residents have been in touch to request that I support the McPartland and Smith amendment, which provides welcome clarity on the specific costs that would be prevented from being passed on to leaseholders. Labour has sought to go further on this. As currently drafted, the McPartland and Smith amendment would not have covered blocks like Grenfell - where flammable cladding has been added at some stage following the building of the block. It only applies to defects in the original design of buildings. The Labour Party’s amendment would ensure that the cost of fire safety problems from refurbishment jobs, like the cladding on Grenfell Tower, cannot be passed on to leaseholders. Labour’s amendments also include new clauses so that the Bill protects leaseholders from the day it comes into law, instead of an unknown date in the future. I would like to thank my colleagues in the Labour Party, Sarah Jones MP, Nick Thomas-Symonds MP, Thangam Debbonaire MP and Mike Amesbury MP for their hard work and commitment to addressing this large injustice on a national scale. If any residents have any further queries on this issue, please do not hesitate to get in touch to discuss this further. In the meantime, I hope this post assures you of the steps myself and the Labour Party are taking to protect tenants and leaseholders during this cladding crisis. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_local_8/content_684.html": "|\nRecently I visited the fantastic Balham Ballers holiday club, based at Ravensbourne Primary school.\nBalham Ballers provide a sports programme for young people aged five to twelve over the school holidays, focusing mainly on football but also giving young people a chance to enjoy a wide range of other sporting activities. I have loved working with the Balham Ballers team over the last few years and it has been fantastic to see them go from strength to strength. Balham Ballers are passionate about promoting a love of sports amongst both boys and girls. This is something that I am particularly supportive of. Following the Lionesses' fantastic win at the Euros earlier this month, the England football team have said \"every girl should be given the chance to play football at school.\" However, currently only 63% of schools offer equal access to football, a number that falls to just 44% at secondary schools. It was great to see so many young people in our community enjoying football, and I even took a penalty myself! To find out more about the Balham Ballers, click here. It was great to visit the wonderful volunteers at the White Eagle Club in Balham recently. The Tooting and Balham Community has rallied together to support the appeal for Ukraine since the Russian invasion in March. Since the appeal was launched, the White Eagle Club has sent 74 trucks, 112 vans, and a massive 1,800 tonnes of goods to Ukraine as part of their humanitarian aid mission. They have also provided many Ukrainian nationals who have recently fled to the UK with clothes, shoes, toiletries, and supplies for babies and infants. It’s always amazing to see the community come together to help those in need. There is however, still much more that the White Eagle Club needs, both for Ukrainian nationals arriving in the UK and to be sent to those still living in Ukraine. Items that are most in need include; medical supplies, toiletries, sanitary products and baby powder, as well as clothes for those who have recently arrived in the UK. You can donate items to 211 Balham High Street at the following times: Tuesdays: 11.00 - 20.00 Wednesday: 10.00 - 17.00 Thursday: 11.00-20.00 Friday: 10.00-17.00 Saturday 10.00-17.00 It was great to visit Mount Carmel Rehabilitation centre again recently. I’ve enjoyed working with this fantastic organisation over the last few years. Mount Carmel offers residential and day programmes to people struggling with addictions. Their Counsellors provide a series of programmes, including a range of talking therapy groups, art therapy and equine therapy, to help people overcome their addiction issues. The pandemic has left Mount Carmel more stretched than ever, with many people seeking help after relapsing or struggling with new addiction problems during the lockdowns. Despite the increased demand, the team at Mount Carmel continue to provide first class care to all their clients. I look forward to continuing to work with the team at Mount Carmel, and seeing all that they go on to achieve. If you would like to support the work they do in our community, you can donate to their Just Giving page below Tooting Bec Athletics Track reopened this summer after a successful community campaign against its closure. It was great to be at their official reopening along with local Councillor Judi Gasser.\nIt was great to meet some young athletes and see the wide range of facilities that they offer, including a seven-a-side football pitch, an eight lane track, and a state of the art fitness centre. I am so grateful we have this brilliant resource on our doorstep in Tooting. The fantastic facilities at Tooting Bec Athletics Track will be vital in helping Tooting’s children become the Olympians of tomorrow. I have no doubt that future Team GB medalists are already training here and I look forward to seeing what they all go on to achieve. Yesterday, my friend Rex Osborn was elected to Wandsworth Council for Tooting Broadway with a whopping 62% of the vote!\nRex has been a constant in my political life – he was the Labour leader on the council when I was elected in 2014 and I served as his deputy. Rex was the one who urged me to run for selection as an MP and has been with me every step of the way since. Tooting has gained a fantastic voice on the council, who will prioritise our town centres, ensure a fairer deal for renters and push for increased cost-of-living support. This election took place under tragic circumstances, following the sad passing of Councillor Andy Gibbons, who served this area faithfully for 28 years. However, I could not think of a better person to represent Tooting in the Town Hall in Andy’s stead and I look forward to working closely with Rex to honour Andy’s legacy. It was a pleasure to invite Royal Mahal, led by Adil Javid, to the Tooting Heroes Awards in Parliament on Monday.\nAdil, and his team, have provided exemplary services to our community, delivering free food parcels to the homeless; supported soup kitchens in Tooting, Balham, Croydon, Norbury, and Purley; provided free school meals to children unable to afford a hot meal and emergency public services, namely the NHS, Police and Fire Services. I would like to send my personal thanks to the Royal Mahal team for being a shining example of a successful local business and key community hub. On behalf of the Tooting community, I wish them the best of luck in continuing to do so. On Monday 13 June, I was delighted to welcome organisations and individuals from across Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting to Parliament, in order to recognise their fantastic contributions to society in the face of adversity in the last few years. It was a sheer joy to see the pillars of our communities together in one place and I look forward to continuing to collaborate and support the inspiring people who do so much for the local area.\nI presented the following organisations and individuals with trophies for truly exceptional services in the community: Councillor Andy Gibbons, for his dedicated public service over the last three decades.

I would like to thank all those who attended - I cannot overstate how proud I am of our community. Each and every one of you is a true Tooting Hero. 44 years of Tory rule in Wandsworth came to an end with Labour taking control of the Council after the local elections. Labour won 35 seats, whilst the Tories won 22. I was thrilled to play a part along with our fantastic Councillors, candidates, and activists in putting Labour into power locally.\nLabour’s historic victory here represents a new start for our borough, and it’s great to see Wandsworth’s group of Labour Councillors already taking action to help residents through the cost-of-living crisis. Talking to residents right across the borough, it was obvious to see that people in Wandsworth have rejected Conservative neglect both locally and nationally. The cost of living crisis is hitting residents hard, and it’s clear the Tories aren’t doing enough to address it. Wandsworth residents simply do not trust the Tories. The road to Labour in Government runs through our local councils, and I am hopeful this local victory will be the springboard to Labour’s general election victory. The Local Elections are hastily approaching on 5th May. After 44 long years of Tory rule, Wandsworth needs a breath of fresh air and a Labour council.\nOver the next four weeks, I will be out on the campaign trail - knocking on doors, delivering leaflets and working to help our fantastic Labour candidates. I would like to thank all the local residents for their support and warm welcome on the doorstep. Together we can turn Labour red this May!\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_local_13/content_702.html": "|\nThe work of biomedical scientists and laboratory staff is incredibly valuable - and this has never been clearer than since the outset of the coronavirus pandemic. Often overlooked as a profession, I was pleased to join others in thanking those working in healthcare sciences. For every coronavirus test conducted, a biomedical scientist has been behind it, working hard to ensure PCR tests are returned safely. I would like to thank, in particular, our incredible microbiology team at St George’s. Working in A&E, I know just how much our NHS relies on the incredible efforts of lab staff. I have included photos of the microbiology team at St George’s, featuring Chris James, a Specialist Biomedical Scientist in Biochemistry who has worked at St George’s for 9 years, and Silva, a Specialist Biomedical Scientist in Medical Microbiology and Virology who has worked St George’s Hospital for the past 4 years, after moving to the UK from Portugal. Silva’s words about her work as a biomedical scientist are impactful and I hope everyone is able to recognise the incredible work they do. “Being a biomedical scientist is an extremely impactful role in healthcare. Even though it’s not patient facing, our work and the speed and accuracy with which we can produce results is essential for patient care.” As you will no doubt be aware, the Covid-19 situation remains serious, with the Delta variant spreading rapidly throughout the country. One of the most important steps we can take to stop the spread of the coronavirus is to get vaccinated as soon as possible. For this reason, a range of walk-in vaccination sites have been launched across South West London. People aged over 18 are invited to drop into the Tooting and Mitcham United F.C. vaccination centre on Saturday 19th or Sunday 20th 9am - 8pm, to receive their first or second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Unvaccinated over 40s and over 40s who have received their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine before mid-April can also head down to the Roehampton Vaccination Centre, located in the Queen Mary’s Hospital car park, on Sunday between 8am and 7.45pm to receive their second dose. Together we can stop the spread of Covid-19. Details of additional walk-in vaccine centres in South West London are available here. Today I had the pleasure of visiting the impressive walk-in vaccine clinic, based at St Boniface Church on Mitcham Road. It was great to have the opportunity to speak with their incredible team of staff and volunteers, as well as meet local residents receiving their coronavirus vaccines. In partnership with NHS England, to date Pearl Chemist have administered over 30,000 doses of the vaccines. This is an incredible achievement and a real credit to our community. For local residents aged 40+ who have not yet had their first vaccination, the AstraZeneca vaccine is available at the Pearl Chemist clinic on Mitcham Road. You can also receive your second dose (eight weeks after your first dose) if you are in cohorts 1-9. Simply bring along your card! All other age groups can book their doses via the NHS website here. As a reminder, before you receive your vaccine, it is important to have eaten and be hydrated. With coronavirus cases in Wandsworth rising, it has never been more important to ensure you are fully vaccinated as soon as possible. By getting vaccinated, you are not only protecting yourself, but your community too. Last week, along with Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney, I was fortunate to visit Heathmere School - a local primary supported by the fantastic mental health charity, Place2Be. It was a wonderful opportunity to hear how Heathmere is promoting positive mental wellbeing for pupils, as well as learn more about the range of support Place2Be provides for schools across Wandsworth and the rest of the UK. During the visit, we heard first-hand from pupils who have benefitted from Heathmere’s whole school approach to mental health and Place2Be’s support. In addition, we were able to meet with Heathmere’s Headteacher, Emma Lewis, Place2Be’s Area Manager for South West London, Khalad Musse, and Place2Be’s Chief Executive Catherine Roche to discuss children’s mental health. It is so important that we shine a spotlight on the incredible work organisations, such as Place2Be, are doing to support children and young people. As we move beyond the pandemic, it is vital that we dedicate our care and attention to listening to young people to understand how we can best support them. Local favourite Mixed Blessings - our very own West Indian bakery on Mitcham Road - will soon be blessed with its very own blue plaque! The plaque will mark and celebrate TMC Studios (Tooting Music Centre), the recording studio that was once based above the bakery and frequented by glam rockers and reggae artists - local legend has it that Bob Marley scrawled his signature on a wall. It is so important that we shine a spotlight on Tooting’s rich musical roots and diverse cultural heritage. I will certainly be there later this summer when the plaque is revealed to share the love. A number of dogs have been reportedly infected with canine parvovirus on Tooting Common in recent times. Dog owners may be well aware that parvovirus is a highly infectious condition spread through contaminated faeces of affected dogs, and it can remain active in the environment for up to nine months. The virus causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea, leading to a dog or puppy becoming very weak and dehydrated. Sadly, many little pups do not recover. Thankfully, there are a number of steps that dog owners can take to protect their furry friends: Prevent your dog from meeting with other dogs to stop the spread of infection Ensure your dog’s vaccinations are up-to-date Notify your vet immediately if your dog displays any worrying symptoms.

The Food Bus – a converted bus stocked with affordable, healthy food – aims to improve Wandsworth residents’ access to fresh produce, while reducing the burden on household budgets. Much of its stock is obtained from retailers’ surpluses, and an ordinary shopping basket of goods will be available at a fraction of the normal price. The bus also features an on-board café. Head on down to All Saints Church on Brudenell Road on Thursday 10 June between 10:30am to 2:30pm to experience this wonderful initiative for yourself. Since the outset of the pandemic, we have lost close to 500 Wandsworth residents to the virus (ONS). That’s 500 families grieving a lost one, 500 people with their own stories to tell, and a community collectively grieving those no longer with us. To remember those who died, I recently visited the National Covid Memorial Wall outside St Thomas’s Hospital, stretching across the south bank of the River Thames. The National Covid Memorial Wall was set up by the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, who I had the pleasure of meeting with in November last year. Hearing the evidence confirming what we knew and feared, of how severe failures caused countless avoidable deaths, results in a devastating combination of anger and heartbreak. All those bereaved are in my thoughts and will continue to be as we build back from this pandemic. On Tuesday, I was alerted to a team of Met Police officers stopping fast food delivery drivers and carrying out immigration checks on Mitcham Road. The only concerns I have received from local residents (which authorities were copied into) were about social distancing, for which an operation of this size seems excessive. However, the police say it was 'a road safety policing operation'. The Home Office say it was in relation to 'suspected immigration offences'. This looks like racial profiling - and under the Equalities Act 2010, this may amount to indirect discrimination due to its disproportionate impact on ethnic minority groups. If it's not unlawful, then it's definitely immoral and I cannot defend it. Our community here in Tooting is inclusive, diverse and welcoming. The celebratory nature of the police’s response to any arrests is not in line with our local values. I have met with the police since and encouraged them to focus their time on fighting crime – not targeting people at work. I would like to congratulate Sadiq Khan on his return to City Hall, where he will be serving as Mayor of London for a second term. As a fellow Tooting-ite, having grown up on the Henry Prince Estate, I know our community has a sense of collective pride seeing Sadiq returned as Mayor of our incredible city. I would also like to congratulate Leonie Cooper on her re-election as Assembly Member for Merton and Wandsworth. Thank you to every single person in Tooting and across London who put their trust in the Labour Party, and thank you to all of the volunteers who hit the ground running, knocking on doors, delivering leaflets, and making phone calls. We will leave no stone unturned to get our city back on its feet. A brighter future is possible, and we’ll deliver it together. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

It was great to have the opportunity to speak with their incredible team of staff and volunteers, as well as meet local residents receiving their coronavirus vaccines. In partnership with NHS England, to date Pearl Chemist have administered over 30,000 doses of the vaccines. This is an incredible achievement and a real credit to our community. For local residents aged 40+ who have not yet had their first vaccination, the AstraZeneca vaccine is available at the Pearl Chemist clinic on Mitcham Road. You can also receive your second dose (eight weeks after your first dose) if you are in cohorts 1-9. Simply bring along your card! All other age groups can book their doses via the NHS website here. As a reminder, before you receive your vaccine, it is important to have eaten and be hydrated. With coronavirus cases in Wandsworth rising, it has never been more important to ensure you are fully vaccinated as soon as possible. By getting vaccinated, you are not only protecting yourself, but your community too. Last week, along with Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney, I was fortunate to visit Heathmere School - a local primary supported by the fantastic mental health charity, Place2Be. It was a wonderful opportunity to hear how Heathmere is promoting positive mental wellbeing for pupils, as well as learn more about the range of support Place2Be provides for schools across Wandsworth and the rest of the UK. During the visit, we heard first-hand from pupils who have benefitted from Heathmere’s whole school approach to mental health and Place2Be’s support. In addition, we were able to meet with Heathmere’s Headteacher, Emma Lewis, Place2Be’s Area Manager for South West London, Khalad Musse, and Place2Be’s Chief Executive Catherine Roche to discuss children’s mental health. It is so important that we shine a spotlight on the incredible work organisations, such as Place2Be, are doing to support children and young people. As we move beyond the pandemic, it is vital that we dedicate our care and attention to listening to young people to understand how we can best support them. Local favourite Mixed Blessings - our very own West Indian bakery on Mitcham Road - will soon be blessed with its very own blue plaque! The plaque will mark and celebrate TMC Studios (Tooting Music Centre), the recording studio that was once based above the bakery and frequented by glam rockers and reggae artists - local legend has it that Bob Marley scrawled his signature on a wall. It is so important that we shine a spotlight on Tooting’s rich musical roots and diverse cultural heritage. I will certainly be there later this summer when the plaque is revealed to share the love. A number of dogs have been reportedly infected with canine parvovirus on Tooting Common in recent times. Dog owners may be well aware that parvovirus is a highly infectious condition spread through contaminated faeces of affected dogs, and it can remain active in the environment for up to nine months. The virus causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea, leading to a dog or puppy becoming very weak and dehydrated. Sadly, many little pups do not recover.

Head on down to All Saints Church on Brudenell Road on Thursday 10 June between 10:30am to 2:30pm to experience this wonderful initiative for yourself. Effective from Monday June 7th, St George’s new visiting policy will allow one visitor per patient for the first time since the pandemic began. Every patient will now be allowed to have one visitor for one hour – at a pre-arranged time – between 1pm and 6pm each day. This applies on weekdays and weekends. Visitors should ideally be someone from the same household or support bubble. Where this is not possible, St George’s ask that the visitor be a close family member or friend. Each ward has implemented an appointment booking system to record visitors names and contact details. Appointments can be made by calling the ward clerk on shift between 8am and 4pm, Monday to Friday. To find out the contact details for each ward, please see here. Tooting Bec Athletics Track needs to be resurfaced.\nThe track surface – which is already 35 years old – failed a track inspection last summer, meaning that it can no longer be used for competitions. Athletes are permitted to train at the facility until the end of 2021. However, the future of the track beyond this time is yet to be secured. The track is much-loved and well utilised by a collective of local residents as diverse as Tooting itself. The Herne Hill Harriers have called the track home since the 1930’s. Their membership is comprised of people of all ages and backgrounds, including elite and Olympic athletes, while countless schools and community groups also make use of the facility. I am calling on Wandsworth Council to commit to funding the resurfacing of this vital community asset without further delay. Click here to add your name to a petition to the Council to refurbish the track. Continue to check back here, and on my Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for further updates. Today marks the beginning of Pride, a month where we celebrate our wonderful and diverse LGBT+ community. Pride is a time for joy, laughter and love. It is also a time to reaffirm our allyship with the LGBT+ communities. Unfortunately, the struggle for equality is not over. To this end, it is vital that the true meaning of Pride doesn’t get lost with corporations wanting to get involved with the ‘fun’. Indeed, we must remember all those who have and continue to suffer attacks on their basic human freedoms that so many of us simply take for granted. I am so proud to be an ally. But we must not rest until everyone feels comfortable to be open about who they are without fear, stigma or judgement. A big congratulations to our local football team Tooting and Mitcham FC, who beat AFC Wimbledon to win the London Senior Cup. On a hot and sunny bank holiday Monday, goals by Jake Rose and Dontai Stewart led to a 2-1 win against a strong Wimbledon side. It was also a great performance from Billy Brown, Ahkeem Belford, Daniel Williams and goalkeeper Gary Ross. As Adam Best wrote in his post-match commentary, “Jake Rose, as we’ve come to expect, finished it like James Bond dispatching a foe; calmly, suavely - a tailored assassin in his craft.” This was undoubtedly a time of celebration, as could be heard from pub gardens across Tooting and Mitcham! Tooting and Mitcham FC continue to be an inspiration to young players in the local community and a source of much needed celebration at this time. Since the outset of the pandemic, we have lost close to 500 Wandsworth residents to the virus (ONS). That’s 500 families grieving a lost one, 500 people with their own stories to tell, and a community collectively grieving those no longer with us.

The Government urgently needs to get a grip on the crisis in our prison system instead of pretending that nothing is wrong.\nThis morning, I joined the panel on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg alongside former Conservative MP, Nadine Dorries and More in Common's Luke Tryl. We chatted about trust in politics and the situation in the Middle East.\nThis morning, following my appearance on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, I joined BBC Politics London with Conservative MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Steve Tuckwell. In today's Guardian, my latest figures reveal that thousands of people are re-admitted to mental health hospitals within days or weeks of leaving it, wreaking havoc on people's lives.\nWhy? Because the Tories cut a quarter of mental health beds and patients don't get the care they deserve.

As Transition Tooting’s annual sustainable community festival, this is a wonderful opportunity for local residents to come together to celebrate all things locally grown, cooked, re-created and re-imagined. Led by local volunteers, the event will run from 11- 5pm on Saturday 4th September and is free and open to all! To find out more, see here. The situation which has unfolded in Afghanistan is shocking and terribly regrettable. It is simply not good enough for world leaders to say the speed of the Taliban advance took them by surprise, when many have been warning of this for months. There has either been a monumental failing of our intelligence services or an unacceptable lack of transparency. Either way the Government has reacted too late. In 2010, I worked (pictured) as a Humanitarian Aid Doctor in the North West Frontier Province, on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan, following the flood crisis. I met many people who had suffered unimaginable pain at the hands of the Taliban. I am continuing to receive a high volume of emails from local residents concerned about loved ones in Afghanistan. Myself and my team are working to respond as quickly as possible. If you are worried about someone, please do not hesitate to get in touch by emailing their details to [email protected]. Please include the following information so I can take action quickly:\nWe must not allow history to repeat itself. Careless leadership from the Prime Minister enabled this tragedy to happen on his watch, while he had taken his eye off the ball. The world must not turn its back on the Afghan people. Following the recall of Parliament on Wednesday, I remain in close contact with my colleagues in the Shadow Foreign Team and will continue to be on hand to support local residents through this. Calling all dog lovers! The Friends of Tooting Common are planning to run their annual Fun Dog Show on Saturday 11 September. Last year's virtual event was a huge success – dogs competed across a range of categories, including Best Puppy, Best Rescue, Best Veteran, Best Trick, and – my personal favourite – Dog That Looks Most Like its Owner. An incredible £475 was raised for St George’s Hospital Charity’s Coronavirus Appeal in the process. Barring any unexpected developments, the Friends are looking forward to bringing this year’s event back to its rightful home on Tooting Common. For more information about this wonderful event, including how to get involved, email the Friends of Tooting Common on [email protected]. Today, the BBC revealed that in 2018 4,500 people in mental health crisis were unlawfully held in police custody due to a lack of mental health beds.\nI spoke about this matter on BBC News earlier today. There is no question that the system must change immediately. This is nothing short of a scandal. Rest assured I will be pressing the Government on this issue. Today, I spoke with GMB and Royal College of Nursing frontline NHS staff at St George’s Hospital to hear their views on the Government’s latest pay offer. The last 18 months has impacted our beloved NHS immeasurably, and staff have made significant sacrifices in order to save lives. I stand in solidarity with my NHS colleagues. They deserve far more than just claps. They need a proper pay rise. It was a pleasure to, once again, attend the annual Nicholas Stewart Project Community Day on the Henry Prince Estate in Earlsfield. It was a real honour to have been asked to lay flowers in memory of Nicholas, who tragically lost his life seven years ago. The Nicholas Stewart Project was founded in the wake of Nicholas Stewart’s murder and encourages young people to reject negative influences in their life and turn away from knife crime. It is always so inspiring to hear the work of the NSP in supporting young people and be part of our community standing together in hope. Tooting Community Kitchen is a wonderful organisation that serves hot food to those vulnerable in our community. And they need volunteers! If you have a few hours to spare, please consider lending a hand to help out this brilliant local organisation. You can find out more about how to get involved here. There was significant concern locally about Wandsworth Council’s decision to extend Controlled Parking Zone restrictions in areas of Earlsfield and Tooting from 9:30am to 9:30pm each day. Over 1400 local residents completed my consultation on the change. I am pleased that, following our pressure, Wandsworth Council have U-turned on their plans to extend CPZ restrictions. Instead, Event Day only restrictions are planned from 1 October - a far more sensible solution, and something which other councils with stadiums do. I received more than double the number of responses to Wandsworth Council’s rushed, ill-thought out consultation. In fact, over 93% of respondents were not happy with the council’s plans. This should never have happened. But I am pleased the Council finally listened and have U-turned on their attempt to rush through restrictions that would simply act as another cash-grab on hardworking local residents. It is so important that those living with sight loss in our community are supported when using public transport. That is why I recently wrote to South Western Rail and Southern Rail to enquire as to when warning tactile - a vital safety and accessibility tool for those travelling by train - will be installed at Earlsfield and Wandsworth Stations. I am happy to say that Southern Rail have now confirmed that warning tactile has been installed on surface platforms at Wandsworth Common Station. And, although tactile is yet to be installed at Earlsfield Station, South West Railway have stated that Network Rail is working hard to deliver these accessibility improvements. Rest assured I will continue to press for accessibility for local residents living with sight loss. A huge congratulations to Troy and Jarrell from Tooting’s Juci Jerk, who will be launching the first ever Caribbean pop-up in the Selfridges Food Hall next Monday (9th August). Juici Jerk is the go-to place for Caribbean deliciousness here in Tooting and I’m so please those not lucky enough to live here are finally getting the chance to sample the great food. Thankfully, the Tooting kitchen will remain open so we can still get our jerk fix! |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_labour-campaign-for-free-movement/content_518.html": "|\nMy responses to the questions provided by the Labour Campaign for Free Movement 1. Defend and extend free movement: opposing any reduction in the freedoms of UK and EU citizens to live, work, and access social security in each others’ countries, and any immigration system based on incomes, migrants’ utility to business, and number caps or targets.I am the very embodiment of the benefits free movement has brought – my mother is Polish and was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Under the draconian new immigration policies being discussed by this Tory government, she might never have been able to do that. Protecting and extending free movement is at the very heart of my internationalist Labour principles. I believe our country is stronger and better because of free movement. When I work shifts as an A&E doctor in my local hospital, I work with NHS staff from across Europe and it breaks my heart to see many of them feeling unwanted or undervalued because of Brexit. As Deputy Leader, I pledge to do everything in my power to promote the core Labour values of internationalism and solidarity across borders, because I believe human life has the same value no matter where someone comes from. That means defending and extending free movement, and it means fighting to protect the human rights of migrants from this hostile Tory government. 2. Close every detention centreHolding migrants in detention centres, often in substandard conditions, is incredibly cruel and degrading. These are often vulnerable people, fleeing from a variety of horrific circumstances such as war, trafficking and poverty. They have the right to be treated with dignity, as human beings, as we would want ourselves or our family to be treated in such horrendous circumstances. When working abroad as a humanitarian doctor, I’ve seen first-hand some of the terrible conditions people are forced to endure in detention centres and it horrified me. We must fight back against the hostile environment the Tories have created for migrants – the Labour Party has always stood for international solidarity and openness to the world – we need a Labour government to bring those principles back into the core of our approach to immigration. I would want to listen to expert opinion on how to do this in a responsible way, but I certainly would want to close as many detention centres as possible and make sure we have an overall approach to immigration that means a concept as cruel as detention centres are not required in the first place. 3. Unconditional rights to family reunionYes, I fully support this. The unconditional right to family reunion is a fundamental element of treating migrants as human beings with dignity and equal value, rather than the Tory approach of seeing migrants as a problem to be managed. When I’ve worked as a humanitarian doctor in conflict zones across the world, it was always horrendous to see so many families ripped apart or prevented from seeing each other again. When I visited Palestine on a humanitarian mission, I saw sick children alone in hospital because the permit system meant their parents weren’t allowed to visit them. I immediately began working on ways to resolve this. It’s not enough to just talk about this – we need to be working every day to deliver a Labour government so we can fix these kinds of injustices. That’s what I’d do as Deputy Leader. 4. End “no recourse to public funds” policiesI support ending such policies, yes. This is another case of a Tory government treating migrants not as human beings with human dignity and equal value, but instead as a problem to be managed through cruelty. I want to deliver a Labour government with internationalism at its core, which would allow us to change our entire approach to migration, and begin seeing human life as equally valuable and equally dignified no matter where that person was born or where they’ve come from. 5. Oppose all Hostile Environment measures, use of landlords and public service providers as border guards, and restrictions on migrants’ NHS accessThe Tory Hostile Environment approach to immigration is a stain on the soul of their party, and they should be ashamed of it. Tragedies such as the Windrush scandal are a horrendous demonstration of where this approach leads, and I worry a similar scandal could occur with EU citizens who’ve made their lives in this country. I want a Labour government so we can end the Hostile Environment immediately and start treating migrants with the human dignity and respect they deserve. 6. Equal voting rights for all UK residents I am certainly interested in all ideas for how to revitalise our democracy and increase the level of engagement with our political process. Indeed, prior to the General Election in 2019, I publicly called for EU citizens to get the right to vote. Our Labour values of openness and internationalism must be at the core of everything we do. 7. Please share your thoughts on these wider issues that our supporters also feel strongly about:Even after Brexit, the UK government looks set to participate in Frontex (the European border agency) and its “Fortress Europe” policies. Will you challenge these policies? I certainly think the EU has often failed dismally to strike the right balance between border security and solidarity with people fleeing from war, poverty and the effects of global climate change. I am a proud pro-European, but that doesn’t mean my view of the EU is uncritical and I’ve never been afraid to say so. My values of international solidarity and openness don’t stop at the borders of Europe – they extend across the whole world. Human life always has equal value, no matter where that person comes from. Will you support an amnesty for undocumented migrants resident in the UK? We should always treat people with compassion and dignity, and we must place those values at the heart of everything we do when it comes to immigration. People in this country without documentation are often asylum seekers fleeing from horrific conditions and I want to see them treated with the human dignity they deserve. I would want to listen in more detail to expert opinion and feedback on the specific question of whether an amnesty is the right approach, but the principles of human dignity and compassion must always guide everything we do. Anything else you’d like Labour members, supporters and affiliates to know about what your leadership/deputy leadership would mean for migrants and migration policy? I am the living, breathing proof that free movement is a wonderful benefit to our country. My Polish mother was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Working on the frontlines of the NHS as an A&E doctor, I work alongside colleagues from across Europe and the rest of the world, and they are a credit to our country. It makes me proud to be British. But years of Tory government has created a literal Hostile Environment for migrants in this country. The drawbridge is being pulled up, and the rights of a whole generation of people to travel freely and live, love and work across Europe is being taken away. That is a tragedy, but it also means those of us who are proud of our outward-looking, progressive, internationalist values must fight even harder to protect and extend them. The fight starts now, and as your Deputy Leader (or even if I’m not!), I promise I will always be there fighting alongside you for those values with everything I’ve got.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_local_16/content_707.html": "When the water has been turned off, the water flow can disturb sediment in the pipes, which can then cause the water to appear to be dark in colour. I have been in contact with Thames Water regarding this and they have assured me that it is not harmful.\nWith the colder weather, Thames Water have also advised the following to help prevent water leaks: • Check pipes – thaw frozen pipes with a hot water bottle or a towel soaked in water • Bleed the radiators – use a radiator key to open the valve and release trapped air • Look after your central heating – get your boiler serviced often and keep the heating on low when not at home • Find your stop tap – these are usually found under the kitchen sink. Turn right to tighten and left to loosen • Keep a plumber on hand – keep details of a reputable plumber on hand and make sure to check home insurance cover In the instance that you see a leak, you can report it to Thames Water here, then phone a plumber immediately. Please do keep an eye on my Twitter, where I am posting updates on the water issues as they arise. The end of 2020 brought the news that we’d been waiting for - the first vaccine was approved for use in the UK. I’m hugely grateful to all the scientists who have made this happen. Around the world they’ve been working non-stop – just like our frontline healthcare professionals and key workers - to put a stop to this virus and allow us to get on with life as normal. Now another milestone in the vaccination programme is happening on our doorstep. St George’s is one of four sites participating in a new study to assess the safety and immune response of the Oxford-AstraZenaca jab in healthy children aged 6-17 years old. Building on previous trials of the vaccine, which have shown that it is safe, produces strong immune system responses, and has high efficacy in all adults, this trial will assess if children and young adults make a good immune response with the vaccine. I recognise that some have concerns about the vaccine, and dangerous myths circulate on social media – it’s simply not good enough to just ignore them and hope they go away. Labour has offered to work with ministers to tackle online harms. And we can all play our part in putting friends and family members at ease by reminding them that we can trust the NHS to take care of us in these difficult times. If the vaccine is good enough for scientists and the regulator, it’s good enough for my family and I. Indeed, I have joined together with a cross-party group of MPs, encouraging everyone to take up the vaccine. The video can be viewed here. We won’t see changes overnight and we still need to look out for our communities. Let's regain the spirit of coming together like we did in the first days of the pandemic and work to eradicate this virus.\nTeachers and school teams are doing a phenomenal job, and I know that digital poverty is a real worry for them, as well as for families across Tooting. Early on in the pandemic, Labour called for a set of measures that would see a mass roll-out of devices and internet access to students currently struggling to learn online, alongside steps such as ‘zero-rating’ of educational websites to ensure data charges are not putting barriers on access to education during lockdown.\nThe digital divide risks failing a generation. I am so pleased to have been able to help close this gap. I know that the Climate and Ecological Emergency (CEE) Bill is one of interest to many people here in Tooting. On 9th February, the CEE Bill was debated in a thirty-minute adjournment debate. Adjournment debates are spaces at the end of the Parliamentary day when MPs can debate a specific topic. As you may know, the CEE Bill is a Private Members Bill (Presentation Bill), meaning that it does not involve a debate or a vote in Parliament, but rather it is a way of drawing attention to an issue. I support the principles of this Bill and will therefore continue to support Parliamentary measures that seek to implement many of the principles laid out in the Bill. Indeed, I have already supported several amendments to the Environment Bill in order to improve it, such as Clause 2 for environmental targets on particulate matter and Clause 7 for Environmental Improvement Plans. I will absolutely continue to support strong and effective amendments to the Environment Bill when it returns to the House of Commons in due course. The climate crisis is an imminent threat to current and future generations. Please know that I am committed to holding the Government to account on their approach to climate change. As puppy prices soar across the UK, I am aware of concerns with the recent rise of dog thefts in our community, with incidents taking place particularly on and around Tooting Common. Perpetrators have been using a number of tactics, including snatching leads from dog owners’ hands, using dog whistles to attract dogs roaming off-lead, and impersonating RSPCA employees to gain access to dogs. One strategy involves approaching people walking their dogs and informing them that their dog resembles an animal that has been reported lost, before asking to scan the dog’s microchip in their van. Once near the van, dogs are being separated from their unsuspecting owners before driving away. The RSPCA reminds that their officers will always be wearing uniforms bearing the charity’s logo and will be carrying identification, and asks that any member of the public who believes someone is impersonating an officer report the incident to the RSPCA and to local police. Suspicious activity – including being approached with questions about your dog, asking for photographs to be taken of your dog – should also be reported. I have written to Inspector Barrie Capper, Head of Wandsworth Neighbourhood Policing Team, asking them to take action to protect our pets and tackle this awful crime. In the meantime, Blue Cross have provided a helpful list of actions you can take to help keep your dog safe.\nClick here for more information. Local residents living or passing through Rackham Mews in Furzedown may have seen the large fly-tip that occurred earlier in the week. Understandably, this is very unpleasant for those who live near this area and I have therefore written to Paul Chadwick, Director of Environment and Community Services at Wandsworth Council, as well as notifying the local councillors of the issue in the hope that this can be rectified as soon as possible. Please be assured that I will keep local resident updated of the progress on this. Furzedown Police are currently appealing for witnesses, so if you have any information about this fly-tip, please do email [email protected] or message them via Twitter. As you will know, a South African variant of Covid-19 has arrived in the UK. This new Covid variant has now been detected in CR4 (Merton). Residents in CR4 are no different to us in neighbouring Tooting (SW16 and SW17). We use the same shops, the same hospital, and the same parks, so if it’s there, it could very easily be here. This will be the same across all affected areas. As a matter of urgency, the Government needs to launch widespread testing in neighbouring postcodes. This is the only way to see how widespread these new variants are. I have written to the Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock MP, the Director of Public Health at Wandsworth Council, Shannon Katiyo, and the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Council, Paul Martin, to ask about plans to launch testing in neighbouring postcodes. While I press for action on this, we need to make sure we’re all doing everything we can to keep ourselves and each other safe. It’s absolutely vital that we minimise our social contact to prevent the spread of this new variant within our community. Please think twice before leaving home, and when you do leave, please continue to adhere to social distancing. Together, we will get through this. Earlier this week I met with local small business owners to hear the issues affecting them.\nFrom the insufficient support available to businesses that are non-direct ratepayers, to a lack of flexibility from landlords regarding rental payments, it is clear that the challenges Tooting small business owners are experiencing are considerable. Their resilience in the face of adversity is a credit to our community. The concerns shared will inform my actions to ensure that small businesses remain the beating heart of Tooting. Please check back here for updates, and keep an eye on my Facebook and Twitter pages for announcements of further events. In light of the upcoming Fire Safety Bill, I would to thank every resident who has written to me with their concerns on this and for continuing to keep me updated on the cladding issues affecting their property. I recognise what an exceptionally difficult time this is and appreciate how much anxiety the cladding proposals are causing to many leaseholders.\nOn more than fifteen occasions, Ministers promised that leaseholders would not be landed with the costs of remedial works. Yet, people are still being put at risk, trapped in flammable buildings for a third lockdown, with leaseholders placed in an impossible position and promises broken. It is evident that the Government’s handling of the cladding crisis has lacked any sense of grip or urgency. For this reason, the Labour Party have tabled an Opposition Day Debate on cladding for Monday, which will subsequently bring forward a vote that will call for leaseholders to be protected from the costs of remediating their blocks with dangerous cladding. The party will also be tabling a number of amendments to the Fire Safety Bill that will aim to protect leaseholders from unfair costs through the power of the law. I am aware that many residents have been in touch to request that I support the McPartland and Smith amendment, which provides welcome clarity on the specific costs that would be prevented from being passed on to leaseholders. Labour has sought to go further on this. As currently drafted, the McPartland and Smith amendment would not have covered blocks like Grenfell - where flammable cladding has been added at some stage following the building of the block. It only applies to defects in the original design of buildings. The Labour Party’s amendment would ensure that the cost of fire safety problems from refurbishment jobs, like the cladding on Grenfell Tower, cannot be passed on to leaseholders. Labour’s amendments also include new clauses so that the Bill protects leaseholders from the day it comes into law, instead of an unknown date in the future. I would like to thank my colleagues in the Labour Party, Sarah Jones MP, Nick Thomas-Symonds MP, Thangam Debbonaire MP and Mike Amesbury MP for their hard work and commitment to addressing this large injustice on a national scale. If any residents have any further queries on this issue, please do not hesitate to get in touch to discuss this further. In the meantime, I hope this post assures you of the steps myself and the Labour Party are taking to protect tenants and leaseholders during this cladding crisis. I recently raised residents' concerns about damage to our beloved Tooting Common with Mr Neil Blackley, Head of Parks at Enable Leisure and Culture and have since received a response on this important issue I am told comprehensive is in plan to return the Common to its pre-pandemic state, while keeping as much as possible open for public use. Initial works will target the worst affected areas, and will see the soil replenished and grass seeds planted. While these works are scheduled to commence in the spring, it will be a number of years before this much-loved part of Tooting is restored. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

If you are yet to receive either your first or second dose, please do so as soon as possible. To help get Tooting vaccinated, the Pearl Chemist Vaccination Centre is now offering a walk-in clinic for those aged 18+ at St Boniface Church on Mitcham Road (Monday to Saturday 9-5pm). Appointments are available for first doses as well as second doses. Second doses can be given eight weeks after the first. Any questions can be directed to Pearl Chemist on 0208 049 6640. As you will most likely be aware, coronavirus cases are currently rising exponentially due to the Delta variant. The situation in Wandsworth remains serious. We currently have a local rate of 238.7 cases per 100,000 people - well above the national average. While the vaccine is giving added protection by reducing deaths and hospitalisations, it is important to bear in mind that it does not eradicate transmission and those who have been vaccinated can still become unwell with coronavirus. Data available from the Government suggests that some areas within Tooting have a higher infection rate than the Wandsworth average of 238.7 cases per 100,000 and these are:\nWhile we need not panic, we should remain careful. A reminder that symptoms of coronavirus include: loss of taste or smell; temperature exceeding 37 degrees; new and persistent cough. Other common symptoms also include feeling tired and a headache. Those experiencing these symptoms should book a free PCR test as soon as possible here. Those aged 18 or over are encouraged to take up the offer of a vaccine. Appointments can be booked here. Information about local walk-in clinics is available here. Unlike previously, second doses of the vaccine are available after eight weeks and many walk-in centres will vaccinate those who bring along their vaccination card. 1 in 3 people who have coronavirus are asymptomatic, so twice weekly testing is another way to keep ourselves and others safe. Lateral flow tests can be ordered for free here. I am in regular contact with NHS England and South West London CCG, who oversee the local coronavirus response. If you are a Tooting resident in need of assistance, please do not hesitate to email [email protected] and please keep an eye on my website and social media pages for further updates. On Saturday, the official UEFA Euro 2020 cup came to the Kings Head in Tooting Bec, the day of England’s historic 4-0 quarter-final win against Ukraine. It was my pleasure to offer two lucky people, plus five guests each, the chance to win VIP access and the opportunity to have their photo taken with the trophy, with raffle ticket proceeds going to Dons Local Action Group. Of all the places UEFA could choose to send the trophy, it’s fantastic that they chose here in Tooting! This tournament has brought much needed positivity and togetherness to our community, and it was fantastic to see the excitement of those lucky enough to meet the trophy. Fingers crossed for a win at the semi-final on Tuesday. We are all rooting for you, England! On 21st June it was announced that Balham Station would be closed to outbound passengers at peak travel times until December 2021, to undertake essential escalator repairs at the station. I met with Transport for London to outline my significant concerns. As a result of this, it was agreed there would be a week-long trial at Balham Station, with the staircase remaining open for use throughout the day, permitting onward travel from the station. This trial began on Monday 28th June. I am thrilled to say this trial was successful and TfL have now confirmed that Balham Station is to remain open while these essential works are ongoing! While this is undoubtedly great news and will ease the worries of the many local residents and commuters who regularly use this station, it is important to remember that - with only one staircase available - social distancing at peak travel times remains a valid concern. As such, to ensure that Balham Station remains open, and we keep ourselves and each other safe, please allow extra time for travel through the station. It is with a massive smile that I offer my congratulations to Kim Leadbeater on being elected as Member of Parliament for Batley and Spen! Kim’s campaign has been marred by bitterness and threatening behaviour. As a woman in politics, I know first-hand the impact this can have. As such, I would like to pay tribute to Kim for her resilient and positive campaigning. I would also like to say a huge thank you to all the Labour staffers and activists who have worked so hard in Batley in the face of such intimidation. We owe them so much. I look forward to welcoming Kim Leadbeater MP to Parliament. With the re-opening of non-essential retail, I took the opportunity to shine a spotlight on the local businesses/business owners that make our vibrant community such a fantastic place to live and work. The easing of national Government restrictions marks an important point in our recovery - our community and high street have so much to offer, so for six weeks I showcased the stores, restaurants, cafes, and other small businesses that make Tooting what it is! A huge thank you to every single business, business owner, employee, and customer who got behind the campaign. The past year has been challenging, so to see our community come together to support the local economy has been truly heartwarming. While this week marks the final instalment (for now) of Spotlight Saturdays, I will continue to find new ways to shine a bright light on Tooting and our wonderful community. Wandsworth is in the top 5 for vaccination rates across London! This is a great step forward and I am proud of everyone here in Tooting who has taken the steps to protect themselves and others by receiving their jab. However, we still have a way to go before everyone is protected against coronavirus. We need to keep pushing to ensure that those who can do so, are vaccinated as soon as possible. Information on how to book your vaccination appointment can be found here. It is also vital that if, for any reason, you have to change or cancel your vaccine appointment that you let the GP surgery or vaccination centre that you appointment is booked with know. You can manage your vaccination appointment here. If you are still unsure about having the jab or have any questions, more information can be found on the vaccine and answers to many common concerns on Wandsworth Council’s website here. I was deeply concerned - as I know many local residents were - to hear of plans to close Balham station to outward passengers from next Monday until December 2021. While I recognise the scheduled repairs to the escalator are essential works, it is important to me that residents are not inconvenienced by the planned updates. Indeed, I also appreciate that it was alarming for many to learn that the closure was to begin in less than a week, lasting for such an extended period of time. It is my understanding that the decision to close Balham station to outward travelling passengers was taken after a trial closure of the downward escalator indicated that use of the staircase at peak travel times was resulting in over-crowding and therefore social distancing was difficult. I called a meeting with Transport for London to outline my concerns and discuss alternatives, such as more staff at the station to support social distancing at peak travel times. I am pleased to announce that as a result of this meeting, TfL have agreed to undertake a week-long trial at Balham Station, which will see the staircase open for use throughout the day and outward travel therefore possible from the station. The trial will commence on Monday 28th June and last 3-4 days. Following the trial, TfL will assess whether outward travel from Balham during the planned escalator repairs is viable. During this time - and beyond should the trial prove successful - I would recommend additional time is allowed for travel through Balham Station. By doing so, we increase the likelihood of a successful trial. More importantly, we can all play our part to ensure all residents can travel safely. Please check back for further updates on this situation. The work of biomedical scientists and laboratory staff is incredibly valuable - and this has never been clearer than since the outset of the coronavirus pandemic. Often overlooked as a profession, I was pleased to join others in thanking those working in healthcare sciences. For every coronavirus test conducted, a biomedical scientist has been behind it, working hard to ensure PCR tests are returned safely. I would like to thank, in particular, our incredible microbiology team at St George’s. Working in A&E, I know just how much our NHS relies on the incredible efforts of lab staff. I have included photos of the microbiology team at St George’s, featuring Chris James, a Specialist Biomedical Scientist in Biochemistry who has worked at St George’s for 9 years, and Silva, a Specialist Biomedical Scientist in Medical Microbiology and Virology who has worked St George’s Hospital for the past 4 years, after moving to the UK from Portugal. Silva’s words about her work as a biomedical scientist are impactful and I hope everyone is able to recognise the incredible work they do. “Being a biomedical scientist is an extremely impactful role in healthcare. Even though it’s not patient facing, our work and the speed and accuracy with which we can produce results is essential for patient care.” As you will no doubt be aware, the Covid-19 situation remains serious, with the Delta variant spreading rapidly throughout the country. One of the most important steps we can take to stop the spread of the coronavirus is to get vaccinated as soon as possible. For this reason, a range of walk-in vaccination sites have been launched across South West London. People aged over 18 are invited to drop into the Tooting and Mitcham United F.C. vaccination centre on Saturday 19th or Sunday 20th 9am - 8pm, to receive their first or second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Unvaccinated over 40s and over 40s who have received their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine before mid-April can also head down to the Roehampton Vaccination Centre, located in the Queen Mary’s Hospital car park, on Sunday between 8am and 7.45pm to receive their second dose. Together we can stop the spread of Covid-19. Details of additional walk-in vaccine centres in South West London are available here. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Trains in the morning evening peaks, to and from Central London, have all seen a worsening of their \"on-time percentage\" in the last six months compared to the same period of 2023. The full breakdown of delays at each station is below. It is shocking to see that, not only are trains late at some stations late half the time, but that there has been a steady decline from an already-unacceptable level of lateness last year. Particularly concerning are the figures at Tooting station, where over half of services were late despite there being only two services per hour on that line.\nSome of the worst performing services include: 8:05 from Balham (8:07 from Wandsworth Common) to Victoria - 88% late (Southern) 18:12 from Waterloo to Earlsfield - 81% late (South Western) 8:21 from Balham to Victoria - 79% late (Southern) 8:40 from Balham (8:42 from Wandsworth Common) to Victoria - 76% late (Southern) 8:13 from Tooting to London Blackfriars - 70% late (Thameslink) Local commuters deserve better than the shoddy service they are currently receiving from Southern, South Western and Thameslink. I look forward to the Government's plans to bring our local rail services back into public control, so that our trains are always run with the interests of the people who use them at heart. Eight years ago today, I was selected as the Tooting Labour candidate for the by-election caused by Sadiq becoming a candidate for Mayor of London.\nIt has been a huge honour and privilege to serve as the representative for the community in which I was born and raised. My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has supported me on this incredible journey.\nThis morning, I invited residents from Tooting to share a cup of tea and a biscuit at my local coffee morning. As the local MP, I am here to help and my door is always open.\nEvery corner of Wandsworth thrives with culture and creativity. Our art, food and history are what makes our community great.\nThat's why I'm so proud that Wandsworth has been selected as London's Borough of Culture in 2025. Thanks to everyone who has worked to make this happen.\nSending my best wishes to everyone in Tooting and around the world. I hope you have a blessed Ramadan.\nSpecial thoughts and prayers going to Palestinians and all Muslims around the world enduring hardship and suffering at this time. This week marks International Women’s Day. It’s a time to celebrate all the brilliant women who make our community, the incredible place it is.\nToday, I brought together a group of fantastic leading women in business and community organisations. Their stories were inspiring and shows what women can do when we support each other. Was great to be at the BATCA Community Awards celebrating the heroes who strive to make our area better.\nWandsworth Labour are freezing council tax for another year to help families through the cost-of-living crisis.\nAt the same time, we're improving services and building a better Wandsworth. My South London Press column is out today! As it was Valentine's Day this week, I wrote a love letter to my local area.\nAcross Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting, there is such an amazing range of people and culture locally. Read my article here👇 https://londonnewsonline.co.uk/ Wandsworth is bursting with creativity and culture. Our art, food and history are what makes our community such a great place to live.\nToday, Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney, and Marsha de Cordova, MP for Battersea, and I have written to Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, to support Wandsworth’s bid to be London Borough of Culture 2025. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Recently, it was announced that free school meals would be available during school holidays for eligible children, while parents of pupils on free school meals will also have access to uniform vouchers to help cover this expense. With the Tory cost-of-living crisis, this is a hugely beneficial scheme for hard-working families across the borough.\nThis is the difference that Labour makes in power and I look forward to continued close cooperation with the new council administration in order to make our communities even better places to live. For further details, see here. In September, I’ll be taking on the London to Brighton cycle along with Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney. We’re fundraising as part of the Time for a Change appeal to help support St George’s Hospital Charity in their work to provide assistance to patients, their families, and the staff who care for them across St George’s Hospital, Queen Mary’s Hospital, and community sites.\nIt’s a 55-mile route from Clapham to Brighton, and we’ll be joined by other fantastic #TeamGeorges participants. Neither of us have done this before and it’s a big challenge for us. The Time for a Change Appeal is supporting children’s services at St George’s Hospital. We know that St George's Trust provides absolutely outstanding care for patients and incredible support for families, but sadly the facilities often don’t reflect this level of care. If you want to support us, our JustGiving link is here: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/fleurandrosenal2b\nAll too often, children are stuck on long waiting lists for mental health treatment and thousands of people are having their referrals closed before an appointment.\nThis Tory Government caused the crisis in mental health services - when will they fix it?\nOn the 75th birthday of the NHS, I joined the amazing team at St George’s Hospital, to say, a big thank you for the incredible care and compassion they show every day.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_all_35/content_742.html": "|\nThroughout the ongoing pandemic I have been inundated with emails from parents, school staff, students, and residents alike who have taken the time to outline their views on school closures. Some are concerned about safety, with many teachers and students facing the very real and grave possibility of bringing the virus home to vulnerable family members. Some are concerned about the impact a further lockdown could have on children's wellbeing and their education. And some are concerned about the challenges school closures will cause for working families.\nAs I am sure you will agree, the current situation is incredibly serious. This virus is spreading exponentially across the country, many people are in hospital, and too many people are tragically losing their loved ones. We know how difficult another lockdown will be, but I believe that national measures are necessary. As the Shadow Minister for Mental Health and a working mother, it is safe to say the impact of extended school closures on children’s well-being and working families cannot be overstated. This is why Labour called on Government to do everything possible to avoid it. Boris Johnson must immediately set out clear plans for every child to return safely to school as soon as possible - and be honest with parents about the timetable for this. It is also critical that young people’s education is safeguarded throughout this period of remote learning, and every student must have access to the devices they need to learn. Schools and families can request free mobile data increases for students without broadband or who cannot afford extra data for devices. More information on this scheme can be found here: get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/about-increasing-mobile-data. It is vital the Government prevent disadvantaged families being priced out of education. As many families will agree, working parents face huge challenges in balancing work, childcare, and supporting their child’s education. They must have the support they need to do this. Nobody should have to choose between their job and supporting their children, so the Government - and employers - must clearly promote the use of the job retention scheme for those unable to work due to family commitments. Please rest assured that myself and Labour Party colleagues will continue to hold the Government to account on these issues as we all navigate the ongoing pandemic. Stay safe, Rosena. With the Officer for National Statistics estimating that 1 in 30 Londoners now have coronavirus, and the Mayor of London declaring a major incident across all London hospitals, the ongoing situation could not be more serious. NHS services in the capital are at risk of becoming overwhelmed in just a matter of days.\nWorking as a doctor in St George’s A&E department, I understand how emotionally drained healthcare workers are feeling. Indeed, ‘overwhelmed’ was the word used by nurses, consultants and registrars at our local hospital in Tooting when they were interviewed for a special report by the BBC, with one senior staff nurse saying she has “never felt so demoralised in her life.” The report conducted by BBC London's Political Correspondent, Karl Mercer, showed the heartbreaking situation in high dependency units at St George’s. The hospital has now had to increase intensive care capacity from 60 to 120, the vast majority of which are for coronavirus patients. Wandsworth alone recorded a further 2394 cases this week – the 13th highest in London. Whilst better times are on the horizon with the recent announcement of the approved Moderna vaccine, I can only implore residents to continue to follow latest public health advice on the virus to ensure we can protect as many lives as possible. On behalf of all my colleagues working on the frontline, please stay at home. The ongoing pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we live our lives, and it is understandable that this will have an impact on our mental health.\nAs we enter a national lockdown, it is vital that we all take care of our mental health. There are many brilliant services available to offer advice and support, and there is never any shame in asking for help. If you are facing a mental health crisis, you can call the Samaritans on 116 123, any time, day or night. If you are not comfortable speaking over the phone, you can also text SHOUT to 85258. They also have an advice page offering tips on how to take care of your mental health during the pandemic. If you are aged between 13-25, you can call The Mix on 0808 808 4994, with any question. They will connect you with experts and peers who will give you the support and advice you need. You can also phone Childline on 0800 1111, or speak directly to a counsellor here. For the LGBT+ community, you can call Switchboard on 0300 330 0630 or email [email protected]. All phone operators identify as LGBT+. Stonewall are also available on 08000 50 2020 for advice on a range of issues. If you are facing domestic abuse, you can call Refuge on 0808 2000 247, or access their online chat feature here. Women’s Aid live chat feature is also open here. Both of these websites have an option to quickly exit their sites and wipe them from your browser history. I am aware that many local residents are concerned about the proposed Tooting Triangle development. Plans to upgrade the site’s facilities and amenities – replacing the artificial football pitch with a modern surface, and building new changing rooms, public toilets, a children’s play area, and a café – are welcome. However, the proposal to fund the improvements via a 25-year lease of the new facilities to TFL Leisure – a private company – is more controversial.\nThe fence set to be constructed around the new football pitch, and the lack of clarity as to whether the upgraded children’s Stay & Play facility will remain free to use, have prompted concerns that the development will put public land behind a literal paywall. I am sure you will agree that if the recent lockdowns have taught us anything, it is that there is a need for more publicly accessible green spaces – not less. As it stands, the proposed development would see a reduction in the area available to the Balham Boxing Club compared with their current provision. Issues have also been raised regarding the smaller size of the female changing rooms compared to the men's, and the impact floodlighting could have on the Triangle’s resident bat population, among other things. I understand that discussions on the proposed development are ongoing. Please be assured that I am keeping a close eye on this evolving situation - we all want what's best for our local community. I have written to the Housing Secretary to outline residents concerns about EWS1 forms and cladding. The latest NHS data shows that from July to September this year the number of urgent referrals for children and young people suffering with eating disorders has almost doubled from the same period in 2019.\nOn 9 December, Alex Norris MP and I spoke with Dr Agnes Ayton, Chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists Eating Disorder Faculty, mental health campaigner Hope Virgo, the Centre for Mental Health, Beat and Young Minds UK to discuss eating disorders and explore ways to alleviate them. We urgently need a public mental health strategy which supports people with eating disorders. Christmas can be an especially difficult period, and it is vital that we remain sensitive to the fact that the focus on food and indulgence can cause individuals suffering with eating disorders real distress. Young people struggling with their mental health need urgent support. Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government for it. I look forward to the New Year, where I will be looking to engage further with the sector as well as individuals with lived experience of eating disorders.\nA number of local residents have reached out to ask me why my name was not included in a letter signed by 61 out of 650 MPs about the very concerning deportation flight to Jamaica. I wanted to explain how the process works.\nFirstly, let me say that this was an incredibly serious matter, which is why I was pleased to see my colleague, Holly Lynch MP, the Shadow Immigration Minister, send an urgent letter to the Government raising concerns. I added my voice to her letter by writing to Priti Patel myself - requesting that the points Holly Lynch raised were answered urgently. A copy of that letter is below:\nAs a member of the Labour Shadow Cabinet, my role is to intervene in matters related to mental health (because I am the Shadow Minister for Mental Health). Members of the Shadow Cabinet do not speak in debates, sign letters, sign EDMs or intervene in matters which are not related to their role. This rule has been in place for as long as I know, it was the same when Jeremy Corbyn was leader.\nI have noticed that my name was put on a list along with 12 colleagues, suggesting we were the only people not to sign this letter. No member of the Labour Shadow Cabinet signed the letter, indeed, almost three quarters of Labour MPs didn't sign the letter. Does that mean that they don't care? No, of course not. Sometimes they miss the deadline to sign, sometimes they can't sign, sometimes they make representations in different ways. It's very disappointing that some would single out me and 12 other colleagues, suggesting we were the only ones not to sign - simply to fit their political agenda. My background has seen me work in war torn countries, disaster zones and refugee camps helping the world's most marginalised and vulnerable people. I always care deeply about these issues and to suggest otherwise is incorrect. I'll continue to liaise with my colleagues in the Home Affairs team with regards to this, and other important issues. The creation of EWS1 forms and concerns about cladding are issues I know a lot of Tooting residents are facing. Everyone deserves the safety and security of home and I am shocked that so many local residents have found themselves in this situation. Following discussions with local people, I have written to the Financial Conduct Authority, Aviva, the National Housing and Building Council and the Shadow Secretary of State for Housing. You can see these letters below. Today Wandsworth Council has announced that it is suspending the Low Traffic Neighbourhoods that it implemented across our community. Wandsworth Council failed from the start to communicate the implementation of LTNs to local residents, and instead of listening and reviewing they have now decided to pull them out because do not want the fuss.\nAs I have said before, I was not consulted and nor were local residents on these changes. They were brought in overnight and pitted neighbour against neighbour, causing fierce rows and division. The Council should be ashamed. When the going got tough, they tried to pass the buck, and now Wandsworth Council is wasting tens of thousands of pounds by scrapping the LTNs entirely. The Conservative Cabinet Member for Transport's position is untenable. Attention will now turn to the TfL Streetspace scheme on Upper Tooting Road, Balham High Road and Tooting High Street. I know that this is a scheme that has its issues and needs reviewing. However, I am confident that TfL want to make it work for our local environment. Contrast TfL's response with that of Wandsworth Council. TfL is taking feedback on board, they are hosting a virtual public meeting next week to gather feedback from local people and I am meeting with a TfL representative next week to discuss the scheme. I will be taking him to meet some of the affected businesses and discussing the issues emergency services have had. TfL evidently want the scheme to work and they deserve credit for trying. I have been clear from the start that I am supportive of schemes which encourage cycling and make our streets safer. We do that by engaging in polite and respectful discussion to bring about changes collectively. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

My figures show that last year, nearly 20,000 new mothers were turned away from mental health services. Maternal mental health services are being rationed. This is despite maternal illness costing the whole of society £8.1 billion a year. It is an absolute scandal. The 8,500 new staff Labour will recruit are vital to solving this crisis. Read the full article here\nIn recent weeks, thousands of people across south London and south-east England have signed my petition calling on NHS England to keep children's cancer services at St George's Hospital, including many parents who have told me how worried they are about this proposed closure.\nLast week, NHS England launched its consultation on the future of services at St George’s Hospital and I want to make sure that we have every chance to defend and protect our local services. Keeping services at St George's is best for our patients and best for the NHS, but this can only happen with the support of people in the community who will be affected by this decision. Please spare a few minutes to complete to consultation questionnaire and share your views with the NHS. The consultation is running until Monday 18 December. See full details of the consultation here and please share this as widely as possible with friends and family here.\nPolice forces across England are set to stop attending many incidents concerning mental health under a new National Partnership Agreement: Right Care, Right Person.\nThe Government's announcement leaves far too many questions unanswered and fails to tackle the root problem of lengthy NHS waiting lists in mental health services. I have written to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, asking him to come clean on what action he is taking to tackle mental health waiting lists. Read my full letter here:\nOn the 75th birthday of the NHS, I joined the amazing team at St George’s Hospital, to say, a big thank you for the incredible care and compassion they show every day. I'm proud to work side-by-side with the team.\nToday, I appeared on BBC Question Time, where I held the Government to account on the shameful Rwanda policy, their neglect of the NHS, and the issues surrounding Thames Water.\nJoining Billy Bragg’s ‘Left Field’ stage at Glastonbury, I spoke about the importance of protecting our NHS. It’s crucial that NHS staff are supported in their work and that patients can access timely treatment.\nIt was great to join Nish Kumar and Coco Khan on Pod Save the UK. We spoke about working on the frontline during the pandemic, Labour’s bold mental health plan, and pitying Matt Hancock.\nSee a clip of the Podcast here:\nOur local NHS board have announced that Trinity Medical Centre will close on 31st July. The decision to close the surgery is deeply disappointing and I am concerned that it will leave thousands of local residents scrambling to find another GP, including vulnerable patients.\nAt a time when local residents are already waiting weeks to see a GP, this decision is a shocking, short-sighted solution for users of the surgery. People will find themselves trying to squeeze onto the books of existing practices, travelling further to see a GP, losing the strong and trusted relationships with their GPs they've built over time. The blame for this decision lies squarely with this Conservative Government who have imposed 13 years of underfunding and neglect on our local NHS services. I have already called on the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, to meet with the community to see the impact of this decision first-hand and to reverse this disastrous decision. Today, I proudly led Labour's opposition debate on mental health and put forward our plan to transform mental health services across the country. It includes more staff, specialists in schools, hubs in communities, treatment within a month. Today, I called on the Health Secretary to get his act together on our failing mental health services. Across mental health services, children are being failed, police are spending hours waiting with children in crisis in A&E, staff are overworked are under-resourced. It's time for the Health Secretary to get a grip or get out of the way. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

However, this list is not exhaustive and anyone who is severely affected by a mental health problem is encouraged to contact their GP if they have not yet been invited to receive the vaccine. If you are a carer for a person with a severe mental illness, you could also be eligible. Click here for more information on eligibility or contact your GP. If you are eligible, to book or manage an existing vaccination appointment, click here. The ongoing pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we live our lives, and it is understandable that this will have an impact on our mental health.\nAs we enter a national lockdown, it is vital that we all take care of our mental health. There are many brilliant services available to offer advice and support, and there is never any shame in asking for help. If you are facing a mental health crisis, you can call the Samaritans on 116 123, any time, day or night. If you are not comfortable speaking over the phone, you can also text SHOUT to 85258. They also have an advice page offering tips on how to take care of your mental health during the pandemic. If you are aged between 13-25, you can call The Mix on 0808 808 4994, with any question.

The latest NHS data shows that from July to September this year the number of urgent referrals for children and young people suffering with eating disorders has almost doubled from the same period in 2019.\nOn 9 December, Alex Norris MP and I spoke with Dr Agnes Ayton, Chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists Eating Disorder Faculty, mental health campaigner Hope Virgo, the Centre for Mental Health, Beat and Young Minds UK to discuss eating disorders and explore ways to alleviate them. We urgently need a public mental health strategy which supports people with eating disorders. Christmas can be an especially difficult period, and it is vital that we remain sensitive to the fact that the focus on food and indulgence can cause individuals suffering with eating disorders real distress. Young people struggling with their mental health need urgent support. Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government for it. I look forward to the New Year, where I will be looking to engage further with the sector as well as individuals with lived experience of eating disorders. Even before the pandemic hit, the case for investing in this kind of support was clear. Coronavirus has exacerbated the existing crisis in mental health. Many NHS and social care staff have been scared of going to work, and they have lost patients and colleagues. It has been heartbreaking to witness the toll this virus has taken on staff mental health. Current support is not good enough, and without a tailored, fast-tracked service for staff who have faced death and despair every day for over three months, our frontline heroes will continue to be failed. We need to care for our carers. It is time for the Government to give back to those who have sacrificed so much to keep our loved ones safe. Unless our staff are protected, they cannot continue their vital work of keeping us all safe. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_archives_03-2020/content_434.html": "|\nThe consequences of not having adequate personal protective equipment for NHS staff are devastatingBarely a day goes by without pictures online of frontline staff fashioning protection out of clinical waste bags. We need to ensure NHS staff are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients.\nThe challenge that coronavirus poses to our society is unprecedented. It is a scary and worrying time, especially for our NHS. Having worked as a frontline A&E doctor this weekend, in my local hospital, I am increasingly concerned that our health service may buckle under the increased strain that Covid-19 has brought. Our only priority must be to protect lives. Every possible resource we have should be dedicated to that single objective. Crucially, our NHS and healthcare workers on the frontlines must be given whatever resources they need to tackle this and to save lives. It’s disheartening then, that basic resources are in short supply. Full personal protective equipment (PPE) is vital to not only protect frontline staff, but also to limit the spread of infection to our loved ones and to our patients. The Government have known this crisis was coming for weeks, and yet they still have not been fully prepared for it. A country like the UK should not be having to ask manufacturing companies to switch production to provide emergency ventilators, or for NHS workers to have to go without PPE. The first part of my shift this weekend was spent looking for the correct masks and aprons - this is happening to frontline workers ahead of every shift, across the country. While we would all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. The consequences of this for NHS staff are devastating. There’s a feeling amongst many frontline staff that protective equipment is already being rationed. A few weeks ago, the guidance for healthcare staff treating people with confirmed cases of Covid-19 was to wear a full FFP3 mask as well as gloves and a full apron - now, that guidance has changed and we are told to only wear gloves and a basic surgical mask. Barely a day goes by without pictures online of frontline staff fashioning protection out of clinical waste bags. We need full transparency on decisions and changes to guidance, otherwise concerns will only grow. As this virus spreads, and as more and more people are forced into hospital, NHS workers are going to have to start making very difficult choices because of the limited resources they have available. They are going to have to start deciding who can access the most urgent care, including who is given priority for the last available ventilator - they’ll be making impossible choices about whose lives can be saved. We have already seen this happening in Italy, and it is an unimaginable tragedy for medics who are dedicated to saving lives above all else. The best way to help frontline staff who go to work to save lives, is for everyone else to stay home. We will get through this, together. The Government must take responsibility for providing all the resources and equipment the NHS needs, including vital PPE, for communicating the message on social distancing clearly to the public, and for enforcing it robustly. I welcome the new, more stringent measures announced yesterday – however, as Mike Ashley has shown, there’s still room for people to exploit it. As a country, we must do what will save the most lives. That’s true of the Government, people across the country, and medics on the frontline. The faster we get on top of this disease, the faster our society will be able to tackle this virus, and fewer lives will be lost. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can and we will save lives. Sports Direct has shown exactly what not to do during this pandemic. If we’re to beat coronavirus, we have to be selflessThere seems to be a view amongst some under-70s, that coronavirus doesn’t really affect them and they don’t need to worry too much about it. I’ve listened to 69-year-olds tell me that because they themselves are fit and healthy, that it couldn’t possibly happen to them. Having just done a shift as a doctor in A&E over the weekend, I want to take this opportunity to warn people that this virus does not discriminate by age.\nIt was deeply, deeply eye-opening. Previously healthy people in their thirties and forties were seriously ill, some of them on ventilators. Being young does not grant you immunity to this disease. The symptoms of Covid-19 at its worst, are horrific. There can be no room for complacency. Our health service is facing an unprecedented crisis. There is a limited amount of vital equipment, including personal protective equipment for healthcare workers and precious ventilators. Every extra person in hospital requiring treatment means there are fewer resources available for others. London Covid-19 doctor says soon staff will be forced to choose whose life to saveRosena Allin-Khan, a Labour MP and A&E doctor, reveals ‘heart-wrenching’ decisions facing hospital workers\nRosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting and an A&E doctor, is still working regular shifts. On Sunday she worked at St George’s hospital in her south London constituency. She explains how the coronavirus pandemic has affected staff: I’ve been an A&E doctor for 15 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this before. The departments are quieter because people are staying away from hospital, but the patients are sicker. We’re seeing a distinct rise in the numbers coming in with respiratory symptoms, who are testing Covid-19 positive. On Sunday, very early in the morning, the entire resuscitation department, where the absolute sickest patients go, was full to capacity with patients with breathing difficulties. We had to move other very ill patients to the paediatric resuscitation area to keep them safe. This is only set to get worse. We’re seeing patients now who would have only contracted the virus two weeks ago. In the coming 10 days we expect the entire A&E department will be taken up with suspected Covid-19 patients. Doctors and nurses are brave, and the A&E department is known for being on the frontline and high risk, but there’s a palpable fear among staff for three reasons. Firstly, they’re frightened for their own health and those of the people they love. When I finished my shift yesterday, which was Mother’s Day, I came back to the house and I couldn’t touch or hug my two little girls until I put all my clothes in the wash and had a shower. The second reason is that staff expect, very soon, potentially to have to make heart-wrenching choices about whose life can be saved if we don’t have enough ventilators. That goes counter to everything you’ve ever learned as a doctor or nurse – to make life-and-death decisions, where we could possibly have saved every one of those people, is unimaginable. This is what our colleagues in Italy are living through now. Third, the patterns described thus far for symptoms of coronavirus are not what we’re now seeing in the emergency department. We’re seeing young, previously very healthy people, who are ill in hospital. Some are in their 30s, and they need ventilators to stay alive. Some patients are presenting with abdominal pain, which we hadn’t heard of before. A person can come in and say they have a stomach pain, and they’re put in the “green” area of the department – but then they mention they also have a cough. Everybody should be assumed to be Covid-positive until proven otherwise at this point. There’s also a real concern among staff around the country about personal protective equipment. They either don’t have any, or if they do many feel it’s being rationed. It’s very hard to listen to some colleagues say that as a result of there not being enough equipment to go round, they’re resigned to catching the virus – it’s just a matter of when. On social distancing, the messaging from the government hasn’t been clear enough. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has banned public gatherings of more than two people. It’s clear and easy to understand. There has to be no ambiguity in the language because people’s lives depend on it. Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives. The MP for Tooting has been working in her local hospital where doctors and nurses are already dealing with cases of covid-19. She warns that many of those being treated are in their 30s and 40s.\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan is the MP for Tooting but she is also a practising doctor in A&E. She regularly goes in to do shifts in her local hospital St George's and has been in contact with her colleagues. This Sunday she took a record down for Mirror readers about the situation faced by nurses, doctors and others on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus. She said her latest shift had been a \"deeply, deeply eye-opening\" experience with previously fit and healthy people in their 30s and 40s \"attached to machines, fighting for their lives\". And she has been deeply critical of the approach taken by the government in tackling the spread of the deadly virus. \"The Prime Minister has been blase about this from the start, waiting for others to make decisions so he doesn't have to. It is costing lives,\" she said. Mirror Diary - Sunday 22 March6.30am – Leaving the HouseOn the way to work in A&E, to help out the real heroes of the frontline – the NHS staff who work day-in, day-out to keep us all safe. I am a bit apprehensive after seeing the stories that are being reported about Covid-19 and having spoken to colleagues across the country, but we need to come together at times like these for our communities. 7am – Reporting for DutyJust finished handover, which is when the day shift gets given notes on the patients who have come in overnight. There’s a very real sense that the number of cases are growing extremely quickly, something that will present a real challenge in the coming days and weeks. Some of the sickest patients that have been admitted have been young – they’re in their 30s and 40s, previously fit and well, but now fighting for their lives in Intensive Care (ICU). There was a lot of talk in January that this was a virus just like the flu that only affects older people – that simply isn’t the case. There’s a real sense of apprehension ahead of the shift – we’re all expecting a rocky road ahead in the coming days. 8am- Protective EquipmentThe first part of the shift was spent looking for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – these are masks and aprons that keep those working on the frontlines safe. While we’d all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. Frontline staff across the country are scared. We’re scared that we’re going to lose patients – we have spent years training to save every life that we can. We are scared of passing this deadly virus onto our loved ones because we don’t always have the PPE that we so desperately need. We’re scared that that if we aren’t properly protected, that we run the risk of spreading the virus between patients. It’s vital that people practice social distancing measures properly – crowded areas will only add to the number of cases, and the number of people being admitted into hospitals across the country. In the coming days and weeks, difficult decisions will be made by my colleagues in ICU about who gets a ventilator – it’s that serious. Midday – Resus overwhelmedThe whole of resus is full of patients with respiratory problems – this is the part of A&E where the sickest patients go. Patients are arriving breathless, with crackles so fine in their lungs, you can hardly hear them. Their X-rays show white lungs where normally, they would look clear and black, full of air. Major trauma, such as heart attacks and victims of car crashes, are now being moved into paediatric A&E. The situation around Covid-19 is clearly getting worse by the day. The talk amongst the team is that we feel that we will be overwhelmed in the coming days. I’m going for a refresher course on ventilators for staff – they’re also training new staff on how to use ventilators. The talk is, of course, feeling quite bleak as the day goes on – but this is what we’ve all been trained for. 4pm – Leaving A&EJust leaving A&E now – it’s been a difficult shift and a difficult Mother’s Day. At times like these, we must think about our loved ones - if we want to protect those dearest to us, we must stay indoors. I’ve just called my husband and asked him to let our daughters know that they won’t be able to cuddle me and give me their handmade presents when I get home. Instead, I’ll be getting straight in the shower and throwing my clothes in the washing machine – it is our duty to protect the ones we love. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can, and we will, save lives. Former Labour MEP SEB DANCE explains why he is supporting Rosena Allin-Khan in the Labour deputy leadership race.\nBritain has left the EU. As a former Labour Member of the European Parliament, as a Remainer, and as a proud pro-European, that’s still not an easy thing for me to say – but it’s the reality. There is no longer a campaign to remain. That doesn’t mean that Boris Johnson’s famous lie of “get Brexit done” has suddenly come true. The ongoing negotiations with the EU will continue to define our country’s future for years to come. Perhaps one day the fight to join the EU will come. How soon that time comes depends on what we do next. Pro-Europeans must now fight for a close relationship between the UK and our friends in the EU and ongoing rights for UK citizens. The Labour Party must play a crucial role in that fight. That’s why I’m supporting Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan to become the next deputy leader of Labour. Rosena was elected as the MP for Tooting the week before the EU referendum in 2016. Despite holding a shadow frontbench position, she refused to compromise on her principles or on the promises she’d made to her community, so she broke the whip and voted against triggering Article 50. Considering the shambles that followed Theresa May’s early triggering of Article 50, this has been conclusively demonstrated as the right decision. Rosena was also the first shadow frontbench minister to come out publicly and call for a People’s Vote. This was an incredibly brave thing to do, at a time when Labour MPs and shadow ministers were being pressured not to speak out against the leadership’s position on Brexit. At a time when the leadership of Labour needed a firm push in the right direction, Rosena was the one brave enough to stand up and do it. There are some voices in the Labour Party, who’ll try to convince you that Brexit was the only reason for Labour’s failure at the last general election – that backing a public vote cost us seats in the so-called ‘Red Wall’. But this analysis is deeply misleading, and is simply not supported by the facts. Yes, of course Brexit was a divisive issue, for Labour as much as for anyone else. The reality however, is that the overwhelming majority of Labour voters, members and supporters voted Remain, wanted us to stay in the EU and wanted a public vote on Brexit. That fact is as true of Labour voters in Redcar, Grimsby or Wakefield as it is of Labour voters in Oxford, Islington or Bristol – Labour’s share of the vote went down in 98% of all seats. Labour’s position on Brexit was fatally undermined not because supporting a public vote was the wrong position for our voters, but because the leadership of the party took so long to get to that position. We sat in the middle of the road on the biggest issue of our time and neither side trusted us. We lost trust among all our communities. Rosena knows this – she won’t stop standing up for our internationalist values. I joined the Labour Party because I believe in internationalism and solidarity across borders. So does Rosena. That’s why she’s worked across the world in conflict and disaster zones as a humanitarian doctor, and why she still does shifts in her local hospital as an A&E doctor alongside her work as an MP. So if you are like me – a proud pro-European, an internationalist and a Labour supporter – and if you want someone as deputy leader who’ll stand up for those values, and who’ll fight for our country to maintain the closest possible relationship with the EU, protecting our workers’ rights, our environmental protections, our food standards, our NHS, and most importantly the rights of EU citizens living in the UK – then vote for Doctor Rosena. Together, let’s take Labour forward. Rosena Allin-Khan MP: \"I want to inspire Asians to own their identity”A CANDIDATE in the race for Labour’s deputy leadership has admitted the party “lost trust with voters” following its crushing defeat in the December general election.\nTooting MP Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is up against fellow MPs Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler, Ian Murray and Angela Rayner in the race, triggered by Labour’s huge loss last year. Suffering one of its worst results since 1935, Labour lost dozens of seats which they had held for decades, including a number of constituencies in the Midlands and northern England, which historically tended to support the party. The loss was down to a lack of trust, Allin- Khan believes. “People, quite frankly, didn’t trust us to govern,” the MP told Eastern Eye. “We had a manifesto which I believe was full of good things, but voters didn’t trust us to deliver it.” The party’s stance on Brexit was an additional factor – “we didn’t seem decisive enough” – and the level of anti-Semitism in the party and the way it was subsequently handled “closed a lot of doors”. “I’ve been up and down the country talking to individuals, wondering why Labour lost, and I’ve been told by activists that people didn’t think we had our own house in order,” she said. Today, she said, the most common concern of voters is the NHS, the level of safety on the streets and housing. “We need to show that the hopes and dreams that people have for themselves are the ones that we (Labour) have for them,” the mother-of-two said. Next month’s contest will also see the unveiling of a new Labour leader, after Jeremy Corbyn announced he would be stepping down following the general election last year. Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey are in the running to lead the opposition party. Allin-Khan, however, will not be voicing her support for any of the candidates as she believes the party needs to “heal all divisions (and) unite” after it fared so badly in the election. “When I’m working in A&E and I see kids coming in with lung infections because of mouldy housing or I see kids who have to go to food banks (…) they don’t care if Labour is left, right or centre,” she explained. “So, the most important thing to move forward is to unite and I can show that by not nominating someone for leader.” On her role in the deputy leadership race, Allin-Khan said she was determined to use it as an opportunity to help “ethnic minorities own their identity and be proud of it”. “That is what I want people to feel I embody when they look at me,” she explained. “For me, being in this race, if that is the one thing I get out of this…that other young British Asians can look at me and say, ‘if she can do it, I can do it too’, then that is my job done.” Allin-Khan admitted she had faced prejudice due to her mixed Pakistani-Polish heritage and has received criticism that she “isn’t fully Asian”. In response to the comments, the MP is keen to highlight her mixed heritage does not make her Asian background any less “important, valuable or special.” “I identify with being an Asian woman, in the same way that I am proud to be Polish,” she said. “Some people in the Asian community wonder how Asian I feel because I’m mixed race, but I’m proud to wear my sari and embrace my heritage.” Some have even suggested that she change her forename to Rosie and take her husband’s surname to downplay her ethnicity. However, Allin-Khan is proud of her roots and is keen to emphasise it. “I went double barrelled because I didn’t want to lose the Asian part of my surname and that for me, is very important,” she said. “I am proud to say that this is who I am – a Polish and Pakistani, proudly British Muslim woman who loves the Labour party.” Born and brought up in Tooting in a working-class household, Allin-Khan described her young life as “tough”. Her mother worked three jobs to keep the family financially afloat, and Allin-Khan recalled there only being one heater in the house that they had to move from room to room to keep themselves warm. Allin-Khan failed her A-Levels, citing the difficulties at home as a factor. Despite the setbacks, she still had a desire to study medicine. However, she was told “it wasn’t for girls like (her)”, as it was financially prohibitive, and she didn’t come from the “right background”. Allin-Khan, who still works part-time as a doctor, knew she had to keep fighting if she wanted to pursue her dream career. “I think my upbringing led me to believe I had no choice but to sink or swim,” she said. After resitting her A-Levels, the then-24-year-old accepted a place to study medicine at Lucy Cavendish College, University of Cambridge, which was funded by scholarships. “I really believe that where you start off in life doesn’t need to dictate where you end up,” the A&E doctor said. Although she credited her own resilience for her success, Allin-Khan believes the Labour government gave her an opportunity to fulfil her potential when things looked bleak. “The Labour government turned my life around,” the 43-year-old claimed. “I redid my A-Levels, did a degree and went to Cambridge to study medicine and I’m afraid those possibilities aren’t going to be there for a new generation of kids under this Tory government.” Allin-Khan, the MP for Tooting since 2016, admitted the biggest challenge of her involvement in politics is racism. She often faces abuse on social media and is mostly targeted for her Muslim beliefs. “When I look at the order in which my abuse comes, it is Muslim first, then my Asian heritage comes second,” she admitted. “My gender is third. Without a doubt, the amount of abuse is a huge challenge.” It is a concern that young BAME women may be deterred from entering politics due to the abuse other politicians have faced, she said. In response, Allin-Khan regularly engages with schools and community groups to encourage young people to “keep going and not to lose faith”. There is also a level of racism in the House of Commons, she said, highlighting that she is the first Muslim person ever to make it on to the deputy leadership ballot. Although it is encouraging to see more women and ethnic minority politicians in parliament, Allin-Khan believes there is “still a ceiling on what we can achieve”. Recently, Allin-Khan approached a “prominent BAME politician” to ask them to consider nominating her in the deputy leadership contest. However, the politician responded: “I’m only in the game of backing winners and you don’t look like you’ve got any chance of winning.” “We can’t have that attitude towards people, and I’ve said in my grassroots revival plan that our BAME communities can’t be an afterthought when it comes to supporting people to hold public office,” she said. “We need to be seeing ethnic minorities at the top of our party, on the front benches. “I’ve smashed that ceiling, but I plan to throw the ladder down and say people ‘come up behind, you can do this.’ But I know it isn’t easy.” My pledge to rebuild confidence in LabourI never imagined that one day I’d become an MP, or now a candidate to become the next Deputy Leader of the Labour Party. Growing up, I was regularly told that ‘girls like me’ from ‘backgrounds like mine’ wouldn’t amount to anything. I never planned to go into politics - I always wanted to be a doctor. The last Labour Government gave me that chance, allowing me to study Medicine aged 24 after failing my A-Levels the first time around because of pressures at home. This shaped the person that I am today and has given me the fire in my belly to ensure that no other child feels that there is a ceiling on what they can achieve.\nWhen I work shifts as an A&E doctor at my local hospital, I see first-hand the issues facing our communities today. I treat young people who come to A&E after self-harming, I treat those who haven’t been able to access mental health services for years, and yes, I treat victims of violent crime. To see a young person breathe their last breath is a pain that never leaves you. Teenage boys, once full of bravado on the street, with the words “Born to die” tattooed on their chests, victims of horrific stab wounds, laying there crying out for their mothers. The sound of a parent grieving for their child is universal - it can’t be forgotten. As the MP for Tooting, I have worked incredibly closely with community groups and young people to try and tackle the rise of violent crime in our society. I’ve organised summits with representatives from local community organisations, charities, the police, the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Council and the Deputy Mayor for Policing, to start tackling this problem from a community perspective. Working with affected communities is paramount in order to resolve these critical issues once and for all. As a keen boxer myself, I have promoted the work of local boxing clubs to tackle violent crime. Boxing is far more than just a sport - for many, it’s family. Clubs offer an opportunity for local young ¬people to make friends, engage with sport and receive mentorship. So much of gang culture and violence is about a sense of belonging. We have a duty to show young people that, if you can gain respect in the ring, you do not have to get respect from violence on the street. One of the reasons I decided to run to become the next Deputy Leader of the Labour Party is because it would give me the platform to give a voice to the voiceless. Whether it’s children losing their lives to senseless violence, older people being unable to access safe and decent social care, or refugees fleeing violence and persecution, their voices must be amplified. A platform alone isn’t enough though - Labour needs to be in power to affect real change for the most vulnerable in our communities. As Deputy Leader, I will rebuild our movement into one people can vote for. A party people can trust. The door may have closed on 12 December for a generation’s hopes and ambitions, but with the right leadership team in place in the Labour Party, it will not be closed for good. We need to win the next General Election, and we must listen to our voters ahead of the Mayoral election in May. As Deputy Leader, it will be my responsibility to rebuild trust, not just with the grassroots of our party, but with voters. Together, we can take Labour forward. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is MP for Tooting and candidate for Deputy Leader of Labour NHS workers battling coronavirus are facing a “national shortage” of protective clothing, HuffPost UK has been told.Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan, a working doctor who still works shifts in A&E, said scientists had told her that there were not enough body suits in the right sizes, while some doctors were only now starting to receive protective clothing.\nIt came amid new official estimates suggesting 5,000 to 10,000 people in the UK have coronavirus, leaving many doctors, nurses and other health workers at risk of infection. Last month, the World Health Organisation also warned that there was a global shortage of protective masks and body suits. One NHS source who worked at a hospital where coronavirus patients were being treated told HuffPost UK: “There were staff forced to wear oversized suits because that’s all they had. “All we have left is XL. “There is a national shortage of suits but this was raised with the government at least three weeks ago so something should have been done.” Appearing on HuffPost UK’s Commons People podcast, Allin-Khan repeated the concerns. “I held a meeting today with some people from the scientific community and they said their concern was though they had been testing out various modes of protective clothing, it turns out that there is a lack of the clothing they need available, the sizes aren’t available,” she said. “Just yesterday - because people still contact me because I’m a doctor still, to let me know what’s going on - someone said they were a GP and had only started receiving the necessary protective clothing yesterday and this has been going on for a month now. The Labour deputy leadership candidate criticised the government for moving too slowly to tackle from coronavirus. In a departure from Labour’s broad support for the government, Allin-Khan called for tougher measures to tackle the outbreak, including testing those with symptoms for the virus as a matter of course. Allin-Khan said the government’s testing programme could be “more robust”, reporting that “friends in the NHS” said people were being given “really unclear messaging”. She gave an example of two people who returned from northern Italy who phoned NHS 111 and were told to wait for a call back which did not come for five days, during which time they self isolated. When they eventually spoke again to NHS staff, they had to give their details again and had to self-isolate for eight days before finally being tested for coronavirus. Test results are also taking three to five days to materialise. Allin-Khan said: “We need to be moving quicker, people need to have a better idea of how to access testing, what it means for their daily lives. “The messaging needs to be clearer and the testing needs to be more robust.” She added: “We should have moved into the delay phase sooner than now and I don’t think we should measure our performance compared to what other countries are doing. “I think we should be looking at what’s best for us and when you look at the fact that China had the same number of cases that we already have surpassed before implementing measures we do need to be listening to what the other scientific community, for example some eminent epidemiologists, listen to what they’re saying. “Because ultimately we can’t leave the scientific community to be scapegoated for the government making bad decisions if they are proven to be wrong.” Allin-Khan meanwhile sidestepped questions on whether she wants to be shadow health secretary under the next Labour leader. “I like to focus on one thing at a time, genuinely, and I don’t think you should ever have a plan B because that’s implying you’ve accepted that your plan A won’t work out,” she said. “So I am genuinely, steely focused on winning this deputy leadership bid.” Put to her that she would be a good fit for the job, she replied: “Well I am a practising NHS doctor and I have got a master’s degree in public health and I care about our party so that’s honestly for whoever is the leader to decide.” |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

I was proud to join my friend Hope Virgo at the Dump The Scales march to Parliament Square on Saturday with hundreds of campaigners and activists.\nThe Government’s attitude towards eating disorders must fundamentally change. They must listen to campaigners and experts, like Hope, to ensure everyone with an eating disorder gets the care they need. It was brilliant to speak at the Watercooler event in the ExCeL London today, for a discussion on mental health in Government and the NHS.\nRather than railing against a \"sick note\" culture as Rishi Sunak has done recently, we must be encouraging more openness and understanding around mental health.\nAs part of my previous work as Shadow Minister for Mental Health and in my capacity as an A&E doctor at St George's, I know firsthand the toll that working on the NHS frontline can take.\nToday, I asked the Government whether they will continue to fund mental health support services past the 12 months they've committed to. Shamefully, the Minister refused to commit to funding. This is just further proof that this Tory Government couldn't care less about our NHS heroes.\nYesterday, I was delighted to join CEN for their Healing our Broken Village Black Mental Health Conference at the New Testament Assembly church in Tooting.\nWith continued racial disparities in sectioning and the use of community treatment orders, more must be done to bring about much-needed change.\nThe Tories' Rwanda Bill is one of the most shameful pieces of legislation in recent memory on both moral and practical grounds, which is why I voted 20 times against the Bill last night.\nAs part of my former role as Shadow Minister for Mental Health, I worked very closely with Melanie Leahy and other campaigners affected by the terrible deaths in Essex mental health hospitals.\nThe Terms of Reference for the inquiry into this scandal have now at long last been published. This inquiry has been beset by delays since the beginning, which is simply not good enough.\nOne of the most fulfilling parts of my role as your MP is helping local people solve problems and, in this case, save money.\nA Furzedown pensioner had been denied over £12,000 in backdated pension payments and Pension Credit, however following my intervention with the Department for Work and Pensions, this money was recouped. If you have a problem with your state benefits or pension, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me and I'd be happy to help. I wish everyone in Tooting and beyond a peaceful and blessed Eid. My thoughts and prayers are especially with all those facing hardship and suffering at this time.\nMaking Wandsworth a greener and cleaner borough was a key policy in our campaign in the 2022 local elections, which is why I'm delighted that the new Labour administration in the Town Hall have now rolled out food waste recycling bins across the local area.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_grassroots-revival-campaigning-action-plan/content_266.html": "|\nAs a doctor, I know that before a patient can be diagnosed, it is vital to first take a detailed history and examine them thoroughly. That’s the challenge we now face in revitalising the Labour Party and taking it off life-support. This is also why, when I decided to run for Deputy Leader, the first thing I did was contact every single Labour councillor I could find an email address for, as well as every single prospective parliamentary candidate who stood for Labour in the last General Election and lost.\nI’m not a leader-in-waiting, I’ll be a campaigner-in-chief, and you can be too. I’ve been travelling across the country, to seats where we won, seats where we lost, and even seats we’ve never held, to talk to activists and members on the ground - because I want to hear from the grassroots directly to truly understand what went wrong, what went right, and what we must do better. Using that detailed feedback, I am now publishing a manifesto called Grassroots Revival – a campaigning action plan that I will immediately start implementing if I’m elected as the next Labour Deputy Leader. **Download Grassroots revival**It starts with changes we must make to our internal organisation. We must overhaul the complaints process. I’ll remove the team from HQ and make it independent, put a time limit on reviewing complaints, and ensure those involved with each case are kept informed of its progress. I also want to start unlocking Labour’s membership talent. It’s not all about delivering leaflets and knocking on doors - we have social media experts, journalists, policy gurus, videographers and many other talents in our ranks. Let’s start making the most of that! For new members, attending meetings can feel daunting - we need to make them more enjoyable and accessible for all. We can ensure party democracy and due process are followed, while making meetings a more enjoyable experience. For example, some CLPs still spend up to an hour arguing about the minutes of the last meeting - which turns off new members. We need to streamline the procedural matters and get more political debate into our local meetings. We can be sociable too! I want to help local groups organise regional social events that break even, instead of looking to make a profit. Quiz nights, continuing the great work of Stand Up For Labour, pub nights, coffee mornings - let’s bring our movement together and celebrate all that we have to offer. Let’s look at how to grow and diversify our movement even further. I’ll offer reduced membership rates to emergency service workers, to encourage them to join the Party and have their say over how we fight to save our NHS. I would support BAME members to hold elected office - I will produce literature to be made available to BAME officers to distribute to new members, “how to be a councillor” meetings will be offered in each borough - not as an afterthought - and I will work with BAME officers to listen to what resources they need. We must start upgrading our technology and infrastructure - we’re running campaigns in 2020 with two colour printers from the 80s and 90s. I’d ensure every CLP has access to a full colour RISO printer (or similar). We can also boost data driven testing of our methods. Comparisons of leaflets, direct mails, e-newsletters, social media and canvassing will allow us to be so much more targeted and effective. A significant amount of dedicated time went into creating software and apps to revolutionise our digital campaigning in recent years but the party didn’t have the resources to fully roll them out - the doorknocking app, dialogue and chatter could have really helped us but members didn’t know how to use them or didn’t know they existed. Contact Creator regularly broke down during the General Election and the user interface hasn’t changed for over a decade. This must all change. Let’s also have a digital team at HQ who goes to every target seat, showing them how to make the most of Facebook ads, emails, Twitter, creating graphics and videos. Let’s also start looking at how to produce more personalised and localised content. The party produces some great literature and supplies it to key seats, but the vast majority of it is national with no localisation. Some leaflets and letters just didn’t arrive in 2019 for some seats, which left them in the dark, and adequate support was not available to deal with it, because staff were already overstretched. We must be better prepared. The manifesto came out weeks after the print deadlines for seats to order their leaflets and letters. I will ensure the necessary information is available to candidates in good time. The Labour Party must do better at supporting our candidates – I’ll make sure they all get adequate briefings and lines for use in their own leaflets, letters, emails and press releases. Candidates and their teams are superheroes, but they aren’t invincible, and campaigns can take their toll both financially, physically and mentally - This is why I’ll set up a dedicated team to offer mental health support and advice during difficult times. Too often, local organisers and staff have contracts that end at 10pm on polling day - this culture needs to change. Organisers put in endless hours to help our campaigns succeed and to dump them when polls close is just simply wrong. I’ll ensure no staff contracts end on Election Day, giving them vital time to find new employment. I also want to establish a system of sharing best practice amongst CLPs and boroughs. Campaigns shouldn’t have borders - we don’t have to operate solely within our constituency or ward boundaries. We need proper twinning with key seats. There’s no sugar-coating it – the Labour Party is in a critical condition right now. But with the right treatment, the right approach and the right support from the leadership team, we can get it back to fighting fitness. With the local elections coming up in May, there’s no time to waste. Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan MP for Tooting Comments are closed.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_archives_02-2020/content_414.html": "|\nWhen I first met Rosena, she was Labour’s candidate in the 2016 Tooting by-election.\nAs a by-election candidate myself in Heywood and Middleton in 2014, I know how difficult and uniquely pressured by-elections can be and I wanted to help Rosena win the seat after the amazing Sadiq Khan left to become London mayor. As soon as I met Rosena, I knew that Tooting would soon have another fantastic Labour MP. Her boundless energy and enthusiasm inspired her whole team. I also knew that Rosena wouldn’t be just a backbench MP but that she would bring her skills and experience to the parliamentary Labour party and she’s certainly done that in her role as shadow sports minister and with her background as a practising A&E doctor in our NHS. The choice of who to support in the deputy leadership contest has been a difficult one for me. I know all the candidates and they’re all people I am proud to call friends. But it’s Rosena who has most impressed me in this campaign and I think she has the qualities that we need in our new deputy leader. After the disastrous election result in December 2019, where I lost my seat to the Tories – the first time that they have ever taken Heywood & Middleton – Rosena was one of the first people to contact me, to commiserate but also to talk about what went wrong and how we rebuild from here. She came up to my constituency to talk with key activists about the campaign and we explored every aspect, from Brexit through to our manifesto and the Labour leadership. We talked about Heywood and Middleton being a 62% Leave voting constituency and how I had tried to represent the views of all my constituents in trying to get a deal that worked for 100%. Rosena understands the issues that we face here in the North and I know that she is going to be a great campaigning deputy leader who will reach out across the country to win back those lost Labour seats in the North, the Midlands, Scotland and Wales. I see the role of deputy leader as being a campaigner, an organiser, an advisor and also a critical friend. I think that Rosena is more than capable of doing this job, and doing it extremely well. I am wary of any offer of leader/deputy leader ‘dream tickets’ suggesting a cosy, already formed relationship. The deputy leader has to be able to stand back and assess situations critically and I know that Rosena has the independence and strength of character to do this. I know how hard Rosena has worked to become a qualified doctor, and she’s not only continued to work shifts at St George’s Hospital, keeping her grounded and in touch with our NHS but she’s also done great humanitarian work reaching out internationally. I’ll never forget her impassioned speech in parliament when she returned from the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh where she’d been providing medical care to people who have nothing – no citizenship, no home, in many cases no family and no prospect of their situation improving. Rosena has the strength, knowledge, intelligence and empathy needed to unite our party and also to take our message out to the wider public. And whoever becomes leader, she will be a unique complement to them. I’m proud to call Rosena a friend, and I’m proud to support her to be the next deputy leader of the Labour Party. Rosena Allin-Khan kicks off Labour deputy leader campaign in Putney with ‘fire in her belly’\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan launched her deputy Labour leadership campaign in Putney last night. The campaign, held in the ballroom of the Star & Garter pub, brought together an eclectic crowd, including some young first-time voters. Tooting MP Dr Allin-Khan, who is running with the slogan ‘Taking Labour Forward’, is a qualified A&E front-line doctor and has provided humanitarian aid to refugees in Syria. Describing her determination to be the next deputy leader, she said: “Expertise in building trust in communities and shared life experience has put fire in my belly to achieve for others.” She set out her ‘internationalist’ vision of Britain’s future after Brexit and brought attention to the importance of social care reform, the significance of a grassroots revival and updating technology within the Labour Party. Labour’s Putney MP Fleur Anderson said that Dr Allin-Khan would be a ‘campaigner-in-chief’ and not a ‘leader-in-waiting’ if elected as deputy leader in a PoliticsHome article last week. The Musician’s Union has given their endorsement to Dr Allin-Khan and to Sir Keir Starmer for leader. Voting takes place from February 24 to April 2 and results will be announced on the April 4. Labour needs to become a party of progressive internationalism once againLast Tuesday, a boat capsized and sank in the Bay of Bengal. There were 138 Rohingya refugees crammed on the boat, fleeing from camps in Bangladesh. At least 15 bodies were found, including four children, with 50 more missing.\nI’ve been campaigning for the rights of the Rohingya since the recent crisis unfolded in 2017. I’ve been involved in humanitarian matters long before entering politics and standing to be Labour deputy leader. Stories such as those of the Rohingya do not often have a light shined upon them here in the UK. They happen far away and it feels as if they’re outside of our control. The UK has a proud history of humanitarian assistance and we must ensure that this continues. We must never allow ourselves to turn a blind eye. Every single human life has equal value, no matter where that person was born, what language they speak or what they look like. Humanity has no borders. This isn’t just something I believe in principle — I act on it. My work as a humanitarian doctor has taken me to the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, where grieving mothers told me accounts of their babies being ripped from their arms and murdered before their eyes. The guilt of coming home to my own three- and five-year-olds left me unable to sleep at night. Why should their lives be of more value to the world than those of the Rohingya children who are slaughtered without a dignified burial? I have seen how human life is not valued equally around the world. It lit a fire in my belly to continue fighting such injustice, no matter where it takes place. At the very heart of my Labour principles is internationalism. I believe this spirit of internationalism must drive everything we do as a party. We must always stand in unwavering opposition to any effort to restrict freedoms, whether here or globally. We’ve seen where this mentality leads — whether it is the tragedy of Windrush, the cruelty of detention centres like Yarl’s Wood, or the inhumanity of a government that votes against protection for vulnerable child refugees. Now is the time for all of us who believe in progressive, internationalist values to fight back. It is our duty to ensure that the Rohingya and other victims are not forgotten by the world. One of the reasons I decided to stand to become the next deputy leader of Labour is because I believe our party has a unique chance to become a global beacon of internationalism, as it has been before. We have arguably the largest grassroots membership of any political party in Europe. If we are able to unite behind a truly internationalist vision for our party and our country, we could be a force for change on a global scale. We have a wonderful society, which has welcomed so many people from across the world, but this government’s hostile environment is diminishing hope — hope for a brighter future, hope for a tolerant society. I first entered politics in order to shed light on humanitarian efforts around the world and give a voice to the voiceless. I still believe we can, and I want to help rebuild the Labour Party so that it becomes a powerful force for good. As a party we need to rebuild trust with our communities, with the British people and the international community. Let’s do this together. Rosena Allin-Khan is Labour MP for Tooting and candidate for the deputy leadership The Musicians’ Union has nominated Keir Starmer to be the next leader of the Labour Party, and Rosena Allin-Khan to be the next deputy.\nThe party-affiliated organisation has become the fourth trade union to back Starmer, and the first to back Allin-Khan. In 2015, the union nominated Andy Burnham for leader and Caroline Flint for deputy, and in 2016 it backed leadership challenger Owen Smith. Commenting on their nomination on Twitter, the Musicians’ Union said Starmer had been “a strong supporter of musicians”. “He understands the challenges musicians working in the EU are facing and what we need to do to meet them”. The organisation also revealed in a tweet that Allin-Khan was a “former Musicians’ Union member” and said they were “proud to see her rise so far” and “to support her as she continues fighting for young people to have a free musical education.” Starmer has already secured his place on the final ballot through both the support of affiliates, including large trade union UNISON, and the backing of local Labour parties. To reach the ballot paper, each candidate must be nominated by 5% of local parties or three affiliates, two of which must be trade unions, amounting to more than 5% of the total affiliate membership. Starmer has been nominated by a total of 159 constituency parties so far, as well as UNISON, Usdaw, SERA, Community, Labour Movement for Europe, Labour Business and the Socialist Health Association. Allin-Khan has yet to secure a place on the final ballot, having so far only secured the support of 17 CLPs and the Labour Campaign for International Development. Rosena Allin-Khan is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in5/2/2020\nFleur Anderson MP: As Deputy Leader, Rosena Allin-Khan would be a campaigner-in-chief, not a leader-in-waitingRosena Allin-Khan is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in, writes Putney's new MP, Fleur Anderson.\nThe night of the General Election result was a deeply distressing moment for all of us who love the Labour Party and who love our country. It was an horrific experience to watch the door close on a whole generation as the Tories won a huge majority to continue their destructive and damaging agenda. But I was also hugely proud and honoured to produce the only Labour gain of the night, as I became the new MP for Putney. It was, I hope, a rare bright light in an otherwise long, dark night for all those Labour activists, members and volunteers who worked tirelessly during the election. Rosena’s help and support was vital to that win. She is my friend and colleague, as we were councillors together and she is the MP for the neighbouring constituency of Tooting. It’s sometimes forgotten how difficult it can be for prospective parliamentary candidates, especially ones who’ve never stood to be an MP before. Of course, it’s a huge honour to be given the chance to represent your local community, and to make their voices heard in the corridors of power – but you also have to put your life on hold for months, spending hardly any time with your friends and family, working and campaigning relentlessly, whatever the weather, rain or shine. And at the end of it all, there’s absolutely no guarantee you’ll get the job, especially in a marginal seat like Putney. It’s incredibly rewarding, but it’s hard work too. Rosena was there for me every step of the way, helping me, guiding me, giving me advice and encouragement and very practical support too. I cannot thank her enough. She is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in, and every single voter who meets her comes away with a positive impression and a smile on their face. I should know - we stood to be Councillors together in the same ward in 2014 - fighting a seat that had been Tory for 24 years - and we won, through sheer hard work and positive conversations. Rosena is a relentless optimist – she always finds the positives in every situation and she never gives up, no matter what. Her life-story is a true demonstration of our Labour values – she comes from an impoverished background, failed her A-levels first time around but persevered, and because of reforms introduced by a Labour government, she was able to study at Cambridge and become a doctor before becoming an MP - it shows the difference a Labour Government can make to the lives of people across our country. Rosena is now running to become the next Deputy Leader of Labour. There’s no doubt she’s the underdog in the race, but that’s never stopped her before, and I know it won’t stop her now. She would be a phenomenal Deputy Leader of our Party, and that’s why she’s got my total support. She’s got the most interesting and substantive ideas of any of the candidates, and she’s already published a fantastic Grassroots Revival manifesto of how the Labour Party can improve our campaigning practices to get back to winning ways ahead of the local elections in May. As Deputy Leader, she would be a campaigner-in-chief, not a leader-in-waiting. In Putney, I saw the real difference she made with her energy, her optimism and her campaigning skill. Thanks to Rosena’s help, we turned blue seats into red ones, and if she’s elected as the next Deputy Leader, we can start doing that across the whole country - at both a local and a national level. Let’s take Labour forward. Fleur Anderson is Labour MP for Putney. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan: As a doctor and as a daughter I know social care is broken.\nThe deputy leadership candidate has spoken about the horror of finding her dad - who has dementia- injured and not knowing what happened. She wants to make sure no other family has to suffer that way. Nothing prepares you for finding your loved one bruised and blooded. Nothing prepares you for never finding answers. This is the reality that every day, so many people are living through, across the UK, because of the nature of the social care system. Nothing prepared me for being one of the statistics. My father has fronto-temporal dementia – he cannot communicate his thoughts but he is fully aware of what is happening. My brother and I found him bloodied and bruised on more than one occasion, we have sought answers but we know that we will never find them. He is safe now, but his health has deteriorated massively and has affected his life expectancy. This is not just my reality. This is the reality for so many others across the country. I am lucky. I was able to call a debate last year and get The Mirror to cover my family’s journey. Most people don’t have that luxury. Instead, they’re left fighting the social care system. I’ve been on both sides. As an aggrieved family member and a local politician with a responsibility for social care, I’ve seen the strife that goes into placements on both sides. The system is failing our most vulnerable residents. As it stands, the social care system is not fit for purpose. The Tories promised in their manifesto that they would tackle social care. It’s been three years – and yet still no Green Paper, despite countless promises. Last week, in Parliament, I asked the Health Secretary how many more families will suffer before the Government looks to reform the social care system. There was no answer. As an A&E doctor, who regularly sees vulnerable older people stranded in hospital because they don’t have access to adequate social care, and as a daughter, who’s had to go through this process, I have the following recommendations: - A truly independent complaints process – formal complaints should not have to go through the care provider or local authority who the complaint is against. - A reformed process for awarding care contracts – to ensure that failing companies cannot simply change their name and continue providing inadequate care. - An Independent Advocate for Older People – to protect and promote the rights of older people. - Mandatory CCTV with an opt-out – CCTV in communal areas within care homes should be mandatory to provide evidence of any unacceptable behaviour in a care setting. - A fully funded social care system, integrated into our NHS, with a ban on outsourcing to private companies. Increased funding alone won’t solve the problems being faced by our most vulnerable – only enacting the above changes will. At some point in our lives, we all have an experience with the social care system – as a daughter, I know how difficult it is when this system fails you. As Labour Deputy Leader, I would continue putting pressure on this Tory Government and their poor record on social care. As a society, we must protect our most vulnerable – sadly, nothing prepares you for confronting the worst. As your Deputy Leader, I would work with the Leader of the Labour Party to put the NHS and social care front and centre of our policy going forward. We need to protect our most vulnerable. We need a Labour Government. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_schools_2/content_536.html": "Teachers and school teams are doing a phenomenal job, and I know that digital poverty is a real worry for them, as well as for families across Tooting. Early on in the pandemic, Labour called for a set of measures that would see a mass roll-out of devices and internet access to students currently struggling to learn online, alongside steps such as ‘zero-rating’ of educational websites to ensure data charges are not putting barriers on access to education during lockdown.\nThe digital divide risks failing a generation. I am so pleased to have been able to help close this gap. Throughout the ongoing pandemic I have been inundated with emails from parents, school staff, students, and residents alike who have taken the time to outline their views on school closures. Some are concerned about safety, with many teachers and students facing the very real and grave possibility of bringing the virus home to vulnerable family members. Some are concerned about the impact a further lockdown could have on children's wellbeing and their education. And some are concerned about the challenges school closures will cause for working families.\nAs I am sure you will agree, the current situation is incredibly serious. This virus is spreading exponentially across the country, many people are in hospital, and too many people are tragically losing their loved ones. We know how difficult another lockdown will be, but I believe that national measures are necessary. As the Shadow Minister for Mental Health and a working mother, it is safe to say the impact of extended school closures on children’s well-being and working families cannot be overstated. This is why Labour called on Government to do everything possible to avoid it. Boris Johnson must immediately set out clear plans for every child to return safely to school as soon as possible - and be honest with parents about the timetable for this. It is also critical that young people’s education is safeguarded throughout this period of remote learning, and every student must have access to the devices they need to learn. Schools and families can request free mobile data increases for students without broadband or who cannot afford extra data for devices. More information on this scheme can be found here: get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/about-increasing-mobile-data. It is vital the Government prevent disadvantaged families being priced out of education. As many families will agree, working parents face huge challenges in balancing work, childcare, and supporting their child’s education. They must have the support they need to do this. Nobody should have to choose between their job and supporting their children, so the Government - and employers - must clearly promote the use of the job retention scheme for those unable to work due to family commitments. Please rest assured that myself and Labour Party colleagues will continue to hold the Government to account on these issues as we all navigate the ongoing pandemic. Stay safe, Rosena. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_local_6/content_669.html": "|\nToday, I wrote to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, calling on him to listen to concerns expressed by local residents about the proposed closure of Trinity Medical Centre.\nAt a time when waiting times are at record levels, these plans by the NHS and Government will make it harder for local residents to access a local GP. That's why, alongside our local Labour Councillors, I'm campaigning to keep GP services at this site. Please add your name to the petition here Read my letter below: The children's cancer centre at St George's Hospital is at risk of closure.\nThis is deeply concerning. The St George's children's cancer centre has more than 25 years of expertise delivering the highest quality care for patients, which will be lost if the services are moved away from Tooting. Under these plans, patients will be forced to travel to a site in central London. Parents have made it very clear that it is easier, cheaper, safer, and more comfortable to take their children to St George's. There is also a huge added cost. The plans to relocate services will cost an estimated £90 million, more than three times the cost to redevelop facilities at St George's Hospital. Today, I've launched a petition calling on the Government and NHS England to keep the children’s cancer service at St George's Hospital. Add your name and share the petition with friends and family here Trinity Medical Centre serves thousands of local people but is under threat of closure. For so many local residents this is a vital service. The closure would cause real difficulties for people accessing their local GP. Many local residents already have to wait weeks for a GP appointment and waiting lists for treatment are at record highs. This closure is a result of 13 years of government underfunding of our NHS. The local Integrated Care Board for South West London has been forced into making huge cuts to their budget and the impact of these cuts is now being felt by our community. In recent weeks, I've been contacted by numerous local residents extremely concerned about the impact of this closure. That's why I am urging the Health Secretary to intervene, listen to patients and staff alike, and keep a GP surgery open at Trinity Medical Centre. Sign my petition here Today, I asked Wandsworth Police officers to join me on a walk about in Tooting Bec.\nWe spoke to local residents and discussed tackling anti-social behaviour in the area. I know local residents have raised a number of concerns - about incidents targeting children and public safety in the area. I addressed these matters with the police, along with strategies already put in place aimed specifically at reducing worrying incidents of this kind and crime. Over recent months, I have taken the following action on anti-social behaviour and crime on the Heaver Estate:\nTooting has so much to offer as a community and I was delighted to visit my friends in Tooting Market yesterday to talk about their businesses. From food to clothes to art, crafts and activities, there is a wonderful array of businesses in the market Next time you're in the area, make sure to pop in and sample the market's delights, whether you need freshly squeezed juice3 or freshly stitched jeans. To hear from the traders themselves (and to see me in a funky hat!). Today, I am marking International Women's Day 2023 by celebrating some of the inspiring women who make Tooting the best place to work and live.\nHere are just some of Tooting's amazing women: Sahar Beg - Sahar, and her amazing team of volunteers, run the Tooting Community Kitchen, which has provided hot meals, toiletries, and care packages to those in need since 2018. Sophie Livingstone - Sophie, and the team at Little Village, are hardworking local activists providing vital support at their baby bank in Tooting. Kate Allan - Kate is a leading member of the Balham and Tooting Community Association (BATCA). BATCA works to organise community events, celebreate the local heroes in our area and bring people of all backgrounds together. Cllr Sarmila Varatharaj - Sarmila was elected to serve our community as a councillor last May and is now Wandsworth's Deputy Mayor. She is a volunteer for Global Human Rights Defence and has been the spokesperson to the United Nations Human Rights Council. Cllr Lizzy Dobres - Lizzy has been a dedicated councillor since being elected last May and has led on fighting inequality and violence against women. Charlotte White - Charlotte is part of the fantastic team at Earlsfield Foodbank. During the most difficult of times, she has worked tirelessly to support those in need of our community. Natasha Best - Natasha, and the team at Tooting Works, provide fantastic community and work space for many local businesses and start ups. To all the countless other amazing women who do so much for our community, thank you. Following my letter to Network Rail regarding step-free access at Wandsworth Common Station, I was very pleased to receive confirmation that the station will be nominated for funding in the next round of the \"Access for All\" programme.\nThis programme has funded step-free access and other accessibility measures in stations across the country, including just down the line at Balham. This is a very encouraging first step in ensuring that public transport is available and convenient for everyone in the local community. The story of a Ukrainian family who wants to come to live in Furzedown recently made national news! Oksana and her young son Dmytro have a sponsor ready and willing to welcome them into their home in the local area, however Home Office delays have stopped them travelling to safety in the United Kingdom.\nIt is inspiring and heartwarming to see the generosity shown by the British public in welcoming Ukrainian refugees into their lives, however Oksana and Dmytro have been let down badly by the Home Office. They applied to come to the UK in September last year and, so far, the Home Office have refused to provide a timeframe for a decision to both myself and their sponsor's solicitors. This is simply not good enough and the Government must get a grip. My thoughts and prayers went out to everyone affected by the recent tragic earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. I was very proud to see that Tooting Islamic Centre raised £16,000 for the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal for relief funds.\nIt is always incredibly touching to see the love, generosity and kindness demonstrated by our fantastic community - thank you to all those that donated and to Arshad Daud, imam at TIC, for all his hard work. Donations can still be made here Last week, I asked the Government how many enquiries to the Home Office from MPs are outstanding and how many older than six months are awaiting a reply.\nIt was incredibly disheartening, although not surprising, to learn that over 10,000 case enquiries have not been answered by the Home Office with nearly 1,000 of those waiting longer than six months. These enquiries cover urgent and compassionate cases and it is simply unacceptable that the Government have allowed such a huge backlog to accumulate. These are people’s lives, with their family lives and jobs often dependent on Home Office decisions – the Government simply has to get a grip.

I’m so proud that our community has, once again, come together. The response was truly overwhelming, and in only four days we were able to raise £1,270 in much-needed funds for the Dons Local Action Group They’re an incredible local charity and I know they’ll be able to do a lot of good for so many families and young people with the money raised. A huge thank you to everyone who bought a ticket! Worryingly, coronavirus rates are soaring once again across London. The vaccine is our best defence. If you are yet to receive either your first or second dose, please do so as soon as possible. To help get Tooting vaccinated, the Pearl Chemist Vaccination Centre is now offering a walk-in clinic for those aged 18+ at St Boniface Church on Mitcham Road (Monday to Saturday 9-5pm). Appointments are available for first doses as well as second doses. Second doses can be given eight weeks after the first. Any questions can be directed to Pearl Chemist on 0208 049 6640. With the re-opening of non-essential retail, I took the opportunity to shine a spotlight on the local businesses/business owners that make our vibrant community such a fantastic place to live and work. The easing of national Government restrictions marks an important point in our recovery - our community and high street have so much to offer, so for six weeks I showcased the stores, restaurants, cafes, and other small businesses that make Tooting what it is! A huge thank you to every single business, business owner, employee, and customer who got behind the campaign. The past year has been challenging, so to see our community come together to support the local economy has been truly heartwarming. While this week marks the final instalment (for now) of Spotlight Saturdays, I will continue to find new ways to shine a bright light on Tooting and our wonderful community. Wandsworth is in the top 5 for vaccination rates across London! This is a great step forward and I am proud of everyone here in Tooting who has taken the steps to protect themselves and others by receiving their jab. However, we still have a way to go before everyone is protected against coronavirus. We need to keep pushing to ensure that those who can do so, are vaccinated as soon as possible. Information on how to book your vaccination appointment can be found here. It is also vital that if, for any reason, you have to change or cancel your vaccine appointment that you let the GP surgery or vaccination centre that you appointment is booked with know. You can manage your vaccination appointment here. If you are still unsure about having the jab or have any questions, more information can be found on the vaccine and answers to many common concerns on Wandsworth Council’s website here. I was deeply concerned - as I know many local residents were - to hear of plans to close Balham station to outward passengers from next Monday until December 2021. While I recognise the scheduled repairs to the escalator are essential works, it is important to me that residents are not inconvenienced by the planned updates. Indeed, I also appreciate that it was alarming for many to learn that the closure was to begin in less than a week, lasting for such an extended period of time. It is my understanding that the decision to close Balham station to outward travelling passengers was taken after a trial closure of the downward escalator indicated that use of the staircase at peak travel times was resulting in over-crowding and therefore social distancing was difficult. I called a meeting with Transport for London to outline my concerns and discuss alternatives, such as more staff at the station to support social distancing at peak travel times. I am pleased to announce that as a result of this meeting, TfL have agreed to undertake a week-long trial at Balham Station, which will see the staircase open for use throughout the day and outward travel therefore possible from the station. The trial will commence on Monday 28th June and last 3-4 days. Following the trial, TfL will assess whether outward travel from Balham during the planned escalator repairs is viable. During this time - and beyond should the trial prove successful - I would recommend additional time is allowed for travel through Balham Station. By doing so, we increase the likelihood of a successful trial. More importantly, we can all play our part to ensure all residents can travel safely. Please check back for further updates on this situation. The work of biomedical scientists and laboratory staff is incredibly valuable - and this has never been clearer than since the outset of the coronavirus pandemic. Often overlooked as a profession, I was pleased to join others in thanking those working in healthcare sciences. For every coronavirus test conducted, a biomedical scientist has been behind it, working hard to ensure PCR tests are returned safely. I would like to thank, in particular, our incredible microbiology team at St George’s. Working in A&E, I know just how much our NHS relies on the incredible efforts of lab staff. I have included photos of the microbiology team at St George’s, featuring Chris James, a Specialist Biomedical Scientist in Biochemistry who has worked at St George’s for 9 years, and Silva, a Specialist Biomedical Scientist in Medical Microbiology and Virology who has worked St George’s Hospital for the past 4 years, after moving to the UK from Portugal. Silva’s words about her work as a biomedical scientist are impactful and I hope everyone is able to recognise the incredible work they do. “Being a biomedical scientist is an extremely impactful role in healthcare. Even though it’s not patient facing, our work and the speed and accuracy with which we can produce results is essential for patient care.” As you will no doubt be aware, the Covid-19 situation remains serious, with the Delta variant spreading rapidly throughout the country. One of the most important steps we can take to stop the spread of the coronavirus is to get vaccinated as soon as possible. For this reason, a range of walk-in vaccination sites have been launched across South West London. People aged over 18 are invited to drop into the Tooting and Mitcham United F.C. vaccination centre on Saturday 19th or Sunday 20th 9am - 8pm, to receive their first or second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Unvaccinated over 40s and over 40s who have received their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine before mid-April can also head down to the Roehampton Vaccination Centre, located in the Queen Mary’s Hospital car park, on Sunday between 8am and 7.45pm to receive their second dose. Together we can stop the spread of Covid-19. Details of additional walk-in vaccine centres in South West London are available here. Today I had the pleasure of visiting the impressive walk-in vaccine clinic, based at St Boniface Church on Mitcham Road. It was great to have the opportunity to speak with their incredible team of staff and volunteers, as well as meet local residents receiving their coronavirus vaccines. In partnership with NHS England, to date Pearl Chemist have administered over 30,000 doses of the vaccines. This is an incredible achievement and a real credit to our community. For local residents aged 40+ who have not yet had their first vaccination, the AstraZeneca vaccine is available at the Pearl Chemist clinic on Mitcham Road. You can also receive your second dose (eight weeks after your first dose) if you are in cohorts 1-9. Simply bring along your card! All other age groups can book their doses via the NHS website here. As a reminder, before you receive your vaccine, it is important to have eaten and be hydrated. With coronavirus cases in Wandsworth rising, it has never been more important to ensure you are fully vaccinated as soon as possible. By getting vaccinated, you are not only protecting yourself, but your community too. Last week, along with Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney, I was fortunate to visit Heathmere School - a local primary supported by the fantastic mental health charity, Place2Be. It was a wonderful opportunity to hear how Heathmere is promoting positive mental wellbeing for pupils, as well as learn more about the range of support Place2Be provides for schools across Wandsworth and the rest of the UK. During the visit, we heard first-hand from pupils who have benefitted from Heathmere’s whole school approach to mental health and Place2Be’s support. In addition, we were able to meet with Heathmere’s Headteacher, Emma Lewis, Place2Be’s Area Manager for South West London, Khalad Musse, and Place2Be’s Chief Executive Catherine Roche to discuss children’s mental health. It is so important that we shine a spotlight on the incredible work organisations, such as Place2Be, are doing to support children and young people. As we move beyond the pandemic, it is vital that we dedicate our care and attention to listening to young people to understand how we can best support them. Local favourite Mixed Blessings - our very own West Indian bakery on Mitcham Road - will soon be blessed with its very own blue plaque! The plaque will mark and celebrate TMC Studios (Tooting Music Centre), the recording studio that was once based above the bakery and frequented by glam rockers and reggae artists - local legend has it that Bob Marley scrawled his signature on a wall. It is so important that we shine a spotlight on Tooting’s rich musical roots and diverse cultural heritage. I will certainly be there later this summer when the plaque is revealed to share the love. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

The situation in Wandsworth remains serious. We currently have a local rate of 238.7 cases per 100,000 people - well above the national average. While the vaccine is giving added protection by reducing deaths and hospitalisations, it is important to bear in mind that it does not eradicate transmission and those who have been vaccinated can still become unwell with coronavirus. Data available from the Government suggests that some areas within Tooting have a higher infection rate than the Wandsworth average of 238.7 cases per 100,000 and these are:\nWhile we need not panic, we should remain careful. A reminder that symptoms of coronavirus include: loss of taste or smell; temperature exceeding 37 degrees; new and persistent cough. Other common symptoms also include feeling tired and a headache. Those experiencing these symptoms should book a free PCR test as soon as possible here. Those aged 18 or over are encouraged to take up the offer of a vaccine. Appointments can be booked here. Information about local walk-in clinics is available here. Unlike previously, second doses of the vaccine are available after eight weeks and many walk-in centres will vaccinate those who bring along their vaccination card. 1 in 3 people who have coronavirus are asymptomatic, so twice weekly testing is another way to keep ourselves and others safe. Lateral flow tests can be ordered for free here. I am in regular contact with NHS England and South West London CCG, who oversee the local coronavirus response. If you are a Tooting resident in need of assistance, please do not hesitate to email [email protected] and please keep an eye on my website and social media pages for further updates. On Saturday, the official UEFA Euro 2020 cup came to the Kings Head in Tooting Bec, the day of England’s historic 4-0 quarter-final win against Ukraine. It was my pleasure to offer two lucky people, plus five guests each, the chance to win VIP access and the opportunity to have their photo taken with the trophy, with raffle ticket proceeds going to Dons Local Action Group. Of all the places UEFA could choose to send the trophy, it’s fantastic that they chose here in Tooting! This tournament has brought much needed positivity and togetherness to our community, and it was fantastic to see the excitement of those lucky enough to meet the trophy. Fingers crossed for a win at the semi-final on Tuesday. We are all rooting for you, England! On 21st June it was announced that Balham Station would be closed to outbound passengers at peak travel times until December 2021, to undertake essential escalator repairs at the station. I met with Transport for London to outline my significant concerns. As a result of this, it was agreed there would be a week-long trial at Balham Station, with the staircase remaining open for use throughout the day, permitting onward travel from the station. This trial began on Monday 28th June. I am thrilled to say this trial was successful and TfL have now confirmed that Balham Station is to remain open while these essential works are ongoing! While this is undoubtedly great news and will ease the worries of the many local residents and commuters who regularly use this station, it is important to remember that - with only one staircase available - social distancing at peak travel times remains a valid concern. As such, to ensure that Balham Station remains open, and we keep ourselves and each other safe, please allow extra time for travel through the station. It is with a massive smile that I offer my congratulations to Kim Leadbeater on being elected as Member of Parliament for Batley and Spen! Kim’s campaign has been marred by bitterness and threatening behaviour. As a woman in politics, I know first-hand the impact this can have. As such, I would like to pay tribute to Kim for her resilient and positive campaigning. I would also like to say a huge thank you to all the Labour staffers and activists who have worked so hard in Batley in the face of such intimidation. We owe them so much.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_brexit/content_168.html": "|\nFormer Labour MEP SEB DANCE explains why he is supporting Rosena Allin-Khan in the Labour deputy leadership race.\nBritain has left the EU. As a former Labour Member of the European Parliament, as a Remainer, and as a proud pro-European, that’s still not an easy thing for me to say – but it’s the reality. There is no longer a campaign to remain. That doesn’t mean that Boris Johnson’s famous lie of “get Brexit done” has suddenly come true. The ongoing negotiations with the EU will continue to define our country’s future for years to come. Perhaps one day the fight to join the EU will come. How soon that time comes depends on what we do next. Pro-Europeans must now fight for a close relationship between the UK and our friends in the EU and ongoing rights for UK citizens. The Labour Party must play a crucial role in that fight. That’s why I’m supporting Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan to become the next deputy leader of Labour. Rosena was elected as the MP for Tooting the week before the EU referendum in 2016. Despite holding a shadow frontbench position, she refused to compromise on her principles or on the promises she’d made to her community, so she broke the whip and voted against triggering Article 50. Considering the shambles that followed Theresa May’s early triggering of Article 50, this has been conclusively demonstrated as the right decision. Rosena was also the first shadow frontbench minister to come out publicly and call for a People’s Vote. This was an incredibly brave thing to do, at a time when Labour MPs and shadow ministers were being pressured not to speak out against the leadership’s position on Brexit. At a time when the leadership of Labour needed a firm push in the right direction, Rosena was the one brave enough to stand up and do it. There are some voices in the Labour Party, who’ll try to convince you that Brexit was the only reason for Labour’s failure at the last general election – that backing a public vote cost us seats in the so-called ‘Red Wall’. But this analysis is deeply misleading, and is simply not supported by the facts. Yes, of course Brexit was a divisive issue, for Labour as much as for anyone else. The reality however, is that the overwhelming majority of Labour voters, members and supporters voted Remain, wanted us to stay in the EU and wanted a public vote on Brexit. That fact is as true of Labour voters in Redcar, Grimsby or Wakefield as it is of Labour voters in Oxford, Islington or Bristol – Labour’s share of the vote went down in 98% of all seats. Labour’s position on Brexit was fatally undermined not because supporting a public vote was the wrong position for our voters, but because the leadership of the party took so long to get to that position. We sat in the middle of the road on the biggest issue of our time and neither side trusted us. We lost trust among all our communities. Rosena knows this – she won’t stop standing up for our internationalist values. I joined the Labour Party because I believe in internationalism and solidarity across borders. So does Rosena. That’s why she’s worked across the world in conflict and disaster zones as a humanitarian doctor, and why she still does shifts in her local hospital as an A&E doctor alongside her work as an MP. So if you are like me – a proud pro-European, an internationalist and a Labour supporter – and if you want someone as deputy leader who’ll stand up for those values, and who’ll fight for our country to maintain the closest possible relationship with the EU, protecting our workers’ rights, our environmental protections, our food standards, our NHS, and most importantly the rights of EU citizens living in the UK – then vote for Doctor Rosena. Together, let’s take Labour forward. Brexit Might Be Done But The Fight Against Boris Johnson's Destruction Must ContinueAlthough the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback.\nWhen the UK leaves the EU this Friday, 31 January 2020, after 47 years of membership, it will be a sombre day for many of us. For others, it will be a day of celebration. For most people, I suspect they will simply hope we can now move on from talking about Brexit at the expense of everything else. As someone who campaigned with all my heart to stay in the EU, and as the first person on Labour’s front bench to publicly call for a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal, I am desperately sad to see us leaving our friends and allies in Europe. But we are leaving. The disastrous result of the General Election has settled that. This is no longer an argument about Leave or Remain, it’s about what kind of future we want for our country and for our children. That’s where the new fight begins. Boris Johnson wants to pretend he’s now “Got Brexit Done”, and we no longer need to worry about the details. He wants us to simply trust him to sort it all out. Well, I don’t trust him. Neither should you. He talks about “Global Britain” whilst turning his back on vulnerable child refugees. He talks about “Taking Back Control” while reducing parliament’s ability to scrutinise his decisions. He talks about attracting “Global Talent” to the UK while creating huge distress and uncertainty for EU citizens, many of whom have been here for years and who have made their lives in this country. The fight for our internationalist values starts now. It will be long, and it will be difficult, because Boris Johnson has a large majority – but that’s why it’s so important. When it feels like hope is lost, that’s when those of us who believe in progressive values and internationalism need to stand up and fight. If we don’t, no-one else is going to do it for us. We need to stand up and fight for our hard-won workers’ rights. We need to stand up and fight for our environmental protections. Most importantly, we need to stand up and fight for the rights of EU citizens living in this country. They are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues, our family. I work side-by-side with many of them in the NHS, when I work shifts as a doctor in my local A&E department. Under the draconian new immigration laws being bandied around by this government, my own Polish mother might not have been able to move to this country and make a life for herself. Although the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback. That’s one of the main reasons I am running to become the next Deputy Leader. We have huge organisational strength through our membership, through our links with the trade unions and through our MPs and councillors embedded in their local communities. Now is the time to deploy those strengths to maximum effect, to hold the Government to account and ensure that we fight back against every attempt to undercut our rights and freedoms at work, every attempt to weaken our environmental safeguards, every attempt to inject privatisation into our National Health Service. The slogan “Get Brexit Done” might have helped win the election for Boris Johnson, but for those of us who stand against his destructive vision for the future of our country, this fight isn’t done. It’s just getting started. My responses to the questions provided by the Labour Campaign for Free Movement 1. Defend and extend free movement: opposing any reduction in the freedoms of UK and EU citizens to live, work, and access social security in each others’ countries, and any immigration system based on incomes, migrants’ utility to business, and number caps or targets.I am the very embodiment of the benefits free movement has brought – my mother is Polish and was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Under the draconian new immigration policies being discussed by this Tory government, she might never have been able to do that. Protecting and extending free movement is at the very heart of my internationalist Labour principles. I believe our country is stronger and better because of free movement. When I work shifts as an A&E doctor in my local hospital, I work with NHS staff from across Europe and it breaks my heart to see many of them feeling unwanted or undervalued because of Brexit. As Deputy Leader, I pledge to do everything in my power to promote the core Labour values of internationalism and solidarity across borders, because I believe human life has the same value no matter where someone comes from. That means defending and extending free movement, and it means fighting to protect the human rights of migrants from this hostile Tory government. 2. Close every detention centreHolding migrants in detention centres, often in substandard conditions, is incredibly cruel and degrading. These are often vulnerable people, fleeing from a variety of horrific circumstances such as war, trafficking and poverty. They have the right to be treated with dignity, as human beings, as we would want ourselves or our family to be treated in such horrendous circumstances. When working abroad as a humanitarian doctor, I’ve seen first-hand some of the terrible conditions people are forced to endure in detention centres and it horrified me. We must fight back against the hostile environment the Tories have created for migrants – the Labour Party has always stood for international solidarity and openness to the world – we need a Labour government to bring those principles back into the core of our approach to immigration. I would want to listen to expert opinion on how to do this in a responsible way, but I certainly would want to close as many detention centres as possible and make sure we have an overall approach to immigration that means a concept as cruel as detention centres are not required in the first place. 3. Unconditional rights to family reunionYes, I fully support this. The unconditional right to family reunion is a fundamental element of treating migrants as human beings with dignity and equal value, rather than the Tory approach of seeing migrants as a problem to be managed. When I’ve worked as a humanitarian doctor in conflict zones across the world, it was always horrendous to see so many families ripped apart or prevented from seeing each other again. When I visited Palestine on a humanitarian mission, I saw sick children alone in hospital because the permit system meant their parents weren’t allowed to visit them. I immediately began working on ways to resolve this. It’s not enough to just talk about this – we need to be working every day to deliver a Labour government so we can fix these kinds of injustices. That’s what I’d do as Deputy Leader. 4. End “no recourse to public funds” policiesI support ending such policies, yes. This is another case of a Tory government treating migrants not as human beings with human dignity and equal value, but instead as a problem to be managed through cruelty. I want to deliver a Labour government with internationalism at its core, which would allow us to change our entire approach to migration, and begin seeing human life as equally valuable and equally dignified no matter where that person was born or where they’ve come from. 5. Oppose all Hostile Environment measures, use of landlords and public service providers as border guards, and restrictions on migrants’ NHS accessThe Tory Hostile Environment approach to immigration is a stain on the soul of their party, and they should be ashamed of it. Tragedies such as the Windrush scandal are a horrendous demonstration of where this approach leads, and I worry a similar scandal could occur with EU citizens who’ve made their lives in this country. I want a Labour government so we can end the Hostile Environment immediately and start treating migrants with the human dignity and respect they deserve. 6. Equal voting rights for all UK residents I am certainly interested in all ideas for how to revitalise our democracy and increase the level of engagement with our political process. Indeed, prior to the General Election in 2019, I publicly called for EU citizens to get the right to vote. Our Labour values of openness and internationalism must be at the core of everything we do. 7. Please share your thoughts on these wider issues that our supporters also feel strongly about:Even after Brexit, the UK government looks set to participate in Frontex (the European border agency) and its “Fortress Europe” policies. Will you challenge these policies? I certainly think the EU has often failed dismally to strike the right balance between border security and solidarity with people fleeing from war, poverty and the effects of global climate change. I am a proud pro-European, but that doesn’t mean my view of the EU is uncritical and I’ve never been afraid to say so. My values of international solidarity and openness don’t stop at the borders of Europe – they extend across the whole world. Human life always has equal value, no matter where that person comes from. Will you support an amnesty for undocumented migrants resident in the UK? We should always treat people with compassion and dignity, and we must place those values at the heart of everything we do when it comes to immigration. People in this country without documentation are often asylum seekers fleeing from horrific conditions and I want to see them treated with the human dignity they deserve. I would want to listen in more detail to expert opinion and feedback on the specific question of whether an amnesty is the right approach, but the principles of human dignity and compassion must always guide everything we do. Anything else you’d like Labour members, supporters and affiliates to know about what your leadership/deputy leadership would mean for migrants and migration policy? I am the living, breathing proof that free movement is a wonderful benefit to our country. My Polish mother was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Working on the frontlines of the NHS as an A&E doctor, I work alongside colleagues from across Europe and the rest of the world, and they are a credit to our country. It makes me proud to be British. But years of Tory government has created a literal Hostile Environment for migrants in this country. The drawbridge is being pulled up, and the rights of a whole generation of people to travel freely and live, love and work across Europe is being taken away. That is a tragedy, but it also means those of us who are proud of our outward-looking, progressive, internationalist values must fight even harder to protect and extend them. The fight starts now, and as your Deputy Leader (or even if I’m not!), I promise I will always be there fighting alongside you for those values with everything I’ve got. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

I was proud to have worked with the Mayor of London on his pledge to plant more trees across our city. This culminated in the Mayor and I planting his 500,000th tree right here at a local Tooting school.\nMore broadly, Labour is vowing to establish three new National Forests in England, whilst planting millions of trees and creating new woodlands. These trees will provide vital habitats for our fantastic wildlife and help fight the climate emergency. In my work as a humanitarian doctor, I have worked across the globe with the victims of war and human suffering. Ensuring that every person, wherever they are, has the safety and security of a roof over their heads and food in their stomach is of paramount importance to me.\nBefore the dissolution of Parliament, I sat on the International Development Committee, where we led an inquiry into the progress on the UN's second Sustainable Development Goal, namely to end world hunger. More broadly, I am pleased to see the Labour manifesto committing to restoring international aid to 0.7% of GNI as soon as the fiscal situation allows. As an NHS doctor myself, I understand how important speedy access to care is. With NHS waiting lists longer than ever, it comes as no surprise that many people are finding it difficult to reach the services they depend on.\nWith as many as 10 million people in the UK having been diagnosed with arthritis, it is of paramount importance that those with the condition can reach the support they need. Especially considering that arthritis and other MSK conditions can have a significant effect on a person’s quality of life. That is why I am pleased to see Labour pledging to cut NHS waiting times with 40,000 more appointments every week. As an animal lover and pet owner myself - I want the very best for all living creatures. I have long believed the UK should lead the world with high animal welfare standards. I was pleased to see the Labour Party pledge to ban exports of foie gras early on in the election campaign.\nI know that many people are concerned specifically about cruelty to our greatest companions; cats, dogs and other pets. Rest assured, I will always stand against cruelty. At this election, I am standing on a manifesto to improve animal welfare. Labour has pledged to ban trail hunting and the import of hunting trophies. We will end the scourge of puppy smuggling and farming, along with the use of snare traps. Most of all, we will partner with scientists, industry, and civil society as we work towards the phasing out of animal testing. I am wishing a happy Eid to those who are celebrating today. Hoping those celebrating enjoy a peaceful and blessed holiday.\nThe dedication and togetherness shown is so uplifting and makes our community the special place that it is. The Labour Party has finally announced our manifesto for change - the platform we'll be standing on to fix the mess made by 14 years of Tory failure.\nRead the manifesto online here. It was a fantastic experience to be at the Friends of Tooting Common Dog Show. The hosts, participants and everyone behind the scenes were brilliant. Judging Most Handsome Dog was incredibly hard, but many congratulations to Loki and his owner in what was a very close competition. The election campaign is in full swing - and there is lots of support on the doorstep for Labour.\nVoters are sick and tired of this shameful Tory Government. We need to get them out so that Labour can get on with the job of fixing their mess. This week, we've been campaigning locally in Balham, Earlsfield and Tooting. We've even been helping out our Labour colleagues out in Hitchin. The Tories have showcased their true colours once again recently; attacking people with mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety as belonging to \"sick note culture\" and meriting exclusion from the welfare system.\nRather than attacking people with mental illnesses, the Tories should have some humility and contrition, and look at the impact of their own shameful policies.

With its causes and symptoms, it’s a complex issue. But in a country as decent and well off as ours, we should not be seeing this increase in rough sleeping on our streets. I invited council reps, the City Hall housing team and local police to join me and see the issues in our community first-hand. I'm working hard to bring agencies together and effect change. A number of local residents have raised their concerns about people rough sleeping during this exceptionally cold spell, and of course amidst the pandemic.\nLike many, I believe the Government’s delay in housing rough sleepers during this third lockdown was completely irresponsible and lacked basic human compassion. In London alone, the Office for National Statistics estimates that 1 in 30 people have coronavirus, and we know that sleeping rough - without adequate shelter or access to basic hygiene facilities - leaves people more exposed to the virus. Today, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick MP announced that councils will collectively receive an additional £10 million in funding to house those currently sleeping rough, as well as an extension to the ban on bailiff evictions. Whilst I welcome this much-needed funding, this money will not help get everyone off the streets, and the ban on bailiffs fails to sufficiently protect renters. Many residents have contacted me with concerns for those who are sleeping rough outside Tooting Broadway tube station, Buzz Bingo and Sainsbury's. I want to reassure residents that I have recently written to the Head of Wandsworth Neighbourhood Policing Team to ensure these people are supported in the best way possible. Beyond the coronavirus emergency, there can be no return to business as usual. It is paramount that Ministers end rough sleeping for good. In a country as well-off as ours, we need to ensure that everyone has the right to a safe place to live. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

It's amazing that all catering is now in-house, with chefs cooking food that has been grown by the students themselves. The children were so enthusiastic about their freshly cooked and nutritious lunches. I believe that the work we’re doing with Chefs in Schools will go a long way to promote positive attitudes and relationships with food and mealtimes for our young people. It was great to be able to support!\nI arrived back home safely from Ukraine yesterday. I went on a humanitarian mission with MedGlobalOrg, who are helping support hospitals to prepare for the darkest days of this conflict. We worked with the most amazing people and met patients with the most heart-breaking stories. I was honoured to be able to help Ukrainian victims in the midst of the heart breaking turmoil they are experiencing. Let’s do all that we can to help support Ukraine. This week, we celebrated our fantastic women business owners in Tooting. Over the last two years, many women have felt a disproportionate economic hit. Women hold the key to supercharging our economy as we recover from the pandemic. Today I was delighted to welcome Anneliese Dodds MP to Tooting and meet with women business owners. I believe it is essential that we recognise the significant contribution women make and commit to tackling the challenges that they still face today. Also, we welcomed some of our community's many impressive business women and community leaders to Parliament. Tooting is home to so many - it's only right we back women in business. Lastly, a big thank you to Sir Keir Starmer MP for hosting. It was great to be joined by Wandsworth Police for my community safety event last night. We discussed local crime concerns, updated residents on local safety initiatives, and learned new ways to keep our homes safe. A big thank you to all who joined - the community feeling is strong. Additionally, it was great to hear from local residents about how we can make our area safer & about our success of the #SafeSpace campaign. Finally, we discussed future plans to tackle violence against women and girls. It was great to be joined by Lord Wajid Khan at Rutherford House School. We met with the school's Pupil Leaders who had some insightful questions about our work in Parliament, and also taught us about their values of resilience and respect. What a credit to the next generation! So glad that I was able to attend this event with Lord Khan. I was honoured to give a sermon at St. John the Divine Church today on racial justice - talking about me work in Calais and how we can all work against racism in our community. We all must stand together for racial justice! Thank you to the whole church community for the warm welcome. Such an incredible honour to have volunteered with the Care4Calais team in Calais and Dunkirk. Their compassion and work ethic is second to none and they do so much to help and support those who have lost everything, in the most difficult of circumstances. Care4Calais is a refugee crisis charity that helps with delivering essential aid and support, such as food and medical supplies, to refugees living in the UK, France, and Belgium. So glad that I could be a part of this experience to help with the crisis in Calais. I’m officially in the Christmas spirit! It was such a pleasure to open the Christmas fair at Penwortham, and hear the school choir perform together after two years! Lots of Christmas cheer and great stalls. I wanted to congratulate the Penwortham choir on their legendary performance. Thank you for the opportunity to attend! Today is Small Business Saturday and it is important to me to understand what it's like to run a local business, and the challenges and successes that people in our local community experience. So I rolled up my sleeves and got stuck into a shift at Tooting's famous flower stall with local legend Chris. Chris was absolutely wonderful! Thank you for teaching me a few things about the flower industry! I’m looking forward to learning more. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Pleasure to invite local residents to share a cuppa and hear about their local issues. Thanks to local organisations and the police for coming along and listening to residents.\nToday, I brought together officials from Wandsworth Council and Wandsworth Police to discuss what we can do to make Tooting Broadway a safer, cleaner and more vibrant place to live and work.\nTonight I joined Andrew Marr on LBC to talk about the appalling hospital conditions doctors face in Palestinian hospitals.\nThe Tories have scrapped the Mental Health Act - failing thousands of patients.\nLabour must seize the opportunity to modernise mental health legislation, with the Joint Committee's recommendations in mind. Read my piece in New Statesman here.\nTonight, I voted on an amendment to the King's Speech to support a ceasefire in Gaza.\nRead my full statement here:\nTonight, I joined with representatives of all faiths and none at the BATCA annual peace ceremony in Tooting.\nThank you to everyone for their prayers of peace. They are needed now more than ever and I am so proud to represent such a wonderful, caring community.\nToday, I read out the names of the fallen and laid a wreath at St Nicholas Church in Tooting with local councillors, Rex Osborn, Kate Forbes and Kemi Akinola and members of our emergency services.\nSince the horrific terrorist attacks on Israel in October, more than 1,000 incidents of antisemitic hate crimes have been reported to Community Secure Trust.\nToday, I visited their headquarters in London to see the work they are doing to tackle antisemitism. It is a stain on our society. It must be combatted and those who perpetrate it must face the full force of the law.\nToday, the Government have scrapped their pledge to reform the Mental Health Act.\nMore than six years of reports, campaigning and hard work has gone down the drain. Last year, I sat on the Joint Committee on the Draft Mental Health Bill. There was overwhelming cross-party support for reforming the Act. To this day, the Government has failed to respond to the committee's recommendations. Earlier this year, the Conservatives scrapped their own 10-year mental health plan. Dither, delay and failure is on form with the Tories' approach to tackling the crisis in mental health services. Black people are five times more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act. The Tories have scrapped a once in a generation opportunity to tackle this burning injustice. Last month, I challenged the Health Minister to commit to reforming the Mental Health Act, her response was less than insightful. It is disappointing that the Tories continue to bury their heads in the sand and neglect mental health services. They are out of ideas and it's costing patients their lives. Only Labour can provide the transformation needed to improve services.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_shadow-cabinet-minister-for-mental-health_3/content_636.html": "|\nToday, the Committee's Report on the Draft Mental Health Bill has been published - this is a once in a generation opportunity to improve the rights of patients experiencing a mental health crisis and to tackle the health inequalities enshrined in current legislation.\nOver the last six months, I've been proud to work with my committee colleagues, listening to patient voices and evidence from experts. We heard heartbreaking accounts from patients. Above all else, the legislation has to protect them and ensure they receiving appropriate care. For years, the Government kicked updating this legislation into the long grass, and now, the current draft bill still does not go far enough to tackle the racial disparity of those detained under the Mental Health Act. Patient voices must be at the heart of this legislation. Read the full report here: https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt5803/jtselect/jtmentalhealth/696/report.html Today, Justin Madders MP and I met with the Retail trade union Usdaw and a group of retail workers in Westminster to talk about how the cost-of-living crisis, rising violence and abuse in stores, and the impact of Christmas holiday trade is affecting the mental health of customers and colleagues.\nFar too many people are facing this Christmas period worried about how to provide for their families. With so many Usdaw members having their mental health impacted as a result of the cost-of-living crisis and increased levels of abuse in the workplace, it is deeply important that we, as politicians, take the time to listen. An undercover joint investigation by Sky News and The Independent has raised serious concerns about the safety of patients at inpatient settings ran by the Huntercombe Group.\nThis is the third investigation into abuse in secure inpatient mental health settings, in four weeks. The system is broken. I previously wrote to Therese Coffey, the previous Health Secretary, to raise my concerns about other similar investigations highlighting allegations of abuse, by Channel 4 Dispatches and BBC Panorama, but did not receive a response. The Government has been silent over these allegations and for weeks there wasn’t even a functioning Mental Health Minister. Patients, and their families, deserve answers. They deserve dignity, respect and access to high quality treatment, which is why I have called for a rapid review into mental health services and the way patients are treated in inpatient settings. See my statement in Parliament here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1587420289662492672?s=20&t=Gj2YhL3GB3Os4nSrRoGK7Q There is a crisis in our universities up and down the country, with record numbers of students now seeking mental health support, according to our latest research. Through Freedom of Information requests, we found that over 200,000 students sought support for their mental health across the UK in 2020-2021 – a threefold increase, since 2010. The lack of mental health support for our young people is not only affecting their health, but it also having a knock-on impact on their future prospects.\nUniversities are struggling to cope with the rising demand for access to the mental health treatment students need. Every five days, a student takes their own life. That is why Labour has put forward a comprehensive plan, that will put prevention of the heart of mental health services. Under Labour’s plan, we will recruit 8,500 new mental health professionals by the end of our first term in office, to see an addition one million patients per year. See more about the crisis in mental health at universities, here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1579388728153604098?s=20&t=CcG6Wxm1iHr6xo0Cfsjyww Parents arriving in A&E with ashen faces holding their children, whose bodies are skeletal and covered in cuts. Families are on suicide watch. Frontline NHS workers are at breaking point. This is the reality of Tory Britain in 2022.\nOur latest research has shown that more than a million patients referred to mental health services were turned away over the last 12 months, whilst the cost of mental illness to the British economy is £117 billion a year. This is the direct result of 12 years of Conservative mismanagement of our economy and public services. We need a growing economy to pay for modern, preventative sustainable healthcare, but we can only do this with a Labour Government that will put our public services back on track. The next Labour Government will transform our mental health services: new staff, new services, faster treatment, and prevention as our watchword. Better mental health for all. Read my latest piece in the Daily Mirror here. https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1579113927438663681?s=20&t=FTZA6bYs6BUjLJ-vVYAmzg Labour will revolutionise mental health treatment – putting prevention front and centre.\nIf ever there was an argument that prevention is better than cure, it is with mental health. We know that the longer mental illnesses are left untreated, the harder and more costly they are to treat. This mental health crisis is wrecking the British economy. Last year, 18 million work days were lost to mental illness - more than industrial disputes, more than injuries. It costs the UK economy at least £117 billion a year. And who does the cost-of-living crisis hit the hardest? Those already living with mental illnesses. The next Labour Government will guarantee treatment within a month, recruit 8,500 new staff, put a specialist in every school and a hub in every community. Labour will transform our mental health services: New staff. New services. Faster treatment. Prevention as our watchword. Better mental health for all. Watch my full speech here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1575177559943581696?s=20&t=wn3hxvRyskYM3JmyFl3dlg It was great to visit Mount Carmel Rehabilitation centre again recently. I’ve enjoyed working with this fantastic organisation over the last few years. Mount Carmel offers residential and day programmes to people struggling with addictions. Their Counsellors provide a series of programmes, including a range of talking therapy groups, art therapy and equine therapy, to help people overcome their addiction issues. The pandemic has left Mount Carmel more stretched than ever, with many people seeking help after relapsing or struggling with new addiction problems during the lockdowns. Despite the increased demand, the team at Mount Carmel continue to provide first class care to all their clients. I look forward to continuing to work with the team at Mount Carmel, and seeing all that they go on to achieve. If you would like to support the work they do in our community, you can donate to their Just Giving page below It was a privilege to speak at the 13th Annual Black Mental Health Conference, hosted by Wandsworth Community Empowerment Network. As a society, we have to understand the role cultural contact and intersecting identities play when working to support those struggling with their mental health. And we must continue to push back against stigma and foster an open and honest dialogue around mental health in our communities. Thank you for having me. On Monday 6 September, I’ll be live on Riverside Radio diving into why mental health matters and, perhaps most importantly, all your mental health matters. The last 18 months have been incredibly challenging for so many of us and have highlighted the importance of mental health care. We need true parity of esteem between physical and mental health. One step we can take towards reducing any stigma is by being open in our conversations around mental health. Join me for an honest, straight-talking hour, 6-7pm next Monday! And if you have any questions about mental health that you want to ask on air, please email [email protected]. Today, the BBC revealed that in 2018 4,500 people in mental health crisis were unlawfully held in police custody due to a lack of mental health beds.\nI spoke about this matter on BBC News earlier today. There is no question that the system must change immediately. This is nothing short of a scandal. Rest assured I will be pressing the Government on this issue. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_archives_05-2021/content_150.html": "|\nSince the outset of the pandemic, we have lost close to 500 Wandsworth residents to the virus (ONS). That’s 500 families grieving a lost one, 500 people with their own stories to tell, and a community collectively grieving those no longer with us. To remember those who died, I recently visited the National Covid Memorial Wall outside St Thomas’s Hospital, stretching across the south bank of the River Thames. The National Covid Memorial Wall was set up by the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, who I had the pleasure of meeting with in November last year. Hearing the evidence confirming what we knew and feared, of how severe failures caused countless avoidable deaths, results in a devastating combination of anger and heartbreak. All those bereaved are in my thoughts and will continue to be as we build back from this pandemic. On Tuesday, I was alerted to a team of Met Police officers stopping fast food delivery drivers and carrying out immigration checks on Mitcham Road. The only concerns I have received from local residents (which authorities were copied into) were about social distancing, for which an operation of this size seems excessive. However, the police say it was 'a road safety policing operation'. The Home Office say it was in relation to 'suspected immigration offences'. This looks like racial profiling - and under the Equalities Act 2010, this may amount to indirect discrimination due to its disproportionate impact on ethnic minority groups. If it's not unlawful, then it's definitely immoral and I cannot defend it. Our community here in Tooting is inclusive, diverse and welcoming. The celebratory nature of the police’s response to any arrests is not in line with our local values. I have met with the police since and encouraged them to focus their time on fighting crime – not targeting people at work. This May marks Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) Month. BPD, also known as Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD), is a serious and complicated mental illness that around 1 in 100 people live with. A type of ‘personality disorder’, BPD affects how individuals cope with life, manage relationships, and feel emotions. Those with BPD can experience deep distress, which is often caused by previous trauma. If you would like to find out more information on BPD, Mind and Rethink - two leading mental health charities - have dedicated pages on their websites. Mind’s can be viewed here and Rethink’s here. If you are experiencing BPD, BPD World also provides information and support to those affected by personality disorders. To find out more about the support they offer, see here. It is vital that we raise awareness of BPD to ensure that people receive the support they need and deserve without feeling stigmatised. I would like to congratulate Sadiq Khan on his return to City Hall, where he will be serving as Mayor of London for a second term. As a fellow Tooting-ite, having grown up on the Henry Prince Estate, I know our community has a sense of collective pride seeing Sadiq returned as Mayor of our incredible city. I would also like to congratulate Leonie Cooper on her re-election as Assembly Member for Merton and Wandsworth. Thank you to every single person in Tooting and across London who put their trust in the Labour Party, and thank you to all of the volunteers who hit the ground running, knocking on doors, delivering leaflets, and making phone calls. We will leave no stone unturned to get our city back on its feet. A brighter future is possible, and we’ll deliver it together. Rites for Girls is a local group which aims aims to prepare girls for that all-important transition from primary to secondary school, focusing on their wellbeing and self-esteem. Girls in Year 6 and 7 are being offered the opportunity to participate in monthly sessions over the course of the year, in which they will be taught about puberty, and learn strategies to take charge of their emotional, social, and physical wellbeing. As we look to the end of Government lockdown measures, during which time many girls have reported feeling disconnected from family and friends, the support Rites for Girls offers girls is more important than ever. Sessions will be held at the Woodfield Pavilion, Tooting Bec Common. For more information see here, or to book a place for your daughter contact [email protected]. As a new mum, it can be vital to talk and share your experiences with those in the same situation as you. No new mother should have to suffer in silence if they are struggling with their mental health. To mark Maternal Mental Health Week, I would like to share some brilliant charities and support services available for women and birthing people: Family Action offers specialist support services for parents with mental health difficulties. This includes services during pregnancy and after birth. Further information on Perinatal Support Services Family Lives can be found here. The Association for Postnatal Illness offers information and support for those experiencing postnatal depression. The APNI are available between 10am and 2pm, Monday to Friday on 0207 386 0868. Alternatively, an online chat box on the bottom left of their website can be found here. Family Lives offers confidential support, information and advice for parents. Support is available via email [email protected] or via there helpline on 0808 800 2222. PaNDAS - Postnatal Awareness and Support is a community organisation offering peer-to-peer support. PaNDAS has a free helpline, open 7 days a week, 11am to 10pm on 0808 1961 776. Alternatively, they can be contacted via email on [email protected] and a trained volunteer will aim to get back to you within 72 hours. If you are at crisis point, the Samaritans can be contacted 24/7 on 116 123. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has supported me on this incredible journey. One of the most fulfilling parts of my role as your MP is helping local people solve problems and, in this case, save money.\nA Furzedown pensioner had been denied over £12,000 in backdated pension payments and Pension Credit, however following my intervention with the Department for Work and Pensions, this money was recouped. If you have a problem with your state benefits or pension, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me and I'd be happy to help. Wandsworth Labour are freezing council tax for another year to help families through the cost-of-living crisis.\nAt the same time, we're improving services and building a better Wandsworth. My South London Press column is out today! As it was Valentine's Day this week, I wrote a love letter to my local area.\nAcross Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting, there is such an amazing range of people and culture locally. Read my article here👇 https://londonnewsonline.co.uk/ Wandsworth is bursting with creativity and culture. Our art, food and history are what makes our community such a great place to live.\nToday, Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney, and Marsha de Cordova, MP for Battersea, and I have written to Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, to support Wandsworth’s bid to be London Borough of Culture 2025. As the MP for Tooting, the safety of our community is my top priority. I am delighted that more than 100 local businesses have already signed up to become a Safe Space.\nFor more details, head to the Safe Space here It was wonderful to attend the Furzedown Project Christmas Party with a great carol performance from local children from Penwortham Primary School. Truly brilliant to see the community come together ahead of Christmas.\nOne of the most important jobs I do as your local Member of Parliament is ensuring that our wonderful communities in Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown, Tooting and Wandsworth Common remain safe and welcoming places to live.\nTo this end, I have recently hosted public meetings with local police leadership in Balham and Furzedown, conducted a walkaround with the Borough Superintendent around the local area, and written to the police on behalf of local residents on a wide range of issues. Please do let me know if you have any concerns regarding crime issues in the local area - my door is always open. It was great to bring together local charities, faith leaders, and leader of Wandsworth Council, Simon Hogg who are all working tirelessly to support local families through the cost-of-living crisis.\nI have already been contacted by countless Tooting residents who are concerned about how they are going to pay their bills and put food on the table this winter, and I fear this will only get worse as we move further into the winter months. With so many households already feeling the squeeze, it’s crucial that we work together to tackle poverty. Representatives from Earlsfield and Wandsworth foodbanks as well as Dons Local Action Group and Little Village Tooting told me that they are seeing unprecedented demand at present, as more and more of those who were just-about-managing become unable to afford the basics. All the organisations represented spoke of the added difficulties the rise in energy prices have brought. The hike in energy prices has meant that even the local charities who are there to address the crisis are struggling to pay their bills, and this means they are less able to help those in need. This comes at the worst possible time, when demand is at it’s highest level for decades. Everyone at the event had numerous stories of people facing hardship, people in overcrowded accommodation, people not being able to put food on the table or buy school uniforms for their children. Many people are also concerned about how they will meet the additional cost of christmas. Despite heartbreaking stories, it was uplifting to see so many people who donate their time, energy and money into making things better for people in our community. I am always amazed by the generosity of people in Tooting. However, in Britain in 2022 these organisations and charitable schemes shouldn’t have to exist. It is imperative that the Government take action immediately to support people through the months ahead. I was deeply concerned to hear pupils at Graveney School in Tooting were being targeted in a recent spate of muggings. I have been in touch with local police leadership to insist on swift action to address this issue. I know that the police are actively working to identify and arrest those responsible.\nEvery child deserves to walk our streets without fear. I am therefore pleased to hear that the local police force are carrying out high visibility patrols and are carrying out regular weapon sweeps around the school. Police are also patrolling the area in unmarked cars to try and identify and arrest the suspects. Pupils at Graveney School have also received assemblies on how to keep safe and how to report a street crime. The local police have also liaised with local CCTV to ensure appropriate coverage. It is vital that all of these issues are reported to the police so they can bring these worrying incidents to an end as quickly as possible. Anyone who has been a victim of a street robbery in this area who is yet to report the incident to the police are advised to do so. Please be assured, I will continue to work with our local police team to resolve this issue as quickly as possible, and I will continue to follow this case as a matter of urgency. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

On 9th February, the CEE Bill was debated in a thirty-minute adjournment debate. Adjournment debates are spaces at the end of the Parliamentary day when MPs can debate a specific topic. As you may know, the CEE Bill is a Private Members Bill (Presentation Bill), meaning that it does not involve a debate or a vote in Parliament, but rather it is a way of drawing attention to an issue. I support the principles of this Bill and will therefore continue to support Parliamentary measures that seek to implement many of the principles laid out in the Bill. Indeed, I have already supported several amendments to the Environment Bill in order to improve it, such as Clause 2 for environmental targets on particulate matter and Clause 7 for Environmental Improvement Plans. I will absolutely continue to support strong and effective amendments to the Environment Bill when it returns to the House of Commons in due course. The climate crisis is an imminent threat to current and future generations. Please know that I am committed to holding the Government to account on their approach to climate change. Local residents living or passing through Rackham Mews in Furzedown may have seen the large fly-tip that occurred earlier in the week. Understandably, this is very unpleasant for those who live near this area and I have therefore written to Paul Chadwick, Director of Environment and Community Services at Wandsworth Council, as well as notifying the local councillors of the issue in the hope that this can be rectified as soon as possible. Please be assured that I will keep local resident updated of the progress on this. Furzedown Police are currently appealing for witnesses, so if you have any information about this fly-tip, please do email [email protected] or message them via Twitter. I recently raised residents' concerns about damage to our beloved Tooting Common with Mr Neil Blackley, Head of Parks at Enable Leisure and Culture and have since received a response on this important issue I am told comprehensive is in plan to return the Common to its pre-pandemic state, while keeping as much as possible open for public use. Initial works will target the worst affected areas, and will see the soil replenished and grass seeds planted. While these works are scheduled to commence in the spring, it will be a number of years before this much-loved part of Tooting is restored.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

This is despite maternal illness costing the whole of society £8.1 billion a year. It is an absolute scandal. The 8,500 new staff Labour will recruit are vital to solving this crisis.

From taking care of the animals to competing in national young farmer competitions, students here are provided with the very best learning opportunities. These kids have an outlet to learn about agriculture and animals in a supportive environment. I’m so proud of the work the farm is doing, and I’m looking forward to returning to see everyone soon - especially the adorable animals. This week the Council finally listened to us! Our beloved Tooting Bec Athletics Track will be saved and get the investment it so desperately needs and deserves. To lose such a valuable asset in our community would be a devastating blow to so many of our young people. Having this track will be useful for encouraging young people to be physically active and lead a healthy lifestyle. Thank you to everyone who joined the efforts to save our track! It was an absolute pleasure to spend time at Beatrix Potter school today. The students were engaged, Year 3's cursive handwriting was impressive, and Year 6 had insightful suggestions on tackling the climate emergency. It's safe to say there were some future leaders in the room! It’s incredibly insightful to see young leaders develop and put their ideas into practice to shape the world in the future. I was truly inspired. Thank you for having me! It was an absolute pleasure to spend time at the Khalsa Centre Gurdwara here in Tooting, sharing prayers and food. It was nice to meet the Sikh community at the Gurdwara. Our community is a vibrant and multicultural place, and the diversity of our community is such a strength. Thank you so much for the warm welcome. Last week was the first time in two years, Tooting came together for the Multi-Faith Peace Ceremony. The importance of this ceremony is that leaders of the main faiths and civic leaders gather with the general public to express prayers and wishes for peace and community solidarity. Our community stood side-by-side, many faiths, all ages, and people from all walks of life who bonded over those differences. It was a real honour to be asked to speak and say a few words. Thank you.\nIt was a privilege to speak at the 13th Annual Black Mental Health Conference, hosted by Wandsworth Community Empowerment Network. As a society, we have to understand the role cultural contact and intersecting identities play when working to support those struggling with their mental health. And we must continue to push back against stigma and foster an open and honest dialogue around mental health in our communities. Thank you for having me. It was great to be part of the 'Any Questions' panel last night. During the show, I spoke about how every death caused by the Covid-19 pandemic is more than just a number. Each death is a family, torn apart by grief by losing a loved one.\nMask wearing, supporting people with proper sick pay, ensuring that indoor areas are ventilated - these are all things that should have never ended.

If you missed the show, you can listen back here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0010nv1 Rough sleeping is a significant and growing concern within our community. With its causes and symptoms, it’s a complex issue. But in a country as decent and well off as ours, we should not be seeing this increase in rough sleeping on our streets. I invited council reps, the City Hall housing team and local police to join me and see the issues in our community first-hand. I'm working hard to bring agencies together and effect change. The Year 2s at Tooting Primary School have been learning all about strong women. I was honoured to be invited to speak with the pupils all about being what it means to be a doctor and represent our wonderful community as MP. It is so important that we recognise and champion the voices and stories of strong women. And the students had great questions. They even taught me a few strong women facts! |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Today, I asked the Health Secretary when will he finally get his act together and back Labour's plans to recruit thousands of additional staff to bring down waiting times? See my question here Our exclusive data reveals that children in a mental health crisis spent more than 900,000 hours in A&E in England, last year. The total delays across England, in the past year alone, equate to 103 years of waiting time. This is a huge rise, up four-fold in the last decade.\nThe figures, made public through Freedom of Information requests, show the staggering number of hours that children have spent in a mental health crisis in Emergency Departments. With nowhere to turn, children with a mental illness are left to deteriorate – at which time A&E is the only place left for them to go. Emergency Departments are incredibly unsuitable settings for children in crisis, yet we’re witnessing increasingly younger children having to present to A&E in desperation. The next Labour Government will prioritise a truly preventative plan for mental health services and will put patient care first. We will ensure access to mental health professionals in every school and put an open access hub in every community, in addition to guaranteeing mental health treatment within a month for all who need it, by recruiting 8,500 new mental health staff to treat a million additional patients a year by Labour’s first term in office., funded by closing tax loopholes.

If you missed the show, you can listen back here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0010nv1 The Government recently released their “Plan for Health and Social Care”, in which they pledge to help the NHS recover from the coronavirus pandemic and reform the adult social care system - funded by a 1.25% increase in National Insurance payments.\nLow-paid families will now be hit with a double whammy of a Universal Credit cut and a hike in tax. In fact, some key workers will end up more than £1,000 worse off. While I have long called for investment in social care, this is not the appropriate way to fund it. Once again the Tories have put the very wealthiest above working people. I am proud to have voted against this National Insurance increase, which will be a damaging blow to so many working people in Tooting. Today, the BBC revealed that in 2018 4,500 people in mental health crisis were unlawfully held in police custody due to a lack of mental health beds.\nI spoke about this matter on BBC News earlier today. There is no question that the system must change immediately. This is nothing short of a scandal. Rest assured I will be pressing the Government on this issue. Today, I spoke with GMB and Royal College of Nursing frontline NHS staff at St George’s Hospital to hear their views on the Government’s latest pay offer. The last 18 months has impacted our beloved NHS immeasurably, and staff have made significant sacrifices in order to save lives. I stand in solidarity with my NHS colleagues. They deserve far more than just claps. They need a proper pay rise. “Prior to 2017, no Government invested in or prioritised mental health services.”\nI couldn’t have put it better myself - and I didn’t need to, for these are not my words. They are the words of Nadine Dorries, the Mental Health Minister. The devastation left behind by the cuts to mental health services is staggering. And who was the architect of these cuts? No one other than the new Health Secretary during his time as a Treasury Minister. This matter cannot go unaddressed. That is why in Parliament today I asked the new Health Secretary to explain why a quarter of mental health beds have been cut since 2010, why 140,000 children were turned away from mental health services last year, and, finally, if he is ashamed of his track record. See here to view the video. On Sunday, I was back in A&E working in the run up to the England v Italy match. While, unfortunately, it did not come home, it was great to spend time with hard-working colleagues at St Georges. With infections and hospitalisations increasing, it’s still incredibly important for us all to look out for one another and play our part in stopping the spread of the virus. Earlier this week, the Prime Minister gave an update on moving to stage four of the coronavirus easing roadmap. This means that from 19 July, the following will apply:\nUnderstandably, many are worried about the repercussions of these eased restrictions. Indeed, many residents have been in touch regarding the use of face coverings on public transport and their anxieties surrounding this. On Wednesday, Sadiq Khan announced that face coverings will remain mandatory for all, unless exempt, when travelling on the TfL network. This will, no doubt, be a relief to many in the local area, and I pay tribute to the Mayor of London in taking a firm stand against the Government’s recklessness. Labour is calling for a controlled approach that keeps in place baseline measures that can push down infections, like mandatory face masks on public transport – which we know protect people, reduce the spread of the virus, and don’t harm the economy. By removing mask requirements - the Johnson Variant is being fast-tracked. Cases will soar, as will hospitalisations. Everyone in Tooting has been fantastic in reducing the spread of coronavirus. With one of the highest vaccination rates in London, I can only ask residents to continue looking out for one another. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_labour-party_2/content_537.html": "|\nEven before the pandemic hit, the case for investing in this kind of support was clear. Coronavirus has exacerbated the existing crisis in mental health. Many NHS and social care staff have been scared of going to work, and they have lost patients and colleagues. It has been heartbreaking to witness the toll this virus has taken on staff mental health. Current support is not good enough, and without a tailored, fast-tracked service for staff who have faced death and despair every day for over three months, our frontline heroes will continue to be failed. We need to care for our carers. It is time for the Government to give back to those who have sacrificed so much to keep our loved ones safe. Unless our staff are protected, they cannot continue their vital work of keeping us all safe. Rosena Allin-Khan MP: \"I want to inspire Asians to own their identity”A CANDIDATE in the race for Labour’s deputy leadership has admitted the party “lost trust with voters” following its crushing defeat in the December general election.\nTooting MP Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is up against fellow MPs Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler, Ian Murray and Angela Rayner in the race, triggered by Labour’s huge loss last year. Suffering one of its worst results since 1935, Labour lost dozens of seats which they had held for decades, including a number of constituencies in the Midlands and northern England, which historically tended to support the party. The loss was down to a lack of trust, Allin- Khan believes. “People, quite frankly, didn’t trust us to govern,” the MP told Eastern Eye. “We had a manifesto which I believe was full of good things, but voters didn’t trust us to deliver it.” The party’s stance on Brexit was an additional factor – “we didn’t seem decisive enough” – and the level of anti-Semitism in the party and the way it was subsequently handled “closed a lot of doors”. “I’ve been up and down the country talking to individuals, wondering why Labour lost, and I’ve been told by activists that people didn’t think we had our own house in order,” she said. Today, she said, the most common concern of voters is the NHS, the level of safety on the streets and housing. “We need to show that the hopes and dreams that people have for themselves are the ones that we (Labour) have for them,” the mother-of-two said. Next month’s contest will also see the unveiling of a new Labour leader, after Jeremy Corbyn announced he would be stepping down following the general election last year. Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey are in the running to lead the opposition party. Allin-Khan, however, will not be voicing her support for any of the candidates as she believes the party needs to “heal all divisions (and) unite” after it fared so badly in the election. “When I’m working in A&E and I see kids coming in with lung infections because of mouldy housing or I see kids who have to go to food banks (…) they don’t care if Labour is left, right or centre,” she explained. “So, the most important thing to move forward is to unite and I can show that by not nominating someone for leader.” On her role in the deputy leadership race, Allin-Khan said she was determined to use it as an opportunity to help “ethnic minorities own their identity and be proud of it”. “That is what I want people to feel I embody when they look at me,” she explained. “For me, being in this race, if that is the one thing I get out of this…that other young British Asians can look at me and say, ‘if she can do it, I can do it too’, then that is my job done.” Allin-Khan admitted she had faced prejudice due to her mixed Pakistani-Polish heritage and has received criticism that she “isn’t fully Asian”. In response to the comments, the MP is keen to highlight her mixed heritage does not make her Asian background any less “important, valuable or special.” “I identify with being an Asian woman, in the same way that I am proud to be Polish,” she said. “Some people in the Asian community wonder how Asian I feel because I’m mixed race, but I’m proud to wear my sari and embrace my heritage.” Some have even suggested that she change her forename to Rosie and take her husband’s surname to downplay her ethnicity. However, Allin-Khan is proud of her roots and is keen to emphasise it. “I went double barrelled because I didn’t want to lose the Asian part of my surname and that for me, is very important,” she said. “I am proud to say that this is who I am – a Polish and Pakistani, proudly British Muslim woman who loves the Labour party.” Born and brought up in Tooting in a working-class household, Allin-Khan described her young life as “tough”. Her mother worked three jobs to keep the family financially afloat, and Allin-Khan recalled there only being one heater in the house that they had to move from room to room to keep themselves warm. Allin-Khan failed her A-Levels, citing the difficulties at home as a factor. Despite the setbacks, she still had a desire to study medicine. However, she was told “it wasn’t for girls like (her)”, as it was financially prohibitive, and she didn’t come from the “right background”. Allin-Khan, who still works part-time as a doctor, knew she had to keep fighting if she wanted to pursue her dream career. “I think my upbringing led me to believe I had no choice but to sink or swim,” she said. After resitting her A-Levels, the then-24-year-old accepted a place to study medicine at Lucy Cavendish College, University of Cambridge, which was funded by scholarships. “I really believe that where you start off in life doesn’t need to dictate where you end up,” the A&E doctor said. Although she credited her own resilience for her success, Allin-Khan believes the Labour government gave her an opportunity to fulfil her potential when things looked bleak. “The Labour government turned my life around,” the 43-year-old claimed. “I redid my A-Levels, did a degree and went to Cambridge to study medicine and I’m afraid those possibilities aren’t going to be there for a new generation of kids under this Tory government.” Allin-Khan, the MP for Tooting since 2016, admitted the biggest challenge of her involvement in politics is racism. She often faces abuse on social media and is mostly targeted for her Muslim beliefs. “When I look at the order in which my abuse comes, it is Muslim first, then my Asian heritage comes second,” she admitted. “My gender is third. Without a doubt, the amount of abuse is a huge challenge.” It is a concern that young BAME women may be deterred from entering politics due to the abuse other politicians have faced, she said. In response, Allin-Khan regularly engages with schools and community groups to encourage young people to “keep going and not to lose faith”. There is also a level of racism in the House of Commons, she said, highlighting that she is the first Muslim person ever to make it on to the deputy leadership ballot. Although it is encouraging to see more women and ethnic minority politicians in parliament, Allin-Khan believes there is “still a ceiling on what we can achieve”. Recently, Allin-Khan approached a “prominent BAME politician” to ask them to consider nominating her in the deputy leadership contest. However, the politician responded: “I’m only in the game of backing winners and you don’t look like you’ve got any chance of winning.” “We can’t have that attitude towards people, and I’ve said in my grassroots revival plan that our BAME communities can’t be an afterthought when it comes to supporting people to hold public office,” she said. “We need to be seeing ethnic minorities at the top of our party, on the front benches. “I’ve smashed that ceiling, but I plan to throw the ladder down and say people ‘come up behind, you can do this.’ But I know it isn’t easy.” My pledge to rebuild confidence in LabourI never imagined that one day I’d become an MP, or now a candidate to become the next Deputy Leader of the Labour Party. Growing up, I was regularly told that ‘girls like me’ from ‘backgrounds like mine’ wouldn’t amount to anything. I never planned to go into politics - I always wanted to be a doctor. The last Labour Government gave me that chance, allowing me to study Medicine aged 24 after failing my A-Levels the first time around because of pressures at home. This shaped the person that I am today and has given me the fire in my belly to ensure that no other child feels that there is a ceiling on what they can achieve.\nWhen I work shifts as an A&E doctor at my local hospital, I see first-hand the issues facing our communities today. I treat young people who come to A&E after self-harming, I treat those who haven’t been able to access mental health services for years, and yes, I treat victims of violent crime. To see a young person breathe their last breath is a pain that never leaves you. Teenage boys, once full of bravado on the street, with the words “Born to die” tattooed on their chests, victims of horrific stab wounds, laying there crying out for their mothers. The sound of a parent grieving for their child is universal - it can’t be forgotten. As the MP for Tooting, I have worked incredibly closely with community groups and young people to try and tackle the rise of violent crime in our society. I’ve organised summits with representatives from local community organisations, charities, the police, the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Council and the Deputy Mayor for Policing, to start tackling this problem from a community perspective. Working with affected communities is paramount in order to resolve these critical issues once and for all. As a keen boxer myself, I have promoted the work of local boxing clubs to tackle violent crime. Boxing is far more than just a sport - for many, it’s family. Clubs offer an opportunity for local young ¬people to make friends, engage with sport and receive mentorship. So much of gang culture and violence is about a sense of belonging. We have a duty to show young people that, if you can gain respect in the ring, you do not have to get respect from violence on the street. One of the reasons I decided to run to become the next Deputy Leader of the Labour Party is because it would give me the platform to give a voice to the voiceless. Whether it’s children losing their lives to senseless violence, older people being unable to access safe and decent social care, or refugees fleeing violence and persecution, their voices must be amplified. A platform alone isn’t enough though - Labour needs to be in power to affect real change for the most vulnerable in our communities. As Deputy Leader, I will rebuild our movement into one people can vote for. A party people can trust. The door may have closed on 12 December for a generation’s hopes and ambitions, but with the right leadership team in place in the Labour Party, it will not be closed for good. We need to win the next General Election, and we must listen to our voters ahead of the Mayoral election in May. As Deputy Leader, it will be my responsibility to rebuild trust, not just with the grassroots of our party, but with voters. Together, we can take Labour forward. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is MP for Tooting and candidate for Deputy Leader of Labour When I first met Rosena, she was Labour’s candidate in the 2016 Tooting by-election.\nAs a by-election candidate myself in Heywood and Middleton in 2014, I know how difficult and uniquely pressured by-elections can be and I wanted to help Rosena win the seat after the amazing Sadiq Khan left to become London mayor. As soon as I met Rosena, I knew that Tooting would soon have another fantastic Labour MP. Her boundless energy and enthusiasm inspired her whole team. I also knew that Rosena wouldn’t be just a backbench MP but that she would bring her skills and experience to the parliamentary Labour party and she’s certainly done that in her role as shadow sports minister and with her background as a practising A&E doctor in our NHS. The choice of who to support in the deputy leadership contest has been a difficult one for me. I know all the candidates and they’re all people I am proud to call friends. But it’s Rosena who has most impressed me in this campaign and I think she has the qualities that we need in our new deputy leader. After the disastrous election result in December 2019, where I lost my seat to the Tories – the first time that they have ever taken Heywood & Middleton – Rosena was one of the first people to contact me, to commiserate but also to talk about what went wrong and how we rebuild from here. She came up to my constituency to talk with key activists about the campaign and we explored every aspect, from Brexit through to our manifesto and the Labour leadership. We talked about Heywood and Middleton being a 62% Leave voting constituency and how I had tried to represent the views of all my constituents in trying to get a deal that worked for 100%. Rosena understands the issues that we face here in the North and I know that she is going to be a great campaigning deputy leader who will reach out across the country to win back those lost Labour seats in the North, the Midlands, Scotland and Wales. I see the role of deputy leader as being a campaigner, an organiser, an advisor and also a critical friend. I think that Rosena is more than capable of doing this job, and doing it extremely well. I am wary of any offer of leader/deputy leader ‘dream tickets’ suggesting a cosy, already formed relationship. The deputy leader has to be able to stand back and assess situations critically and I know that Rosena has the independence and strength of character to do this. I know how hard Rosena has worked to become a qualified doctor, and she’s not only continued to work shifts at St George’s Hospital, keeping her grounded and in touch with our NHS but she’s also done great humanitarian work reaching out internationally. I’ll never forget her impassioned speech in parliament when she returned from the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh where she’d been providing medical care to people who have nothing – no citizenship, no home, in many cases no family and no prospect of their situation improving. Rosena has the strength, knowledge, intelligence and empathy needed to unite our party and also to take our message out to the wider public. And whoever becomes leader, she will be a unique complement to them. I’m proud to call Rosena a friend, and I’m proud to support her to be the next deputy leader of the Labour Party. Rosena Allin-Khan kicks off Labour deputy leader campaign in Putney with ‘fire in her belly’\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan launched her deputy Labour leadership campaign in Putney last night. The campaign, held in the ballroom of the Star & Garter pub, brought together an eclectic crowd, including some young first-time voters. Tooting MP Dr Allin-Khan, who is running with the slogan ‘Taking Labour Forward’, is a qualified A&E front-line doctor and has provided humanitarian aid to refugees in Syria. Describing her determination to be the next deputy leader, she said: “Expertise in building trust in communities and shared life experience has put fire in my belly to achieve for others.” She set out her ‘internationalist’ vision of Britain’s future after Brexit and brought attention to the importance of social care reform, the significance of a grassroots revival and updating technology within the Labour Party. Labour’s Putney MP Fleur Anderson said that Dr Allin-Khan would be a ‘campaigner-in-chief’ and not a ‘leader-in-waiting’ if elected as deputy leader in a PoliticsHome article last week. The Musician’s Union has given their endorsement to Dr Allin-Khan and to Sir Keir Starmer for leader. Voting takes place from February 24 to April 2 and results will be announced on the April 4. Labour needs to become a party of progressive internationalism once againLast Tuesday, a boat capsized and sank in the Bay of Bengal. There were 138 Rohingya refugees crammed on the boat, fleeing from camps in Bangladesh. At least 15 bodies were found, including four children, with 50 more missing.\nI’ve been campaigning for the rights of the Rohingya since the recent crisis unfolded in 2017. I’ve been involved in humanitarian matters long before entering politics and standing to be Labour deputy leader. Stories such as those of the Rohingya do not often have a light shined upon them here in the UK. They happen far away and it feels as if they’re outside of our control. The UK has a proud history of humanitarian assistance and we must ensure that this continues. We must never allow ourselves to turn a blind eye. Every single human life has equal value, no matter where that person was born, what language they speak or what they look like. Humanity has no borders. This isn’t just something I believe in principle — I act on it. My work as a humanitarian doctor has taken me to the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, where grieving mothers told me accounts of their babies being ripped from their arms and murdered before their eyes. The guilt of coming home to my own three- and five-year-olds left me unable to sleep at night. Why should their lives be of more value to the world than those of the Rohingya children who are slaughtered without a dignified burial? I have seen how human life is not valued equally around the world. It lit a fire in my belly to continue fighting such injustice, no matter where it takes place. At the very heart of my Labour principles is internationalism. I believe this spirit of internationalism must drive everything we do as a party. We must always stand in unwavering opposition to any effort to restrict freedoms, whether here or globally. We’ve seen where this mentality leads — whether it is the tragedy of Windrush, the cruelty of detention centres like Yarl’s Wood, or the inhumanity of a government that votes against protection for vulnerable child refugees. Now is the time for all of us who believe in progressive, internationalist values to fight back. It is our duty to ensure that the Rohingya and other victims are not forgotten by the world. One of the reasons I decided to stand to become the next deputy leader of Labour is because I believe our party has a unique chance to become a global beacon of internationalism, as it has been before. We have arguably the largest grassroots membership of any political party in Europe. If we are able to unite behind a truly internationalist vision for our party and our country, we could be a force for change on a global scale. We have a wonderful society, which has welcomed so many people from across the world, but this government’s hostile environment is diminishing hope — hope for a brighter future, hope for a tolerant society. I first entered politics in order to shed light on humanitarian efforts around the world and give a voice to the voiceless. I still believe we can, and I want to help rebuild the Labour Party so that it becomes a powerful force for good. As a party we need to rebuild trust with our communities, with the British people and the international community. Let’s do this together. Rosena Allin-Khan is Labour MP for Tooting and candidate for the deputy leadership The Musicians’ Union has nominated Keir Starmer to be the next leader of the Labour Party, and Rosena Allin-Khan to be the next deputy.\nThe party-affiliated organisation has become the fourth trade union to back Starmer, and the first to back Allin-Khan. In 2015, the union nominated Andy Burnham for leader and Caroline Flint for deputy, and in 2016 it backed leadership challenger Owen Smith. Commenting on their nomination on Twitter, the Musicians’ Union said Starmer had been “a strong supporter of musicians”. “He understands the challenges musicians working in the EU are facing and what we need to do to meet them”. The organisation also revealed in a tweet that Allin-Khan was a “former Musicians’ Union member” and said they were “proud to see her rise so far” and “to support her as she continues fighting for young people to have a free musical education.” Starmer has already secured his place on the final ballot through both the support of affiliates, including large trade union UNISON, and the backing of local Labour parties. To reach the ballot paper, each candidate must be nominated by 5% of local parties or three affiliates, two of which must be trade unions, amounting to more than 5% of the total affiliate membership. Starmer has been nominated by a total of 159 constituency parties so far, as well as UNISON, Usdaw, SERA, Community, Labour Movement for Europe, Labour Business and the Socialist Health Association. Allin-Khan has yet to secure a place on the final ballot, having so far only secured the support of 17 CLPs and the Labour Campaign for International Development. Rosena Allin-Khan is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in5/2/2020\nFleur Anderson MP: As Deputy Leader, Rosena Allin-Khan would be a campaigner-in-chief, not a leader-in-waitingRosena Allin-Khan is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in, writes Putney's new MP, Fleur Anderson.\nThe night of the General Election result was a deeply distressing moment for all of us who love the Labour Party and who love our country. It was an horrific experience to watch the door close on a whole generation as the Tories won a huge majority to continue their destructive and damaging agenda. But I was also hugely proud and honoured to produce the only Labour gain of the night, as I became the new MP for Putney. It was, I hope, a rare bright light in an otherwise long, dark night for all those Labour activists, members and volunteers who worked tirelessly during the election. Rosena’s help and support was vital to that win. She is my friend and colleague, as we were councillors together and she is the MP for the neighbouring constituency of Tooting. It’s sometimes forgotten how difficult it can be for prospective parliamentary candidates, especially ones who’ve never stood to be an MP before. Of course, it’s a huge honour to be given the chance to represent your local community, and to make their voices heard in the corridors of power – but you also have to put your life on hold for months, spending hardly any time with your friends and family, working and campaigning relentlessly, whatever the weather, rain or shine. And at the end of it all, there’s absolutely no guarantee you’ll get the job, especially in a marginal seat like Putney. It’s incredibly rewarding, but it’s hard work too. Rosena was there for me every step of the way, helping me, guiding me, giving me advice and encouragement and very practical support too. I cannot thank her enough. She is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in, and every single voter who meets her comes away with a positive impression and a smile on their face. I should know - we stood to be Councillors together in the same ward in 2014 - fighting a seat that had been Tory for 24 years - and we won, through sheer hard work and positive conversations. Rosena is a relentless optimist – she always finds the positives in every situation and she never gives up, no matter what. Her life-story is a true demonstration of our Labour values – she comes from an impoverished background, failed her A-levels first time around but persevered, and because of reforms introduced by a Labour government, she was able to study at Cambridge and become a doctor before becoming an MP - it shows the difference a Labour Government can make to the lives of people across our country. Rosena is now running to become the next Deputy Leader of Labour. There’s no doubt she’s the underdog in the race, but that’s never stopped her before, and I know it won’t stop her now. She would be a phenomenal Deputy Leader of our Party, and that’s why she’s got my total support. She’s got the most interesting and substantive ideas of any of the candidates, and she’s already published a fantastic Grassroots Revival manifesto of how the Labour Party can improve our campaigning practices to get back to winning ways ahead of the local elections in May. As Deputy Leader, she would be a campaigner-in-chief, not a leader-in-waiting. In Putney, I saw the real difference she made with her energy, her optimism and her campaigning skill. Thanks to Rosena’s help, we turned blue seats into red ones, and if she’s elected as the next Deputy Leader, we can start doing that across the whole country - at both a local and a national level. Let’s take Labour forward. Fleur Anderson is Labour MP for Putney. Labour Campaign for International Development endorses Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan for Deputy Leader30/1/2020\nI am hugely proud and honoured to be nominated for Deputy Leader by the Labour Campaign for International Development.\nAs someone who has worked as an humanitarian doctor in conflict zones across the world, their progressive approach to international development and promotion of global justice is an inspiration. My priority will always be to put human rights and international solidarity at the core of everything I do. Human life should have equal value, no matter where someone comes from. These principles shouldn't just apply to our international development policies, they should be applied to everything we do as the Labour Party. I want to thank the Labour Campaign for International Development for their support and their endorsement. Let's take Labour forward, together. Thank you Doctor Rosena |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_changes-to-our-roads/content_19.html": "|\nI have received lots of correspondence from local residents regarding the changes that have been made to our roads as part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood and the Streetspace schemes on the A24 (Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road). As part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood schemes, many streets have had filters put in to close the road to all vehicles except cycles and some now have turning restrictions. As part of the Streetspace scheme, a number of changes have been made to Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road including the installation of wands to segregate cycle lanes, a number of turning restrictions as well as changes to bus stops.\nThese changes have come about as a result of statutory guidance that the Government issued in May, stating that local authorities were expected to make significant changes to their road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians “as swiftly as possible”. (If you would like to read more about this statutory guidance you can read it in full here.) As a result, TfL made £55m of funding available to the 33 councils in London as part of its “Streetspace for London” programme to urgently create new segregated cycle lanes, extend pavements and close roads to traffic. Wandsworth Council was given £1,923,500 by TfL and used this money to implement the LTNs. TfL has, in consultation with Wandsworth Council but acting separately, implemented changes to the A24. I am supportive of initiatives which reduce car usage, make our streets safer, encourage cycling and create a better local environment. But we must make it work for everyone in Tooting and Balham. I know that lots of local residents have concerns and comments about how the changes have affected our community. The only way to have your voice heard is to feed into the consultations that Wandsworth Council is running and to let TfL know what you think by emailing them. To respond to Wandsworth Council's consultation, click here. To provide feedback to TfL please email: [email protected] It is important to note that I was not consulted prior to the implementation of these changes to our roads and I have no control over the decisions that have been made. As the local MP, I can lobby the Government and the relevant Ministers, but I cannot make decisions for the Conservative Council. I am listening and engaging with local residents on this but I cannot make alterations to these changes. If you have already provided your feedback to Wandsworth Council's consultation and/or emailed TfL, and you want to raise your concerns with other officials, you may also wish to contact Wandsworth Council's Transport spokesperson Councillor John Locker via email at [email protected], or the Government's Minister of State with responsibility for cycling and walking Chris Heaton-Harris MP via email at [email protected] Comments are closed.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_national_12/content_675.html": "|\nWhen I first met Rosena, she was Labour’s candidate in the 2016 Tooting by-election.\nAs a by-election candidate myself in Heywood and Middleton in 2014, I know how difficult and uniquely pressured by-elections can be and I wanted to help Rosena win the seat after the amazing Sadiq Khan left to become London mayor. As soon as I met Rosena, I knew that Tooting would soon have another fantastic Labour MP. Her boundless energy and enthusiasm inspired her whole team. I also knew that Rosena wouldn’t be just a backbench MP but that she would bring her skills and experience to the parliamentary Labour party and she’s certainly done that in her role as shadow sports minister and with her background as a practising A&E doctor in our NHS. The choice of who to support in the deputy leadership contest has been a difficult one for me. I know all the candidates and they’re all people I am proud to call friends. But it’s Rosena who has most impressed me in this campaign and I think she has the qualities that we need in our new deputy leader. After the disastrous election result in December 2019, where I lost my seat to the Tories – the first time that they have ever taken Heywood & Middleton – Rosena was one of the first people to contact me, to commiserate but also to talk about what went wrong and how we rebuild from here. She came up to my constituency to talk with key activists about the campaign and we explored every aspect, from Brexit through to our manifesto and the Labour leadership. We talked about Heywood and Middleton being a 62% Leave voting constituency and how I had tried to represent the views of all my constituents in trying to get a deal that worked for 100%. Rosena understands the issues that we face here in the North and I know that she is going to be a great campaigning deputy leader who will reach out across the country to win back those lost Labour seats in the North, the Midlands, Scotland and Wales. I see the role of deputy leader as being a campaigner, an organiser, an advisor and also a critical friend. I think that Rosena is more than capable of doing this job, and doing it extremely well. I am wary of any offer of leader/deputy leader ‘dream tickets’ suggesting a cosy, already formed relationship. The deputy leader has to be able to stand back and assess situations critically and I know that Rosena has the independence and strength of character to do this. I know how hard Rosena has worked to become a qualified doctor, and she’s not only continued to work shifts at St George’s Hospital, keeping her grounded and in touch with our NHS but she’s also done great humanitarian work reaching out internationally. I’ll never forget her impassioned speech in parliament when she returned from the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh where she’d been providing medical care to people who have nothing – no citizenship, no home, in many cases no family and no prospect of their situation improving. Rosena has the strength, knowledge, intelligence and empathy needed to unite our party and also to take our message out to the wider public. And whoever becomes leader, she will be a unique complement to them. I’m proud to call Rosena a friend, and I’m proud to support her to be the next deputy leader of the Labour Party. Labour needs to become a party of progressive internationalism once againLast Tuesday, a boat capsized and sank in the Bay of Bengal. There were 138 Rohingya refugees crammed on the boat, fleeing from camps in Bangladesh. At least 15 bodies were found, including four children, with 50 more missing.\nI’ve been campaigning for the rights of the Rohingya since the recent crisis unfolded in 2017. I’ve been involved in humanitarian matters long before entering politics and standing to be Labour deputy leader. Stories such as those of the Rohingya do not often have a light shined upon them here in the UK. They happen far away and it feels as if they’re outside of our control. The UK has a proud history of humanitarian assistance and we must ensure that this continues. We must never allow ourselves to turn a blind eye. Every single human life has equal value, no matter where that person was born, what language they speak or what they look like. Humanity has no borders. This isn’t just something I believe in principle — I act on it. My work as a humanitarian doctor has taken me to the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, where grieving mothers told me accounts of their babies being ripped from their arms and murdered before their eyes. The guilt of coming home to my own three- and five-year-olds left me unable to sleep at night. Why should their lives be of more value to the world than those of the Rohingya children who are slaughtered without a dignified burial? I have seen how human life is not valued equally around the world. It lit a fire in my belly to continue fighting such injustice, no matter where it takes place. At the very heart of my Labour principles is internationalism. I believe this spirit of internationalism must drive everything we do as a party. We must always stand in unwavering opposition to any effort to restrict freedoms, whether here or globally. We’ve seen where this mentality leads — whether it is the tragedy of Windrush, the cruelty of detention centres like Yarl’s Wood, or the inhumanity of a government that votes against protection for vulnerable child refugees. Now is the time for all of us who believe in progressive, internationalist values to fight back. It is our duty to ensure that the Rohingya and other victims are not forgotten by the world. One of the reasons I decided to stand to become the next deputy leader of Labour is because I believe our party has a unique chance to become a global beacon of internationalism, as it has been before. We have arguably the largest grassroots membership of any political party in Europe. If we are able to unite behind a truly internationalist vision for our party and our country, we could be a force for change on a global scale. We have a wonderful society, which has welcomed so many people from across the world, but this government’s hostile environment is diminishing hope — hope for a brighter future, hope for a tolerant society. I first entered politics in order to shed light on humanitarian efforts around the world and give a voice to the voiceless. I still believe we can, and I want to help rebuild the Labour Party so that it becomes a powerful force for good. As a party we need to rebuild trust with our communities, with the British people and the international community. Let’s do this together. Rosena Allin-Khan is Labour MP for Tooting and candidate for the deputy leadership The Musicians’ Union has nominated Keir Starmer to be the next leader of the Labour Party, and Rosena Allin-Khan to be the next deputy.\nThe party-affiliated organisation has become the fourth trade union to back Starmer, and the first to back Allin-Khan. In 2015, the union nominated Andy Burnham for leader and Caroline Flint for deputy, and in 2016 it backed leadership challenger Owen Smith. Commenting on their nomination on Twitter, the Musicians’ Union said Starmer had been “a strong supporter of musicians”. “He understands the challenges musicians working in the EU are facing and what we need to do to meet them”. The organisation also revealed in a tweet that Allin-Khan was a “former Musicians’ Union member” and said they were “proud to see her rise so far” and “to support her as she continues fighting for young people to have a free musical education.” Starmer has already secured his place on the final ballot through both the support of affiliates, including large trade union UNISON, and the backing of local Labour parties. To reach the ballot paper, each candidate must be nominated by 5% of local parties or three affiliates, two of which must be trade unions, amounting to more than 5% of the total affiliate membership. Starmer has been nominated by a total of 159 constituency parties so far, as well as UNISON, Usdaw, SERA, Community, Labour Movement for Europe, Labour Business and the Socialist Health Association. Allin-Khan has yet to secure a place on the final ballot, having so far only secured the support of 17 CLPs and the Labour Campaign for International Development. Rosena Allin-Khan is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in5/2/2020\nFleur Anderson MP: As Deputy Leader, Rosena Allin-Khan would be a campaigner-in-chief, not a leader-in-waitingRosena Allin-Khan is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in, writes Putney's new MP, Fleur Anderson.\nThe night of the General Election result was a deeply distressing moment for all of us who love the Labour Party and who love our country. It was an horrific experience to watch the door close on a whole generation as the Tories won a huge majority to continue their destructive and damaging agenda. But I was also hugely proud and honoured to produce the only Labour gain of the night, as I became the new MP for Putney. It was, I hope, a rare bright light in an otherwise long, dark night for all those Labour activists, members and volunteers who worked tirelessly during the election. Rosena’s help and support was vital to that win. She is my friend and colleague, as we were councillors together and she is the MP for the neighbouring constituency of Tooting. It’s sometimes forgotten how difficult it can be for prospective parliamentary candidates, especially ones who’ve never stood to be an MP before. Of course, it’s a huge honour to be given the chance to represent your local community, and to make their voices heard in the corridors of power – but you also have to put your life on hold for months, spending hardly any time with your friends and family, working and campaigning relentlessly, whatever the weather, rain or shine. And at the end of it all, there’s absolutely no guarantee you’ll get the job, especially in a marginal seat like Putney. It’s incredibly rewarding, but it’s hard work too. Rosena was there for me every step of the way, helping me, guiding me, giving me advice and encouragement and very practical support too. I cannot thank her enough. She is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in, and every single voter who meets her comes away with a positive impression and a smile on their face. I should know - we stood to be Councillors together in the same ward in 2014 - fighting a seat that had been Tory for 24 years - and we won, through sheer hard work and positive conversations. Rosena is a relentless optimist – she always finds the positives in every situation and she never gives up, no matter what. Her life-story is a true demonstration of our Labour values – she comes from an impoverished background, failed her A-levels first time around but persevered, and because of reforms introduced by a Labour government, she was able to study at Cambridge and become a doctor before becoming an MP - it shows the difference a Labour Government can make to the lives of people across our country. Rosena is now running to become the next Deputy Leader of Labour. There’s no doubt she’s the underdog in the race, but that’s never stopped her before, and I know it won’t stop her now. She would be a phenomenal Deputy Leader of our Party, and that’s why she’s got my total support. She’s got the most interesting and substantive ideas of any of the candidates, and she’s already published a fantastic Grassroots Revival manifesto of how the Labour Party can improve our campaigning practices to get back to winning ways ahead of the local elections in May. As Deputy Leader, she would be a campaigner-in-chief, not a leader-in-waiting. In Putney, I saw the real difference she made with her energy, her optimism and her campaigning skill. Thanks to Rosena’s help, we turned blue seats into red ones, and if she’s elected as the next Deputy Leader, we can start doing that across the whole country - at both a local and a national level. Let’s take Labour forward. Fleur Anderson is Labour MP for Putney. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan: As a doctor and as a daughter I know social care is broken.\nThe deputy leadership candidate has spoken about the horror of finding her dad - who has dementia- injured and not knowing what happened. She wants to make sure no other family has to suffer that way. Nothing prepares you for finding your loved one bruised and blooded. Nothing prepares you for never finding answers. This is the reality that every day, so many people are living through, across the UK, because of the nature of the social care system. Nothing prepared me for being one of the statistics. My father has fronto-temporal dementia – he cannot communicate his thoughts but he is fully aware of what is happening. My brother and I found him bloodied and bruised on more than one occasion, we have sought answers but we know that we will never find them. He is safe now, but his health has deteriorated massively and has affected his life expectancy. This is not just my reality. This is the reality for so many others across the country. I am lucky. I was able to call a debate last year and get The Mirror to cover my family’s journey. Most people don’t have that luxury. Instead, they’re left fighting the social care system. I’ve been on both sides. As an aggrieved family member and a local politician with a responsibility for social care, I’ve seen the strife that goes into placements on both sides. The system is failing our most vulnerable residents. As it stands, the social care system is not fit for purpose. The Tories promised in their manifesto that they would tackle social care. It’s been three years – and yet still no Green Paper, despite countless promises. Last week, in Parliament, I asked the Health Secretary how many more families will suffer before the Government looks to reform the social care system. There was no answer. As an A&E doctor, who regularly sees vulnerable older people stranded in hospital because they don’t have access to adequate social care, and as a daughter, who’s had to go through this process, I have the following recommendations: - A truly independent complaints process – formal complaints should not have to go through the care provider or local authority who the complaint is against. - A reformed process for awarding care contracts – to ensure that failing companies cannot simply change their name and continue providing inadequate care. - An Independent Advocate for Older People – to protect and promote the rights of older people. - Mandatory CCTV with an opt-out – CCTV in communal areas within care homes should be mandatory to provide evidence of any unacceptable behaviour in a care setting. - A fully funded social care system, integrated into our NHS, with a ban on outsourcing to private companies. Increased funding alone won’t solve the problems being faced by our most vulnerable – only enacting the above changes will. At some point in our lives, we all have an experience with the social care system – as a daughter, I know how difficult it is when this system fails you. As Labour Deputy Leader, I would continue putting pressure on this Tory Government and their poor record on social care. As a society, we must protect our most vulnerable – sadly, nothing prepares you for confronting the worst. As your Deputy Leader, I would work with the Leader of the Labour Party to put the NHS and social care front and centre of our policy going forward. We need to protect our most vulnerable. We need a Labour Government. Labour Campaign for International Development endorses Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan for Deputy Leader30/1/2020\nI am hugely proud and honoured to be nominated for Deputy Leader by the Labour Campaign for International Development.\nAs someone who has worked as an humanitarian doctor in conflict zones across the world, their progressive approach to international development and promotion of global justice is an inspiration. My priority will always be to put human rights and international solidarity at the core of everything I do. Human life should have equal value, no matter where someone comes from. These principles shouldn't just apply to our international development policies, they should be applied to everything we do as the Labour Party. I want to thank the Labour Campaign for International Development for their support and their endorsement. Let's take Labour forward, together. Thank you Doctor Rosena Brexit Might Be Done But The Fight Against Boris Johnson's Destruction Must ContinueAlthough the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback.\nWhen the UK leaves the EU this Friday, 31 January 2020, after 47 years of membership, it will be a sombre day for many of us. For others, it will be a day of celebration. For most people, I suspect they will simply hope we can now move on from talking about Brexit at the expense of everything else. As someone who campaigned with all my heart to stay in the EU, and as the first person on Labour’s front bench to publicly call for a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal, I am desperately sad to see us leaving our friends and allies in Europe. But we are leaving. The disastrous result of the General Election has settled that. This is no longer an argument about Leave or Remain, it’s about what kind of future we want for our country and for our children. That’s where the new fight begins. Boris Johnson wants to pretend he’s now “Got Brexit Done”, and we no longer need to worry about the details. He wants us to simply trust him to sort it all out. Well, I don’t trust him. Neither should you. He talks about “Global Britain” whilst turning his back on vulnerable child refugees. He talks about “Taking Back Control” while reducing parliament’s ability to scrutinise his decisions. He talks about attracting “Global Talent” to the UK while creating huge distress and uncertainty for EU citizens, many of whom have been here for years and who have made their lives in this country. The fight for our internationalist values starts now. It will be long, and it will be difficult, because Boris Johnson has a large majority – but that’s why it’s so important. When it feels like hope is lost, that’s when those of us who believe in progressive values and internationalism need to stand up and fight. If we don’t, no-one else is going to do it for us. We need to stand up and fight for our hard-won workers’ rights. We need to stand up and fight for our environmental protections. Most importantly, we need to stand up and fight for the rights of EU citizens living in this country. They are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues, our family. I work side-by-side with many of them in the NHS, when I work shifts as a doctor in my local A&E department. Under the draconian new immigration laws being bandied around by this government, my own Polish mother might not have been able to move to this country and make a life for herself. Although the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback. That’s one of the main reasons I am running to become the next Deputy Leader. We have huge organisational strength through our membership, through our links with the trade unions and through our MPs and councillors embedded in their local communities. Now is the time to deploy those strengths to maximum effect, to hold the Government to account and ensure that we fight back against every attempt to undercut our rights and freedoms at work, every attempt to weaken our environmental safeguards, every attempt to inject privatisation into our National Health Service. The slogan “Get Brexit Done” might have helped win the election for Boris Johnson, but for those of us who stand against his destructive vision for the future of our country, this fight isn’t done. It’s just getting started. My responses to the questions provided by the Labour Campaign for Free Movement 1. Defend and extend free movement: opposing any reduction in the freedoms of UK and EU citizens to live, work, and access social security in each others’ countries, and any immigration system based on incomes, migrants’ utility to business, and number caps or targets.I am the very embodiment of the benefits free movement has brought – my mother is Polish and was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Under the draconian new immigration policies being discussed by this Tory government, she might never have been able to do that. Protecting and extending free movement is at the very heart of my internationalist Labour principles. I believe our country is stronger and better because of free movement. When I work shifts as an A&E doctor in my local hospital, I work with NHS staff from across Europe and it breaks my heart to see many of them feeling unwanted or undervalued because of Brexit. As Deputy Leader, I pledge to do everything in my power to promote the core Labour values of internationalism and solidarity across borders, because I believe human life has the same value no matter where someone comes from. That means defending and extending free movement, and it means fighting to protect the human rights of migrants from this hostile Tory government. 2. Close every detention centreHolding migrants in detention centres, often in substandard conditions, is incredibly cruel and degrading. These are often vulnerable people, fleeing from a variety of horrific circumstances such as war, trafficking and poverty. They have the right to be treated with dignity, as human beings, as we would want ourselves or our family to be treated in such horrendous circumstances. When working abroad as a humanitarian doctor, I’ve seen first-hand some of the terrible conditions people are forced to endure in detention centres and it horrified me. We must fight back against the hostile environment the Tories have created for migrants – the Labour Party has always stood for international solidarity and openness to the world – we need a Labour government to bring those principles back into the core of our approach to immigration. I would want to listen to expert opinion on how to do this in a responsible way, but I certainly would want to close as many detention centres as possible and make sure we have an overall approach to immigration that means a concept as cruel as detention centres are not required in the first place. 3. Unconditional rights to family reunionYes, I fully support this. The unconditional right to family reunion is a fundamental element of treating migrants as human beings with dignity and equal value, rather than the Tory approach of seeing migrants as a problem to be managed. When I’ve worked as a humanitarian doctor in conflict zones across the world, it was always horrendous to see so many families ripped apart or prevented from seeing each other again. When I visited Palestine on a humanitarian mission, I saw sick children alone in hospital because the permit system meant their parents weren’t allowed to visit them. I immediately began working on ways to resolve this. It’s not enough to just talk about this – we need to be working every day to deliver a Labour government so we can fix these kinds of injustices. That’s what I’d do as Deputy Leader. 4. End “no recourse to public funds” policiesI support ending such policies, yes. This is another case of a Tory government treating migrants not as human beings with human dignity and equal value, but instead as a problem to be managed through cruelty. I want to deliver a Labour government with internationalism at its core, which would allow us to change our entire approach to migration, and begin seeing human life as equally valuable and equally dignified no matter where that person was born or where they’ve come from. 5. Oppose all Hostile Environment measures, use of landlords and public service providers as border guards, and restrictions on migrants’ NHS accessThe Tory Hostile Environment approach to immigration is a stain on the soul of their party, and they should be ashamed of it. Tragedies such as the Windrush scandal are a horrendous demonstration of where this approach leads, and I worry a similar scandal could occur with EU citizens who’ve made their lives in this country. I want a Labour government so we can end the Hostile Environment immediately and start treating migrants with the human dignity and respect they deserve. 6. Equal voting rights for all UK residents I am certainly interested in all ideas for how to revitalise our democracy and increase the level of engagement with our political process. Indeed, prior to the General Election in 2019, I publicly called for EU citizens to get the right to vote. Our Labour values of openness and internationalism must be at the core of everything we do. 7. Please share your thoughts on these wider issues that our supporters also feel strongly about:Even after Brexit, the UK government looks set to participate in Frontex (the European border agency) and its “Fortress Europe” policies. Will you challenge these policies? I certainly think the EU has often failed dismally to strike the right balance between border security and solidarity with people fleeing from war, poverty and the effects of global climate change. I am a proud pro-European, but that doesn’t mean my view of the EU is uncritical and I’ve never been afraid to say so. My values of international solidarity and openness don’t stop at the borders of Europe – they extend across the whole world. Human life always has equal value, no matter where that person comes from. Will you support an amnesty for undocumented migrants resident in the UK? We should always treat people with compassion and dignity, and we must place those values at the heart of everything we do when it comes to immigration. People in this country without documentation are often asylum seekers fleeing from horrific conditions and I want to see them treated with the human dignity they deserve. I would want to listen in more detail to expert opinion and feedback on the specific question of whether an amnesty is the right approach, but the principles of human dignity and compassion must always guide everything we do. Anything else you’d like Labour members, supporters and affiliates to know about what your leadership/deputy leadership would mean for migrants and migration policy? I am the living, breathing proof that free movement is a wonderful benefit to our country. My Polish mother was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Working on the frontlines of the NHS as an A&E doctor, I work alongside colleagues from across Europe and the rest of the world, and they are a credit to our country. It makes me proud to be British. But years of Tory government has created a literal Hostile Environment for migrants in this country. The drawbridge is being pulled up, and the rights of a whole generation of people to travel freely and live, love and work across Europe is being taken away. That is a tragedy, but it also means those of us who are proud of our outward-looking, progressive, internationalist values must fight even harder to protect and extend them. The fight starts now, and as your Deputy Leader (or even if I’m not!), I promise I will always be there fighting alongside you for those values with everything I’ve got. Nothing prepares you for seeing a colleague in tears over antisemitism.\nLabour deputy leadership hopeful, Rosena Allin-Khan, speaks about her heritage informing her fight against Jew-hate, and her commitment to mending ties with the community. “There is nothing that prepares you for seeing a colleague in tears,” says Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, one of five hopefuls standing for Labour’s deputy-leadership. Committed to winning back the trust of the community – and standing up for MPs such as Luciana Berger and Ruth Smeeth who are no longer in Westminster – Allin-Khan, currently the MP for Tooting, seems sincere in her battle against hate. She grew up as the daughter of immigrants – her father hailing from Pakistan, her mother from Poland, herself the descendent of resistance fighters killed by the Nazis. But she’s aware that hate and prejudice won’t be solved over a chat with tea and biscuits. Before her career in politics, she was a humanitarian doctor, working on the ground with Palestinians, while her mother’s family from Poland were killed by the Nazis. It’s these experiences which allow her to reconcile speaking out against Israeli policies, while committing herself to the fight against antisemitism, drawing praise from the community in carefully balancing these issues. The first of her pledges is to meet with the Jewish Labour Movement, should she get elected. It would be “essential to the restructuring” of relations, and “how we rebuild trust.” She is also keen on an education program, saying “people use antisemitic tropes and they don’t even realise what they’re doing and they repeatedly do so.” While indicating she would speak with “any group that was looking to acknowledge there was a problem, and work towards coming up with a solution to fix it” she adds that she is the “only deputy leader candidate who hasn’t nominated a leader”. She’s willing to “work with whomever the leader is” on rebuilding trust. Calling the demise in relations between the community and the party “sad” and “terrible”, she opens up about “people I know that I am very close to, who have been really brave and speaking out antisemitism in the party.” “They have received torrents of abuse and nothing’s been done about it”. “Any leader seeing something like this unfolding needs to be all over it”, she says. But was Corbyn’s team responsible? She says they were not the “cause of the antisemitic problem in Labour, I think they didn’t deal with the problem, well enough”. Yet, she’s under no illusions as to the extent of the problem, saying it must be tackled “from a grassroots membership level first and take it all the way to MPs themselves”. “The complaints process wasn’t dealt with properly”, Allin-Khan says, adding: “As people began to show antisemitic abuse .. the more they saw it wasn’t being dealt with the more they felt able to do so.” On mending ties, she wants an “independent” process for tackling complaints with “outstanding cases to be dealt with within a particular time”, and “automatic expulsion” for antisemitism, though she wouldn’t be drawn on whether she would intervene, like Tom Watson, who she is trying to succeed. Her drive to fight antisemitism is in part inspired by her heritage. “My mum’s Polish and I lost lots of family during the war. They were not Jewish, but they fought alongside Jewish friends and my great uncle died during that time, my grandma was pregnant in the Warsaw ghetto with my uncle.” “That whole experience is a very real part of my history, and it is a shared history that I understand deeply and I’m very saddened about with the Jewish community. She was embroiled in a dispute with the Israeli Deputy Ambassador in 2016, following a radio discussion about Palestinians’ access to medical aid. After revealing the two had met in person to discuss the issue, she was accused of being “bought by Zionists”, facing significant online abuse. Her response drew praise, with Dave Rich from the Community Security Trust saying it “illustrated the difference between pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist”. She says: “I am a doctor, and have been a humanitarian doctor for my whole professional life.” “It is possible, and fair, to identify areas where there could be improvement to somebody’s life and health and not to conflate that with a whole antisemitic issue. “ I will always be proud to stand up for people’s basic human rights, and I’m also very aware of my history and my shared history with the Jewish community. I feel it’s perfectly possible to manage the two.” Many former Labour voters feel unrepresented. That has to change\nThe Labour party has shaped who I am today. It has helped provide me with the opportunity to train as a doctor and has given me and my family life chances we otherwise would not have had. I want everyone to experience these opportunities. It deeply saddens me to see a lost generation for whom the door closed on their dreams and ambitions on 12 December. Growing up poor and cold while my single mum worked three jobs to support me and my brother taught me the reality of day-to-day life for many people in the UK. My mother always told me, even through our darkest moments, that there were people worse off than us – and I have never forgotten that. The Labour party changed my life. Despite failing my A-levels due to difficult circumstances at home, I was finally able to go to Cambridge University at the age of 24 to study medicine because of reforms the Labour party made in government. People did not know what we stood for – the Tories had three simple words Working on the A&E frontline has shown me the best and worst of society. A&E is a microcosm of real life. I hold parents as they say goodbye to their children who have died through senseless violence. I talk to nurses who tell me they can’t afford to feed their children and are having to use foodbanks. I treat older people who just want the dignity of accessing social care in their homes. But I also see hope. The UK is full of people pushing through barriers to serve their communities. Our NHS provided me with the skills to give back to society – it spurred me on to work as a humanitarian aid doctor in disaster zones across the world, something that I have been proud to continue during my time as an MP. I am proud of the internationalist views of the Labour party – we must never turn our backs on the world’s most vulnerable. On the border of Myanmar, it was shocking to listen to the stories of Rohingya refugees speaking of having to make the impossible decision of whether to save their child who was thrown alive on to a burning fire, or escape with their surviving child. We must not turn our backs on those who are living through the absolute worst of human atrocities. In Palestine, I was heartbroken to meet children who were undergoing cancer treatment utterly alone because their parents were unable to obtain permits to accompany them. Humanity should have no borders. Only with a Labour government can the UK have a truly outward, internationalist approach, ensuring that we are there for people in their times of greatest need. In order to be in government, we must get our house in order, and as deputy leader this would be my priority. We cannot look to champion equality abroad, while turning a blind eye to racism in our party. This needs to end. As deputy leader, my first major meeting would be with the Jewish Labour Movement – they are our official Jewish affiliate; we must listen. I want JLM to be at the forefront of this fight against antisemitism, especially when it comes to education at the grassroots level. I will separate the complaints process from HQ, making it independent and asking the new team to immediately review all cases, acting swiftly and expelling antisemites. There must also be a strict time limit by which cases need to be resolved. I commit to adopt every recommendation proposed by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, without hesitation. Enough is enough. Only then will we be able to start rebuilding trust. Communities across the country have turned away from Labour, thinking that we do not represent them. We must listen with humility to people across our country and across our movement to assess why we’ve lost the last four elections, and how we can win people back. From speaking to people in seats that we lost in December, I have been told that trust in us has gone. People did not know what we stood for – there appeared to be new policies announced every day and voters did not trust that we had a plan for how to deliver them. The Tories had three simple words. To win, we need to be able to communicate our messages, not just internally, but with the public. I will focus on grassroots campaigners being armed with the information and messaging that they need to talk to voters on the doorstep. I will equip candidates and their local Labour parties with the resources that they so desperately need. I will introduce reduced membership rates to our emergency service workers so they can have a say within Labour on the NHS at this vital time. We need to build our movement into one people can vote for. A party people can trust. Under this government, which has chosen to block child refugees from reunification with their families, I worry for the future of our children. I worry for the future of tolerance. I worry for the future of compassion. We have a wonderful society, which has welcomed so many people from across the world, but the hostile environment this government is imposing on our country is restricting the ability to hope. Hope for a brighter future. Hope for a tolerant society. The door may have closed on 12 December for a generation’s hopes and ambitions, but with the right leadership team in place in the Labour party, it will not be closed for good. We need to win the next general election, and we must start rebuilding trust ahead of local elections in May. As deputy leader, it will be my responsibility to rebuild trust, not just with the grassroots of our party, but with voters. Together, we can take Labour forward. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_wandsworth-prison/content_47.html": "|\nAs 2024 draws to a close, I wanted to take this opportunity to look back on the events of the past year. It has been a year of change and renewal - full of ups and downs - but as I enter into my ninth year as your Member of Parliament for Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting, it remains the greatest honour of my life to represent the community in which I was born and raised. Entering the new year, I would like to pay tribute to the incredible frontline workers working around the clock to keep the country going through the festive period. From our NHS services to local hospitality staff to food bank volunteers - you all have my heartfelt gratitude for your tireless work this Christmas and throughout the year. A year for democracyWhat a year it has been for elections, both locally and across the country. We began the year with a fantastic win in the Tooting Broadway by-election, increasing the Labour vote share by nearly 7% to a whopping 58% majority. Then came the Mayoral elections in May, when we kept London red by electing my Tooting predecessor Sadiq Khan to a historic third term as Mayor of London. Finally - and most importantly - we finally elected a new Labour Government after 14 long years, with areas up and down the country voting Labour for the very first time. It was humbling to receive the most votes of any Labour MP and thanks must go to everyone who voted for me - your support means the world. £100m to fix Wandsworth PrisonAfter years of campaigning - and countless stories of mismanagement and scandal - the Ministry of Justice announced a £100 million funding package for HMP Wandsworth. This will go a long way to reduce the impact of overcrowding, repair crumbling cell blocks and facilities, and ensure that prison guards can work in a safe environment. Delivering for everyone in TootingThousands of local people have contacted me this year regarding a variety of issues, I have dealt with 15,000 cases. I reclaimed tens of thousands in unpaid pensions or benefits for local people, got decisions on hundreds of delayed passport or visa applications, and helped countless local residents get repairs to their homes. My door is always open and please get in touch if there is anything I can help with. On the NHS frontline\nSpeaking up for Gaza It has now been over a year since the horrific 7th October attacks and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza. The humanitarian disaster we have seen unfold there in the time since, has been truly heartwrenching. This year, I've raised the issue numerous times in Parliament, visited the region in the spring, and held evidence sessions with humanitarian experts. Revitalising Tooting town centre\nThis Morning and Loose Women Using my background as an NHS doctor, I have enjoyed trying my hand at being a TV medic this year! The lovely people at This Morning and Loose Women have had me on many times to talk about a range of topics from mental health to medical emergencies and even gave me space to open up about my own childhood challenges with speech, in a bid to end stigma and help others. Work in Parliament\nKeeping our streets safe in 2024, I successfully campaigned for a tripling of the Tooting neighbourhood policing team, putting more bobbies on our streets. In the summer, Operation Kenny run by the Metropolitan Police resulted in a 70% reduction in crime in Tooting town centre. This work will continue with the new Government's plans to recruit 13,000 new officers and return policing to communities. Cleaning up the local area I have never stopped campaigning for cleaner streets. This year saw a 15% reduction in fly-tipping in Wandsworth, with thousands of fines issued to people dumping their bulky rubbish on our streets. Meanwhile, Wandsworth Labour introduced food recycling for the first time ever in the borough. Free School Meals roll-out\nMental health reform Mental health is incredibly important to me and, for far too long, much-needed reforms were swept under the rug by a Conservative Government that simply wasn't interested. After much hard work, it was fantastic to see reform of the Mental Health Act announced in the King's Speech in July - this was long overdue.\nFollowing a recent spot inspection of HMP Wandsworth by the Chief Inspector of Prisons. an Urgent Notification was issued to the Secretary of State for Justice, meaning that the Chief Inspector has serious and immediate concerns about the day-to-day operation of the prison.\nThe report was damning and laid the blame for the deficiencies squarely at the Government's door, citing a lack of leadership at the very highest levels. I have been raising these issues for years now and my concerns have gone unheeded by this Tory Government, even after a high-profile alleged escape last autumn. Read my Twitter thread on the subject below:\nToday I met with the Prison Officers Assocation from Wandsworth Prison and Battersea and Wandsworth TUC to discuss the brutal conditions officers face.\nThey told me about appalling conditions with three assaults on staff every day. This simply can’t go on - the Govt must get a grip on the crisis in our prisons. Tonight, I spoke to Channel 4 News about the appalling conditions faced by staff and inmates in Wandsworth Prison. This can't go on. The Government urgently needs to get a grip on the crisis in our prison system instead of pretending that nothing is wrong. With 80 prison officers unavailable on the day Daniel Khalife escaped from Wandsworth Prison - it beggars belief that he was even allowed to work in the kitchen. The Government need to explain themselves. Today, I've been speaking about the very serious concerns I have regarding the prisoner escape from Wandsworth Prison. The Government need to provide answers regarding how this was allowed to happen. With schools crumbling, our prisons falling apart, and the NHS on it's knees, you can't trust the Tories with the NHS. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_all_34/content_741.html": "|\nLocal residents living or passing through Rackham Mews in Furzedown may have seen the large fly-tip that occurred earlier in the week. Understandably, this is very unpleasant for those who live near this area and I have therefore written to Paul Chadwick, Director of Environment and Community Services at Wandsworth Council, as well as notifying the local councillors of the issue in the hope that this can be rectified as soon as possible. Please be assured that I will keep local resident updated of the progress on this. Furzedown Police are currently appealing for witnesses, so if you have any information about this fly-tip, please do email [email protected] or message them via Twitter. As you will know, a South African variant of Covid-19 has arrived in the UK. This new Covid variant has now been detected in CR4 (Merton). Residents in CR4 are no different to us in neighbouring Tooting (SW16 and SW17). We use the same shops, the same hospital, and the same parks, so if it’s there, it could very easily be here. This will be the same across all affected areas. As a matter of urgency, the Government needs to launch widespread testing in neighbouring postcodes. This is the only way to see how widespread these new variants are. I have written to the Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock MP, the Director of Public Health at Wandsworth Council, Shannon Katiyo, and the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Council, Paul Martin, to ask about plans to launch testing in neighbouring postcodes. While I press for action on this, we need to make sure we’re all doing everything we can to keep ourselves and each other safe. It’s absolutely vital that we minimise our social contact to prevent the spread of this new variant within our community. Please think twice before leaving home, and when you do leave, please continue to adhere to social distancing. Together, we will get through this. Since the Labour Party tabled a vote on the cladding scandal, I wanted to update you on the outcome of the Opposition Day Debate and the subsequent vote that took place on Monday 1 February 2021. While I'm pleased to let residents know that the Labour Party motion proposed passed 263 to 0, disappointingly, however, the Government didn't bother to turn up. It is worth noting that, while the motion has been passed, Opposition Day motions are not legally binding and there is no guarantee that the Government will take the proposals into consideration. In recent times, however, it has generally been convention for the Government to review policies that have been successful at the end of an Opposition Day Debate. My thoughts remain with everyone in the local area who is affected by this cladding scandal. I know how difficult this is for you, and please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government on this. Earlier this week I met with local small business owners to hear the issues affecting them.\nFrom the insufficient support available to businesses that are non-direct ratepayers, to a lack of flexibility from landlords regarding rental payments, it is clear that the challenges Tooting small business owners are experiencing are considerable. Their resilience in the face of adversity is a credit to our community. The concerns shared will inform my actions to ensure that small businesses remain the beating heart of Tooting. Please check back here for updates, and keep an eye on my Facebook and Twitter pages for announcements of further events. In light of the upcoming Fire Safety Bill, I would to thank every resident who has written to me with their concerns on this and for continuing to keep me updated on the cladding issues affecting their property. I recognise what an exceptionally difficult time this is and appreciate how much anxiety the cladding proposals are causing to many leaseholders.\nOn more than fifteen occasions, Ministers promised that leaseholders would not be landed with the costs of remedial works. Yet, people are still being put at risk, trapped in flammable buildings for a third lockdown, with leaseholders placed in an impossible position and promises broken. It is evident that the Government’s handling of the cladding crisis has lacked any sense of grip or urgency. For this reason, the Labour Party have tabled an Opposition Day Debate on cladding for Monday, which will subsequently bring forward a vote that will call for leaseholders to be protected from the costs of remediating their blocks with dangerous cladding. The party will also be tabling a number of amendments to the Fire Safety Bill that will aim to protect leaseholders from unfair costs through the power of the law. I am aware that many residents have been in touch to request that I support the McPartland and Smith amendment, which provides welcome clarity on the specific costs that would be prevented from being passed on to leaseholders. Labour has sought to go further on this. As currently drafted, the McPartland and Smith amendment would not have covered blocks like Grenfell - where flammable cladding has been added at some stage following the building of the block. It only applies to defects in the original design of buildings. The Labour Party’s amendment would ensure that the cost of fire safety problems from refurbishment jobs, like the cladding on Grenfell Tower, cannot be passed on to leaseholders. Labour’s amendments also include new clauses so that the Bill protects leaseholders from the day it comes into law, instead of an unknown date in the future. I would like to thank my colleagues in the Labour Party, Sarah Jones MP, Nick Thomas-Symonds MP, Thangam Debbonaire MP and Mike Amesbury MP for their hard work and commitment to addressing this large injustice on a national scale. If any residents have any further queries on this issue, please do not hesitate to get in touch to discuss this further. In the meantime, I hope this post assures you of the steps myself and the Labour Party are taking to protect tenants and leaseholders during this cladding crisis. I recently raised residents' concerns about damage to our beloved Tooting Common with Mr Neil Blackley, Head of Parks at Enable Leisure and Culture and have since received a response on this important issue I am told comprehensive is in plan to return the Common to its pre-pandemic state, while keeping as much as possible open for public use. Initial works will target the worst affected areas, and will see the soil replenished and grass seeds planted. While these works are scheduled to commence in the spring, it will be a number of years before this much-loved part of Tooting is restored.\nWandsworth Council is currently consulting local residents on its ‘Local Plan’ document on developments for the borough across the next 15 years. This plan identifies Tooting as a potential area for regeneration, where proposals include new sustainable transport, improvements to public realm, and contributions to the health and wellbeing of residents.\n3. 56 Tooting High Street on the west corner of the Garratt Lane and Tooting High Street junction: The Council are considering using this site for a development of sustainable architecture and urban design, as well as considering the planting of street trees on Garratt Lane.\nFurther information on these proposals can be found here. Whilst I hold no authority over Wandsworth Council, it is important to me that residents, businesses and organisations have their say on these proposals. If you would like to submit comments on the ‘Pre-Publication’ Draft Local Plan, you must do so before 11.59pm on Monday 1 March 2021 using the following link: https://www.wandsworth.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy/local-plan/draft-local-plan-pre-publication/\nA number of local residents have raised their concerns about people rough sleeping during this exceptionally cold spell, and of course amidst the pandemic.\nLike many, I believe the Government’s delay in housing rough sleepers during this third lockdown was completely irresponsible and lacked basic human compassion. In London alone, the Office for National Statistics estimates that 1 in 30 people have coronavirus, and we know that sleeping rough - without adequate shelter or access to basic hygiene facilities - leaves people more exposed to the virus. Today, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick MP announced that councils will collectively receive an additional £10 million in funding to house those currently sleeping rough, as well as an extension to the ban on bailiff evictions. Whilst I welcome this much-needed funding, this money will not help get everyone off the streets, and the ban on bailiffs fails to sufficiently protect renters. Many residents have contacted me with concerns for those who are sleeping rough outside Tooting Broadway tube station, Buzz Bingo and Sainsbury's. I want to reassure residents that I have recently written to the Head of Wandsworth Neighbourhood Policing Team to ensure these people are supported in the best way possible. Beyond the coronavirus emergency, there can be no return to business as usual. It is paramount that Ministers end rough sleeping for good. In a country as well-off as ours, we need to ensure that everyone has the right to a safe place to live. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_mental-health_3/content_591.html": "|\nToday, I called on the Health Secretary to get his act together on our failing mental health services. Across mental health services, children are being failed, police are spending hours waiting with children in crisis in A&E, staff are overworked are under-resourced. It's time for the Health Secretary to get a grip or get out of the way. Some businesses take their workplace mental health responsibilities very seriously. It was extremely insightful to talk to leaders of Talon, JCDecaux, Clear Channel Outdoor, Ocean Outdoor today, about what they’re doing to support employees’ mental health.\nToday, I wrote to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, regarding my growing concerns about the limited powers of the ongoing inquiry into the deaths of up to 2,000 patients in mental health hospitals in Essex Partnership University Trust over the past 20 years.\nThe inquiry has only received the co-operation of less than 30% of named staff, who are essential witnesses in the deaths that are being investigated, leaving families in limbo and further compounding their grief. I have called on the Health Secretary to give the inquiry the full statutory powers required to ensure families get answers and that lessons can be learned for the future. Read my full letter here: As Mental Health Awareness Week comes to a close, I’ve been highlighting Labour’s bold plan for improving services across England, with prevention and early intervention at its heart.\nOn my visit to Maudsley Hospital, I spoke to the incredible Aji Lewis, who has tirelessly campaigned for Seni's Law to transform patient safety across the country. I spoke at a Parliamentary reception for Mental Health Foundation and joined Baton of Hope in Parliament, for a meeting with the Speaker to discuss their work on suicide prevention. And finally, speaking to students South Thames College, I spoke about my role as Shadow Cabinet Minister for Mental Health, holding the Government to account for failure in Mental Health services across England. Patients experiencing a mental health crisis often find themselves stuck in A&E.\nThe Health Secretary should be ashamed. Today, I asked the Health Secretary when will he finally get his act together and back Labour's plans to recruit thousands of additional staff to bring down waiting times? See my question here It was fantastic to be out in the gorgeous Peak District to support my friend and High Peak's next Labour MP, Jon Pearce. We first visited the Glossop Arts Project to see the amazing work they do, using art to support young people's mental health - of course, we had to indulge in the offer of a free toastie and cuppa too!\nOn the doorstep afterwards, we spoke to so many people fed up with the Tories, both locally and in Westminster. There are council elections coming up in May and Labour has every chance to take full control of the council here! The views were incredible, the people lovely, and I can't wait to be back! Today marks World Bipolar Day, which raises awareness and reduces the stigma surrounding bipolar disorder. One-in-fifty people in the UK live with bipolar disorder yet many struggle to access the services they need to get a proper diagnosis. Living with bipolar disorder can have a devastating impact on the people struggling with the illness as well as an impact on their loved ones, which is why it is vital that people are able to get a diagnosis early. We need a Government that will get serious on bipolar disorder. Labour will put prevention and early intervention at the forefront of our approach to mental health. The next Labour Government will recruit 8,500 new staff to ensure mental health treatment within a month for all who need it.\nOn Eating Disorder Awareness Week, I spoke a debate in Westminster Hall on challenging the stereotypes and assumptions around eating disorders. Across the UK, there are as many as 1.25 million people living with an eating disorder. Eating disorders have considerably high mortality rates, with anorexia claiming the most lives of any mental illness. Yet, with timely and appropriate treatment, people can go on to live healthy and fulfilling lives. We need a Government that will get serious on mental health and eating disorders. Labour will put prevention and early intervention at the forefront of our approach to mental health. We will place a mental health specialist in every school and place an open access hub for young people in every single community. Our latest research, shows that in 2021/22, the total number of days lost to poor mental health has doubled to more than 730,000 over the last decade. This comes at the same time that there has been a drop in the number of neighbourhood police officers by 6,000 and of Police Community Support Officers by 8,500.\nThese absences equate to over 2,000 police officers being off sick each day, last year alone, due to poor mental health. It is clear that this Conservative Government has presided over 13 years of neglect and staff shortages that have left our public services at breaking point. The next Labour Government will recruit 8,500 more mental health professionals, ensuring a million more patients get treated each year; and we will rebuild neighbourhood policing, delivering a package of 13,000 extra neighbourhood officers and PCSOs, putting police back on the beat. Read the full story here Our exclusive data reveals that children in a mental health crisis spent more than 900,000 hours in A&E in England, last year. The total delays across England, in the past year alone, equate to 103 years of waiting time. This is a huge rise, up four-fold in the last decade.\nThe figures, made public through Freedom of Information requests, show the staggering number of hours that children have spent in a mental health crisis in Emergency Departments. With nowhere to turn, children with a mental illness are left to deteriorate – at which time A&E is the only place left for them to go. Emergency Departments are incredibly unsuitable settings for children in crisis, yet we’re witnessing increasingly younger children having to present to A&E in desperation. The next Labour Government will prioritise a truly preventative plan for mental health services and will put patient care first. We will ensure access to mental health professionals in every school and put an open access hub in every community, in addition to guaranteeing mental health treatment within a month for all who need it, by recruiting 8,500 new mental health staff to treat a million additional patients a year by Labour’s first term in office., funded by closing tax loopholes.

Step 2: You will receive a Safe Spaces package with a large sticker to display in your premise window and a poster with information to share with your employees about Safe Spaces. Step 3: In the event someone needs to use your premises as a place of safety, you provide them with facilities to charge their phone, call a taxi or 999 if necessary. Please note, that if someone is behaving violently towards a member of the public or your staff, always call 999. This campaign will make clear to the public that you are a business that supports the safety of all members of our community and the right of all to travel without fear of harassment or violence.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_transport/content_324.html": "|\nData from National Rail and the Rail Delivery Group has revealed a shocking rise in the number of late trains at Balham, Earlsfield, Tooting and Wandsworth Common stations. Trains in the morning evening peaks, to and from Central London, have all seen a worsening of their \"on-time percentage\" in the last six months compared to the same period of 2023. The full breakdown of delays at each station is below. It is shocking to see that, not only are trains late at some stations late half the time, but that there has been a steady decline from an already-unacceptable level of lateness last year. Particularly concerning are the figures at Tooting station, where over half of services were late despite there being only two services per hour on that line.\nSome of the worst performing services include: 8:05 from Balham (8:07 from Wandsworth Common) to Victoria - 88% late (Southern) 18:12 from Waterloo to Earlsfield - 81% late (South Western) 8:21 from Balham to Victoria - 79% late (Southern) 8:40 from Balham (8:42 from Wandsworth Common) to Victoria - 76% late (Southern) 8:13 from Tooting to London Blackfriars - 70% late (Thameslink) Local commuters deserve better than the shoddy service they are currently receiving from Southern, South Western and Thameslink. I look forward to the Government's plans to bring our local rail services back into public control, so that our trains are always run with the interests of the people who use them at heart. Following my letter to Network Rail regarding step-free access at Wandsworth Common Station, I was very pleased to receive confirmation that the station will be nominated for funding in the next round of the \"Access for All\" programme.\nThis programme has funded step-free access and other accessibility measures in stations across the country, including just down the line at Balham. This is a very encouraging first step in ensuring that public transport is available and convenient for everyone in the local community. Today, I have written to the Managing Director of the Southern Region of Network Rail calling for an investigation looking into improving accessibility and step-free access at Wandsworth Common Station.\nCurrently, there is step free access on Platform 1, but those wishing to travel on Platform 2 must cross an elevated footbridge, which is not accessible for wheelchair users, parents with young children, and the elderly. I have called for a feasibility study to be conducted, given the signifcant proportion of the local community that falls around the station. Read my full letter here: I am concerned about South Western Railway’s planned cuts to local services. Earlsfield Station could lose two trains per hour off-peak, and direct services to Shepperton could be cut. With residents gradually returning to offices, I believe that these cuts to rail services are ill-considered. In addition, if we are to tackle air pollution and reduce carbon emissions, we need to be encouraging public transport use - not making it more difficult to use. The South Western Railway’s Consultation on this matter closes on Sunday 19th September. If you are affected by these planned changes, I would encourage you to submit your view to the consultation here. There was significant concern locally about Wandsworth Council’s decision to extend Controlled Parking Zone restrictions in areas of Earlsfield and Tooting from 9:30am to 9:30pm each day. Over 1400 local residents completed my consultation on the change. I am pleased that, following our pressure, Wandsworth Council have U-turned on their plans to extend CPZ restrictions. Instead, Event Day only restrictions are planned from 1 October - a far more sensible solution, and something which other councils with stadiums do. I received more than double the number of responses to Wandsworth Council’s rushed, ill-thought out consultation. In fact, over 93% of respondents were not happy with the council’s plans. This should never have happened. But I am pleased the Council finally listened and have U-turned on their attempt to rush through restrictions that would simply act as another cash-grab on hardworking local residents. It is so important that those living with sight loss in our community are supported when using public transport. That is why I recently wrote to South Western Rail and Southern Rail to enquire as to when warning tactile - a vital safety and accessibility tool for those travelling by train - will be installed at Earlsfield and Wandsworth Stations. I am happy to say that Southern Rail have now confirmed that warning tactile has been installed on surface platforms at Wandsworth Common Station. And, although tactile is yet to be installed at Earlsfield Station, South West Railway have stated that Network Rail is working hard to deliver these accessibility improvements. Rest assured I will continue to press for accessibility for local residents living with sight loss. I was deeply concerned - as I know many local residents were - to hear of plans to close Balham station to outward passengers from next Monday until December 2021. While I recognise the scheduled repairs to the escalator are essential works, it is important to me that residents are not inconvenienced by the planned updates. Indeed, I also appreciate that it was alarming for many to learn that the closure was to begin in less than a week, lasting for such an extended period of time. It is my understanding that the decision to close Balham station to outward travelling passengers was taken after a trial closure of the downward escalator indicated that use of the staircase at peak travel times was resulting in over-crowding and therefore social distancing was difficult. I called a meeting with Transport for London to outline my concerns and discuss alternatives, such as more staff at the station to support social distancing at peak travel times. I am pleased to announce that as a result of this meeting, TfL have agreed to undertake a week-long trial at Balham Station, which will see the staircase open for use throughout the day and outward travel therefore possible from the station. The trial will commence on Monday 28th June and last 3-4 days. Following the trial, TfL will assess whether outward travel from Balham during the planned escalator repairs is viable. During this time - and beyond should the trial prove successful - I would recommend additional time is allowed for travel through Balham Station. By doing so, we increase the likelihood of a successful trial. More importantly, we can all play our part to ensure all residents can travel safely. Please check back for further updates on this situation. Today Wandsworth Council has announced that it is suspending the Low Traffic Neighbourhoods that it implemented across our community. Wandsworth Council failed from the start to communicate the implementation of LTNs to local residents, and instead of listening and reviewing they have now decided to pull them out because do not want the fuss.\nAs I have said before, I was not consulted and nor were local residents on these changes. They were brought in overnight and pitted neighbour against neighbour, causing fierce rows and division. The Council should be ashamed. When the going got tough, they tried to pass the buck, and now Wandsworth Council is wasting tens of thousands of pounds by scrapping the LTNs entirely. The Conservative Cabinet Member for Transport's position is untenable. Attention will now turn to the TfL Streetspace scheme on Upper Tooting Road, Balham High Road and Tooting High Street. I know that this is a scheme that has its issues and needs reviewing. However, I am confident that TfL want to make it work for our local environment. Contrast TfL's response with that of Wandsworth Council. TfL is taking feedback on board, they are hosting a virtual public meeting next week to gather feedback from local people and I am meeting with a TfL representative next week to discuss the scheme. I will be taking him to meet some of the affected businesses and discussing the issues emergency services have had. TfL evidently want the scheme to work and they deserve credit for trying. I have been clear from the start that I am supportive of schemes which encourage cycling and make our streets safer. We do that by engaging in polite and respectful discussion to bring about changes collectively. I have received lots of correspondence from local residents regarding the changes that have been made to our roads as part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood and the Streetspace schemes on the A24 (Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road). As part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood schemes, many streets have had filters put in to close the road to all vehicles except cycles and some now have turning restrictions. As part of the Streetspace scheme, a number of changes have been made to Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road including the installation of wands to segregate cycle lanes, a number of turning restrictions as well as changes to bus stops.\nThese changes have come about as a result of statutory guidance that the Government issued in May, stating that local authorities were expected to make significant changes to their road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians “as swiftly as possible”. (If you would like to read more about this statutory guidance you can read it in full here.) As a result, TfL made £55m of funding available to the 33 councils in London as part of its “Streetspace for London” programme to urgently create new segregated cycle lanes, extend pavements and close roads to traffic. Wandsworth Council was given £1,923,500 by TfL and used this money to implement the LTNs. TfL has, in consultation with Wandsworth Council but acting separately, implemented changes to the A24. I am supportive of initiatives which reduce car usage, make our streets safer, encourage cycling and create a better local environment. But we must make it work for everyone in Tooting and Balham. I know that lots of local residents have concerns and comments about how the changes have affected our community. The only way to have your voice heard is to feed into the consultations that Wandsworth Council is running and to let TfL know what you think by emailing them. To respond to Wandsworth Council's consultation, click here. To provide feedback to TfL please email: [email protected] It is important to note that I was not consulted prior to the implementation of these changes to our roads and I have no control over the decisions that have been made. As the local MP, I can lobby the Government and the relevant Ministers, but I cannot make decisions for the Conservative Council. I am listening and engaging with local residents on this but I cannot make alterations to these changes. If you have already provided your feedback to Wandsworth Council's consultation and/or emailed TfL, and you want to raise your concerns with other officials, you may also wish to contact Wandsworth Council's Transport spokesperson Councillor John Locker via email at [email protected], or the Government's Minister of State with responsibility for cycling and walking Chris Heaton-Harris MP via email at [email protected] |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_media_3/content_620.html": "|\nToday, the BBC revealed that in 2018 4,500 people in mental health crisis were unlawfully held in police custody due to a lack of mental health beds.\nI spoke about this matter on BBC News earlier today. There is no question that the system must change immediately. This is nothing short of a scandal. Rest assured I will be pressing the Government on this issue. Children and young people have suffered immensely during the pandemic. But the mental health crisis facing Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) is nothing new. CAMHS services are at breaking point. They were before the pandemic. Tens of thousands of children are being turned away from mental health services – support they vitally need. Parents have raised this issue. Doctors have raised this issue. The stats provide the evidence. When will the Government admit that CAMHS services need to be better resourced? As the backdrop for the BAFTA winning series 24 Hours in A&E, St Georges is now opening their doors to the Fetal Medicine Unit in Channel 4’s new series ‘Baby Surgeons: Delivering Miracles’. The documentary follows obstetrician Professor Basky Thilaganathan and his team as they work to save the lives of unborn babies with complex medical conditions. In one moving episode, Professor Thilaganathan was seen helping parents Becky and Richard, who were told that their baby had no chance of surviving. At Becky’s nineteen week scan, baby Annie was showing signs of congenital heart failure due to pressures from a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung. In simpler terms, this meant that Annie had a tumour on her lung the size of a malteaser. Owing to developments in medicine, Professor Thilaganathan was able to complete a non-invasive operation immediately on Becky and Annie by placing a tube near the mass, and feeding a laser through it, to zap and kill a rogue blood vessel. Remarkably, despite the parents being told that Annie’s heart could stop at any time, the procedure was successful and Becky gave birth to Annie several months later, with no signs of the surgery she had undergone before she was born. This is, yet again, proof of what amazing talent and humanity we have here in Tooting. Following on from the BBC’s successful documentary in March last year, ‘Stacey Dooley: On The Psych Ward’, Stacey Dooley returned to Springfield in a moving programme aired on Tuesday (13th April 2021). Stacey Dooley: Back On The Psych Ward follows the dedicated mental health professionals working on the frontline at Springfield, as well as a number of brave patients who came forward to share their experiences of life at Springfield during lockdown. I am always exceptionally proud of everyone working in mental health across the country. As both the Shadow Minister for Mental Health and Member of Parliament for Tooting, I remain committed to ensuring that local mental health services receive the funding they deserve. With the Officer for National Statistics estimating that 1 in 30 Londoners now have coronavirus, and the Mayor of London declaring a major incident across all London hospitals, the ongoing situation could not be more serious. NHS services in the capital are at risk of becoming overwhelmed in just a matter of days.\nWorking as a doctor in St George’s A&E department, I understand how emotionally drained healthcare workers are feeling. Indeed, ‘overwhelmed’ was the word used by nurses, consultants and registrars at our local hospital in Tooting when they were interviewed for a special report by the BBC, with one senior staff nurse saying she has “never felt so demoralised in her life.” The report conducted by BBC London's Political Correspondent, Karl Mercer, showed the heartbreaking situation in high dependency units at St George’s. The hospital has now had to increase intensive care capacity from 60 to 120, the vast majority of which are for coronavirus patients. Wandsworth alone recorded a further 2394 cases this week – the 13th highest in London. Whilst better times are on the horizon with the recent announcement of the approved Moderna vaccine, I can only implore residents to continue to follow latest public health advice on the virus to ensure we can protect as many lives as possible. On behalf of all my colleagues working on the frontline, please stay at home. London Covid-19 doctor says soon staff will be forced to choose whose life to saveRosena Allin-Khan, a Labour MP and A&E doctor, reveals ‘heart-wrenching’ decisions facing hospital workers\nRosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting and an A&E doctor, is still working regular shifts. On Sunday she worked at St George’s hospital in her south London constituency. She explains how the coronavirus pandemic has affected staff: I’ve been an A&E doctor for 15 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this before. The departments are quieter because people are staying away from hospital, but the patients are sicker. We’re seeing a distinct rise in the numbers coming in with respiratory symptoms, who are testing Covid-19 positive. On Sunday, very early in the morning, the entire resuscitation department, where the absolute sickest patients go, was full to capacity with patients with breathing difficulties. We had to move other very ill patients to the paediatric resuscitation area to keep them safe. This is only set to get worse. We’re seeing patients now who would have only contracted the virus two weeks ago. In the coming 10 days we expect the entire A&E department will be taken up with suspected Covid-19 patients. Doctors and nurses are brave, and the A&E department is known for being on the frontline and high risk, but there’s a palpable fear among staff for three reasons. Firstly, they’re frightened for their own health and those of the people they love. When I finished my shift yesterday, which was Mother’s Day, I came back to the house and I couldn’t touch or hug my two little girls until I put all my clothes in the wash and had a shower. The second reason is that staff expect, very soon, potentially to have to make heart-wrenching choices about whose life can be saved if we don’t have enough ventilators. That goes counter to everything you’ve ever learned as a doctor or nurse – to make life-and-death decisions, where we could possibly have saved every one of those people, is unimaginable. This is what our colleagues in Italy are living through now. Third, the patterns described thus far for symptoms of coronavirus are not what we’re now seeing in the emergency department. We’re seeing young, previously very healthy people, who are ill in hospital. Some are in their 30s, and they need ventilators to stay alive. Some patients are presenting with abdominal pain, which we hadn’t heard of before. A person can come in and say they have a stomach pain, and they’re put in the “green” area of the department – but then they mention they also have a cough. Everybody should be assumed to be Covid-positive until proven otherwise at this point. There’s also a real concern among staff around the country about personal protective equipment. They either don’t have any, or if they do many feel it’s being rationed. It’s very hard to listen to some colleagues say that as a result of there not being enough equipment to go round, they’re resigned to catching the virus – it’s just a matter of when. On social distancing, the messaging from the government hasn’t been clear enough. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has banned public gatherings of more than two people. It’s clear and easy to understand. There has to be no ambiguity in the language because people’s lives depend on it. Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives. The MP for Tooting has been working in her local hospital where doctors and nurses are already dealing with cases of covid-19. She warns that many of those being treated are in their 30s and 40s.\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan is the MP for Tooting but she is also a practising doctor in A&E. She regularly goes in to do shifts in her local hospital St George's and has been in contact with her colleagues. This Sunday she took a record down for Mirror readers about the situation faced by nurses, doctors and others on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus. She said her latest shift had been a \"deeply, deeply eye-opening\" experience with previously fit and healthy people in their 30s and 40s \"attached to machines, fighting for their lives\". And she has been deeply critical of the approach taken by the government in tackling the spread of the deadly virus. \"The Prime Minister has been blase about this from the start, waiting for others to make decisions so he doesn't have to. It is costing lives,\" she said. Mirror Diary - Sunday 22 March6.30am – Leaving the HouseOn the way to work in A&E, to help out the real heroes of the frontline – the NHS staff who work day-in, day-out to keep us all safe. I am a bit apprehensive after seeing the stories that are being reported about Covid-19 and having spoken to colleagues across the country, but we need to come together at times like these for our communities. 7am – Reporting for DutyJust finished handover, which is when the day shift gets given notes on the patients who have come in overnight. There’s a very real sense that the number of cases are growing extremely quickly, something that will present a real challenge in the coming days and weeks. Some of the sickest patients that have been admitted have been young – they’re in their 30s and 40s, previously fit and well, but now fighting for their lives in Intensive Care (ICU). There was a lot of talk in January that this was a virus just like the flu that only affects older people – that simply isn’t the case. There’s a real sense of apprehension ahead of the shift – we’re all expecting a rocky road ahead in the coming days. 8am- Protective EquipmentThe first part of the shift was spent looking for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – these are masks and aprons that keep those working on the frontlines safe. While we’d all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. Frontline staff across the country are scared. We’re scared that we’re going to lose patients – we have spent years training to save every life that we can. We are scared of passing this deadly virus onto our loved ones because we don’t always have the PPE that we so desperately need. We’re scared that that if we aren’t properly protected, that we run the risk of spreading the virus between patients. It’s vital that people practice social distancing measures properly – crowded areas will only add to the number of cases, and the number of people being admitted into hospitals across the country. In the coming days and weeks, difficult decisions will be made by my colleagues in ICU about who gets a ventilator – it’s that serious. Midday – Resus overwhelmedThe whole of resus is full of patients with respiratory problems – this is the part of A&E where the sickest patients go. Patients are arriving breathless, with crackles so fine in their lungs, you can hardly hear them. Their X-rays show white lungs where normally, they would look clear and black, full of air. Major trauma, such as heart attacks and victims of car crashes, are now being moved into paediatric A&E. The situation around Covid-19 is clearly getting worse by the day. The talk amongst the team is that we feel that we will be overwhelmed in the coming days. I’m going for a refresher course on ventilators for staff – they’re also training new staff on how to use ventilators. The talk is, of course, feeling quite bleak as the day goes on – but this is what we’ve all been trained for. 4pm – Leaving A&EJust leaving A&E now – it’s been a difficult shift and a difficult Mother’s Day. At times like these, we must think about our loved ones - if we want to protect those dearest to us, we must stay indoors. I’ve just called my husband and asked him to let our daughters know that they won’t be able to cuddle me and give me their handmade presents when I get home. Instead, I’ll be getting straight in the shower and throwing my clothes in the washing machine – it is our duty to protect the ones we love. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can, and we will, save lives. Former Labour MEP SEB DANCE explains why he is supporting Rosena Allin-Khan in the Labour deputy leadership race.\nBritain has left the EU. As a former Labour Member of the European Parliament, as a Remainer, and as a proud pro-European, that’s still not an easy thing for me to say – but it’s the reality. There is no longer a campaign to remain. That doesn’t mean that Boris Johnson’s famous lie of “get Brexit done” has suddenly come true. The ongoing negotiations with the EU will continue to define our country’s future for years to come. Perhaps one day the fight to join the EU will come. How soon that time comes depends on what we do next. Pro-Europeans must now fight for a close relationship between the UK and our friends in the EU and ongoing rights for UK citizens. The Labour Party must play a crucial role in that fight. That’s why I’m supporting Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan to become the next deputy leader of Labour. Rosena was elected as the MP for Tooting the week before the EU referendum in 2016. Despite holding a shadow frontbench position, she refused to compromise on her principles or on the promises she’d made to her community, so she broke the whip and voted against triggering Article 50. Considering the shambles that followed Theresa May’s early triggering of Article 50, this has been conclusively demonstrated as the right decision. Rosena was also the first shadow frontbench minister to come out publicly and call for a People’s Vote. This was an incredibly brave thing to do, at a time when Labour MPs and shadow ministers were being pressured not to speak out against the leadership’s position on Brexit. At a time when the leadership of Labour needed a firm push in the right direction, Rosena was the one brave enough to stand up and do it. There are some voices in the Labour Party, who’ll try to convince you that Brexit was the only reason for Labour’s failure at the last general election – that backing a public vote cost us seats in the so-called ‘Red Wall’. But this analysis is deeply misleading, and is simply not supported by the facts. Yes, of course Brexit was a divisive issue, for Labour as much as for anyone else. The reality however, is that the overwhelming majority of Labour voters, members and supporters voted Remain, wanted us to stay in the EU and wanted a public vote on Brexit. That fact is as true of Labour voters in Redcar, Grimsby or Wakefield as it is of Labour voters in Oxford, Islington or Bristol – Labour’s share of the vote went down in 98% of all seats. Labour’s position on Brexit was fatally undermined not because supporting a public vote was the wrong position for our voters, but because the leadership of the party took so long to get to that position. We sat in the middle of the road on the biggest issue of our time and neither side trusted us. We lost trust among all our communities. Rosena knows this – she won’t stop standing up for our internationalist values. I joined the Labour Party because I believe in internationalism and solidarity across borders. So does Rosena. That’s why she’s worked across the world in conflict and disaster zones as a humanitarian doctor, and why she still does shifts in her local hospital as an A&E doctor alongside her work as an MP. So if you are like me – a proud pro-European, an internationalist and a Labour supporter – and if you want someone as deputy leader who’ll stand up for those values, and who’ll fight for our country to maintain the closest possible relationship with the EU, protecting our workers’ rights, our environmental protections, our food standards, our NHS, and most importantly the rights of EU citizens living in the UK – then vote for Doctor Rosena. Together, let’s take Labour forward. Rosena Allin-Khan MP: \"I want to inspire Asians to own their identity”A CANDIDATE in the race for Labour’s deputy leadership has admitted the party “lost trust with voters” following its crushing defeat in the December general election.\nTooting MP Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is up against fellow MPs Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler, Ian Murray and Angela Rayner in the race, triggered by Labour’s huge loss last year. Suffering one of its worst results since 1935, Labour lost dozens of seats which they had held for decades, including a number of constituencies in the Midlands and northern England, which historically tended to support the party. The loss was down to a lack of trust, Allin- Khan believes. “People, quite frankly, didn’t trust us to govern,” the MP told Eastern Eye. “We had a manifesto which I believe was full of good things, but voters didn’t trust us to deliver it.” The party’s stance on Brexit was an additional factor – “we didn’t seem decisive enough” – and the level of anti-Semitism in the party and the way it was subsequently handled “closed a lot of doors”. “I’ve been up and down the country talking to individuals, wondering why Labour lost, and I’ve been told by activists that people didn’t think we had our own house in order,” she said. Today, she said, the most common concern of voters is the NHS, the level of safety on the streets and housing. “We need to show that the hopes and dreams that people have for themselves are the ones that we (Labour) have for them,” the mother-of-two said. Next month’s contest will also see the unveiling of a new Labour leader, after Jeremy Corbyn announced he would be stepping down following the general election last year. Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey are in the running to lead the opposition party. Allin-Khan, however, will not be voicing her support for any of the candidates as she believes the party needs to “heal all divisions (and) unite” after it fared so badly in the election. “When I’m working in A&E and I see kids coming in with lung infections because of mouldy housing or I see kids who have to go to food banks (…) they don’t care if Labour is left, right or centre,” she explained. “So, the most important thing to move forward is to unite and I can show that by not nominating someone for leader.” On her role in the deputy leadership race, Allin-Khan said she was determined to use it as an opportunity to help “ethnic minorities own their identity and be proud of it”. “That is what I want people to feel I embody when they look at me,” she explained. “For me, being in this race, if that is the one thing I get out of this…that other young British Asians can look at me and say, ‘if she can do it, I can do it too’, then that is my job done.” Allin-Khan admitted she had faced prejudice due to her mixed Pakistani-Polish heritage and has received criticism that she “isn’t fully Asian”. In response to the comments, the MP is keen to highlight her mixed heritage does not make her Asian background any less “important, valuable or special.” “I identify with being an Asian woman, in the same way that I am proud to be Polish,” she said. “Some people in the Asian community wonder how Asian I feel because I’m mixed race, but I’m proud to wear my sari and embrace my heritage.” Some have even suggested that she change her forename to Rosie and take her husband’s surname to downplay her ethnicity. However, Allin-Khan is proud of her roots and is keen to emphasise it. “I went double barrelled because I didn’t want to lose the Asian part of my surname and that for me, is very important,” she said. “I am proud to say that this is who I am – a Polish and Pakistani, proudly British Muslim woman who loves the Labour party.” Born and brought up in Tooting in a working-class household, Allin-Khan described her young life as “tough”. Her mother worked three jobs to keep the family financially afloat, and Allin-Khan recalled there only being one heater in the house that they had to move from room to room to keep themselves warm. Allin-Khan failed her A-Levels, citing the difficulties at home as a factor. Despite the setbacks, she still had a desire to study medicine. However, she was told “it wasn’t for girls like (her)”, as it was financially prohibitive, and she didn’t come from the “right background”. Allin-Khan, who still works part-time as a doctor, knew she had to keep fighting if she wanted to pursue her dream career. “I think my upbringing led me to believe I had no choice but to sink or swim,” she said. After resitting her A-Levels, the then-24-year-old accepted a place to study medicine at Lucy Cavendish College, University of Cambridge, which was funded by scholarships. “I really believe that where you start off in life doesn’t need to dictate where you end up,” the A&E doctor said. Although she credited her own resilience for her success, Allin-Khan believes the Labour government gave her an opportunity to fulfil her potential when things looked bleak. “The Labour government turned my life around,” the 43-year-old claimed. “I redid my A-Levels, did a degree and went to Cambridge to study medicine and I’m afraid those possibilities aren’t going to be there for a new generation of kids under this Tory government.” Allin-Khan, the MP for Tooting since 2016, admitted the biggest challenge of her involvement in politics is racism. She often faces abuse on social media and is mostly targeted for her Muslim beliefs. “When I look at the order in which my abuse comes, it is Muslim first, then my Asian heritage comes second,” she admitted. “My gender is third. Without a doubt, the amount of abuse is a huge challenge.” It is a concern that young BAME women may be deterred from entering politics due to the abuse other politicians have faced, she said. In response, Allin-Khan regularly engages with schools and community groups to encourage young people to “keep going and not to lose faith”. There is also a level of racism in the House of Commons, she said, highlighting that she is the first Muslim person ever to make it on to the deputy leadership ballot. Although it is encouraging to see more women and ethnic minority politicians in parliament, Allin-Khan believes there is “still a ceiling on what we can achieve”. Recently, Allin-Khan approached a “prominent BAME politician” to ask them to consider nominating her in the deputy leadership contest. However, the politician responded: “I’m only in the game of backing winners and you don’t look like you’ve got any chance of winning.” “We can’t have that attitude towards people, and I’ve said in my grassroots revival plan that our BAME communities can’t be an afterthought when it comes to supporting people to hold public office,” she said. “We need to be seeing ethnic minorities at the top of our party, on the front benches. “I’ve smashed that ceiling, but I plan to throw the ladder down and say people ‘come up behind, you can do this.’ But I know it isn’t easy.” NHS workers battling coronavirus are facing a “national shortage” of protective clothing, HuffPost UK has been told.Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan, a working doctor who still works shifts in A&E, said scientists had told her that there were not enough body suits in the right sizes, while some doctors were only now starting to receive protective clothing.\nIt came amid new official estimates suggesting 5,000 to 10,000 people in the UK have coronavirus, leaving many doctors, nurses and other health workers at risk of infection. Last month, the World Health Organisation also warned that there was a global shortage of protective masks and body suits. One NHS source who worked at a hospital where coronavirus patients were being treated told HuffPost UK: “There were staff forced to wear oversized suits because that’s all they had. “All we have left is XL. “There is a national shortage of suits but this was raised with the government at least three weeks ago so something should have been done.” Appearing on HuffPost UK’s Commons People podcast, Allin-Khan repeated the concerns. “I held a meeting today with some people from the scientific community and they said their concern was though they had been testing out various modes of protective clothing, it turns out that there is a lack of the clothing they need available, the sizes aren’t available,” she said. “Just yesterday - because people still contact me because I’m a doctor still, to let me know what’s going on - someone said they were a GP and had only started receiving the necessary protective clothing yesterday and this has been going on for a month now. The Labour deputy leadership candidate criticised the government for moving too slowly to tackle from coronavirus. In a departure from Labour’s broad support for the government, Allin-Khan called for tougher measures to tackle the outbreak, including testing those with symptoms for the virus as a matter of course. Allin-Khan said the government’s testing programme could be “more robust”, reporting that “friends in the NHS” said people were being given “really unclear messaging”. She gave an example of two people who returned from northern Italy who phoned NHS 111 and were told to wait for a call back which did not come for five days, during which time they self isolated. When they eventually spoke again to NHS staff, they had to give their details again and had to self-isolate for eight days before finally being tested for coronavirus. Test results are also taking three to five days to materialise. Allin-Khan said: “We need to be moving quicker, people need to have a better idea of how to access testing, what it means for their daily lives. “The messaging needs to be clearer and the testing needs to be more robust.” She added: “We should have moved into the delay phase sooner than now and I don’t think we should measure our performance compared to what other countries are doing. “I think we should be looking at what’s best for us and when you look at the fact that China had the same number of cases that we already have surpassed before implementing measures we do need to be listening to what the other scientific community, for example some eminent epidemiologists, listen to what they’re saying. “Because ultimately we can’t leave the scientific community to be scapegoated for the government making bad decisions if they are proven to be wrong.” Allin-Khan meanwhile sidestepped questions on whether she wants to be shadow health secretary under the next Labour leader. “I like to focus on one thing at a time, genuinely, and I don’t think you should ever have a plan B because that’s implying you’ve accepted that your plan A won’t work out,” she said. “So I am genuinely, steely focused on winning this deputy leadership bid.” Put to her that she would be a good fit for the job, she replied: “Well I am a practising NHS doctor and I have got a master’s degree in public health and I care about our party so that’s honestly for whoever is the leader to decide.” |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Today I challenged him at Prime Minister's Questions on why he continues to stand idly by while innocent civilians suffer in their hundreds of thousands.\nFollowing the decision to relocate children's cancer services in South East England away from St George's Hospital, I met with the Health Secretary with a cross-party group of MPs to raise our concerns.\nWhen I visited the Pinckney Ward where this care is conducted, I met with Jackson, a former patient there, and his parents, who told me that such a move would be detrimental for parents, children and the hospital alike. I have urged the Secretary to review and reconsider NHS England's decision as soon as possible. Eight years ago today, I was selected as the Tooting Labour candidate for the by-election caused by Sadiq becoming a candidate for Mayor of London.\nIt has been a huge honour and privilege to serve as the representative for the community in which I was born and raised. My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has supported me on this incredible journey. The beginning of Mental Health Awareness week was marked by grim tidings that, for the first time in recorded history, the number of people on an waiting list for mental health treatment has hit 2 million.\nThis is more than the combined population of four major British cities and is a shocking indictment of the Tories' failed record on mental health.\nFollowing a recent spot inspection of HMP Wandsworth by the Chief Inspector of Prisons. an Urgent Notification was issued to the Secretary of State for Justice, meaning that the Chief Inspector has serious and immediate concerns about the day-to-day operation of the prison.\nThe report was damning and laid the blame for the deficiencies squarely at the Government's door, citing a lack of leadership at the very highest levels. I have been raising these issues for years now and my concerns have gone unheeded by this Tory Government, even after a high-profile alleged escape last autumn. Read my Twitter thread on the subject below:\nNew data published by the Environment Agency recently revealed that sewage was pumped in our local rivers, the Graveney and Wandle, for over 700 hours last year. This is equivalent to the entire month of February and demonstrates this Tory Government's complete disregard for our natural environment.\nOnly Labour has a plan to clean up our waterways and hold water companies to account by fines for illegal discharges, blocking bonuses for bosses of companies that violate the rules and holding these bosses personally criminally liable for any violations. History was made last Thursday as my friend and predecessor as MP for Tooting, Sadiq Khan, was re-elected for an unprecedented third term as Mayor of London.\nAfter weeks of hard graft, the result was a decisive victory for Sadiq and Labour with our wonderful capital rejecting the divisive, toxic politics of the Tory candidate. I look forward to continuing to work with Sadiq to make Tooting and our wider city a greener, cleaner, safer and more prosperous place to live.\nAs someone who grew up with and later overcame a stammer, I know all too well the difficulties and challenges that having one can bring. I was very glad and honoured to join Dermot and Alison on This Morning once again to talk about stammers and the wonderful work that Stamma charity do.\nAs someone who has had close friends and family members with eating disorders, I know just how damaging and dangerous they can be. I was proud to join my friend Hope Virgo at the Dump The Scales march to Parliament Square on Saturday with hundreds of campaigners and activists.\nThe Government’s attitude towards eating disorders must fundamentally change. They must listen to campaigners and experts, like Hope, to ensure everyone with an eating disorder gets the care they need. It was brilliant to speak at the Watercooler event in the ExCeL London today, for a discussion on mental health in Government and the NHS.\nRather than railing against a \"sick note\" culture as Rishi Sunak has done recently, we must be encouraging more openness and understanding around mental health. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

It is short and easy. Remember don't delay and send it back and it would be an honour if you would re-elect me as your Member of Parliament.\nProtecting our natural world is hugely important. I was proud to have worked with the Mayor of London on his pledge to plant more trees across our city. This culminated in the Mayor and I planting his 500,000th tree right here at a local Tooting school.\nMore broadly, Labour is vowing to establish three new National Forests in England, whilst planting millions of trees and creating new woodlands. These trees will provide vital habitats for our fantastic wildlife and help fight the climate emergency. In my work as a humanitarian doctor, I have worked across the globe with the victims of war and human suffering. Ensuring that every person, wherever they are, has the safety and security of a roof over their heads and food in their stomach is of paramount importance to me.\nBefore the dissolution of Parliament, I sat on the International Development Committee, where we led an inquiry into the progress on the UN's second Sustainable Development Goal, namely to end world hunger. More broadly, I am pleased to see the Labour manifesto committing to restoring international aid to 0.7% of GNI as soon as the fiscal situation allows. As an NHS doctor myself, I understand how important speedy access to care is. With NHS waiting lists longer than ever, it comes as no surprise that many people are finding it difficult to reach the services they depend on.\nWith as many as 10 million people in the UK having been diagnosed with arthritis, it is of paramount importance that those with the condition can reach the support they need. Especially considering that arthritis and other MSK conditions can have a significant effect on a person’s quality of life. That is why I am pleased to see Labour pledging to cut NHS waiting times with 40,000 more appointments every week. As an animal lover and pet owner myself - I want the very best for all living creatures. I have long believed the UK should lead the world with high animal welfare standards. I was pleased to see the Labour Party pledge to ban exports of foie gras early on in the election campaign.\nI know that many people are concerned specifically about cruelty to our greatest companions; cats, dogs and other pets. Rest assured, I will always stand against cruelty. At this election, I am standing on a manifesto to improve animal welfare. Labour has pledged to ban trail hunting and the import of hunting trophies. We will end the scourge of puppy smuggling and farming, along with the use of snare traps. Most of all, we will partner with scientists, industry, and civil society as we work towards the phasing out of animal testing. I am wishing a happy Eid to those who are celebrating today. Hoping those celebrating enjoy a peaceful and blessed holiday.\nThe dedication and togetherness shown is so uplifting and makes our community the special place that it is. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_national_10/content_665.html": "|\nToday, I voted against the Nationality and Borders Bill, a piece of legislation that risks breaking international law and turns our backs on unaccompanied children fleeing war and persecution. The Conservatives just voted to make it harder to give a safe haven to children fleeing violence and war. They should be ashamed. The cruel irony of this Government’s approach is that it’s weak on taking action against criminal gangs and brutal when it comes to orphaned children from war zones. As someone who has held the hands of frightened children and terrified parents working as a doctor in war torn areas such as the Rohingya and Palestine, I am appalled at the Government’s approach to protecting those in need of safety. “Prior to 2017, no Government invested in or prioritised mental health services.”\nI couldn’t have put it better myself - and I didn’t need to, for these are not my words. They are the words of Nadine Dorries, the Mental Health Minister. The devastation left behind by the cuts to mental health services is staggering. And who was the architect of these cuts? No one other than the new Health Secretary during his time as a Treasury Minister. This matter cannot go unaddressed. That is why in Parliament today I asked the new Health Secretary to explain why a quarter of mental health beds have been cut since 2010, why 140,000 children were turned away from mental health services last year, and, finally, if he is ashamed of his track record. See here to view the video. This May marks Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) Month. BPD, also known as Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD), is a serious and complicated mental illness that around 1 in 100 people live with. A type of ‘personality disorder’, BPD affects how individuals cope with life, manage relationships, and feel emotions. Those with BPD can experience deep distress, which is often caused by previous trauma. If you would like to find out more information on BPD, Mind and Rethink - two leading mental health charities - have dedicated pages on their websites. Mind’s can be viewed here and Rethink’s here. If you are experiencing BPD, BPD World also provides information and support to those affected by personality disorders. To find out more about the support they offer, see here. It is vital that we raise awareness of BPD to ensure that people receive the support they need and deserve without feeling stigmatised. As a new mum, it can be vital to talk and share your experiences with those in the same situation as you. No new mother should have to suffer in silence if they are struggling with their mental health. To mark Maternal Mental Health Week, I would like to share some brilliant charities and support services available for women and birthing people: Family Action offers specialist support services for parents with mental health difficulties. This includes services during pregnancy and after birth. Further information on Perinatal Support Services Family Lives can be found here. The Association for Postnatal Illness offers information and support for those experiencing postnatal depression. The APNI are available between 10am and 2pm, Monday to Friday on 0207 386 0868. Alternatively, an online chat box on the bottom left of their website can be found here. Family Lives offers confidential support, information and advice for parents. Support is available via email [email protected] or via there helpline on 0808 800 2222. PaNDAS - Postnatal Awareness and Support is a community organisation offering peer-to-peer support. PaNDAS has a free helpline, open 7 days a week, 11am to 10pm on 0808 1961 776. Alternatively, they can be contacted via email on [email protected] and a trained volunteer will aim to get back to you within 72 hours. If you are at crisis point, the Samaritans can be contacted 24/7 on 116 123. Today, Trans Visibility Day, is a day that we celebrate each trans and nonbinary person, whether you choose to be visible or not, and reaffirm our commitment to stand against discrimination, bigotry and all forms of trans exclusionary behaviour.\nWhen wider society discusses trans issues, too often trans people have to deal with vitriolic and discriminatory language which has a profound impact on wellbeing. In October 2020, I organised and chaired a roundtable with leading trans charities to discuss mental health, discrimination, and how we can work together to tackle it. I will always be an ally of the trans community. As MP for Tooting and Shadow Minister for Mental Health, I want to be a voice for everyone - including the LGBTQ+ community - and I will continue to uphold LGBT+ Labour’s 10 pledges, which I signed up to during the 2020 Labour leadership race, outlined below. It was a pleasure to join Basildon Councillor Gavin Callaghan as well as local Basildon organisations to talk about mental health this week. Coronavirus has had a profound impact on our mental health support services and it is always great to see a local authority listen to and work with local organisations on the front line providing help where it is most needed. We need to take inspiration from Basildon Council and create an environment at a national level where community organisations and peer support groups work in tandem with local authorities and local health services. A huge thank you to Kim Bailey of Purple Genie Life Coaching, Karen Pullen of Craig Tyler Trust, Jonathan Barrow of Sociability, and Alison Cunningham of The Listening Post, for taking part. The recent vigil on Clapham Common was our chance to come together and grieve the loss of Sarah Everard's life. Our chance to mourn the lives of the women lost to violence. And it was a chance to mourn our own lived experiences. I share the frustrations and disappointment felt over police action taken that day. In light of events at Clapham Common, I know many are concerned about the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, and what this divisive law would mean for the right to protest. I want to be clear: Tonight, I will be voting against this Bill. I believe that the Government has undermined this Bill through draconian measures that impose disproportionate controls on free expression and the right to protest. I believe these measures will have an unfair impact on Black, Asian, and ethnic minority people. I also believe 10 year sentences for crimes against statues – significantly longer than the sentences for crimes which disproportionately impact women – is a worrying priority. Under this Government, rape convictions have fallen to an all-time low, delays in the Crown Courts are at an all-time high, and justice is not being served for thousands of women and girls. This is now the time for the Government to correct their woeful record and commit to putting in place long overdue protections for women. The ongoing pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we live our lives, and it is understandable that this will have an impact on our mental health.\nAs we enter a national lockdown, it is vital that we all take care of our mental health. There are many brilliant services available to offer advice and support, and there is never any shame in asking for help. If you are facing a mental health crisis, you can call the Samaritans on 116 123, any time, day or night. If you are not comfortable speaking over the phone, you can also text SHOUT to 85258. They also have an advice page offering tips on how to take care of your mental health during the pandemic. If you are aged between 13-25, you can call The Mix on 0808 808 4994, with any question. They will connect you with experts and peers who will give you the support and advice you need. You can also phone Childline on 0800 1111, or speak directly to a counsellor here. For the LGBT+ community, you can call Switchboard on 0300 330 0630 or email [email protected]. All phone operators identify as LGBT+. Stonewall are also available on 08000 50 2020 for advice on a range of issues. If you are facing domestic abuse, you can call Refuge on 0808 2000 247, or access their online chat feature here. Women’s Aid live chat feature is also open here. Both of these websites have an option to quickly exit their sites and wipe them from your browser history. The latest NHS data shows that from July to September this year the number of urgent referrals for children and young people suffering with eating disorders has almost doubled from the same period in 2019.\nOn 9 December, Alex Norris MP and I spoke with Dr Agnes Ayton, Chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists Eating Disorder Faculty, mental health campaigner Hope Virgo, the Centre for Mental Health, Beat and Young Minds UK to discuss eating disorders and explore ways to alleviate them. We urgently need a public mental health strategy which supports people with eating disorders. Christmas can be an especially difficult period, and it is vital that we remain sensitive to the fact that the focus on food and indulgence can cause individuals suffering with eating disorders real distress. Young people struggling with their mental health need urgent support. Please rest assured that I will continue to press the Government for it. I look forward to the New Year, where I will be looking to engage further with the sector as well as individuals with lived experience of eating disorders.\nA number of local residents have reached out to ask me why my name was not included in a letter signed by 61 out of 650 MPs about the very concerning deportation flight to Jamaica. I wanted to explain how the process works.\nFirstly, let me say that this was an incredibly serious matter, which is why I was pleased to see my colleague, Holly Lynch MP, the Shadow Immigration Minister, send an urgent letter to the Government raising concerns. I added my voice to her letter by writing to Priti Patel myself - requesting that the points Holly Lynch raised were answered urgently. A copy of that letter is below:\nAs a member of the Labour Shadow Cabinet, my role is to intervene in matters related to mental health (because I am the Shadow Minister for Mental Health). Members of the Shadow Cabinet do not speak in debates, sign letters, sign EDMs or intervene in matters which are not related to their role. This rule has been in place for as long as I know, it was the same when Jeremy Corbyn was leader.\nI have noticed that my name was put on a list along with 12 colleagues, suggesting we were the only people not to sign this letter. No member of the Labour Shadow Cabinet signed the letter, indeed, almost three quarters of Labour MPs didn't sign the letter. Does that mean that they don't care? No, of course not. Sometimes they miss the deadline to sign, sometimes they can't sign, sometimes they make representations in different ways. It's very disappointing that some would single out me and 12 other colleagues, suggesting we were the only ones not to sign - simply to fit their political agenda. My background has seen me work in war torn countries, disaster zones and refugee camps helping the world's most marginalised and vulnerable people. I always care deeply about these issues and to suggest otherwise is incorrect. I'll continue to liaise with my colleagues in the Home Affairs team with regards to this, and other important issues. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

My thoughts and prayers are especially with all those facing hardship and suffering at this time.\nSending my best wishes to everyone in Tooting and around the world. I hope you have a blessed Ramadan.\nSpecial thoughts and prayers going to Palestinians and all Muslims around the world enduring hardship and suffering at this time. Tonight, I joined with representatives of all faiths and none at the BATCA annual peace ceremony in Tooting.\nThank you to everyone for their prayers of peace. They are needed now more than ever and I am so proud to represent such a wonderful, caring community.\nSince the horrific terrorist attacks on Israel in October, more than 1,000 incidents of antisemitic hate crimes have been reported to Community Secure Trust.\nToday, I visited their headquarters in London to see the work they are doing to tackle antisemitism. It is a stain on our society. It must be combatted and those who perpetrate it must face the full force of the law.\nIt was wonderful to host a coffee morning for local residents today at Tooting United Reform Church. It was brilliant to welcome residents from Tooting and Furzedown. I am really grateful to everyone who attended, including some local organisations and charities who do invaluable work in the community. Tonight, I held a peace vigil at Tooting Broadway station to bring our community together to remember all those who have died in Israel and Gaza recently. I want to pay a huge thanks to the representatives from our local religious groups who said a prayer for peace.\nDuring some of our darkest hours, Tooting reminds us that there is always hope. It was great to attend and speak at the annual Balham and Tooting Community Association’s multi-faith peace ceremony in Tooting Broadway.\nLocal people of all faiths and none gathered to celebrate all that unites us. We heard prayers and moving speeches from leaders of six different faiths and school students. I love representing a community where so many faiths are represented. People of all faiths and none live and work alongside each other in our community and I was honoured to be part of such a joyous occasion that celebrates our diversity and our commitment to common values of tolerance and understanding. Leaders from Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh communities spoke and prayed in their own traditions. Senior school pupils from Al Risalah Girls Secondary School spoke of what their faith means to them and their hopes for peace. This event has taken place in Tooting for many years now and it’s always an inspiring and uplifting event that I look forward to attending. It’s always fantastic to see our community come together. Thank you to all who attending and to those who worked so hard to make this event a success. I was honoured to give a sermon at St. John the Divine Church today on racial justice - talking about me work in Calais and how we can all work against racism in our community. We all must stand together for racial justice! Thank you to the whole church community for the warm welcome. It was an absolute pleasure to spend time at the Khalsa Centre Gurdwara here in Tooting, sharing prayers and food. It was nice to meet the Sikh community at the Gurdwara. Our community is a vibrant and multicultural place, and the diversity of our community is such a strength. Thank you so much for the warm welcome. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_tooting_6/content_652.html": "|\nIt was so nice to be at Smallwood Primary School to learn about the fantastic work of the Chefs In Schools. It's amazing that all catering is now in-house, with chefs cooking food that has been grown by the students themselves. The children were so enthusiastic about their freshly cooked and nutritious lunches. I believe that the work we’re doing with Chefs in Schools will go a long way to promote positive attitudes and relationships with food and mealtimes for our young people. It was great to be able to support! This week, we celebrated our fantastic women business owners in Tooting. Over the last two years, many women have felt a disproportionate economic hit. Women hold the key to supercharging our economy as we recover from the pandemic. Today I was delighted to welcome Anneliese Dodds MP to Tooting and meet with women business owners. I believe it is essential that we recognise the significant contribution women make and commit to tackling the challenges that they still face today. Also, we welcomed some of our community's many impressive business women and community leaders to Parliament. Tooting is home to so many - it's only right we back women in business. Lastly, a big thank you to Sir Keir Starmer MP for hosting. It was great to be joined by Lord Wajid Khan at Rutherford House School. We met with the school's Pupil Leaders who had some insightful questions about our work in Parliament, and also taught us about their values of resilience and respect. What a credit to the next generation! So glad that I was able to attend this event with Lord Khan. I was honoured to give a sermon at St. John the Divine Church today on racial justice - talking about me work in Calais and how we can all work against racism in our community. We all must stand together for racial justice! Thank you to the whole church community for the warm welcome. I’m officially in the Christmas spirit! It was such a pleasure to open the Christmas fair at Penwortham, and hear the school choir perform together after two years! Lots of Christmas cheer and great stalls. I wanted to congratulate the Penwortham choir on their legendary performance. Thank you for the opportunity to attend! Today is Small Business Saturday and it is important to me to understand what it's like to run a local business, and the challenges and successes that people in our local community experience. So I rolled up my sleeves and got stuck into a shift at Tooting's famous flower stall with local legend Chris. Chris was absolutely wonderful! Thank you for teaching me a few things about the flower industry! I’m looking forward to learning more. Tom's Farm at Nightingale Academy is truly special. From taking care of the animals to competing in national young farmer competitions, students here are provided with the very best learning opportunities. These kids have an outlet to learn about agriculture and animals in a supportive environment. I’m so proud of the work the farm is doing, and I’m looking forward to returning to see everyone soon - especially the adorable animals. This week the Council finally listened to us! Our beloved Tooting Bec Athletics Track will be saved and get the investment it so desperately needs and deserves. To lose such a valuable asset in our community would be a devastating blow to so many of our young people. Having this track will be useful for encouraging young people to be physically active and lead a healthy lifestyle. Thank you to everyone who joined the efforts to save our track! It was an absolute pleasure to spend time at Beatrix Potter school today. The students were engaged, Year 3's cursive handwriting was impressive, and Year 6 had insightful suggestions on tackling the climate emergency. It's safe to say there were some future leaders in the room! It’s incredibly insightful to see young leaders develop and put their ideas into practice to shape the world in the future. I was truly inspired. Thank you for having me! It was an absolute pleasure to spend time at the Khalsa Centre Gurdwara here in Tooting, sharing prayers and food. It was nice to meet the Sikh community at the Gurdwara. Our community is a vibrant and multicultural place, and the diversity of our community is such a strength.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_national_5/content_605.html": "|\nToday, I was on BBC Politics Live ahead of Prime Minister Questions, to discuss the conflict in Israel and Gaza, free speech and the drinking culture in Westminster.\nThe Government is dragging its feet on reforming mental health services – it's costing people their lives.\nI asked the Minister if she will keep her promise to reform the Mental Health Act - there was no answer. This is a Government out of ideas. We need a General Election now.\nPalestinians must not pay the collective price for the acts of terror carried out by Hamas. World leaders have a duty to ensure Israel doesn’t deliberately indiscriminately target civilians.\nIn Parliament today, I sought assurances from the Prime Minister regarding Gaza: - Incendiary weapons won't be used in civilian areas. - Hospitals/medics won't be targeted. - Food, water and electricity immediately restored. - No occupation of Gaza.\nThe Hamas attacks on Israel in recent days were horrific. The brutal murder of innocent civilians in their own homes, killing innocent festivalgoers, raping women and taking children hostage must be condemned in the strongest possible terms - nothing can justify it. Those who planned and carried out the attacks must face justice.\nWe have not been close to peace in the region, but there is no doubt that these attacks, and the response from Israel, will set us back many years. This will be devastating for the many innocent people in Israel and Palestine who just want peace. I fear it will be innocent men, women and children from Gaza who are going to pay the price for Hamas' attacks. I have been very critical of Netanyahu throughout the years, and I really do worry about what the next few days and weeks will bring. The cutting off of water, gas and electricity supplies breaches a whole host of internationally recognised laws. Refusing to allow aid in and stopping food supplies will hit the most vulnerable the hardest. Countless innocent lives will be lost and the international community must work on a resolution that de-escalates the conflict as soon as possible. The discourse I've seen on Twitter has appalled me in recent days, which is why I have decided to post this on my website, instead of there. I have worked as a humanitarian doctor in the region, spanning a period of over a decade. I've always sought the recognition of a sovereign Palestinian state, and my views have not changed, I believe it is the only way to achieve peace in the region. But I will also call out barbaric attacks when they occur. The rape and murder of innocent civilians should be called out and I'm sure the vast majority of people will share my disgust.\nNot many people know this about me: when I was young, due to significant childhood trauma, I had a stammer. All too often it made me too afraid to speak, for fear of being ridiculed.\nPeople that have stammers aren't victims. Stammers are a normal part of life. Today I had such an amazing time with the ladies on Loose Women, opening up publicly about it for the first time. With greater awareness and better representation of people with stammers, we can become a society where people who are disfluent are not stigmatised. Great as always to catch up with my friend Denise Welch. And shout out to Adam Alexander in Tooting for my new, fresh hair colour.\nPolice forces across England are set to stop attending many incidents concerning mental health under a new National Partnership Agreement: Right Care, Right Person.\nThe Government's announcement leaves far too many questions unanswered and fails to tackle the root problem of lengthy NHS waiting lists in mental health services. I have written to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, asking him to come clean on what action he is taking to tackle mental health waiting lists. Read my full letter here:\nOver recent weeks, I have been appalled at the Tory's unworkable, unethical plans to house asylum seekers on a barge in Dorset.\nThe Government failed to listen to well-founded concerns or even carry out basic checks of the water supply, which was contaminated with Legionella bacteria, putting both asylum-seekers and staff at-risk. The Tories have serious questions to answer about the safety of this project and should stop wasting taxpayer's money pursuing headlines and instead fix this broken asylum system.\nRecently, I have received many emails about the climate emergency and how a potential Labour government would respond to it. We are facing a climate crisis and urgent action needs to be taken to avoid it. UN reports have shown that existing policies are not doing enough to avert cataclysmic climate related events, and we are already seeing historic weather activities causing floods, wildfires and droughts around the world.\nA Labour government would put climate change at the heart of our agenda to help build a better Britain. Labour would deliver zero-carbon power by 2030, insulate 19 million homes and establish a National Wealth Fund to help create over a million jobs in green industry. Labour will make the UK a clean energy superpower to cut energy bills and improve national energy security. The current housing market is incredibly difficult to get into as a first-time buyer. In our local area especially, house and rent prices are daunting, and sadly the Tories are not doing enough to provide support for people or help increase the housing supply.\nLabour have set out an ambitious plan for housebuilding targets to help supply the need for housing and provide security to people and their families. This would include relaxing planning restrictions to let local authorities and examining green Belt areas that could be used to build on. I fully support Labour’s ambition to have 70% of people owning their own home. Many people have got in touch with me recently about the Government’s proposed ban on electric shock collars for dogs. As an animal lover myself, it is my firm belief that the UK should lead the world in animal welfare standards which would mean no animal would be made to endure unnecessary suffering.\nAll pets deserve the utmost protection, and I’m pleased that the legislation introduced has been approved by the House of Lords. However, I’m also pleased that there will be an exemption for those with protected characteristics who have a legitimate need to use collars that produce sounds, vibrations, and other non-shock signals. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_covid19/content_17.html": "|\nIt was great to join Nish Kumar and Coco Khan on Pod Save the UK. We spoke about working on the frontline during the pandemic, Labour’s bold mental health plan, and pitying Matt Hancock.\nSee a clip of the Podcast here:\nIt was great to be part of the 'Any Questions' panel last night. During the show, I spoke about how every death caused by the Covid-19 pandemic is more than just a number. Each death is a family, torn apart by grief by losing a loved one.\nMask wearing, supporting people with proper sick pay, ensuring that indoor areas are ventilated - these are all things that should have never ended. As winter approaches, the Government must take the risk posed by Coronavirus seriously. The Government needs to step and take the safety of people seriously. If you missed the show, you can listen back here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0010nv1 On Sunday, I was back in A&E working in the run up to the England v Italy match. While, unfortunately, it did not come home, it was great to spend time with hard-working colleagues at St Georges. With infections and hospitalisations increasing, it’s still incredibly important for us all to look out for one another and play our part in stopping the spread of the virus. Earlier this week, the Prime Minister gave an update on moving to stage four of the coronavirus easing roadmap. This means that from 19 July, the following will apply:\nUnderstandably, many are worried about the repercussions of these eased restrictions. Indeed, many residents have been in touch regarding the use of face coverings on public transport and their anxieties surrounding this. On Wednesday, Sadiq Khan announced that face coverings will remain mandatory for all, unless exempt, when travelling on the TfL network. This will, no doubt, be a relief to many in the local area, and I pay tribute to the Mayor of London in taking a firm stand against the Government’s recklessness. Labour is calling for a controlled approach that keeps in place baseline measures that can push down infections, like mandatory face masks on public transport – which we know protect people, reduce the spread of the virus, and don’t harm the economy. By removing mask requirements - the Johnson Variant is being fast-tracked. Cases will soar, as will hospitalisations. Everyone in Tooting has been fantastic in reducing the spread of coronavirus. With one of the highest vaccination rates in London, I can only ask residents to continue looking out for one another. Worryingly, coronavirus rates are soaring once again across London. The vaccine is our best defence. If you are yet to receive either your first or second dose, please do so as soon as possible. To help get Tooting vaccinated, the Pearl Chemist Vaccination Centre is now offering a walk-in clinic for those aged 18+ at St Boniface Church on Mitcham Road (Monday to Saturday 9-5pm). Appointments are available for first doses as well as second doses. Second doses can be given eight weeks after the first. Any questions can be directed to Pearl Chemist on 0208 049 6640. With the re-opening of non-essential retail, I took the opportunity to shine a spotlight on the local businesses/business owners that make our vibrant community such a fantastic place to live and work. The easing of national Government restrictions marks an important point in our recovery - our community and high street have so much to offer, so for six weeks I showcased the stores, restaurants, cafes, and other small businesses that make Tooting what it is! A huge thank you to every single business, business owner, employee, and customer who got behind the campaign. The past year has been challenging, so to see our community come together to support the local economy has been truly heartwarming. While this week marks the final instalment (for now) of Spotlight Saturdays, I will continue to find new ways to shine a bright light on Tooting and our wonderful community. Wandsworth is in the top 5 for vaccination rates across London! This is a great step forward and I am proud of everyone here in Tooting who has taken the steps to protect themselves and others by receiving their jab. However, we still have a way to go before everyone is protected against coronavirus. We need to keep pushing to ensure that those who can do so, are vaccinated as soon as possible. Information on how to book your vaccination appointment can be found here. It is also vital that if, for any reason, you have to change or cancel your vaccine appointment that you let the GP surgery or vaccination centre that you appointment is booked with know. You can manage your vaccination appointment here. If you are still unsure about having the jab or have any questions, more information can be found on the vaccine and answers to many common concerns on Wandsworth Council’s website here. The work of biomedical scientists and laboratory staff is incredibly valuable - and this has never been clearer than since the outset of the coronavirus pandemic. Often overlooked as a profession, I was pleased to join others in thanking those working in healthcare sciences. For every coronavirus test conducted, a biomedical scientist has been behind it, working hard to ensure PCR tests are returned safely. I would like to thank, in particular, our incredible microbiology team at St George’s. Working in A&E, I know just how much our NHS relies on the incredible efforts of lab staff. I have included photos of the microbiology team at St George’s, featuring Chris James, a Specialist Biomedical Scientist in Biochemistry who has worked at St George’s for 9 years, and Silva, a Specialist Biomedical Scientist in Medical Microbiology and Virology who has worked St George’s Hospital for the past 4 years, after moving to the UK from Portugal. Silva’s words about her work as a biomedical scientist are impactful and I hope everyone is able to recognise the incredible work they do. “Being a biomedical scientist is an extremely impactful role in healthcare. Even though it’s not patient facing, our work and the speed and accuracy with which we can produce results is essential for patient care.” As you will no doubt be aware, the Covid-19 situation remains serious, with the Delta variant spreading rapidly throughout the country. One of the most important steps we can take to stop the spread of the coronavirus is to get vaccinated as soon as possible. For this reason, a range of walk-in vaccination sites have been launched across South West London. People aged over 18 are invited to drop into the Tooting and Mitcham United F.C. vaccination centre on Saturday 19th or Sunday 20th 9am - 8pm, to receive their first or second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Unvaccinated over 40s and over 40s who have received their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine before mid-April can also head down to the Roehampton Vaccination Centre, located in the Queen Mary’s Hospital car park, on Sunday between 8am and 7.45pm to receive their second dose. Together we can stop the spread of Covid-19. Details of additional walk-in vaccine centres in South West London are available here. Since the outset of the pandemic, we have lost close to 500 Wandsworth residents to the virus (ONS). That’s 500 families grieving a lost one, 500 people with their own stories to tell, and a community collectively grieving those no longer with us. To remember those who died, I recently visited the National Covid Memorial Wall outside St Thomas’s Hospital, stretching across the south bank of the River Thames. The National Covid Memorial Wall was set up by the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, who I had the pleasure of meeting with in November last year. Hearing the evidence confirming what we knew and feared, of how severe failures caused countless avoidable deaths, results in a devastating combination of anger and heartbreak. All those bereaved are in my thoughts and will continue to be as we build back from this pandemic. Several cases of the South African variant of Covid-19 has been found in Wandsworth, and the Council is encouraging everyone over the age of 11 who lives, works in, or travels through Wandsworth to book a PCR test – including those of us who have had the vaccine, even if you are not showing any symptoms.\nPCR testing sites have opened across Wandsworth, including one at Tooting Leisure Centre by appointment only. Tests can also be ordered online, or collected without an appointment at Wandsworth Town Hall. Tests are also available on a strictly appointment-only basis at many local pharmacies. It is necessary to book a PCR test because although the widely available rapid lateral flow test can determine positivity for Covid-19, only the PCR test is able to detect specific variants. It is important that we are all tested because one-in-three people who have Covid-19 are asymptomatic, and could be spreading the virus without knowing it. Let’s all do our part to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 variant. Click here to order a home testing kit, or to book an appointment at a testing centre or local pharmacy. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_archives_05-2023/content_271.html": "|\nToday, I wrote to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, calling on him to listen to concerns expressed by local residents about the proposed closure of Trinity Medical Centre.\nAt a time when waiting times are at record levels, these plans by the NHS and Government will make it harder for local residents to access a local GP. That's why, alongside our local Labour Councillors, I'm campaigning to keep GP services at this site. Please add your name to the petition here Read my letter below: Today, I wrote to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, regarding my growing concerns about the limited powers of the ongoing inquiry into the deaths of up to 2,000 patients in mental health hospitals in Essex Partnership University Trust over the past 20 years.\nThe inquiry has only received the co-operation of less than 30% of named staff, who are essential witnesses in the deaths that are being investigated, leaving families in limbo and further compounding their grief. I have called on the Health Secretary to give the inquiry the full statutory powers required to ensure families get answers and that lessons can be learned for the future. Read my full letter here: The children's cancer centre at St George's Hospital is at risk of closure.\nThis is deeply concerning. The St George's children's cancer centre has more than 25 years of expertise delivering the highest quality care for patients, which will be lost if the services are moved away from Tooting. Under these plans, patients will be forced to travel to a site in central London. Parents have made it very clear that it is easier, cheaper, safer, and more comfortable to take their children to St George's. There is also a huge added cost. The plans to relocate services will cost an estimated £90 million, more than three times the cost to redevelop facilities at St George's Hospital. Today, I've launched a petition calling on the Government and NHS England to keep the children’s cancer service at St George's Hospital. Add your name and share the petition with friends and family here Trinity Medical Centre serves thousands of local people but is under threat of closure. For so many local residents this is a vital service. The closure would cause real difficulties for people accessing their local GP. Many local residents already have to wait weeks for a GP appointment and waiting lists for treatment are at record highs. This closure is a result of 13 years of government underfunding of our NHS. The local Integrated Care Board for South West London has been forced into making huge cuts to their budget and the impact of these cuts is now being felt by our community. In recent weeks, I've been contacted by numerous local residents extremely concerned about the impact of this closure. That's why I am urging the Health Secretary to intervene, listen to patients and staff alike, and keep a GP surgery open at Trinity Medical Centre. Sign my petition here As Mental Health Awareness Week comes to a close, I’ve been highlighting Labour’s bold plan for improving services across England, with prevention and early intervention at its heart.\nOn my visit to Maudsley Hospital, I spoke to the incredible Aji Lewis, who has tirelessly campaigned for Seni's Law to transform patient safety across the country. I spoke at a Parliamentary reception for Mental Health Foundation and joined Baton of Hope in Parliament, for a meeting with the Speaker to discuss their work on suicide prevention. And finally, speaking to students South Thames College, I spoke about my role as Shadow Cabinet Minister for Mental Health, holding the Government to account for failure in Mental Health services across England. Today, I asked Wandsworth Police officers to join me on a walk about in Tooting Bec.\nWe spoke to local residents and discussed tackling anti-social behaviour in the area. I know local residents have raised a number of concerns - about incidents targeting children and public safety in the area. I addressed these matters with the police, along with strategies already put in place aimed specifically at reducing worrying incidents of this kind and crime. Over recent months, I have taken the following action on anti-social behaviour and crime on the Heaver Estate:\nOn polling day, I joined Labour Party candidates standing for council seats in Dover, Medway and Gravesham. Across the country, Labour won more than 600 local council seats in Stoke-on-Trent, Plymouth, Dover, Medway, and many other areas that we will need to win, if we are to form a Labour majority at the next General Election.\nTalking to voters in these seats, it's clear that people right across the country have turned their back on the Conservatives, looking to Labour to deal with the cost-of-living crisis, tackle NHS waiting lists, and improving safety in our communities. The road to Labour in Government runs through our local councils, and I am hopeful this local victory will be the springboard to Labour’s general election victory. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_my-pledge-to-rebuild-confidence-in-labour/content_127.html": "|\nMy pledge to rebuild confidence in LabourI never imagined that one day I’d become an MP, or now a candidate to become the next Deputy Leader of the Labour Party. Growing up, I was regularly told that ‘girls like me’ from ‘backgrounds like mine’ wouldn’t amount to anything. I never planned to go into politics - I always wanted to be a doctor. The last Labour Government gave me that chance, allowing me to study Medicine aged 24 after failing my A-Levels the first time around because of pressures at home. This shaped the person that I am today and has given me the fire in my belly to ensure that no other child feels that there is a ceiling on what they can achieve.\nWhen I work shifts as an A&E doctor at my local hospital, I see first-hand the issues facing our communities today. I treat young people who come to A&E after self-harming, I treat those who haven’t been able to access mental health services for years, and yes, I treat victims of violent crime. To see a young person breathe their last breath is a pain that never leaves you. Teenage boys, once full of bravado on the street, with the words “Born to die” tattooed on their chests, victims of horrific stab wounds, laying there crying out for their mothers. The sound of a parent grieving for their child is universal - it can’t be forgotten. As the MP for Tooting, I have worked incredibly closely with community groups and young people to try and tackle the rise of violent crime in our society. I’ve organised summits with representatives from local community organisations, charities, the police, the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Council and the Deputy Mayor for Policing, to start tackling this problem from a community perspective. Working with affected communities is paramount in order to resolve these critical issues once and for all. As a keen boxer myself, I have promoted the work of local boxing clubs to tackle violent crime. Boxing is far more than just a sport - for many, it’s family. Clubs offer an opportunity for local young ¬people to make friends, engage with sport and receive mentorship. So much of gang culture and violence is about a sense of belonging. We have a duty to show young people that, if you can gain respect in the ring, you do not have to get respect from violence on the street. One of the reasons I decided to run to become the next Deputy Leader of the Labour Party is because it would give me the platform to give a voice to the voiceless. Whether it’s children losing their lives to senseless violence, older people being unable to access safe and decent social care, or refugees fleeing violence and persecution, their voices must be amplified. A platform alone isn’t enough though - Labour needs to be in power to affect real change for the most vulnerable in our communities. As Deputy Leader, I will rebuild our movement into one people can vote for. A party people can trust. The door may have closed on 12 December for a generation’s hopes and ambitions, but with the right leadership team in place in the Labour Party, it will not be closed for good. We need to win the next General Election, and we must listen to our voters ahead of the Mayoral election in May. As Deputy Leader, it will be my responsibility to rebuild trust, not just with the grassroots of our party, but with voters. Together, we can take Labour forward. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is MP for Tooting and candidate for Deputy Leader of Labour Comments are closed.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

My figures show that last year, nearly 20,000 new mothers were turned away from mental health services. Maternal mental health services are being rationed. This is despite maternal illness costing the whole of society £8.1 billion a year. It is an absolute scandal. The 8,500 new staff Labour will recruit are vital to solving this crisis. Read the full article here\nTonight I joined Andrew Marr on LBC to talk about the appalling hospital conditions doctors face in Palestinian hospitals.\nThe Tories have scrapped the Mental Health Act - failing thousands of patients.\nLabour must seize the opportunity to modernise mental health legislation, with the Joint Committee's recommendations in mind. Read my piece in New Statesman here.\nTonight, I voted on an amendment to the King's Speech to support a ceasefire in Gaza.\nRead my full statement here:\nSince the horrific terrorist attacks on Israel in October, more than 1,000 incidents of antisemitic hate crimes have been reported to Community Secure Trust.\nToday, I visited their headquarters in London to see the work they are doing to tackle antisemitism. It is a stain on our society. It must be combatted and those who perpetrate it must face the full force of the law.\nToday, the Government have scrapped their pledge to reform the Mental Health Act.\nMore than six years of reports, campaigning and hard work has gone down the drain. Last year, I sat on the Joint Committee on the Draft Mental Health Bill. There was overwhelming cross-party support for reforming the Act. To this day, the Government has failed to respond to the committee's recommendations. Earlier this year, the Conservatives scrapped their own 10-year mental health plan. Dither, delay and failure is on form with the Tories' approach to tackling the crisis in mental health services. Black people are five times more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act. The Tories have scrapped a once in a generation opportunity to tackle this burning injustice. Last month, I challenged the Health Minister to commit to reforming the Mental Health Act, her response was less than insightful. It is disappointing that the Tories continue to bury their heads in the sand and neglect mental health services. They are out of ideas and it's costing patients their lives. Only Labour can provide the transformation needed to improve services.\nMany people in Gaza were already living in appalling conditions before this latest conflict. If the Israeli bombardment continues and aid doesn't get through, I really fear for the consequences. Today, I appeared on Peston to reiterate calls for an immediate ceasefire in Israel and Gaza. Every effort needs to be made to work towards a peaceful solution. See my clip here:\nToday in Parliament, I challenged the Foreign Secretary to call on his Israeli counterpart to demand an immediate ceasefire to the escalating crisis in Gaza. While rightly calling out Hamas’ horrific attacks, we also have a duty to speak on behalf of those innocent Palestinians who are being collectively punished, starved and bombed in their own homes by Israeli forces. See my question here:\nToday marks International Stammer Awareness Day. I know from my own experience, the impact the stigma of stammering has on those affected. We must not create a narrative of trying to fix people with speech disfluency. Instead we need to work to create a more inclusive society. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

This plan identifies Tooting as a potential area for regeneration, where proposals include new sustainable transport, improvements to public realm, and contributions to the health and wellbeing of residents.\n3. 56 Tooting High Street on the west corner of the Garratt Lane and Tooting High Street junction: The Council are considering using this site for a development of sustainable architecture and urban design, as well as considering the planting of street trees on Garratt Lane.\nFurther information on these proposals can be found here. Whilst I hold no authority over Wandsworth Council, it is important to me that residents, businesses and organisations have their say on these proposals. If you would like to submit comments on the ‘Pre-Publication’ Draft Local Plan, you must do so before 11.59pm on Monday 1 March 2021 using the following link: https://www.wandsworth.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy/local-plan/draft-local-plan-pre-publication/ I am aware that many local residents are concerned about the proposed Tooting Triangle development. Plans to upgrade the site’s facilities and amenities – replacing the artificial football pitch with a modern surface, and building new changing rooms, public toilets, a children’s play area, and a café – are welcome. However, the proposal to fund the improvements via a 25-year lease of the new facilities to TFL Leisure – a private company – is more controversial.\nThe fence set to be constructed around the new football pitch, and the lack of clarity as to whether the upgraded children’s Stay & Play facility will remain free to use, have prompted concerns that the development will put public land behind a literal paywall. I am sure you will agree that if the recent lockdowns have taught us anything, it is that there is a need for more publicly accessible green spaces – not less. As it stands, the proposed development would see a reduction in the area available to the Balham Boxing Club compared with their current provision. Issues have also been raised regarding the smaller size of the female changing rooms compared to the men's, and the impact floodlighting could have on the Triangle’s resident bat population, among other things. I understand that discussions on the proposed development are ongoing. Please be assured that I am keeping a close eye on this evolving situation - we all want what's best for our local community. I have written to the Housing Secretary to outline residents concerns about EWS1 forms and cladding.\nThe creation of EWS1 forms and concerns about cladding are issues I know a lot of Tooting residents are facing. Everyone deserves the safety and security of home and I am shocked that so many local residents have found themselves in this situation. Following discussions with local people, I have written to the Financial Conduct Authority, Aviva, the National Housing and Building Council and the Shadow Secretary of State for Housing. You can see these letters below. I have received lots of correspondence from local residents regarding the changes that have been made to our roads as part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood and the Streetspace schemes on the A24 (Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road). As part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood schemes, many streets have had filters put in to close the road to all vehicles except cycles and some now have turning restrictions. As part of the Streetspace scheme, a number of changes have been made to Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road including the installation of wands to segregate cycle lanes, a number of turning restrictions as well as changes to bus stops.\nThese changes have come about as a result of statutory guidance that the Government issued in May, stating that local authorities were expected to make significant changes to their road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians “as swiftly as possible”. (If you would like to read more about this statutory guidance you can read it in full here.) As a result, TfL made £55m of funding available to the 33 councils in London as part of its “Streetspace for London” programme to urgently create new segregated cycle lanes, extend pavements and close roads to traffic. Wandsworth Council was given £1,923,500 by TfL and used this money to implement the LTNs. TfL has, in consultation with Wandsworth Council but acting separately, implemented changes to the A24. I am supportive of initiatives which reduce car usage, make our streets safer, encourage cycling and create a better local environment. But we must make it work for everyone in Tooting and Balham. I know that lots of local residents have concerns and comments about how the changes have affected our community. The only way to have your voice heard is to feed into the consultations that Wandsworth Council is running and to let TfL know what you think by emailing them. To respond to Wandsworth Council's consultation, click here. To provide feedback to TfL please email: [email protected] It is important to note that I was not consulted prior to the implementation of these changes to our roads and I have no control over the decisions that have been made. As the local MP, I can lobby the Government and the relevant Ministers, but I cannot make decisions for the Conservative Council. I am listening and engaging with local residents on this but I cannot make alterations to these changes. If you have already provided your feedback to Wandsworth Council's consultation and/or emailed TfL, and you want to raise your concerns with other officials, you may also wish to contact Wandsworth Council's Transport spokesperson Councillor John Locker via email at [email protected], or the Government's Minister of State with responsibility for cycling and walking Chris Heaton-Harris MP via email at [email protected] |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_communities_10/content_673.html": "|\nA number of dogs have been reportedly infected with canine parvovirus on Tooting Common in recent times. Dog owners may be well aware that parvovirus is a highly infectious condition spread through contaminated faeces of affected dogs, and it can remain active in the environment for up to nine months. The virus causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea, leading to a dog or puppy becoming very weak and dehydrated. Sadly, many little pups do not recover. Thankfully, there are a number of steps that dog owners can take to protect their furry friends: Prevent your dog from meeting with other dogs to stop the spread of infection Ensure your dog’s vaccinations are up-to-date Notify your vet immediately if your dog displays any worrying symptoms. Click here to learn more about canine parvovirus. Good news - the Food Bus is coming to Tooting! The Food Bus – a converted bus stocked with affordable, healthy food – aims to improve Wandsworth residents’ access to fresh produce, while reducing the burden on household budgets. Much of its stock is obtained from retailers’ surpluses, and an ordinary shopping basket of goods will be available at a fraction of the normal price. The bus also features an on-board café. Head on down to All Saints Church on Brudenell Road on Thursday 10 June between 10:30am to 2:30pm to experience this wonderful initiative for yourself. Since the outset of the pandemic, we have lost close to 500 Wandsworth residents to the virus (ONS). That’s 500 families grieving a lost one, 500 people with their own stories to tell, and a community collectively grieving those no longer with us. To remember those who died, I recently visited the National Covid Memorial Wall outside St Thomas’s Hospital, stretching across the south bank of the River Thames. The National Covid Memorial Wall was set up by the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, who I had the pleasure of meeting with in November last year. Hearing the evidence confirming what we knew and feared, of how severe failures caused countless avoidable deaths, results in a devastating combination of anger and heartbreak. All those bereaved are in my thoughts and will continue to be as we build back from this pandemic. On Tuesday, I was alerted to a team of Met Police officers stopping fast food delivery drivers and carrying out immigration checks on Mitcham Road. The only concerns I have received from local residents (which authorities were copied into) were about social distancing, for which an operation of this size seems excessive. However, the police say it was 'a road safety policing operation'. The Home Office say it was in relation to 'suspected immigration offences'. This looks like racial profiling - and under the Equalities Act 2010, this may amount to indirect discrimination due to its disproportionate impact on ethnic minority groups. If it's not unlawful, then it's definitely immoral and I cannot defend it. Our community here in Tooting is inclusive, diverse and welcoming. The celebratory nature of the police’s response to any arrests is not in line with our local values. I have met with the police since and encouraged them to focus their time on fighting crime – not targeting people at work. The Bike Project - a wonderful local charity which supplies refugees with old, unloved, and abandoned bicycles – is looking for someone to provide a new Tooting drop-off point. A drop-off point is a place where local residents can leave their unwanted bikes to be collected by the charity, who repairs them before they are donated to refugees and asylum seekers. With just £37.75 a week to live on, these bikes can make an enormous difference to the lives of refugees. If you are able to volunteer a space to act as a new drop-off point in our area, or to arrange a time to donate a bike, email Julia from The Bike Project at [email protected]. We have been blessed with wonderful sunshine throughout this week, which has undoubtedly brought out the best of our surroundings here in Tooting. Working in St George’s Hospital, I know what a real difference the green spaces in the grounds make to patients, visitors and staff alike. I would therefore like to express my sincere thanks to the hospital gardening team, in particular their Head of Gardening, John Greco, who have put their all into this wonderful display of spring blooms for us all to enjoy. The bright array of tulips and blossom trees will no doubt be a great comfort to what is an often anxious time for patients and visitors to the hospital. Thank you team! Several cases of the South African variant of Covid-19 has been found in Wandsworth, and the Council is encouraging everyone over the age of 11 who lives, works in, or travels through Wandsworth to book a PCR test – including those of us who have had the vaccine, even if you are not showing any symptoms.\nPCR testing sites have opened across Wandsworth, including one at Tooting Leisure Centre by appointment only. Tests can also be ordered online, or collected without an appointment at Wandsworth Town Hall. Tests are also available on a strictly appointment-only basis at many local pharmacies. It is necessary to book a PCR test because although the widely available rapid lateral flow test can determine positivity for Covid-19, only the PCR test is able to detect specific variants. It is important that we are all tested because one-in-three people who have Covid-19 are asymptomatic, and could be spreading the virus without knowing it. Let’s all do our part to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 variant. Click here to order a home testing kit, or to book an appointment at a testing centre or local pharmacy. Today Muslims across the UK and around the world mark the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan. As a proud Muslim, the period of reflection, prayer, and fasting is incredibly important to our Muslim community. Traditionally, Ramadan is a time for gathering and sharing Iftar with family and friends. Although, like last year, we are unable to come together and celebrate as we normally would, the spirit of Ramadan remains. To every Muslim nurse and doctor who have saved countless lives throughout this pandemic, to every volunteer and community leader in our Mosques and community centres who continue to support those most vulnerable, and to every Muslim in Tooting and across the country, I wish you all Ramadan Mubarak. With the easing of Government restrictions, The Share Community are seeking volunteer befrienders to help local residents with learning disabilities get back out into the community. Share is a registered charity with a site in Tooting providing support to adults with learning disabilities and/or autism. Their befriending project matches people with similar interests to go for walks, bike rides, or coffee. Befriending is incredibly rewarding, providing companionship to those who are socially isolated and regular contact with a friendly face outside their usual circle. I am told that reliability and being a good listener are the only prerequisites to be a volunteer befriender. If this sounds like you, Share would love to hear from you! Click here to find out more. Here in South West London, over half a million residents have received their first vaccine dose so far! Although this is a pivotal milestone, the percentage of vaccinated persons still remains lower among all ethnic minority groups compared with the White British population. I recognise that many within the BAME community may be unfamiliar with vaccines and feel unsure. However, I can assure you that the vaccines have all been rigorously tested and declared safe by doctors around the world. I continue to urge everyone eligible to book their vaccine appointment as soon as possible. The sooner the vaccine is rolled out, the sooner we can begin to rebuild. Together we can do this. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

The Commonwealth Games have also had a more local hero. Eden Cheng won a silver medal in the 10m synchro platform competition along with Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix. Eden is a brilliant example of our community producing talented athletes, and I am sure many will aspire to reach Eden’s success. Congratulations to Eden, and all the medal winners at the Games! I arrived back home safely from Ukraine yesterday. I went on a humanitarian mission with MedGlobalOrg, who are helping support hospitals to prepare for the darkest days of this conflict. We worked with the most amazing people and met patients with the most heart-breaking stories. I was honoured to be able to help Ukrainian victims in the midst of the heart breaking turmoil they are experiencing. Let’s do all that we can to help support Ukraine.\nIt was great to be part of the 'Any Questions' panel last night. During the show, I spoke about how every death caused by the Covid-19 pandemic is more than just a number. Each death is a family, torn apart by grief by losing a loved one.\nMask wearing, supporting people with proper sick pay, ensuring that indoor areas are ventilated - these are all things that should have never ended. As winter approaches, the Government must take the risk posed by Coronavirus seriously. The Government needs to step and take the safety of people seriously. If you missed the show, you can listen back here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0010nv1 The Government recently released their “Plan for Health and Social Care”, in which they pledge to help the NHS recover from the coronavirus pandemic and reform the adult social care system - funded by a 1.25% increase in National Insurance payments.\nLow-paid families will now be hit with a double whammy of a Universal Credit cut and a hike in tax. In fact, some key workers will end up more than £1,000 worse off. While I have long called for investment in social care, this is not the appropriate way to fund it. Once again the Tories have put the very wealthiest above working people. I am proud to have voted against this National Insurance increase, which will be a damaging blow to so many working people in Tooting. On Monday 6 September, I’ll be live on Riverside Radio diving into why mental health matters and, perhaps most importantly, all your mental health matters. The last 18 months have been incredibly challenging for so many of us and have highlighted the importance of mental health care. We need true parity of esteem between physical and mental health. One step we can take towards reducing any stigma is by being open in our conversations around mental health. Join me for an honest, straight-talking hour, 6-7pm next Monday! And if you have any questions about mental health that you want to ask on air, please email [email protected]. The situation which has unfolded in Afghanistan is shocking and terribly regrettable. It is simply not good enough for world leaders to say the speed of the Taliban advance took them by surprise, when many have been warning of this for months. There has either been a monumental failing of our intelligence services or an unacceptable lack of transparency. Either way the Government has reacted too late. In 2010, I worked (pictured) as a Humanitarian Aid Doctor in the North West Frontier Province, on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan, following the flood crisis. I met many people who had suffered unimaginable pain at the hands of the Taliban. I am continuing to receive a high volume of emails from local residents concerned about loved ones in Afghanistan. Myself and my team are working to respond as quickly as possible. If you are worried about someone, please do not hesitate to get in touch by emailing their details to [email protected]. Please include the following information so I can take action quickly:\nWe must not allow history to repeat itself. Careless leadership from the Prime Minister enabled this tragedy to happen on his watch, while he had taken his eye off the ball. The world must not turn its back on the Afghan people. Following the recall of Parliament on Wednesday, I remain in close contact with my colleagues in the Shadow Foreign Team and will continue to be on hand to support local residents through this. Today, the BBC revealed that in 2018 4,500 people in mental health crisis were unlawfully held in police custody due to a lack of mental health beds.\nI spoke about this matter on BBC News earlier today. There is no question that the system must change immediately. This is nothing short of a scandal. Rest assured I will be pressing the Government on this issue. Children and young people have suffered immensely during the pandemic. But the mental health crisis facing Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) is nothing new. CAMHS services are at breaking point. They were before the pandemic. Tens of thousands of children are being turned away from mental health services – support they vitally need. Parents have raised this issue. Doctors have raised this issue. The stats provide the evidence. When will the Government admit that CAMHS services need to be better resourced? |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

The situation in Wandsworth remains serious. We currently have a local rate of 238.7 cases per 100,000 people - well above the national average. While the vaccine is giving added protection by reducing deaths and hospitalisations, it is important to bear in mind that it does not eradicate transmission and those who have been vaccinated can still become unwell with coronavirus.

Information about local walk-in clinics is available here. Unlike previously, second doses of the vaccine are available after eight weeks and many walk-in centres will vaccinate those who bring along their vaccination card. 1 in 3 people who have coronavirus are asymptomatic, so twice weekly testing is another way to keep ourselves and others safe.

This circus is the latest saga in the Tory melodrama, but it is the most vulnerable people whose lives they're playing with. Britain is better than this cruel, cynical Tory Government. I have worked with refugees for more than a decade. I have heard their experiences of war, violence and terror. Nobody leaves their homes, communities and livelihoods unless they must.

My figures show that last year, nearly 20,000 new mothers were turned away from mental health services. Maternal mental health services are being rationed. This is despite maternal illness costing the whole of society £8.1 billion a year. It is an absolute scandal. The 8,500 new staff Labour will recruit are vital to solving this crisis.

Serving as the Member of Parliament for the community I grew up in is an honour. From helping local residents with casework, playing a part in winning the council, defending our NHS and serving as the shadow Minister to Mental Health - I have the best job in the world. My job is made even greater by the fantastic support local members show me all year round, so I want to take this opportunity to say a big thank you to them all! The next election is make-or-break for our party, we simply must win. I’m looking forward to working hard to make this happen. The NHS is being dismantled, I see it every time I work a shift. More people than ever are relying on foodbanks, and the cost-of-living crisis is having a devastating impact on people locally and across the country. I will be absolutely committed to doing everything I can to put Labour into Government and make the changes this country so desperately needs. Thank you again to everyone who voted. It was great to visit Mount Carmel Rehabilitation centre again recently. I’ve enjoyed working with this fantastic organisation over the last few years. Mount Carmel offers residential and day programmes to people struggling with addictions. Their Counsellors provide a series of programmes, including a range of talking therapy groups, art therapy and equine therapy, to help people overcome their addiction issues. The pandemic has left Mount Carmel more stretched than ever, with many people seeking help after relapsing or struggling with new addiction problems during the lockdowns. Despite the increased demand, the team at Mount Carmel continue to provide first class care to all their clients. I look forward to continuing to work with the team at Mount Carmel, and seeing all that they go on to achieve. If you would like to support the work they do in our community, you can donate to their Just Giving page below On Monday 13 June, I was delighted to welcome organisations and individuals from across Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting to Parliament, in order to recognise their fantastic contributions to society in the face of adversity in the last few years.

I would like to thank all those who attended - I cannot overstate how proud I am of our community. Each and every one of you is a true Tooting Hero. 44 years of Tory rule in Wandsworth came to an end with Labour taking control of the Council after the local elections. Labour won 35 seats, whilst the Tories won 22. I was thrilled to play a part along with our fantastic Councillors, candidates, and activists in putting Labour into power locally.\nLabour’s historic victory here represents a new start for our borough, and it’s great to see Wandsworth’s group of Labour Councillors already taking action to help residents through the cost-of-living crisis. Talking to residents right across the borough, it was obvious to see that people in Wandsworth have rejected Conservative neglect both locally and nationally. The cost of living crisis is hitting residents hard, and it’s clear the Tories aren’t doing enough to address it. Wandsworth residents simply do not trust the Tories. The road to Labour in Government runs through our local councils, and I am hopeful this local victory will be the springboard to Labour’s general election victory. The Local Elections are hastily approaching on 5th May. After 44 long years of Tory rule, Wandsworth needs a breath of fresh air and a Labour council.\nOver the next four weeks, I will be out on the campaign trail - knocking on doors, delivering leaflets and working to help our fantastic Labour candidates. I would like to thank all the local residents for their support and warm welcome on the doorstep. Together we can turn Labour red this May! Today Muslims across the UK and around the world mark the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan. As a proud Muslim, the period of reflection, prayer, and fasting is incredibly important to our Muslim community. Traditionally, Ramadan is a time for gathering and sharing Iftar with family and friends. Although, like last year, we are unable to come together and celebrate as we normally would, the spirit of Ramadan remains. To every Muslim nurse and doctor who have saved countless lives throughout this pandemic, to every volunteer and community leader in our Mosques and community centres who continue to support those most vulnerable, and to every Muslim in Tooting and across the country, I wish you all Ramadan Mubarak. Local residents living or passing through Rackham Mews in Furzedown may have seen the large fly-tip that occurred earlier in the week. Understandably, this is very unpleasant for those who live near this area and I have therefore written to Paul Chadwick, Director of Environment and Community Services at Wandsworth Council, as well as notifying the local councillors of the issue in the hope that this can be rectified as soon as possible. Please be assured that I will keep local resident updated of the progress on this. Furzedown Police are currently appealing for witnesses, so if you have any information about this fly-tip, please do email [email protected] or message them via Twitter. As you will know, a South African variant of Covid-19 has arrived in the UK. This new Covid variant has now been detected in CR4 (Merton). Residents in CR4 are no different to us in neighbouring Tooting (SW16 and SW17). We use the same shops, the same hospital, and the same parks, so if it’s there, it could very easily be here. This will be the same across all affected areas. As a matter of urgency, the Government needs to launch widespread testing in neighbouring postcodes. This is the only way to see how widespread these new variants are. I have written to the Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock MP, the Director of Public Health at Wandsworth Council, Shannon Katiyo, and the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Council, Paul Martin, to ask about plans to launch testing in neighbouring postcodes. While I press for action on this, we need to make sure we’re all doing everything we can to keep ourselves and each other safe. It’s absolutely vital that we minimise our social contact to prevent the spread of this new variant within our community. Please think twice before leaving home, and when you do leave, please continue to adhere to social distancing. Together, we will get through this. In light of the upcoming Fire Safety Bill, I would to thank every resident who has written to me with their concerns on this and for continuing to keep me updated on the cladding issues affecting their property. I recognise what an exceptionally difficult time this is and appreciate how much anxiety the cladding proposals are causing to many leaseholders.\nOn more than fifteen occasions, Ministers promised that leaseholders would not be landed with the costs of remedial works. Yet, people are still being put at risk, trapped in flammable buildings for a third lockdown, with leaseholders placed in an impossible position and promises broken. It is evident that the Government’s handling of the cladding crisis has lacked any sense of grip or urgency. For this reason, the Labour Party have tabled an Opposition Day Debate on cladding for Monday, which will subsequently bring forward a vote that will call for leaseholders to be protected from the costs of remediating their blocks with dangerous cladding. The party will also be tabling a number of amendments to the Fire Safety Bill that will aim to protect leaseholders from unfair costs through the power of the law. I am aware that many residents have been in touch to request that I support the McPartland and Smith amendment, which provides welcome clarity on the specific costs that would be prevented from being passed on to leaseholders. Labour has sought to go further on this. As currently drafted, the McPartland and Smith amendment would not have covered blocks like Grenfell - where flammable cladding has been added at some stage following the building of the block. It only applies to defects in the original design of buildings. The Labour Party’s amendment would ensure that the cost of fire safety problems from refurbishment jobs, like the cladding on Grenfell Tower, cannot be passed on to leaseholders. Labour’s amendments also include new clauses so that the Bill protects leaseholders from the day it comes into law, instead of an unknown date in the future. I would like to thank my colleagues in the Labour Party, Sarah Jones MP, Nick Thomas-Symonds MP, Thangam Debbonaire MP and Mike Amesbury MP for their hard work and commitment to addressing this large injustice on a national scale. If any residents have any further queries on this issue, please do not hesitate to get in touch to discuss this further. In the meantime, I hope this post assures you of the steps myself and the Labour Party are taking to protect tenants and leaseholders during this cladding crisis. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_shadow-cabinet-minister-for-mental-health_2/content_581.html": "|\nSome businesses take their workplace mental health responsibilities very seriously. It was extremely insightful to talk to leaders of Talon, JCDecaux, Clear Channel Outdoor, Ocean Outdoor today, about what they’re doing to support employees’ mental health.\nToday, I wrote to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, regarding my growing concerns about the limited powers of the ongoing inquiry into the deaths of up to 2,000 patients in mental health hospitals in Essex Partnership University Trust over the past 20 years.\nThe inquiry has only received the co-operation of less than 30% of named staff, who are essential witnesses in the deaths that are being investigated, leaving families in limbo and further compounding their grief. I have called on the Health Secretary to give the inquiry the full statutory powers required to ensure families get answers and that lessons can be learned for the future. Read my full letter here: As Mental Health Awareness Week comes to a close, I’ve been highlighting Labour’s bold plan for improving services across England, with prevention and early intervention at its heart.\nOn my visit to Maudsley Hospital, I spoke to the incredible Aji Lewis, who has tirelessly campaigned for Seni's Law to transform patient safety across the country. I spoke at a Parliamentary reception for Mental Health Foundation and joined Baton of Hope in Parliament, for a meeting with the Speaker to discuss their work on suicide prevention. And finally, speaking to students South Thames College, I spoke about my role as Shadow Cabinet Minister for Mental Health, holding the Government to account for failure in Mental Health services across England. Patients experiencing a mental health crisis often find themselves stuck in A&E.\nThe Health Secretary should be ashamed. Today, I asked the Health Secretary when will he finally get his act together and back Labour's plans to recruit thousands of additional staff to bring down waiting times? See my question here It was fantastic to be out in the gorgeous Peak District to support my friend and High Peak's next Labour MP, Jon Pearce. We first visited the Glossop Arts Project to see the amazing work they do, using art to support young people's mental health - of course, we had to indulge in the offer of a free toastie and cuppa too!\nOn the doorstep afterwards, we spoke to so many people fed up with the Tories, both locally and in Westminster. There are council elections coming up in May and Labour has every chance to take full control of the council here! The views were incredible, the people lovely, and I can't wait to be back! Today marks World Bipolar Day, which raises awareness and reduces the stigma surrounding bipolar disorder. One-in-fifty people in the UK live with bipolar disorder yet many struggle to access the services they need to get a proper diagnosis. Living with bipolar disorder can have a devastating impact on the people struggling with the illness as well as an impact on their loved ones, which is why it is vital that people are able to get a diagnosis early. We need a Government that will get serious on bipolar disorder. Labour will put prevention and early intervention at the forefront of our approach to mental health. The next Labour Government will recruit 8,500 new staff to ensure mental health treatment within a month for all who need it.\nOn Eating Disorder Awareness Week, I spoke a debate in Westminster Hall on challenging the stereotypes and assumptions around eating disorders. Across the UK, there are as many as 1.25 million people living with an eating disorder. Eating disorders have considerably high mortality rates, with anorexia claiming the most lives of any mental illness. Yet, with timely and appropriate treatment, people can go on to live healthy and fulfilling lives. We need a Government that will get serious on mental health and eating disorders. Labour will put prevention and early intervention at the forefront of our approach to mental health. We will place a mental health specialist in every school and place an open access hub for young people in every single community. Our latest research, shows that in 2021/22, the total number of days lost to poor mental health has doubled to more than 730,000 over the last decade. This comes at the same time that there has been a drop in the number of neighbourhood police officers by 6,000 and of Police Community Support Officers by 8,500.\nThese absences equate to over 2,000 police officers being off sick each day, last year alone, due to poor mental health. It is clear that this Conservative Government has presided over 13 years of neglect and staff shortages that have left our public services at breaking point. The next Labour Government will recruit 8,500 more mental health professionals, ensuring a million more patients get treated each year; and we will rebuild neighbourhood policing, delivering a package of 13,000 extra neighbourhood officers and PCSOs, putting police back on the beat. Read the full story here Our exclusive data reveals that children in a mental health crisis spent more than 900,000 hours in A&E in England, last year. The total delays across England, in the past year alone, equate to 103 years of waiting time. This is a huge rise, up four-fold in the last decade.\nThe figures, made public through Freedom of Information requests, show the staggering number of hours that children have spent in a mental health crisis in Emergency Departments. With nowhere to turn, children with a mental illness are left to deteriorate – at which time A&E is the only place left for them to go. Emergency Departments are incredibly unsuitable settings for children in crisis, yet we’re witnessing increasingly younger children having to present to A&E in desperation. The next Labour Government will prioritise a truly preventative plan for mental health services and will put patient care first. We will ensure access to mental health professionals in every school and put an open access hub in every community, in addition to guaranteeing mental health treatment within a month for all who need it, by recruiting 8,500 new mental health staff to treat a million additional patients a year by Labour’s first term in office., funded by closing tax loopholes. Read the full article here For Children's Mental Health Week, I've written for LabourList about Labour's bold, transformative plan to deliver mental health care for children and young people. With children waiting days in A&E in a mental health crisis and more than one million people being turned away from mental health services without being seen, it is vital that we transform care by putting prevention at the heart of our plan.\nThis Government should not cut corners when it comes to young people’s mental health. Good mental health starts in childhood. Labour’s vision for future generations is one where mental health conditions are treated early. Adverse childhood experiences are the greatest driver of mental illness in adulthood – it’s just common sense to get mental health treatment right for young people in order to transform the future of the country’s mental health. The next Labour Government will ensure access to a mental health professional in every school, and we will put an open access mental health hub in every community. Every child should have the ability to raise concerns about their mental health with someone they trust, in an environment in which they feel safe. All of this will be funded by ending tax breaks for private schools. Read my full article here |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_deputy-leadership-campaign/content_29.html": "|\nThe MP for Tooting has been working in her local hospital where doctors and nurses are already dealing with cases of covid-19. She warns that many of those being treated are in their 30s and 40s.\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan is the MP for Tooting but she is also a practising doctor in A&E. She regularly goes in to do shifts in her local hospital St George's and has been in contact with her colleagues. This Sunday she took a record down for Mirror readers about the situation faced by nurses, doctors and others on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus. She said her latest shift had been a \"deeply, deeply eye-opening\" experience with previously fit and healthy people in their 30s and 40s \"attached to machines, fighting for their lives\". And she has been deeply critical of the approach taken by the government in tackling the spread of the deadly virus. \"The Prime Minister has been blase about this from the start, waiting for others to make decisions so he doesn't have to. It is costing lives,\" she said. Mirror Diary - Sunday 22 March6.30am – Leaving the HouseOn the way to work in A&E, to help out the real heroes of the frontline – the NHS staff who work day-in, day-out to keep us all safe. I am a bit apprehensive after seeing the stories that are being reported about Covid-19 and having spoken to colleagues across the country, but we need to come together at times like these for our communities. 7am – Reporting for DutyJust finished handover, which is when the day shift gets given notes on the patients who have come in overnight. There’s a very real sense that the number of cases are growing extremely quickly, something that will present a real challenge in the coming days and weeks. Some of the sickest patients that have been admitted have been young – they’re in their 30s and 40s, previously fit and well, but now fighting for their lives in Intensive Care (ICU). There was a lot of talk in January that this was a virus just like the flu that only affects older people – that simply isn’t the case. There’s a real sense of apprehension ahead of the shift – we’re all expecting a rocky road ahead in the coming days. 8am- Protective EquipmentThe first part of the shift was spent looking for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – these are masks and aprons that keep those working on the frontlines safe. While we’d all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. Frontline staff across the country are scared. We’re scared that we’re going to lose patients – we have spent years training to save every life that we can. We are scared of passing this deadly virus onto our loved ones because we don’t always have the PPE that we so desperately need. We’re scared that that if we aren’t properly protected, that we run the risk of spreading the virus between patients. It’s vital that people practice social distancing measures properly – crowded areas will only add to the number of cases, and the number of people being admitted into hospitals across the country. In the coming days and weeks, difficult decisions will be made by my colleagues in ICU about who gets a ventilator – it’s that serious. Midday – Resus overwhelmedThe whole of resus is full of patients with respiratory problems – this is the part of A&E where the sickest patients go. Patients are arriving breathless, with crackles so fine in their lungs, you can hardly hear them. Their X-rays show white lungs where normally, they would look clear and black, full of air. Major trauma, such as heart attacks and victims of car crashes, are now being moved into paediatric A&E. The situation around Covid-19 is clearly getting worse by the day. The talk amongst the team is that we feel that we will be overwhelmed in the coming days. I’m going for a refresher course on ventilators for staff – they’re also training new staff on how to use ventilators. The talk is, of course, feeling quite bleak as the day goes on – but this is what we’ve all been trained for. 4pm – Leaving A&EJust leaving A&E now – it’s been a difficult shift and a difficult Mother’s Day. At times like these, we must think about our loved ones - if we want to protect those dearest to us, we must stay indoors. I’ve just called my husband and asked him to let our daughters know that they won’t be able to cuddle me and give me their handmade presents when I get home. Instead, I’ll be getting straight in the shower and throwing my clothes in the washing machine – it is our duty to protect the ones we love. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can, and we will, save lives. Former Labour MEP SEB DANCE explains why he is supporting Rosena Allin-Khan in the Labour deputy leadership race.\nBritain has left the EU. As a former Labour Member of the European Parliament, as a Remainer, and as a proud pro-European, that’s still not an easy thing for me to say – but it’s the reality. There is no longer a campaign to remain. That doesn’t mean that Boris Johnson’s famous lie of “get Brexit done” has suddenly come true. The ongoing negotiations with the EU will continue to define our country’s future for years to come. Perhaps one day the fight to join the EU will come. How soon that time comes depends on what we do next. Pro-Europeans must now fight for a close relationship between the UK and our friends in the EU and ongoing rights for UK citizens. The Labour Party must play a crucial role in that fight. That’s why I’m supporting Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan to become the next deputy leader of Labour. Rosena was elected as the MP for Tooting the week before the EU referendum in 2016. Despite holding a shadow frontbench position, she refused to compromise on her principles or on the promises she’d made to her community, so she broke the whip and voted against triggering Article 50. Considering the shambles that followed Theresa May’s early triggering of Article 50, this has been conclusively demonstrated as the right decision. Rosena was also the first shadow frontbench minister to come out publicly and call for a People’s Vote. This was an incredibly brave thing to do, at a time when Labour MPs and shadow ministers were being pressured not to speak out against the leadership’s position on Brexit. At a time when the leadership of Labour needed a firm push in the right direction, Rosena was the one brave enough to stand up and do it. There are some voices in the Labour Party, who’ll try to convince you that Brexit was the only reason for Labour’s failure at the last general election – that backing a public vote cost us seats in the so-called ‘Red Wall’. But this analysis is deeply misleading, and is simply not supported by the facts. Yes, of course Brexit was a divisive issue, for Labour as much as for anyone else. The reality however, is that the overwhelming majority of Labour voters, members and supporters voted Remain, wanted us to stay in the EU and wanted a public vote on Brexit. That fact is as true of Labour voters in Redcar, Grimsby or Wakefield as it is of Labour voters in Oxford, Islington or Bristol – Labour’s share of the vote went down in 98% of all seats. Labour’s position on Brexit was fatally undermined not because supporting a public vote was the wrong position for our voters, but because the leadership of the party took so long to get to that position. We sat in the middle of the road on the biggest issue of our time and neither side trusted us. We lost trust among all our communities. Rosena knows this – she won’t stop standing up for our internationalist values. I joined the Labour Party because I believe in internationalism and solidarity across borders. So does Rosena. That’s why she’s worked across the world in conflict and disaster zones as a humanitarian doctor, and why she still does shifts in her local hospital as an A&E doctor alongside her work as an MP. So if you are like me – a proud pro-European, an internationalist and a Labour supporter – and if you want someone as deputy leader who’ll stand up for those values, and who’ll fight for our country to maintain the closest possible relationship with the EU, protecting our workers’ rights, our environmental protections, our food standards, our NHS, and most importantly the rights of EU citizens living in the UK – then vote for Doctor Rosena. Together, let’s take Labour forward. Rosena Allin-Khan MP: \"I want to inspire Asians to own their identity”A CANDIDATE in the race for Labour’s deputy leadership has admitted the party “lost trust with voters” following its crushing defeat in the December general election.\nTooting MP Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is up against fellow MPs Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler, Ian Murray and Angela Rayner in the race, triggered by Labour’s huge loss last year. Suffering one of its worst results since 1935, Labour lost dozens of seats which they had held for decades, including a number of constituencies in the Midlands and northern England, which historically tended to support the party. The loss was down to a lack of trust, Allin- Khan believes. “People, quite frankly, didn’t trust us to govern,” the MP told Eastern Eye. “We had a manifesto which I believe was full of good things, but voters didn’t trust us to deliver it.” The party’s stance on Brexit was an additional factor – “we didn’t seem decisive enough” – and the level of anti-Semitism in the party and the way it was subsequently handled “closed a lot of doors”. “I’ve been up and down the country talking to individuals, wondering why Labour lost, and I’ve been told by activists that people didn’t think we had our own house in order,” she said. Today, she said, the most common concern of voters is the NHS, the level of safety on the streets and housing. “We need to show that the hopes and dreams that people have for themselves are the ones that we (Labour) have for them,” the mother-of-two said. Next month’s contest will also see the unveiling of a new Labour leader, after Jeremy Corbyn announced he would be stepping down following the general election last year. Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey are in the running to lead the opposition party. Allin-Khan, however, will not be voicing her support for any of the candidates as she believes the party needs to “heal all divisions (and) unite” after it fared so badly in the election. “When I’m working in A&E and I see kids coming in with lung infections because of mouldy housing or I see kids who have to go to food banks (…) they don’t care if Labour is left, right or centre,” she explained. “So, the most important thing to move forward is to unite and I can show that by not nominating someone for leader.” On her role in the deputy leadership race, Allin-Khan said she was determined to use it as an opportunity to help “ethnic minorities own their identity and be proud of it”. “That is what I want people to feel I embody when they look at me,” she explained. “For me, being in this race, if that is the one thing I get out of this…that other young British Asians can look at me and say, ‘if she can do it, I can do it too’, then that is my job done.” Allin-Khan admitted she had faced prejudice due to her mixed Pakistani-Polish heritage and has received criticism that she “isn’t fully Asian”. In response to the comments, the MP is keen to highlight her mixed heritage does not make her Asian background any less “important, valuable or special.” “I identify with being an Asian woman, in the same way that I am proud to be Polish,” she said. “Some people in the Asian community wonder how Asian I feel because I’m mixed race, but I’m proud to wear my sari and embrace my heritage.” Some have even suggested that she change her forename to Rosie and take her husband’s surname to downplay her ethnicity. However, Allin-Khan is proud of her roots and is keen to emphasise it. “I went double barrelled because I didn’t want to lose the Asian part of my surname and that for me, is very important,” she said. “I am proud to say that this is who I am – a Polish and Pakistani, proudly British Muslim woman who loves the Labour party.” Born and brought up in Tooting in a working-class household, Allin-Khan described her young life as “tough”. Her mother worked three jobs to keep the family financially afloat, and Allin-Khan recalled there only being one heater in the house that they had to move from room to room to keep themselves warm. Allin-Khan failed her A-Levels, citing the difficulties at home as a factor. Despite the setbacks, she still had a desire to study medicine. However, she was told “it wasn’t for girls like (her)”, as it was financially prohibitive, and she didn’t come from the “right background”. Allin-Khan, who still works part-time as a doctor, knew she had to keep fighting if she wanted to pursue her dream career. “I think my upbringing led me to believe I had no choice but to sink or swim,” she said. After resitting her A-Levels, the then-24-year-old accepted a place to study medicine at Lucy Cavendish College, University of Cambridge, which was funded by scholarships. “I really believe that where you start off in life doesn’t need to dictate where you end up,” the A&E doctor said. Although she credited her own resilience for her success, Allin-Khan believes the Labour government gave her an opportunity to fulfil her potential when things looked bleak. “The Labour government turned my life around,” the 43-year-old claimed. “I redid my A-Levels, did a degree and went to Cambridge to study medicine and I’m afraid those possibilities aren’t going to be there for a new generation of kids under this Tory government.” Allin-Khan, the MP for Tooting since 2016, admitted the biggest challenge of her involvement in politics is racism. She often faces abuse on social media and is mostly targeted for her Muslim beliefs. “When I look at the order in which my abuse comes, it is Muslim first, then my Asian heritage comes second,” she admitted. “My gender is third. Without a doubt, the amount of abuse is a huge challenge.” It is a concern that young BAME women may be deterred from entering politics due to the abuse other politicians have faced, she said. In response, Allin-Khan regularly engages with schools and community groups to encourage young people to “keep going and not to lose faith”. There is also a level of racism in the House of Commons, she said, highlighting that she is the first Muslim person ever to make it on to the deputy leadership ballot. Although it is encouraging to see more women and ethnic minority politicians in parliament, Allin-Khan believes there is “still a ceiling on what we can achieve”. Recently, Allin-Khan approached a “prominent BAME politician” to ask them to consider nominating her in the deputy leadership contest. However, the politician responded: “I’m only in the game of backing winners and you don’t look like you’ve got any chance of winning.” “We can’t have that attitude towards people, and I’ve said in my grassroots revival plan that our BAME communities can’t be an afterthought when it comes to supporting people to hold public office,” she said. “We need to be seeing ethnic minorities at the top of our party, on the front benches. “I’ve smashed that ceiling, but I plan to throw the ladder down and say people ‘come up behind, you can do this.’ But I know it isn’t easy.” My pledge to rebuild confidence in LabourI never imagined that one day I’d become an MP, or now a candidate to become the next Deputy Leader of the Labour Party. Growing up, I was regularly told that ‘girls like me’ from ‘backgrounds like mine’ wouldn’t amount to anything. I never planned to go into politics - I always wanted to be a doctor. The last Labour Government gave me that chance, allowing me to study Medicine aged 24 after failing my A-Levels the first time around because of pressures at home. This shaped the person that I am today and has given me the fire in my belly to ensure that no other child feels that there is a ceiling on what they can achieve.\nWhen I work shifts as an A&E doctor at my local hospital, I see first-hand the issues facing our communities today. I treat young people who come to A&E after self-harming, I treat those who haven’t been able to access mental health services for years, and yes, I treat victims of violent crime. To see a young person breathe their last breath is a pain that never leaves you. Teenage boys, once full of bravado on the street, with the words “Born to die” tattooed on their chests, victims of horrific stab wounds, laying there crying out for their mothers. The sound of a parent grieving for their child is universal - it can’t be forgotten. As the MP for Tooting, I have worked incredibly closely with community groups and young people to try and tackle the rise of violent crime in our society. I’ve organised summits with representatives from local community organisations, charities, the police, the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Council and the Deputy Mayor for Policing, to start tackling this problem from a community perspective. Working with affected communities is paramount in order to resolve these critical issues once and for all. As a keen boxer myself, I have promoted the work of local boxing clubs to tackle violent crime. Boxing is far more than just a sport - for many, it’s family. Clubs offer an opportunity for local young ¬people to make friends, engage with sport and receive mentorship. So much of gang culture and violence is about a sense of belonging. We have a duty to show young people that, if you can gain respect in the ring, you do not have to get respect from violence on the street. One of the reasons I decided to run to become the next Deputy Leader of the Labour Party is because it would give me the platform to give a voice to the voiceless. Whether it’s children losing their lives to senseless violence, older people being unable to access safe and decent social care, or refugees fleeing violence and persecution, their voices must be amplified. A platform alone isn’t enough though - Labour needs to be in power to affect real change for the most vulnerable in our communities. As Deputy Leader, I will rebuild our movement into one people can vote for. A party people can trust. The door may have closed on 12 December for a generation’s hopes and ambitions, but with the right leadership team in place in the Labour Party, it will not be closed for good. We need to win the next General Election, and we must listen to our voters ahead of the Mayoral election in May. As Deputy Leader, it will be my responsibility to rebuild trust, not just with the grassroots of our party, but with voters. Together, we can take Labour forward. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is MP for Tooting and candidate for Deputy Leader of Labour When I first met Rosena, she was Labour’s candidate in the 2016 Tooting by-election.\nAs a by-election candidate myself in Heywood and Middleton in 2014, I know how difficult and uniquely pressured by-elections can be and I wanted to help Rosena win the seat after the amazing Sadiq Khan left to become London mayor. As soon as I met Rosena, I knew that Tooting would soon have another fantastic Labour MP. Her boundless energy and enthusiasm inspired her whole team. I also knew that Rosena wouldn’t be just a backbench MP but that she would bring her skills and experience to the parliamentary Labour party and she’s certainly done that in her role as shadow sports minister and with her background as a practising A&E doctor in our NHS. The choice of who to support in the deputy leadership contest has been a difficult one for me. I know all the candidates and they’re all people I am proud to call friends. But it’s Rosena who has most impressed me in this campaign and I think she has the qualities that we need in our new deputy leader. After the disastrous election result in December 2019, where I lost my seat to the Tories – the first time that they have ever taken Heywood & Middleton – Rosena was one of the first people to contact me, to commiserate but also to talk about what went wrong and how we rebuild from here. She came up to my constituency to talk with key activists about the campaign and we explored every aspect, from Brexit through to our manifesto and the Labour leadership. We talked about Heywood and Middleton being a 62% Leave voting constituency and how I had tried to represent the views of all my constituents in trying to get a deal that worked for 100%. Rosena understands the issues that we face here in the North and I know that she is going to be a great campaigning deputy leader who will reach out across the country to win back those lost Labour seats in the North, the Midlands, Scotland and Wales. I see the role of deputy leader as being a campaigner, an organiser, an advisor and also a critical friend. I think that Rosena is more than capable of doing this job, and doing it extremely well. I am wary of any offer of leader/deputy leader ‘dream tickets’ suggesting a cosy, already formed relationship. The deputy leader has to be able to stand back and assess situations critically and I know that Rosena has the independence and strength of character to do this. I know how hard Rosena has worked to become a qualified doctor, and she’s not only continued to work shifts at St George’s Hospital, keeping her grounded and in touch with our NHS but she’s also done great humanitarian work reaching out internationally. I’ll never forget her impassioned speech in parliament when she returned from the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh where she’d been providing medical care to people who have nothing – no citizenship, no home, in many cases no family and no prospect of their situation improving. Rosena has the strength, knowledge, intelligence and empathy needed to unite our party and also to take our message out to the wider public. And whoever becomes leader, she will be a unique complement to them. I’m proud to call Rosena a friend, and I’m proud to support her to be the next deputy leader of the Labour Party. Rosena Allin-Khan kicks off Labour deputy leader campaign in Putney with ‘fire in her belly’\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan launched her deputy Labour leadership campaign in Putney last night. The campaign, held in the ballroom of the Star & Garter pub, brought together an eclectic crowd, including some young first-time voters. Tooting MP Dr Allin-Khan, who is running with the slogan ‘Taking Labour Forward’, is a qualified A&E front-line doctor and has provided humanitarian aid to refugees in Syria. Describing her determination to be the next deputy leader, she said: “Expertise in building trust in communities and shared life experience has put fire in my belly to achieve for others.” She set out her ‘internationalist’ vision of Britain’s future after Brexit and brought attention to the importance of social care reform, the significance of a grassroots revival and updating technology within the Labour Party. Labour’s Putney MP Fleur Anderson said that Dr Allin-Khan would be a ‘campaigner-in-chief’ and not a ‘leader-in-waiting’ if elected as deputy leader in a PoliticsHome article last week. The Musician’s Union has given their endorsement to Dr Allin-Khan and to Sir Keir Starmer for leader. Voting takes place from February 24 to April 2 and results will be announced on the April 4. Labour needs to become a party of progressive internationalism once againLast Tuesday, a boat capsized and sank in the Bay of Bengal. There were 138 Rohingya refugees crammed on the boat, fleeing from camps in Bangladesh. At least 15 bodies were found, including four children, with 50 more missing.\nI’ve been campaigning for the rights of the Rohingya since the recent crisis unfolded in 2017. I’ve been involved in humanitarian matters long before entering politics and standing to be Labour deputy leader. Stories such as those of the Rohingya do not often have a light shined upon them here in the UK. They happen far away and it feels as if they’re outside of our control. The UK has a proud history of humanitarian assistance and we must ensure that this continues. We must never allow ourselves to turn a blind eye. Every single human life has equal value, no matter where that person was born, what language they speak or what they look like. Humanity has no borders. This isn’t just something I believe in principle — I act on it. My work as a humanitarian doctor has taken me to the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, where grieving mothers told me accounts of their babies being ripped from their arms and murdered before their eyes. The guilt of coming home to my own three- and five-year-olds left me unable to sleep at night. Why should their lives be of more value to the world than those of the Rohingya children who are slaughtered without a dignified burial? I have seen how human life is not valued equally around the world. It lit a fire in my belly to continue fighting such injustice, no matter where it takes place. At the very heart of my Labour principles is internationalism. I believe this spirit of internationalism must drive everything we do as a party. We must always stand in unwavering opposition to any effort to restrict freedoms, whether here or globally. We’ve seen where this mentality leads — whether it is the tragedy of Windrush, the cruelty of detention centres like Yarl’s Wood, or the inhumanity of a government that votes against protection for vulnerable child refugees. Now is the time for all of us who believe in progressive, internationalist values to fight back. It is our duty to ensure that the Rohingya and other victims are not forgotten by the world. One of the reasons I decided to stand to become the next deputy leader of Labour is because I believe our party has a unique chance to become a global beacon of internationalism, as it has been before. We have arguably the largest grassroots membership of any political party in Europe. If we are able to unite behind a truly internationalist vision for our party and our country, we could be a force for change on a global scale. We have a wonderful society, which has welcomed so many people from across the world, but this government’s hostile environment is diminishing hope — hope for a brighter future, hope for a tolerant society. I first entered politics in order to shed light on humanitarian efforts around the world and give a voice to the voiceless. I still believe we can, and I want to help rebuild the Labour Party so that it becomes a powerful force for good. As a party we need to rebuild trust with our communities, with the British people and the international community. Let’s do this together. Rosena Allin-Khan is Labour MP for Tooting and candidate for the deputy leadership The Musicians’ Union has nominated Keir Starmer to be the next leader of the Labour Party, and Rosena Allin-Khan to be the next deputy.\nThe party-affiliated organisation has become the fourth trade union to back Starmer, and the first to back Allin-Khan. In 2015, the union nominated Andy Burnham for leader and Caroline Flint for deputy, and in 2016 it backed leadership challenger Owen Smith. Commenting on their nomination on Twitter, the Musicians’ Union said Starmer had been “a strong supporter of musicians”. “He understands the challenges musicians working in the EU are facing and what we need to do to meet them”. The organisation also revealed in a tweet that Allin-Khan was a “former Musicians’ Union member” and said they were “proud to see her rise so far” and “to support her as she continues fighting for young people to have a free musical education.” Starmer has already secured his place on the final ballot through both the support of affiliates, including large trade union UNISON, and the backing of local Labour parties. To reach the ballot paper, each candidate must be nominated by 5% of local parties or three affiliates, two of which must be trade unions, amounting to more than 5% of the total affiliate membership. Starmer has been nominated by a total of 159 constituency parties so far, as well as UNISON, Usdaw, SERA, Community, Labour Movement for Europe, Labour Business and the Socialist Health Association. Allin-Khan has yet to secure a place on the final ballot, having so far only secured the support of 17 CLPs and the Labour Campaign for International Development. Rosena Allin-Khan is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in5/2/2020\nFleur Anderson MP: As Deputy Leader, Rosena Allin-Khan would be a campaigner-in-chief, not a leader-in-waitingRosena Allin-Khan is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in, writes Putney's new MP, Fleur Anderson.\nThe night of the General Election result was a deeply distressing moment for all of us who love the Labour Party and who love our country. It was an horrific experience to watch the door close on a whole generation as the Tories won a huge majority to continue their destructive and damaging agenda. But I was also hugely proud and honoured to produce the only Labour gain of the night, as I became the new MP for Putney. It was, I hope, a rare bright light in an otherwise long, dark night for all those Labour activists, members and volunteers who worked tirelessly during the election. Rosena’s help and support was vital to that win. She is my friend and colleague, as we were councillors together and she is the MP for the neighbouring constituency of Tooting. It’s sometimes forgotten how difficult it can be for prospective parliamentary candidates, especially ones who’ve never stood to be an MP before. Of course, it’s a huge honour to be given the chance to represent your local community, and to make their voices heard in the corridors of power – but you also have to put your life on hold for months, spending hardly any time with your friends and family, working and campaigning relentlessly, whatever the weather, rain or shine. And at the end of it all, there’s absolutely no guarantee you’ll get the job, especially in a marginal seat like Putney. It’s incredibly rewarding, but it’s hard work too. Rosena was there for me every step of the way, helping me, guiding me, giving me advice and encouragement and very practical support too. I cannot thank her enough. She is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in, and every single voter who meets her comes away with a positive impression and a smile on their face. I should know - we stood to be Councillors together in the same ward in 2014 - fighting a seat that had been Tory for 24 years - and we won, through sheer hard work and positive conversations. Rosena is a relentless optimist – she always finds the positives in every situation and she never gives up, no matter what. Her life-story is a true demonstration of our Labour values – she comes from an impoverished background, failed her A-levels first time around but persevered, and because of reforms introduced by a Labour government, she was able to study at Cambridge and become a doctor before becoming an MP - it shows the difference a Labour Government can make to the lives of people across our country. Rosena is now running to become the next Deputy Leader of Labour. There’s no doubt she’s the underdog in the race, but that’s never stopped her before, and I know it won’t stop her now. She would be a phenomenal Deputy Leader of our Party, and that’s why she’s got my total support. She’s got the most interesting and substantive ideas of any of the candidates, and she’s already published a fantastic Grassroots Revival manifesto of how the Labour Party can improve our campaigning practices to get back to winning ways ahead of the local elections in May. As Deputy Leader, she would be a campaigner-in-chief, not a leader-in-waiting. In Putney, I saw the real difference she made with her energy, her optimism and her campaigning skill. Thanks to Rosena’s help, we turned blue seats into red ones, and if she’s elected as the next Deputy Leader, we can start doing that across the whole country - at both a local and a national level. Let’s take Labour forward. Fleur Anderson is Labour MP for Putney. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

From taking care of the animals to competing in national young farmer competitions, students here are provided with the very best learning opportunities. These kids have an outlet to learn about agriculture and animals in a supportive environment. I’m so proud of the work the farm is doing, and I’m looking forward to returning to see everyone soon - especially the adorable animals. This week the Council finally listened to us! Our beloved Tooting Bec Athletics Track will be saved and get the investment it so desperately needs and deserves. To lose such a valuable asset in our community would be a devastating blow to so many of our young people. Having this track will be useful for encouraging young people to be physically active and lead a healthy lifestyle. Thank you to everyone who joined the efforts to save our track! It was an absolute pleasure to spend time at Beatrix Potter school today. The students were engaged, Year 3's cursive handwriting was impressive, and Year 6 had insightful suggestions on tackling the climate emergency. It's safe to say there were some future leaders in the room! It’s incredibly insightful to see young leaders develop and put their ideas into practice to shape the world in the future. I was truly inspired. Thank you for having me! It was an absolute pleasure to spend time at the Khalsa Centre Gurdwara here in Tooting, sharing prayers and food. It was nice to meet the Sikh community at the Gurdwara. Our community is a vibrant and multicultural place, and the diversity of our community is such a strength. Thank you so much for the warm welcome. Last week was the first time in two years, Tooting came together for the Multi-Faith Peace Ceremony. The importance of this ceremony is that leaders of the main faiths and civic leaders gather with the general public to express prayers and wishes for peace and community solidarity. Our community stood side-by-side, many faiths, all ages, and people from all walks of life who bonded over those differences. It was a real honour to be asked to speak and say a few words. Thank you.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_all_19/content_705.html": "|\nFollowing my letter to Network Rail regarding step-free access at Wandsworth Common Station, I was very pleased to receive confirmation that the station will be nominated for funding in the next round of the \"Access for All\" programme.\nThis programme has funded step-free access and other accessibility measures in stations across the country, including just down the line at Balham. This is a very encouraging first step in ensuring that public transport is available and convenient for everyone in the local community. On Eating Disorder Awareness Week, I spoke a debate in Westminster Hall on challenging the stereotypes and assumptions around eating disorders. Across the UK, there are as many as 1.25 million people living with an eating disorder. Eating disorders have considerably high mortality rates, with anorexia claiming the most lives of any mental illness. Yet, with timely and appropriate treatment, people can go on to live healthy and fulfilling lives. We need a Government that will get serious on mental health and eating disorders. Labour will put prevention and early intervention at the forefront of our approach to mental health. We will place a mental health specialist in every school and place an open access hub for young people in every single community. The story of a Ukrainian family who wants to come to live in Furzedown recently made national news! Oksana and her young son Dmytro have a sponsor ready and willing to welcome them into their home in the local area, however Home Office delays have stopped them travelling to safety in the United Kingdom.\nIt is inspiring and heartwarming to see the generosity shown by the British public in welcoming Ukrainian refugees into their lives, however Oksana and Dmytro have been let down badly by the Home Office. They applied to come to the UK in September last year and, so far, the Home Office have refused to provide a timeframe for a decision to both myself and their sponsor's solicitors. This is simply not good enough and the Government must get a grip. Our latest research, shows that in 2021/22, the total number of days lost to poor mental health has doubled to more than 730,000 over the last decade. This comes at the same time that there has been a drop in the number of neighbourhood police officers by 6,000 and of Police Community Support Officers by 8,500.\nThese absences equate to over 2,000 police officers being off sick each day, last year alone, due to poor mental health. It is clear that this Conservative Government has presided over 13 years of neglect and staff shortages that have left our public services at breaking point. The next Labour Government will recruit 8,500 more mental health professionals, ensuring a million more patients get treated each year; and we will rebuild neighbourhood policing, delivering a package of 13,000 extra neighbourhood officers and PCSOs, putting police back on the beat. Read the full story here My thoughts and prayers went out to everyone affected by the recent tragic earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. I was very proud to see that Tooting Islamic Centre raised £16,000 for the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal for relief funds.\nIt is always incredibly touching to see the love, generosity and kindness demonstrated by our fantastic community - thank you to all those that donated and to Arshad Daud, imam at TIC, for all his hard work. Donations can still be made here Our exclusive data reveals that children in a mental health crisis spent more than 900,000 hours in A&E in England, last year. The total delays across England, in the past year alone, equate to 103 years of waiting time. This is a huge rise, up four-fold in the last decade.\nThe figures, made public through Freedom of Information requests, show the staggering number of hours that children have spent in a mental health crisis in Emergency Departments. With nowhere to turn, children with a mental illness are left to deteriorate – at which time A&E is the only place left for them to go. Emergency Departments are incredibly unsuitable settings for children in crisis, yet we’re witnessing increasingly younger children having to present to A&E in desperation. The next Labour Government will prioritise a truly preventative plan for mental health services and will put patient care first. We will ensure access to mental health professionals in every school and put an open access hub in every community, in addition to guaranteeing mental health treatment within a month for all who need it, by recruiting 8,500 new mental health staff to treat a million additional patients a year by Labour’s first term in office., funded by closing tax loopholes. Read the full article here For Children's Mental Health Week, I've written for LabourList about Labour's bold, transformative plan to deliver mental health care for children and young people. With children waiting days in A&E in a mental health crisis and more than one million people being turned away from mental health services without being seen, it is vital that we transform care by putting prevention at the heart of our plan.\nThis Government should not cut corners when it comes to young people’s mental health. Good mental health starts in childhood. Labour’s vision for future generations is one where mental health conditions are treated early. Adverse childhood experiences are the greatest driver of mental illness in adulthood – it’s just common sense to get mental health treatment right for young people in order to transform the future of the country’s mental health. The next Labour Government will ensure access to a mental health professional in every school, and we will put an open access mental health hub in every community. Every child should have the ability to raise concerns about their mental health with someone they trust, in an environment in which they feel safe. All of this will be funded by ending tax breaks for private schools. Read my full article here Last week, I asked the Government how many enquiries to the Home Office from MPs are outstanding and how many older than six months are awaiting a reply.\nIt was incredibly disheartening, although not surprising, to learn that over 10,000 case enquiries have not been answered by the Home Office with nearly 1,000 of those waiting longer than six months. These enquiries cover urgent and compassionate cases and it is simply unacceptable that the Government have allowed such a huge backlog to accumulate. These are people’s lives, with their family lives and jobs often dependent on Home Office decisions – the Government simply has to get a grip. To see these questions, follow the links here and here. Following reports from local residents of increased levels of speeding on Blackshaw Road, I am pleased that the police agreed to my suggestion of increased speed watches around the local area. Given that there is a nursery and St George's Hospital along this road, it is vital that speed levels are stringently enforced to ensure everyone's safety.\nI will continue to work with the police, Wandsworth Council and local councillors to keep our streets safe and accessible. To this end, I am very pleased to hear that the council is currently considering implementing a zebra crossing outside the nursery to protect both children and parents. Today, I have written to the Managing Director of the Southern Region of Network Rail calling for an investigation looking into improving accessibility and step-free access at Wandsworth Common Station.\nCurrently, there is step free access on Platform 1, but those wishing to travel on Platform 2 must cross an elevated footbridge, which is not accessible for wheelchair users, parents with young children, and the elderly. I have called for a feasibility study to be conducted, given the signifcant proportion of the local community that falls around the station.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_liz-mcinnes-why-im-backing-rosena-allin-khan-for-deputy-leader/content_202.html": "|\nWhen I first met Rosena, she was Labour’s candidate in the 2016 Tooting by-election.\nAs a by-election candidate myself in Heywood and Middleton in 2014, I know how difficult and uniquely pressured by-elections can be and I wanted to help Rosena win the seat after the amazing Sadiq Khan left to become London mayor. As soon as I met Rosena, I knew that Tooting would soon have another fantastic Labour MP. Her boundless energy and enthusiasm inspired her whole team. I also knew that Rosena wouldn’t be just a backbench MP but that she would bring her skills and experience to the parliamentary Labour party and she’s certainly done that in her role as shadow sports minister and with her background as a practising A&E doctor in our NHS. The choice of who to support in the deputy leadership contest has been a difficult one for me. I know all the candidates and they’re all people I am proud to call friends. But it’s Rosena who has most impressed me in this campaign and I think she has the qualities that we need in our new deputy leader. After the disastrous election result in December 2019, where I lost my seat to the Tories – the first time that they have ever taken Heywood & Middleton – Rosena was one of the first people to contact me, to commiserate but also to talk about what went wrong and how we rebuild from here. She came up to my constituency to talk with key activists about the campaign and we explored every aspect, from Brexit through to our manifesto and the Labour leadership. We talked about Heywood and Middleton being a 62% Leave voting constituency and how I had tried to represent the views of all my constituents in trying to get a deal that worked for 100%. Rosena understands the issues that we face here in the North and I know that she is going to be a great campaigning deputy leader who will reach out across the country to win back those lost Labour seats in the North, the Midlands, Scotland and Wales. I see the role of deputy leader as being a campaigner, an organiser, an advisor and also a critical friend. I think that Rosena is more than capable of doing this job, and doing it extremely well. I am wary of any offer of leader/deputy leader ‘dream tickets’ suggesting a cosy, already formed relationship. The deputy leader has to be able to stand back and assess situations critically and I know that Rosena has the independence and strength of character to do this. I know how hard Rosena has worked to become a qualified doctor, and she’s not only continued to work shifts at St George’s Hospital, keeping her grounded and in touch with our NHS but she’s also done great humanitarian work reaching out internationally. I’ll never forget her impassioned speech in parliament when she returned from the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh where she’d been providing medical care to people who have nothing – no citizenship, no home, in many cases no family and no prospect of their situation improving. Rosena has the strength, knowledge, intelligence and empathy needed to unite our party and also to take our message out to the wider public. And whoever becomes leader, she will be a unique complement to them. I’m proud to call Rosena a friend, and I’m proud to support her to be the next deputy leader of the Labour Party.

We discussed local crime concerns, updated residents on local safety initiatives, and learned new ways to keep our homes safe. A big thank you to all who joined - the community feeling is strong. Additionally, it was great to hear from local residents about how we can make our area safer & about our success of the #SafeSpace campaign. Finally, we discussed future plans to tackle violence against women and girls. It was great to be joined by Lord Wajid Khan at Rutherford House School. We met with the school's Pupil Leaders who had some insightful questions about our work in Parliament, and also taught us about their values of resilience and respect. What a credit to the next generation! So glad that I was able to attend this event with Lord Khan. I was honoured to give a sermon at St. John the Divine Church today on racial justice - talking about me work in Calais and how we can all work against racism in our community. We all must stand together for racial justice! Thank you to the whole church community for the warm welcome. I’m officially in the Christmas spirit! It was such a pleasure to open the Christmas fair at Penwortham, and hear the school choir perform together after two years! Lots of Christmas cheer and great stalls. I wanted to congratulate the Penwortham choir on their legendary performance. Thank you for the opportunity to attend! Today is Small Business Saturday and it is important to me to understand what it's like to run a local business, and the challenges and successes that people in our local community experience. So I rolled up my sleeves and got stuck into a shift at Tooting's famous flower stall with local legend Chris. Chris was absolutely wonderful! Thank you for teaching me a few things about the flower industry! I’m looking forward to learning more. Tom's Farm at Nightingale Academy is truly special. From taking care of the animals to competing in national young farmer competitions, students here are provided with the very best learning opportunities. These kids have an outlet to learn about agriculture and animals in a supportive environment. I’m so proud of the work the farm is doing, and I’m looking forward to returning to see everyone soon - especially the adorable animals. This week the Council finally listened to us! Our beloved Tooting Bec Athletics Track will be saved and get the investment it so desperately needs and deserves. To lose such a valuable asset in our community would be a devastating blow to so many of our young people. Having this track will be useful for encouraging young people to be physically active and lead a healthy lifestyle. Thank you to everyone who joined the efforts to save our track! It was an absolute pleasure to spend time at Beatrix Potter school today. The students were engaged, Year 3's cursive handwriting was impressive, and Year 6 had insightful suggestions on tackling the climate emergency. It's safe to say there were some future leaders in the room! It’s incredibly insightful to see young leaders develop and put their ideas into practice to shape the world in the future. I was truly inspired. Thank you for having me! It was an absolute pleasure to spend time at the Khalsa Centre Gurdwara here in Tooting, sharing prayers and food. It was nice to meet the Sikh community at the Gurdwara. Our community is a vibrant and multicultural place, and the diversity of our community is such a strength. Thank you so much for the warm welcome. Last week was the first time in two years, Tooting came together for the Multi-Faith Peace Ceremony. The importance of this ceremony is that leaders of the main faiths and civic leaders gather with the general public to express prayers and wishes for peace and community solidarity. Our community stood side-by-side, many faiths, all ages, and people from all walks of life who bonded over those differences. It was a real honour to be asked to speak and say a few words. Thank you. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_archives_10-2022/content_24.html": "|\nThere were so many fantastic events across Tooting to celebrate Black History Month, which is celebrated in October.\nIt was great to see Wandsworth Council celebrate the contributions of black business owners, and other influential members of the blakc community make to our borough. Many of our local libraries were host to brilliant events where black authors could share their stories with the community. A series of videos published online celebrated the brilliant contributions to local creative industries. I know that many residents particularly enjoyed the pop up street food event celebrating some of the best cuisine from across Africa and the Caribbean. My personal highlight was attending the Roots and Culture event in Tooting, where dancers, musicians, poetry, comedy, and fantastic street food stalls showed some of the best of African and Caribbean culture. It was great to see how well attended all these events were, and great to see our community coming together to celebrate the cultures of the black communities here in Tooting. Thank you to everyone who attended and helped to organise these events! I was deeply concerned to hear pupils at Graveney School in Tooting were being targeted in a recent spate of muggings. I have been in touch with local police leadership to insist on swift action to address this issue. I know that the police are actively working to identify and arrest those responsible.\nEvery child deserves to walk our streets without fear. I am therefore pleased to hear that the local police force are carrying out high visibility patrols and are carrying out regular weapon sweeps around the school. Police are also patrolling the area in unmarked cars to try and identify and arrest the suspects. Pupils at Graveney School have also received assemblies on how to keep safe and how to report a street crime. The local police have also liaised with local CCTV to ensure appropriate coverage. It is vital that all of these issues are reported to the police so they can bring these worrying incidents to an end as quickly as possible. Anyone who has been a victim of a street robbery in this area who is yet to report the incident to the police are advised to do so. Please be assured, I will continue to work with our local police team to resolve this issue as quickly as possible, and I will continue to follow this case as a matter of urgency. There is a crisis in our universities up and down the country, with record numbers of students now seeking mental health support, according to our latest research. Through Freedom of Information requests, we found that over 200,000 students sought support for their mental health across the UK in 2020-2021 – a threefold increase, since 2010. The lack of mental health support for our young people is not only affecting their health, but it also having a knock-on impact on their future prospects.\nUniversities are struggling to cope with the rising demand for access to the mental health treatment students need. Every five days, a student takes their own life. That is why Labour has put forward a comprehensive plan, that will put prevention of the heart of mental health services. Under Labour’s plan, we will recruit 8,500 new mental health professionals by the end of our first term in office, to see an addition one million patients per year. See more about the crisis in mental health at universities, here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1579388728153604098?s=20&t=CcG6Wxm1iHr6xo0Cfsjyww Working with the MP for Bury South, we brought an Urgent Question to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care demanding a statement in response to BBC Panorama’s alarming reports of abuse, excessive restraint, segregation and seclusion at the Edenfield Centre in Prestwich. The episode aired on BBC over two weeks ago yet there has not been a single statement or response from the Secretary of State.\nToday in Parliament, I demanded that the Secretary of State provide patients, and their families, the much-needed answers they deserve into these alarming allegations. I also challenged the Secretary of State on this Government’s commitment to reducing the need for restraint and restrictive intervention as it had pledged to do in 2019. See my statement in Parliament here https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1580509847417917440?s=20&t=Gj2YhL3GB3Os4nSrRoGK7Q Parents arriving in A&E with ashen faces holding their children, whose bodies are skeletal and covered in cuts. Families are on suicide watch. Frontline NHS workers are at breaking point. This is the reality of Tory Britain in 2022.\nOur latest research has shown that more than a million patients referred to mental health services were turned away over the last 12 months, whilst the cost of mental illness to the British economy is £117 billion a year. This is the direct result of 12 years of Conservative mismanagement of our economy and public services. We need a growing economy to pay for modern, preventative sustainable healthcare, but we can only do this with a Labour Government that will put our public services back on track. The next Labour Government will transform our mental health services: new staff, new services, faster treatment, and prevention as our watchword. Better mental health for all. Read my latest piece in the Daily Mirror here. https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1579113927438663681?s=20&t=FTZA6bYs6BUjLJ-vVYAmzg The Prime Minister has been forced to abandon her unfunded tax cut for the 1% of highest earners.\nThis Government U-turn is too late for the families who will pay higher mortgages for years to come. It will also do nothing to help or to reassure the people in Tooting and beyond. The Tories have destroyed their economic credibility and damaged trust in the British economy. Twelve years of Tory government have left the economy in chaos, and the new Prime Minister continues to make it up as she goes along. Today’s U-turn does not mark a move away from disastrous Tory economics, it’s just some districation. The Government needs to reverse their trickle down strategy. It just doesn’t work. Instead, they need to offer a programme of measures that will offer real support to those struggling with rises in food and energy bills, and increases in rent and mortgage payments. Too many people will struggle to pay their bills and put food on the table this winter, and the Government must step in now. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

We first visited the Glossop Arts Project to see the amazing work they do, using art to support young people's mental health - of course, we had to indulge in the offer of a free toastie and cuppa too!\nOn the doorstep afterwards, we spoke to so many people fed up with the Tories, both locally and in Westminster. There are council elections coming up in May and Labour has every chance to take full control of the council here! The views were incredible, the people lovely, and I can't wait to be back! Fresh off the back of our trip to South Wales yesterday, Luke Pollard MP and I continued to take the fight to the Tories today, this time in Reading.\nWe kicked off the day with a doorknocking session in Reading West, another Tory-held marginal seat where it is essential Labour wins at the next general election. We were delighted to be joined by my colleague, Matt Rodda, MP for Reading East, who took us to a community-run cafe to show the empowering work that local people are doing on a daily basis. Reading is a great example of what Labour can do in power - the town's carbon emissions have been reduced by 70% in the last 12 years and the Council is currently investing £88 million in over 300 new social housing homes across Reading. Today, my friend Luke Pollard MP and I visited the lush landscape of South Wales in order to continue our fight to put Keir Starmer in 10 Downing Street.\nWe visited Barry Island (cue many Gavin and Stacey references!) in the Vale of Glamorgan seat and Chepstow in Monmouth - two vitally important areas that Labour needs to win to form a government. Labour took control of both Vale of Glamorgan & Monmouthshire Councils after the May elections and I greatly enjoyed campaigning with local members, building on that momentum in order to elect two new Labour MPs at the next election. Of course, a trip to Barry Island would not be complete without a wander down the beautiful seafront, complete with ice cream. Lloniannau!\nTooting Bec Athletics Track reopened this summer after a successful community campaign against its closure. It was great to be at their official reopening along with local Councillor Judi Gasser.\nIt was great to meet some young athletes and see the wide range of facilities that they offer, including a seven-a-side football pitch, an eight lane track, and a state of the art fitness centre. I am so grateful we have this brilliant resource on our doorstep in Tooting. The fantastic facilities at Tooting Bec Athletics Track will be vital in helping Tooting’s children become the Olympians of tomorrow. I have no doubt that future Team GB medalists are already training here and I look forward to seeing what they all go on to achieve.\nToday, I spoke with GMB and Royal College of Nursing frontline NHS staff at St George’s Hospital to hear their views on the Government’s latest pay offer. The last 18 months has impacted our beloved NHS immeasurably, and staff have made significant sacrifices in order to save lives. I stand in solidarity with my NHS colleagues. They deserve far more than just claps. They need a proper pay rise. It was a pleasure to get out on the doorstep with our Greater London Authority candidate for South London, Candice Atterton, today! Alongside Candice and Ruth Cadbury MP for Brentford and Isleworth, it was a privilege to visit Hounslow Youth Counselling Service. The post-pandemic recovery must have young people at its heart, so it was fantastic to spend the morning hearing about the great work taking place in Hounslow to support and champion young people’s mental health. With her background in youth work and youth justice, Candice is determined to focus on support and opportunities for young people. I have no doubt that she will be a great addition to Mayor Sadiq Khan’s Labour Team in City Hall! Today, Trans Visibility Day, is a day that we celebrate each trans and nonbinary person, whether you choose to be visible or not, and reaffirm our commitment to stand against discrimination, bigotry and all forms of trans exclusionary behaviour.\nWhen wider society discusses trans issues, too often trans people have to deal with vitriolic and discriminatory language which has a profound impact on wellbeing. In October 2020, I organised and chaired a roundtable with leading trans charities to discuss mental health, discrimination, and how we can work together to tackle it. I will always be an ally of the trans community. As MP for Tooting and Shadow Minister for Mental Health, I want to be a voice for everyone - including the LGBTQ+ community - and I will continue to uphold LGBT+ Labour’s 10 pledges, which I signed up to during the 2020 Labour leadership race, outlined below. The MP for Tooting has been working in her local hospital where doctors and nurses are already dealing with cases of covid-19. She warns that many of those being treated are in their 30s and 40s.\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan is the MP for Tooting but she is also a practising doctor in A&E. She regularly goes in to do shifts in her local hospital St George's and has been in contact with her colleagues. This Sunday she took a record down for Mirror readers about the situation faced by nurses, doctors and others on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus. She said her latest shift had been a \"deeply, deeply eye-opening\" experience with previously fit and healthy people in their 30s and 40s \"attached to machines, fighting for their lives\". And she has been deeply critical of the approach taken by the government in tackling the spread of the deadly virus. \"The Prime Minister has been blase about this from the start, waiting for others to make decisions so he doesn't have to. It is costing lives,\" she said. Mirror Diary - Sunday 22 March6.30am – Leaving the HouseOn the way to work in A&E, to help out the real heroes of the frontline – the NHS staff who work day-in, day-out to keep us all safe. I am a bit apprehensive after seeing the stories that are being reported about Covid-19 and having spoken to colleagues across the country, but we need to come together at times like these for our communities. 7am – Reporting for DutyJust finished handover, which is when the day shift gets given notes on the patients who have come in overnight. There’s a very real sense that the number of cases are growing extremely quickly, something that will present a real challenge in the coming days and weeks. Some of the sickest patients that have been admitted have been young – they’re in their 30s and 40s, previously fit and well, but now fighting for their lives in Intensive Care (ICU). There was a lot of talk in January that this was a virus just like the flu that only affects older people – that simply isn’t the case. There’s a real sense of apprehension ahead of the shift – we’re all expecting a rocky road ahead in the coming days. 8am- Protective EquipmentThe first part of the shift was spent looking for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – these are masks and aprons that keep those working on the frontlines safe. While we’d all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. Frontline staff across the country are scared. We’re scared that we’re going to lose patients – we have spent years training to save every life that we can. We are scared of passing this deadly virus onto our loved ones because we don’t always have the PPE that we so desperately need. We’re scared that that if we aren’t properly protected, that we run the risk of spreading the virus between patients. It’s vital that people practice social distancing measures properly – crowded areas will only add to the number of cases, and the number of people being admitted into hospitals across the country. In the coming days and weeks, difficult decisions will be made by my colleagues in ICU about who gets a ventilator – it’s that serious. Midday – Resus overwhelmedThe whole of resus is full of patients with respiratory problems – this is the part of A&E where the sickest patients go. Patients are arriving breathless, with crackles so fine in their lungs, you can hardly hear them. Their X-rays show white lungs where normally, they would look clear and black, full of air. Major trauma, such as heart attacks and victims of car crashes, are now being moved into paediatric A&E. The situation around Covid-19 is clearly getting worse by the day. The talk amongst the team is that we feel that we will be overwhelmed in the coming days. I’m going for a refresher course on ventilators for staff – they’re also training new staff on how to use ventilators. The talk is, of course, feeling quite bleak as the day goes on – but this is what we’ve all been trained for. 4pm – Leaving A&EJust leaving A&E now – it’s been a difficult shift and a difficult Mother’s Day. At times like these, we must think about our loved ones - if we want to protect those dearest to us, we must stay indoors. I’ve just called my husband and asked him to let our daughters know that they won’t be able to cuddle me and give me their handmade presents when I get home. Instead, I’ll be getting straight in the shower and throwing my clothes in the washing machine – it is our duty to protect the ones we love. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can, and we will, save lives. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

The Committee published our report on the ongoing crisis. You can read more about it here\nWhen I look at myself in the mirror, I want to be proud of the person looking back. We have a moral responsibility to stop more innocent people being killed. That is why I am voting for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. See my speech in full here: Statement on the International Court of Justice interim judgement on situation in Israel and Gaza26/1/2024\nChildren eating weeds, 1000 children already losing their legs and enduring amputations without anaesthesia. This is the daily living hell for the children of Gaza.\nToday in Prime Minister Questions, I implored the Prime Minister to act to end this bloodshed.\nToday, I asked Dr Ghada Al Jabda, Chief of Health in Gaza for UNRWA about the dire situation facing hospitals in Gaza.\nAccording to the latest reports, 64% of hospitals in Gaza are non-operational and many are struggling to provide effective care.\nIn Parliament, I renewed my calls to the Foreign Secretary for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nPalestinian parents in Gaza love their children as much as we love ours, but theirs are buried under rubble. Millions are facing starvation. How many more need to die before the Government call for a ceasefire?\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_balham_4/content_538.html": "|\nThe Local Elections are hastily approaching on 5th May. After 44 long years of Tory rule, Wandsworth needs a breath of fresh air and a Labour council.\nOver the next four weeks, I will be out on the campaign trail - knocking on doors, delivering leaflets and working to help our fantastic Labour candidates. I would like to thank all the local residents for their support and warm welcome on the doorstep. Together we can turn Labour red this May!\nBalham has a long and proud history, and its architecture is of real importance to the local community; and Balham Railway Bridge is a prominent and important feature of this historical architecture. Unfortunately in recent years, the bridge’s grandeur has sadly faded beyond all recognition. I recently spoke with the local community group Beautify Balham who have made suggestions, such as painting the bridge an attractive colour, re-painting the metal columns, and installing up-lighting to showcase the bridge. I am wholly supportive of these suggestions. As such, I wrote to Network Rail, asking them to consider incorporating these simple yet impactful improvements as part of the £2.6 million investment they have committed to restore Balham Station. Swift action was taken and I was delighted to hear that the Bridge has had its first coat of paint! It has been a pleasure to support the wonderful Beautify Balham volunteers with this campaign and I would like to especially thank Councillor Clare Fraser, who works so hard to support local residents. I was deeply concerned - as I know many local residents were - to hear of plans to close Balham station to outward passengers from next Monday until December 2021. While I recognise the scheduled repairs to the escalator are essential works, it is important to me that residents are not inconvenienced by the planned updates. Indeed, I also appreciate that it was alarming for many to learn that the closure was to begin in less than a week, lasting for such an extended period of time. It is my understanding that the decision to close Balham station to outward travelling passengers was taken after a trial closure of the downward escalator indicated that use of the staircase at peak travel times was resulting in over-crowding and therefore social distancing was difficult. I called a meeting with Transport for London to outline my concerns and discuss alternatives, such as more staff at the station to support social distancing at peak travel times. I am pleased to announce that as a result of this meeting, TfL have agreed to undertake a week-long trial at Balham Station, which will see the staircase open for use throughout the day and outward travel therefore possible from the station. The trial will commence on Monday 28th June and last 3-4 days. Following the trial, TfL will assess whether outward travel from Balham during the planned escalator repairs is viable. During this time - and beyond should the trial prove successful - I would recommend additional time is allowed for travel through Balham Station. By doing so, we increase the likelihood of a successful trial. More importantly, we can all play our part to ensure all residents can travel safely. Please check back for further updates on this situation. Today Muslims across the UK and around the world mark the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan. As a proud Muslim, the period of reflection, prayer, and fasting is incredibly important to our Muslim community. Traditionally, Ramadan is a time for gathering and sharing Iftar with family and friends. Although, like last year, we are unable to come together and celebrate as we normally would, the spirit of Ramadan remains. To every Muslim nurse and doctor who have saved countless lives throughout this pandemic, to every volunteer and community leader in our Mosques and community centres who continue to support those most vulnerable, and to every Muslim in Tooting and across the country, I wish you all Ramadan Mubarak. Many local residents have shared with me their concerns about pickpocketing in the Balham area.\nI have met with Wandsworth Police about this issue, who I know are working hard to ensure that our streets are safe. I have been assured that the police have now increased foot patrols around identified hotspots, in order to identify suspects and to tackle these worrying crimes. Unfortunately, although these crimes are reported on social media, very few of these are reported directly to the police. In order that the police can act on crime, it is vital that any offences are reported as soon as it is possible to do so, either via 999 or 101. This will help the police identify where to direct resources and provide the best opportunity to apprehend those responsible. Stay safe. Last week the Balham and Tooting Community Association (BATCA) celebrated its 15th anniversary.\nBATCA is a network of diverse individuals and organisations committed to creating a cohesive, thriving community in Balham and Tooting. Their annual events – the Fun Day on Broadwater Road, the Tooting Broadway Peace Ceremony, and the Community Heroes Awards – are local institutions. BATCA have continued their good works throughout the pandemic, moving events online and acting as a platform for groups to share news and information. BATCA are always looking to welcome new members to help them further the organisation’s aims. Click here to find out more, and to join this wonderful collective. As you will know, a South African variant of Covid-19 has arrived in the UK. This new Covid variant has now been detected in CR4 (Merton). Residents in CR4 are no different to us in neighbouring Tooting (SW16 and SW17). We use the same shops, the same hospital, and the same parks, so if it’s there, it could very easily be here. This will be the same across all affected areas. As a matter of urgency, the Government needs to launch widespread testing in neighbouring postcodes. This is the only way to see how widespread these new variants are. I have written to the Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock MP, the Director of Public Health at Wandsworth Council, Shannon Katiyo, and the Chief Executive of Wandsworth Council, Paul Martin, to ask about plans to launch testing in neighbouring postcodes. While I press for action on this, we need to make sure we’re all doing everything we can to keep ourselves and each other safe. It’s absolutely vital that we minimise our social contact to prevent the spread of this new variant within our community. Please think twice before leaving home, and when you do leave, please continue to adhere to social distancing. Together, we will get through this. In light of the upcoming Fire Safety Bill, I would to thank every resident who has written to me with their concerns on this and for continuing to keep me updated on the cladding issues affecting their property. I recognise what an exceptionally difficult time this is and appreciate how much anxiety the cladding proposals are causing to many leaseholders.\nOn more than fifteen occasions, Ministers promised that leaseholders would not be landed with the costs of remedial works. Yet, people are still being put at risk, trapped in flammable buildings for a third lockdown, with leaseholders placed in an impossible position and promises broken. It is evident that the Government’s handling of the cladding crisis has lacked any sense of grip or urgency. For this reason, the Labour Party have tabled an Opposition Day Debate on cladding for Monday, which will subsequently bring forward a vote that will call for leaseholders to be protected from the costs of remediating their blocks with dangerous cladding. The party will also be tabling a number of amendments to the Fire Safety Bill that will aim to protect leaseholders from unfair costs through the power of the law. I am aware that many residents have been in touch to request that I support the McPartland and Smith amendment, which provides welcome clarity on the specific costs that would be prevented from being passed on to leaseholders. Labour has sought to go further on this. As currently drafted, the McPartland and Smith amendment would not have covered blocks like Grenfell - where flammable cladding has been added at some stage following the building of the block. It only applies to defects in the original design of buildings. The Labour Party’s amendment would ensure that the cost of fire safety problems from refurbishment jobs, like the cladding on Grenfell Tower, cannot be passed on to leaseholders. Labour’s amendments also include new clauses so that the Bill protects leaseholders from the day it comes into law, instead of an unknown date in the future. I would like to thank my colleagues in the Labour Party, Sarah Jones MP, Nick Thomas-Symonds MP, Thangam Debbonaire MP and Mike Amesbury MP for their hard work and commitment to addressing this large injustice on a national scale. If any residents have any further queries on this issue, please do not hesitate to get in touch to discuss this further. In the meantime, I hope this post assures you of the steps myself and the Labour Party are taking to protect tenants and leaseholders during this cladding crisis. I am aware that many local residents are concerned about the proposed Tooting Triangle development. Plans to upgrade the site’s facilities and amenities – replacing the artificial football pitch with a modern surface, and building new changing rooms, public toilets, a children’s play area, and a café – are welcome. However, the proposal to fund the improvements via a 25-year lease of the new facilities to TFL Leisure – a private company – is more controversial.\nThe fence set to be constructed around the new football pitch, and the lack of clarity as to whether the upgraded children’s Stay & Play facility will remain free to use, have prompted concerns that the development will put public land behind a literal paywall. I am sure you will agree that if the recent lockdowns have taught us anything, it is that there is a need for more publicly accessible green spaces – not less. As it stands, the proposed development would see a reduction in the area available to the Balham Boxing Club compared with their current provision. Issues have also been raised regarding the smaller size of the female changing rooms compared to the men's, and the impact floodlighting could have on the Triangle’s resident bat population, among other things. I understand that discussions on the proposed development are ongoing. Please be assured that I am keeping a close eye on this evolving situation - we all want what's best for our local community. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_free-school-meals/content_424.html": "|\nAs 2024 draws to a close, I wanted to take this opportunity to look back on the events of the past year. It has been a year of change and renewal - full of ups and downs - but as I enter into my ninth year as your Member of Parliament for Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting, it remains the greatest honour of my life to represent the community in which I was born and raised. Entering the new year, I would like to pay tribute to the incredible frontline workers working around the clock to keep the country going through the festive period. From our NHS services to local hospitality staff to food bank volunteers - you all have my heartfelt gratitude for your tireless work this Christmas and throughout the year. A year for democracyWhat a year it has been for elections, both locally and across the country. We began the year with a fantastic win in the Tooting Broadway by-election, increasing the Labour vote share by nearly 7% to a whopping 58% majority. Then came the Mayoral elections in May, when we kept London red by electing my Tooting predecessor Sadiq Khan to a historic third term as Mayor of London. Finally - and most importantly - we finally elected a new Labour Government after 14 long years, with areas up and down the country voting Labour for the very first time. It was humbling to receive the most votes of any Labour MP and thanks must go to everyone who voted for me - your support means the world. £100m to fix Wandsworth PrisonAfter years of campaigning - and countless stories of mismanagement and scandal - the Ministry of Justice announced a £100 million funding package for HMP Wandsworth. This will go a long way to reduce the impact of overcrowding, repair crumbling cell blocks and facilities, and ensure that prison guards can work in a safe environment. Delivering for everyone in TootingThousands of local people have contacted me this year regarding a variety of issues, I have dealt with 15,000 cases. I reclaimed tens of thousands in unpaid pensions or benefits for local people, got decisions on hundreds of delayed passport or visa applications, and helped countless local residents get repairs to their homes. My door is always open and please get in touch if there is anything I can help with. On the NHS frontline\nSpeaking up for Gaza It has now been over a year since the horrific 7th October attacks and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza. The humanitarian disaster we have seen unfold there in the time since, has been truly heartwrenching. This year, I've raised the issue numerous times in Parliament, visited the region in the spring, and held evidence sessions with humanitarian experts. Revitalising Tooting town centre\nThis Morning and Loose Women Using my background as an NHS doctor, I have enjoyed trying my hand at being a TV medic this year! The lovely people at This Morning and Loose Women have had me on many times to talk about a range of topics from mental health to medical emergencies and even gave me space to open up about my own childhood challenges with speech, in a bid to end stigma and help others. Work in Parliament\nKeeping our streets safe in 2024, I successfully campaigned for a tripling of the Tooting neighbourhood policing team, putting more bobbies on our streets. In the summer, Operation Kenny run by the Metropolitan Police resulted in a 70% reduction in crime in Tooting town centre. This work will continue with the new Government's plans to recruit 13,000 new officers and return policing to communities. Cleaning up the local area I have never stopped campaigning for cleaner streets. This year saw a 15% reduction in fly-tipping in Wandsworth, with thousands of fines issued to people dumping their bulky rubbish on our streets. Meanwhile, Wandsworth Labour introduced food recycling for the first time ever in the borough. Free School Meals roll-out\nMental health reform Mental health is incredibly important to me and, for far too long, much-needed reforms were swept under the rug by a Conservative Government that simply wasn't interested. After much hard work, it was fantastic to see reform of the Mental Health Act announced in the King's Speech in July - this was long overdue.\nVisiting Earlsfield Primary, I saw first-hand how universal free school meals are working to produce a level playing field in schools and provide all children with a delicious and nutritious lunch.\nLunch should never be a struggle for families or a time of stress and stigma for children – and Labour Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan’s funding means it won’t be here in London. The verdict from the judges that matter: the Red Velvet cake with beetroot was a hit.\nIt is incredible to see the work being done in Wandsworth Town Hall by the new Labour council. Recently, it was announced that free school meals would be available during school holidays for eligible children, while parents of pupils on free school meals will also have access to uniform vouchers to help cover this expense. With the Tory cost-of-living crisis, this is a hugely beneficial scheme for hard-working families across the borough.\nThis is the difference that Labour makes in power and I look forward to continued close cooperation with the new council administration in order to make our communities even better places to live.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_labours-pro-eu-choice-for-deputy-leader/content_181.html": "|\nFormer Labour MEP SEB DANCE explains why he is supporting Rosena Allin-Khan in the Labour deputy leadership race.\nBritain has left the EU. As a former Labour Member of the European Parliament, as a Remainer, and as a proud pro-European, that’s still not an easy thing for me to say – but it’s the reality. There is no longer a campaign to remain. That doesn’t mean that Boris Johnson’s famous lie of “get Brexit done” has suddenly come true. The ongoing negotiations with the EU will continue to define our country’s future for years to come. Perhaps one day the fight to join the EU will come. How soon that time comes depends on what we do next. Pro-Europeans must now fight for a close relationship between the UK and our friends in the EU and ongoing rights for UK citizens. The Labour Party must play a crucial role in that fight. That’s why I’m supporting Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan to become the next deputy leader of Labour. Rosena was elected as the MP for Tooting the week before the EU referendum in 2016. Despite holding a shadow frontbench position, she refused to compromise on her principles or on the promises she’d made to her community, so she broke the whip and voted against triggering Article 50. Considering the shambles that followed Theresa May’s early triggering of Article 50, this has been conclusively demonstrated as the right decision. Rosena was also the first shadow frontbench minister to come out publicly and call for a People’s Vote. This was an incredibly brave thing to do, at a time when Labour MPs and shadow ministers were being pressured not to speak out against the leadership’s position on Brexit. At a time when the leadership of Labour needed a firm push in the right direction, Rosena was the one brave enough to stand up and do it. There are some voices in the Labour Party, who’ll try to convince you that Brexit was the only reason for Labour’s failure at the last general election – that backing a public vote cost us seats in the so-called ‘Red Wall’. But this analysis is deeply misleading, and is simply not supported by the facts. Yes, of course Brexit was a divisive issue, for Labour as much as for anyone else. The reality however, is that the overwhelming majority of Labour voters, members and supporters voted Remain, wanted us to stay in the EU and wanted a public vote on Brexit. That fact is as true of Labour voters in Redcar, Grimsby or Wakefield as it is of Labour voters in Oxford, Islington or Bristol – Labour’s share of the vote went down in 98% of all seats. Labour’s position on Brexit was fatally undermined not because supporting a public vote was the wrong position for our voters, but because the leadership of the party took so long to get to that position. We sat in the middle of the road on the biggest issue of our time and neither side trusted us. We lost trust among all our communities. Rosena knows this – she won’t stop standing up for our internationalist values. I joined the Labour Party because I believe in internationalism and solidarity across borders. So does Rosena. That’s why she’s worked across the world in conflict and disaster zones as a humanitarian doctor, and why she still does shifts in her local hospital as an A&E doctor alongside her work as an MP. So if you are like me – a proud pro-European, an internationalist and a Labour supporter – and if you want someone as deputy leader who’ll stand up for those values, and who’ll fight for our country to maintain the closest possible relationship with the EU, protecting our workers’ rights, our environmental protections, our food standards, our NHS, and most importantly the rights of EU citizens living in the UK – then vote for Doctor Rosena. Together, let’s take Labour forward. Comments are closed.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_shadow-cabinet-minister-for-mental-health/content_399.html": "|\nAs part of my former role as Shadow Minister for Mental Health, I worked very closely with Melanie Leahy and other campaigners affected by the terrible deaths in Essex mental health hospitals.\nThe Terms of Reference for the inquiry into this scandal have now at long last been published. This inquiry has been beset by delays since the beginning, which is simply not good enough.\nToday, the Government have scrapped their pledge to reform the Mental Health Act.\nMore than six years of reports, campaigning and hard work has gone down the drain. Last year, I sat on the Joint Committee on the Draft Mental Health Bill. There was overwhelming cross-party support for reforming the Act. To this day, the Government has failed to respond to the committee's recommendations. Earlier this year, the Conservatives scrapped their own 10-year mental health plan. Dither, delay and failure is on form with the Tories' approach to tackling the crisis in mental health services. Black people are five times more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act. The Tories have scrapped a once in a generation opportunity to tackle this burning injustice. Last month, I challenged the Health Minister to commit to reforming the Mental Health Act, her response was less than insightful. It is disappointing that the Tories continue to bury their heads in the sand and neglect mental health services. They are out of ideas and it's costing patients their lives. Only Labour can provide the transformation needed to improve services.\nPolice forces across England are set to stop attending many incidents concerning mental health under a new National Partnership Agreement: Right Care, Right Person.\nThe Government's announcement leaves far too many questions unanswered and fails to tackle the root problem of lengthy NHS waiting lists in mental health services. I have written to the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, asking him to come clean on what action he is taking to tackle mental health waiting lists. Read my full letter here:\nAll too often, children are stuck on long waiting lists for mental health treatment and thousands of people are having their referrals closed before an appointment.\nThis Tory Government caused the crisis in mental health services - when will they fix it?\nToday, I appeared on BBC Question Time, where I held the Government to account on the shameful Rwanda policy, their neglect of the NHS, and the issues surrounding Thames Water.\nFor Pride month, Anneliese Dodds MP, Shadow Women and Equalities Secretary, and I brought together mental health and LGBT+ organisations to discuss the challenges facing the mental health of LGBT+ people.\nJoining Billy Bragg’s ‘Left Field’ stage at Glastonbury, I spoke about the importance of protecting our NHS. It’s crucial that NHS staff are supported in their work and that patients can access timely treatment.\nIt was great to join Nish Kumar and Coco Khan on Pod Save the UK. We spoke about working on the frontline during the pandemic, Labour’s bold mental health plan, and pitying Matt Hancock.\nSee a clip of the Podcast here:\nToday, I proudly led Labour's opposition debate on mental health and put forward our plan to transform mental health services across the country. It includes more staff, specialists in schools, hubs in communities, treatment within a month. Today, I called on the Health Secretary to get his act together on our failing mental health services. Across mental health services, children are being failed, police are spending hours waiting with children in crisis in A&E, staff are overworked are under-resourced. It's time for the Health Secretary to get a grip or get out of the way. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_communities_3/content_505.html": "|\nSince the horrific terrorist attacks on Israel in October, more than 1,000 incidents of antisemitic hate crimes have been reported to Community Secure Trust.\nToday, I visited their headquarters in London to see the work they are doing to tackle antisemitism. It is a stain on our society. It must be combatted and those who perpetrate it must face the full force of the law.\nIt was wonderful to host a coffee morning for local residents today at Tooting United Reform Church. It was brilliant to welcome residents from Tooting and Furzedown. I am really grateful to everyone who attended, including some local organisations and charities who do invaluable work in the community. Tonight, I held a peace vigil at Tooting Broadway station to bring our community together to remember all those who have died in Israel and Gaza recently. I want to pay a huge thanks to the representatives from our local religious groups who said a prayer for peace.\nDuring some of our darkest hours, Tooting reminds us that there is always hope.\nAs part of National Care Home Week. I recently met some of the incredible staff and residents at Nightingale House in Balham to see first-hand the fantastic work being done in the local community.\nThe annual BATCA Fun Day is always good fun - and this year was no exception. I was delighted to celebrate the helpers, heroes and happy Tooting residents at this wonderful community event.\nIt was my pleasure to open the Quirky Dovetail Market. There was such a fantastic display of local arts and crafts on sale, which demonstrated the truly incredible talents that local people have to offer.\nOur local NHS board have announced that Trinity Medical Centre will close on 31st July. The decision to close the surgery is deeply disappointing and I am concerned that it will leave thousands of local residents scrambling to find another GP, including vulnerable patients.\nAt a time when local residents are already waiting weeks to see a GP, this decision is a shocking, short-sighted solution for users of the surgery. People will find themselves trying to squeeze onto the books of existing practices, travelling further to see a GP, losing the strong and trusted relationships with their GPs they've built over time. The blame for this decision lies squarely with this Conservative Government who have imposed 13 years of underfunding and neglect on our local NHS services. I have already called on the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, to meet with the community to see the impact of this decision first-hand and to reverse this disastrous decision. Trinity Medical Centre serves thousands of local people but is under threat of closure. For so many local residents this is a vital service. The closure would cause real difficulties for people accessing their local GP. Many local residents already have to wait weeks for a GP appointment and waiting lists for treatment are at record highs. This closure is a result of 13 years of government underfunding of our NHS. The local Integrated Care Board for South West London has been forced into making huge cuts to their budget and the impact of these cuts is now being felt by our community. In recent weeks, I've been contacted by numerous local residents extremely concerned about the impact of this closure. That's why I am urging the Health Secretary to intervene, listen to patients and staff alike, and keep a GP surgery open at Trinity Medical Centre. Sign my petition here Today, I asked Wandsworth Police officers to join me on a walk about in Tooting Bec.\nWe spoke to local residents and discussed tackling anti-social behaviour in the area. I know local residents have raised a number of concerns - about incidents targeting children and public safety in the area. I addressed these matters with the police, along with strategies already put in place aimed specifically at reducing worrying incidents of this kind and crime. Over recent months, I have taken the following action on anti-social behaviour and crime on the Heaver Estate:\nTooting has so much to offer as a community and I was delighted to visit my friends in Tooting Market yesterday to talk about their businesses. From food to clothes to art, crafts and activities, there is a wonderful array of businesses in the market Next time you're in the area, make sure to pop in and sample the market's delights, whether you need freshly squeezed juice3 or freshly stitched jeans.

The easing of national Government restrictions marks an important point in our recovery - our community and high street have so much to offer, so for six weeks I showcased the stores, restaurants, cafes, and other small businesses that make Tooting what it is! A huge thank you to every single business, business owner, employee, and customer who got behind the campaign. The past year has been challenging, so to see our community come together to support the local economy has been truly heartwarming. While this week marks the final instalment (for now) of Spotlight Saturdays, I will continue to find new ways to shine a bright light on Tooting and our wonderful community. Wandsworth is in the top 5 for vaccination rates across London! This is a great step forward and I am proud of everyone here in Tooting who has taken the steps to protect themselves and others by receiving their jab. However, we still have a way to go before everyone is protected against coronavirus. We need to keep pushing to ensure that those who can do so, are vaccinated as soon as possible. Information on how to book your vaccination appointment can be found here. It is also vital that if, for any reason, you have to change or cancel your vaccine appointment that you let the GP surgery or vaccination centre that you appointment is booked with know. You can manage your vaccination appointment here. If you are still unsure about having the jab or have any questions, more information can be found on the vaccine and answers to many common concerns on Wandsworth Council’s website here.

I am pleased to announce that as a result of this meeting, TfL have agreed to undertake a week-long trial at Balham Station, which will see the staircase open for use throughout the day and outward travel therefore possible from the station. The trial will commence on Monday 28th June and last 3-4 days. Following the trial, TfL will assess whether outward travel from Balham during the planned escalator repairs is viable. During this time - and beyond should the trial prove successful - I would recommend additional time is allowed for travel through Balham Station. By doing so, we increase the likelihood of a successful trial. More importantly, we can all play our part to ensure all residents can travel safely. Please check back for further updates on this situation. The work of biomedical scientists and laboratory staff is incredibly valuable - and this has never been clearer than since the outset of the coronavirus pandemic. Often overlooked as a profession, I was pleased to join others in thanking those working in healthcare sciences. For every coronavirus test conducted, a biomedical scientist has been behind it, working hard to ensure PCR tests are returned safely. I would like to thank, in particular, our incredible microbiology team at St George’s. Working in A&E, I know just how much our NHS relies on the incredible efforts of lab staff. I have included photos of the microbiology team at St George’s, featuring Chris James, a Specialist Biomedical Scientist in Biochemistry who has worked at St George’s for 9 years, and Silva, a Specialist Biomedical Scientist in Medical Microbiology and Virology who has worked St George’s Hospital for the past 4 years, after moving to the UK from Portugal. Silva’s words about her work as a biomedical scientist are impactful and I hope everyone is able to recognise the incredible work they do. “Being a biomedical scientist is an extremely impactful role in healthcare. Even though it’s not patient facing, our work and the speed and accuracy with which we can produce results is essential for patient care.” As you will no doubt be aware, the Covid-19 situation remains serious, with the Delta variant spreading rapidly throughout the country. One of the most important steps we can take to stop the spread of the coronavirus is to get vaccinated as soon as possible. For this reason, a range of walk-in vaccination sites have been launched across South West London. People aged over 18 are invited to drop into the Tooting and Mitcham United F.C. vaccination centre on Saturday 19th or Sunday 20th 9am - 8pm, to receive their first or second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Unvaccinated over 40s and over 40s who have received their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine before mid-April can also head down to the Roehampton Vaccination Centre, located in the Queen Mary’s Hospital car park, on Sunday between 8am and 7.45pm to receive their second dose. Together we can stop the spread of Covid-19. Details of additional walk-in vaccine centres in South West London are available here. Today I had the pleasure of visiting the impressive walk-in vaccine clinic, based at St Boniface Church on Mitcham Road. It was great to have the opportunity to speak with their incredible team of staff and volunteers, as well as meet local residents receiving their coronavirus vaccines. In partnership with NHS England, to date Pearl Chemist have administered over 30,000 doses of the vaccines. This is an incredible achievement and a real credit to our community. For local residents aged 40+ who have not yet had their first vaccination, the AstraZeneca vaccine is available at the Pearl Chemist clinic on Mitcham Road. You can also receive your second dose (eight weeks after your first dose) if you are in cohorts 1-9. Simply bring along your card! All other age groups can book their doses via the NHS website here. As a reminder, before you receive your vaccine, it is important to have eaten and be hydrated. With coronavirus cases in Wandsworth rising, it has never been more important to ensure you are fully vaccinated as soon as possible. By getting vaccinated, you are not only protecting yourself, but your community too. Last week, along with Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney, I was fortunate to visit Heathmere School - a local primary supported by the fantastic mental health charity, Place2Be. It was a wonderful opportunity to hear how Heathmere is promoting positive mental wellbeing for pupils, as well as learn more about the range of support Place2Be provides for schools across Wandsworth and the rest of the UK. During the visit, we heard first-hand from pupils who have benefitted from Heathmere’s whole school approach to mental health and Place2Be’s support. In addition, we were able to meet with Heathmere’s Headteacher, Emma Lewis, Place2Be’s Area Manager for South West London, Khalad Musse, and Place2Be’s Chief Executive Catherine Roche to discuss children’s mental health. It is so important that we shine a spotlight on the incredible work organisations, such as Place2Be, are doing to support children and young people. As we move beyond the pandemic, it is vital that we dedicate our care and attention to listening to young people to understand how we can best support them. Local favourite Mixed Blessings - our very own West Indian bakery on Mitcham Road - will soon be blessed with its very own blue plaque! The plaque will mark and celebrate TMC Studios (Tooting Music Centre), the recording studio that was once based above the bakery and frequented by glam rockers and reggae artists - local legend has it that Bob Marley scrawled his signature on a wall. It is so important that we shine a spotlight on Tooting’s rich musical roots and diverse cultural heritage. I will certainly be there later this summer when the plaque is revealed to share the love. A number of dogs have been reportedly infected with canine parvovirus on Tooting Common in recent times. Dog owners may be well aware that parvovirus is a highly infectious condition spread through contaminated faeces of affected dogs, and it can remain active in the environment for up to nine months. The virus causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea, leading to a dog or puppy becoming very weak and dehydrated. Sadly, many little pups do not recover. Thankfully, there are a number of steps that dog owners can take to protect their furry friends: Prevent your dog from meeting with other dogs to stop the spread of infection Ensure your dog’s vaccinations are up-to-date Notify your vet immediately if your dog displays any worrying symptoms. Click here to learn more about canine parvovirus. Good news - the Food Bus is coming to Tooting! The Food Bus – a converted bus stocked with affordable, healthy food – aims to improve Wandsworth residents’ access to fresh produce, while reducing the burden on household budgets. Much of its stock is obtained from retailers’ surpluses, and an ordinary shopping basket of goods will be available at a fraction of the normal price. The bus also features an on-board café. Head on down to All Saints Church on Brudenell Road on Thursday 10 June between 10:30am to 2:30pm to experience this wonderful initiative for yourself. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

It's amazing that all catering is now in-house, with chefs cooking food that has been grown by the students themselves. The children were so enthusiastic about their freshly cooked and nutritious lunches. I believe that the work we’re doing with Chefs in Schools will go a long way to promote positive attitudes and relationships with food and mealtimes for our young people. It was great to be able to support!\nI arrived back home safely from Ukraine yesterday. I went on a humanitarian mission with MedGlobalOrg, who are helping support hospitals to prepare for the darkest days of this conflict. We worked with the most amazing people and met patients with the most heart-breaking stories. I was honoured to be able to help Ukrainian victims in the midst of the heart breaking turmoil they are experiencing. Let’s do all that we can to help support Ukraine. This week, we celebrated our fantastic women business owners in Tooting. Over the last two years, many women have felt a disproportionate economic hit. Women hold the key to supercharging our economy as we recover from the pandemic. Today I was delighted to welcome Anneliese Dodds MP to Tooting and meet with women business owners. I believe it is essential that we recognise the significant contribution women make and commit to tackling the challenges that they still face today. Also, we welcomed some of our community's many impressive business women and community leaders to Parliament. Tooting is home to so many - it's only right we back women in business. Lastly, a big thank you to Sir Keir Starmer MP for hosting. It was great to be joined by Wandsworth Police for my community safety event last night. We discussed local crime concerns, updated residents on local safety initiatives, and learned new ways to keep our homes safe. A big thank you to all who joined - the community feeling is strong. Additionally, it was great to hear from local residents about how we can make our area safer & about our success of the #SafeSpace campaign. Finally, we discussed future plans to tackle violence against women and girls. It was great to be joined by Lord Wajid Khan at Rutherford House School. We met with the school's Pupil Leaders who had some insightful questions about our work in Parliament, and also taught us about their values of resilience and respect. What a credit to the next generation! So glad that I was able to attend this event with Lord Khan. I was honoured to give a sermon at St. John the Divine Church today on racial justice - talking about me work in Calais and how we can all work against racism in our community. We all must stand together for racial justice! Thank you to the whole church community for the warm welcome. Such an incredible honour to have volunteered with the Care4Calais team in Calais and Dunkirk. Their compassion and work ethic is second to none and they do so much to help and support those who have lost everything, in the most difficult of circumstances. Care4Calais is a refugee crisis charity that helps with delivering essential aid and support, such as food and medical supplies, to refugees living in the UK, France, and Belgium. So glad that I could be a part of this experience to help with the crisis in Calais. I’m officially in the Christmas spirit! It was such a pleasure to open the Christmas fair at Penwortham, and hear the school choir perform together after two years! Lots of Christmas cheer and great stalls. I wanted to congratulate the Penwortham choir on their legendary performance. Thank you for the opportunity to attend! Today is Small Business Saturday and it is important to me to understand what it's like to run a local business, and the challenges and successes that people in our local community experience. So I rolled up my sleeves and got stuck into a shift at Tooting's famous flower stall with local legend Chris. Chris was absolutely wonderful! Thank you for teaching me a few things about the flower industry! I’m looking forward to learning more. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_campaigns_3/content_500.html": "Labour Campaign for International Development endorses Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan for Deputy Leader30/1/2020\nI am hugely proud and honoured to be nominated for Deputy Leader by the Labour Campaign for International Development.\nAs someone who has worked as an humanitarian doctor in conflict zones across the world, their progressive approach to international development and promotion of global justice is an inspiration. My priority will always be to put human rights and international solidarity at the core of everything I do. Human life should have equal value, no matter where someone comes from. These principles shouldn't just apply to our international development policies, they should be applied to everything we do as the Labour Party. I want to thank the Labour Campaign for International Development for their support and their endorsement. Let's take Labour forward, together. Thank you Doctor Rosena Brexit Might Be Done But The Fight Against Boris Johnson's Destruction Must ContinueAlthough the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback.\nWhen the UK leaves the EU this Friday, 31 January 2020, after 47 years of membership, it will be a sombre day for many of us. For others, it will be a day of celebration. For most people, I suspect they will simply hope we can now move on from talking about Brexit at the expense of everything else. As someone who campaigned with all my heart to stay in the EU, and as the first person on Labour’s front bench to publicly call for a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal, I am desperately sad to see us leaving our friends and allies in Europe. But we are leaving. The disastrous result of the General Election has settled that. This is no longer an argument about Leave or Remain, it’s about what kind of future we want for our country and for our children. That’s where the new fight begins. Boris Johnson wants to pretend he’s now “Got Brexit Done”, and we no longer need to worry about the details. He wants us to simply trust him to sort it all out. Well, I don’t trust him. Neither should you. He talks about “Global Britain” whilst turning his back on vulnerable child refugees. He talks about “Taking Back Control” while reducing parliament’s ability to scrutinise his decisions. He talks about attracting “Global Talent” to the UK while creating huge distress and uncertainty for EU citizens, many of whom have been here for years and who have made their lives in this country. The fight for our internationalist values starts now. It will be long, and it will be difficult, because Boris Johnson has a large majority – but that’s why it’s so important. When it feels like hope is lost, that’s when those of us who believe in progressive values and internationalism need to stand up and fight. If we don’t, no-one else is going to do it for us. We need to stand up and fight for our hard-won workers’ rights. We need to stand up and fight for our environmental protections. Most importantly, we need to stand up and fight for the rights of EU citizens living in this country. They are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues, our family. I work side-by-side with many of them in the NHS, when I work shifts as a doctor in my local A&E department. Under the draconian new immigration laws being bandied around by this government, my own Polish mother might not have been able to move to this country and make a life for herself. Although the Labour party is in a difficult place right now, we must make sure it is at the forefront of the fightback. That’s one of the main reasons I am running to become the next Deputy Leader. We have huge organisational strength through our membership, through our links with the trade unions and through our MPs and councillors embedded in their local communities. Now is the time to deploy those strengths to maximum effect, to hold the Government to account and ensure that we fight back against every attempt to undercut our rights and freedoms at work, every attempt to weaken our environmental safeguards, every attempt to inject privatisation into our National Health Service. The slogan “Get Brexit Done” might have helped win the election for Boris Johnson, but for those of us who stand against his destructive vision for the future of our country, this fight isn’t done. It’s just getting started. My responses to the questions provided by the Labour Campaign for Free Movement 1. Defend and extend free movement: opposing any reduction in the freedoms of UK and EU citizens to live, work, and access social security in each others’ countries, and any immigration system based on incomes, migrants’ utility to business, and number caps or targets.I am the very embodiment of the benefits free movement has brought – my mother is Polish and was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Under the draconian new immigration policies being discussed by this Tory government, she might never have been able to do that. Protecting and extending free movement is at the very heart of my internationalist Labour principles. I believe our country is stronger and better because of free movement. When I work shifts as an A&E doctor in my local hospital, I work with NHS staff from across Europe and it breaks my heart to see many of them feeling unwanted or undervalued because of Brexit. As Deputy Leader, I pledge to do everything in my power to promote the core Labour values of internationalism and solidarity across borders, because I believe human life has the same value no matter where someone comes from. That means defending and extending free movement, and it means fighting to protect the human rights of migrants from this hostile Tory government. 2. Close every detention centreHolding migrants in detention centres, often in substandard conditions, is incredibly cruel and degrading. These are often vulnerable people, fleeing from a variety of horrific circumstances such as war, trafficking and poverty. They have the right to be treated with dignity, as human beings, as we would want ourselves or our family to be treated in such horrendous circumstances. When working abroad as a humanitarian doctor, I’ve seen first-hand some of the terrible conditions people are forced to endure in detention centres and it horrified me. We must fight back against the hostile environment the Tories have created for migrants – the Labour Party has always stood for international solidarity and openness to the world – we need a Labour government to bring those principles back into the core of our approach to immigration. I would want to listen to expert opinion on how to do this in a responsible way, but I certainly would want to close as many detention centres as possible and make sure we have an overall approach to immigration that means a concept as cruel as detention centres are not required in the first place. 3. Unconditional rights to family reunionYes, I fully support this. The unconditional right to family reunion is a fundamental element of treating migrants as human beings with dignity and equal value, rather than the Tory approach of seeing migrants as a problem to be managed. When I’ve worked as a humanitarian doctor in conflict zones across the world, it was always horrendous to see so many families ripped apart or prevented from seeing each other again. When I visited Palestine on a humanitarian mission, I saw sick children alone in hospital because the permit system meant their parents weren’t allowed to visit them. I immediately began working on ways to resolve this. It’s not enough to just talk about this – we need to be working every day to deliver a Labour government so we can fix these kinds of injustices. That’s what I’d do as Deputy Leader. 4. End “no recourse to public funds” policiesI support ending such policies, yes. This is another case of a Tory government treating migrants not as human beings with human dignity and equal value, but instead as a problem to be managed through cruelty. I want to deliver a Labour government with internationalism at its core, which would allow us to change our entire approach to migration, and begin seeing human life as equally valuable and equally dignified no matter where that person was born or where they’ve come from. 5. Oppose all Hostile Environment measures, use of landlords and public service providers as border guards, and restrictions on migrants’ NHS accessThe Tory Hostile Environment approach to immigration is a stain on the soul of their party, and they should be ashamed of it. Tragedies such as the Windrush scandal are a horrendous demonstration of where this approach leads, and I worry a similar scandal could occur with EU citizens who’ve made their lives in this country. I want a Labour government so we can end the Hostile Environment immediately and start treating migrants with the human dignity and respect they deserve. 6. Equal voting rights for all UK residents I am certainly interested in all ideas for how to revitalise our democracy and increase the level of engagement with our political process. Indeed, prior to the General Election in 2019, I publicly called for EU citizens to get the right to vote. Our Labour values of openness and internationalism must be at the core of everything we do. 7. Please share your thoughts on these wider issues that our supporters also feel strongly about:Even after Brexit, the UK government looks set to participate in Frontex (the European border agency) and its “Fortress Europe” policies. Will you challenge these policies? I certainly think the EU has often failed dismally to strike the right balance between border security and solidarity with people fleeing from war, poverty and the effects of global climate change. I am a proud pro-European, but that doesn’t mean my view of the EU is uncritical and I’ve never been afraid to say so. My values of international solidarity and openness don’t stop at the borders of Europe – they extend across the whole world. Human life always has equal value, no matter where that person comes from. Will you support an amnesty for undocumented migrants resident in the UK? We should always treat people with compassion and dignity, and we must place those values at the heart of everything we do when it comes to immigration. People in this country without documentation are often asylum seekers fleeing from horrific conditions and I want to see them treated with the human dignity they deserve. I would want to listen in more detail to expert opinion and feedback on the specific question of whether an amnesty is the right approach, but the principles of human dignity and compassion must always guide everything we do. Anything else you’d like Labour members, supporters and affiliates to know about what your leadership/deputy leadership would mean for migrants and migration policy? I am the living, breathing proof that free movement is a wonderful benefit to our country. My Polish mother was able to come to this country and make a life for herself here. Working on the frontlines of the NHS as an A&E doctor, I work alongside colleagues from across Europe and the rest of the world, and they are a credit to our country. It makes me proud to be British. But years of Tory government has created a literal Hostile Environment for migrants in this country. The drawbridge is being pulled up, and the rights of a whole generation of people to travel freely and live, love and work across Europe is being taken away. That is a tragedy, but it also means those of us who are proud of our outward-looking, progressive, internationalist values must fight even harder to protect and extend them. The fight starts now, and as your Deputy Leader (or even if I’m not!), I promise I will always be there fighting alongside you for those values with everything I’ve got. Nothing prepares you for seeing a colleague in tears over antisemitism.\nLabour deputy leadership hopeful, Rosena Allin-Khan, speaks about her heritage informing her fight against Jew-hate, and her commitment to mending ties with the community. “There is nothing that prepares you for seeing a colleague in tears,” says Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, one of five hopefuls standing for Labour’s deputy-leadership. Committed to winning back the trust of the community – and standing up for MPs such as Luciana Berger and Ruth Smeeth who are no longer in Westminster – Allin-Khan, currently the MP for Tooting, seems sincere in her battle against hate. She grew up as the daughter of immigrants – her father hailing from Pakistan, her mother from Poland, herself the descendent of resistance fighters killed by the Nazis. But she’s aware that hate and prejudice won’t be solved over a chat with tea and biscuits. Before her career in politics, she was a humanitarian doctor, working on the ground with Palestinians, while her mother’s family from Poland were killed by the Nazis. It’s these experiences which allow her to reconcile speaking out against Israeli policies, while committing herself to the fight against antisemitism, drawing praise from the community in carefully balancing these issues. The first of her pledges is to meet with the Jewish Labour Movement, should she get elected. It would be “essential to the restructuring” of relations, and “how we rebuild trust.” She is also keen on an education program, saying “people use antisemitic tropes and they don’t even realise what they’re doing and they repeatedly do so.” While indicating she would speak with “any group that was looking to acknowledge there was a problem, and work towards coming up with a solution to fix it” she adds that she is the “only deputy leader candidate who hasn’t nominated a leader”. She’s willing to “work with whomever the leader is” on rebuilding trust. Calling the demise in relations between the community and the party “sad” and “terrible”, she opens up about “people I know that I am very close to, who have been really brave and speaking out antisemitism in the party.” “They have received torrents of abuse and nothing’s been done about it”. “Any leader seeing something like this unfolding needs to be all over it”, she says. But was Corbyn’s team responsible? She says they were not the “cause of the antisemitic problem in Labour, I think they didn’t deal with the problem, well enough”. Yet, she’s under no illusions as to the extent of the problem, saying it must be tackled “from a grassroots membership level first and take it all the way to MPs themselves”. “The complaints process wasn’t dealt with properly”, Allin-Khan says, adding: “As people began to show antisemitic abuse .. the more they saw it wasn’t being dealt with the more they felt able to do so.” On mending ties, she wants an “independent” process for tackling complaints with “outstanding cases to be dealt with within a particular time”, and “automatic expulsion” for antisemitism, though she wouldn’t be drawn on whether she would intervene, like Tom Watson, who she is trying to succeed. Her drive to fight antisemitism is in part inspired by her heritage. “My mum’s Polish and I lost lots of family during the war. They were not Jewish, but they fought alongside Jewish friends and my great uncle died during that time, my grandma was pregnant in the Warsaw ghetto with my uncle.” “That whole experience is a very real part of my history, and it is a shared history that I understand deeply and I’m very saddened about with the Jewish community. She was embroiled in a dispute with the Israeli Deputy Ambassador in 2016, following a radio discussion about Palestinians’ access to medical aid. After revealing the two had met in person to discuss the issue, she was accused of being “bought by Zionists”, facing significant online abuse. Her response drew praise, with Dave Rich from the Community Security Trust saying it “illustrated the difference between pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist”. She says: “I am a doctor, and have been a humanitarian doctor for my whole professional life.” “It is possible, and fair, to identify areas where there could be improvement to somebody’s life and health and not to conflate that with a whole antisemitic issue. “ I will always be proud to stand up for people’s basic human rights, and I’m also very aware of my history and my shared history with the Jewish community. I feel it’s perfectly possible to manage the two.” Many former Labour voters feel unrepresented. That has to change\nThe Labour party has shaped who I am today. It has helped provide me with the opportunity to train as a doctor and has given me and my family life chances we otherwise would not have had. I want everyone to experience these opportunities. It deeply saddens me to see a lost generation for whom the door closed on their dreams and ambitions on 12 December. Growing up poor and cold while my single mum worked three jobs to support me and my brother taught me the reality of day-to-day life for many people in the UK. My mother always told me, even through our darkest moments, that there were people worse off than us – and I have never forgotten that. The Labour party changed my life. Despite failing my A-levels due to difficult circumstances at home, I was finally able to go to Cambridge University at the age of 24 to study medicine because of reforms the Labour party made in government. People did not know what we stood for – the Tories had three simple words Working on the A&E frontline has shown me the best and worst of society. A&E is a microcosm of real life. I hold parents as they say goodbye to their children who have died through senseless violence. I talk to nurses who tell me they can’t afford to feed their children and are having to use foodbanks. I treat older people who just want the dignity of accessing social care in their homes. But I also see hope. The UK is full of people pushing through barriers to serve their communities. Our NHS provided me with the skills to give back to society – it spurred me on to work as a humanitarian aid doctor in disaster zones across the world, something that I have been proud to continue during my time as an MP. I am proud of the internationalist views of the Labour party – we must never turn our backs on the world’s most vulnerable. On the border of Myanmar, it was shocking to listen to the stories of Rohingya refugees speaking of having to make the impossible decision of whether to save their child who was thrown alive on to a burning fire, or escape with their surviving child. We must not turn our backs on those who are living through the absolute worst of human atrocities. In Palestine, I was heartbroken to meet children who were undergoing cancer treatment utterly alone because their parents were unable to obtain permits to accompany them. Humanity should have no borders. Only with a Labour government can the UK have a truly outward, internationalist approach, ensuring that we are there for people in their times of greatest need. In order to be in government, we must get our house in order, and as deputy leader this would be my priority. We cannot look to champion equality abroad, while turning a blind eye to racism in our party. This needs to end. As deputy leader, my first major meeting would be with the Jewish Labour Movement – they are our official Jewish affiliate; we must listen. I want JLM to be at the forefront of this fight against antisemitism, especially when it comes to education at the grassroots level. I will separate the complaints process from HQ, making it independent and asking the new team to immediately review all cases, acting swiftly and expelling antisemites. There must also be a strict time limit by which cases need to be resolved. I commit to adopt every recommendation proposed by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, without hesitation. Enough is enough. Only then will we be able to start rebuilding trust. Communities across the country have turned away from Labour, thinking that we do not represent them. We must listen with humility to people across our country and across our movement to assess why we’ve lost the last four elections, and how we can win people back. From speaking to people in seats that we lost in December, I have been told that trust in us has gone. People did not know what we stood for – there appeared to be new policies announced every day and voters did not trust that we had a plan for how to deliver them. The Tories had three simple words. To win, we need to be able to communicate our messages, not just internally, but with the public. I will focus on grassroots campaigners being armed with the information and messaging that they need to talk to voters on the doorstep. I will equip candidates and their local Labour parties with the resources that they so desperately need. I will introduce reduced membership rates to our emergency service workers so they can have a say within Labour on the NHS at this vital time. We need to build our movement into one people can vote for. A party people can trust. Under this government, which has chosen to block child refugees from reunification with their families, I worry for the future of our children. I worry for the future of tolerance. I worry for the future of compassion. We have a wonderful society, which has welcomed so many people from across the world, but the hostile environment this government is imposing on our country is restricting the ability to hope. Hope for a brighter future. Hope for a tolerant society. The door may have closed on 12 December for a generation’s hopes and ambitions, but with the right leadership team in place in the Labour party, it will not be closed for good. We need to win the next general election, and we must start rebuilding trust ahead of local elections in May. As deputy leader, it will be my responsibility to rebuild trust, not just with the grassroots of our party, but with voters. Together, we can take Labour forward. As a doctor, I know that before a patient can be diagnosed, it is vital to first take a detailed history and examine them thoroughly. That’s the challenge we now face in revitalising the Labour Party and taking it off life-support. This is also why, when I decided to run for Deputy Leader, the first thing I did was contact every single Labour councillor I could find an email address for, as well as every single prospective parliamentary candidate who stood for Labour in the last General Election and lost.\nI’m not a leader-in-waiting, I’ll be a campaigner-in-chief, and you can be too. I’ve been travelling across the country, to seats where we won, seats where we lost, and even seats we’ve never held, to talk to activists and members on the ground - because I want to hear from the grassroots directly to truly understand what went wrong, what went right, and what we must do better. Using that detailed feedback, I am now publishing a manifesto called Grassroots Revival – a campaigning action plan that I will immediately start implementing if I’m elected as the next Labour Deputy Leader. **Download Grassroots revival**It starts with changes we must make to our internal organisation. We must overhaul the complaints process. I’ll remove the team from HQ and make it independent, put a time limit on reviewing complaints, and ensure those involved with each case are kept informed of its progress. I also want to start unlocking Labour’s membership talent. It’s not all about delivering leaflets and knocking on doors - we have social media experts, journalists, policy gurus, videographers and many other talents in our ranks. Let’s start making the most of that! For new members, attending meetings can feel daunting - we need to make them more enjoyable and accessible for all. We can ensure party democracy and due process are followed, while making meetings a more enjoyable experience. For example, some CLPs still spend up to an hour arguing about the minutes of the last meeting - which turns off new members. We need to streamline the procedural matters and get more political debate into our local meetings. We can be sociable too! I want to help local groups organise regional social events that break even, instead of looking to make a profit. Quiz nights, continuing the great work of Stand Up For Labour, pub nights, coffee mornings - let’s bring our movement together and celebrate all that we have to offer. Let’s look at how to grow and diversify our movement even further. I’ll offer reduced membership rates to emergency service workers, to encourage them to join the Party and have their say over how we fight to save our NHS. I would support BAME members to hold elected office - I will produce literature to be made available to BAME officers to distribute to new members, “how to be a councillor” meetings will be offered in each borough - not as an afterthought - and I will work with BAME officers to listen to what resources they need. We must start upgrading our technology and infrastructure - we’re running campaigns in 2020 with two colour printers from the 80s and 90s. I’d ensure every CLP has access to a full colour RISO printer (or similar). We can also boost data driven testing of our methods. Comparisons of leaflets, direct mails, e-newsletters, social media and canvassing will allow us to be so much more targeted and effective. A significant amount of dedicated time went into creating software and apps to revolutionise our digital campaigning in recent years but the party didn’t have the resources to fully roll them out - the doorknocking app, dialogue and chatter could have really helped us but members didn’t know how to use them or didn’t know they existed. Contact Creator regularly broke down during the General Election and the user interface hasn’t changed for over a decade. This must all change. Let’s also have a digital team at HQ who goes to every target seat, showing them how to make the most of Facebook ads, emails, Twitter, creating graphics and videos. Let’s also start looking at how to produce more personalised and localised content. The party produces some great literature and supplies it to key seats, but the vast majority of it is national with no localisation. Some leaflets and letters just didn’t arrive in 2019 for some seats, which left them in the dark, and adequate support was not available to deal with it, because staff were already overstretched. We must be better prepared. The manifesto came out weeks after the print deadlines for seats to order their leaflets and letters. I will ensure the necessary information is available to candidates in good time. The Labour Party must do better at supporting our candidates – I’ll make sure they all get adequate briefings and lines for use in their own leaflets, letters, emails and press releases. Candidates and their teams are superheroes, but they aren’t invincible, and campaigns can take their toll both financially, physically and mentally - This is why I’ll set up a dedicated team to offer mental health support and advice during difficult times. Too often, local organisers and staff have contracts that end at 10pm on polling day - this culture needs to change. Organisers put in endless hours to help our campaigns succeed and to dump them when polls close is just simply wrong. I’ll ensure no staff contracts end on Election Day, giving them vital time to find new employment. I also want to establish a system of sharing best practice amongst CLPs and boroughs. Campaigns shouldn’t have borders - we don’t have to operate solely within our constituency or ward boundaries. We need proper twinning with key seats. There’s no sugar-coating it – the Labour Party is in a critical condition right now. But with the right treatment, the right approach and the right support from the leadership team, we can get it back to fighting fitness. With the local elections coming up in May, there’s no time to waste. Doctor Rosena Allin-Khan MP for Tooting Front-line workers in the NHS have felt ignored by the Government - and now the Tories look set to give up the NHS for profit.\nThis Christmas I’ve been proud to support my hard-working colleagues on the front line by doing shifts in my local A&E. We’re all touched by the NHS at some point in our lives. For over 70 years it has been our lifeline, the glue holding our society together, often forgotten about, but there in our times of greatest need. The NHS is there to bring life, to offer care and dignity when we leave the world, and to support our loved ones when tragedy hits. But front-line workers in the NHS have felt ignored and that the Government does not recognise the day-to-day pressures they face. It didn’t start with claims on the side of a bus during the European referendum campaign in 2016 but, since then, using the NHS for political gain certainly picked up pace. Throughout the election, Boris Johnson repeatedly denied that the NHS would be up for sale. Just two weeks after the election, it was revealed that NHS cancer care and children’s treatments are up for grabs in a stealth Tory sell-off. Cardiology, gynaecology, paediatrics and oncology are among the services being offered to companies. As an A&E doctor, when someone is rushed into A&E having a heart attack, we work to patch someone up before sending them off to heart specialists. How will it feel knowing that those services are now being provided by a private company? Where is the trust? Allowing hospital trusts to outsource treatment to private companies could lead to a postcode lottery of health care, further widening the health divide. We need to be bringing the UK together, not tearing it apart, turning communities against each other. On top of this, discussions are taking place with tech giants on how to make money from patient data. While we must do everything possible to look for cures and ensure a better patient journey, we need to know how our own data is being used. The last decade has shown us that we must exercise caution with tech giants. The Government does not have the money or expertise needed to create an anonymised patient database, which is exactly why Amazon and Microsoft have been approached. Trust in our NHS cannot be destroyed because without trust, everything else could be up for grabs. I was stunned and heartbroken after the election result and bereft at what it would mean for our NHS. Our hospitals, treatments and dedicated staff cannot simply be sold off to the highest bidder. These aren’t the principles our NHS was founded and built on and I will continue fighting, standing side by side with our hospital workers, to protect our NHS from those who wish to destroy it. Shadow minister launches deputy leadership bid with a unifying pitch\nLabour must move past the factionalism and “ideological purity” that has alienated voters across the country, the shadow minister Rosena Allin-Khan has said as she set out her pitch to become the party’s deputy leader. The A&E doctor who has served on Jeremy Corbyn’s frontbench is the latest party figure to officially throw their hat in the ring for the deputy leadership, alongside the shadow cabinet members Angela Rayner and Richard Burgon. Allin-Khan, 43, said that for too long the party had been weighted down by infighting and described her politics as being inspired by public service, which she said was not based within soft- or hard-left identities. “I’ve got the campaigning experience but also the life experience to help rebuild the party again,” said Allin-Khan, who has been a shadow minister for sport since 2016 and still works hospital shifts. “We need to move beyond the last few years where nasty internal debates about faction and ideological purity have too often alienated people outside our movement. “Public service isn’t about identifying who sits on which side of the Labour party. I am Labour because of my values, my life experiences and the fact that I’m a doctor. We must communicate how we are going to change people’s lives in a way they can understand.” Her pitch as a unifying figure across Labour’s political spectrum would involve trying to make inroads in Scotland and Wales and other heartland areas that went Conservative, by holding town hall events, as well as meetings in synagogues, churches, mosques and temples. She said to rebuild the party’s base Labour must listen far more to councillors, who she says are the experts in their communities. The Tooting MP, who has a Pakistani father and Polish mother, dismissed concerns that Labour must have a leadership team that is drawn from northern constituencies. “I grew up poor with a single mum working three jobs to support me and my brother. That taught me the reality of day to day life for people across this country,” she said. “There’s no regional distinction to hunger. Loss of hope lives across the UK. London is used to mean ‘metropolitan elite’ but we also have some of the highest levels of deprivation. “Growing up in poverty. Understanding what it was like to get a job really young to supplement household income, to being careful in supermarkets with food, to feel there was no hope for someone from your background – that experience gives me a fire in my stomach to fight for all people around the country that have to go through that.” The mother of two studied medicine at Cambridge through Labour-initiated scholarships after initially failing her A-levels during a period of difficult family circumstances. After qualifying as a doctor she has worked as an A&E specialist in London hospitals and as a humanitarian aid doctor in the Middle East, Africa and Asia for a decade. She won the Tooting seat in a 2016 by-election after Sadiq Khan quit to run as mayor of London. In parliament she has highlighted the difficulty Palestinian children in Gaza have in accessing healthcare in Israeli hospitals because their parents are not allowed to accompany them through a restrictive permit system. As part of her sports brief she has fought for the return of safe standing at football clubs, as well as being an advocate for the women’s game both in parliament and as a player herself. She was also a vociferous campaigner for the People’s Vote campaign on a second referendum but said she accepted the country was leaving the EU, even though she had fought so hard against it because she did not believe the deal would work for her constituents. As for rejoining the bloc, she said that would have to be looked at if it should ever come up but was not a priority. Despite Corbyn being rejected at the election, she pointed out positive changes he made for the party, including a more welcoming immigration policy, and said she was proud of his strong anti-austerity message and the party’s continued support for the NHS. But on the defeat, she said: “We threw everything out there and nothing had time to land effectively. In comparison the Tories used three words and a few repeated soundbites which ultimately proved effective.” She said she would be happy to work with any leadership candidate should they be elected. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_wandsworth-council_2/content_66.html": "|\nIt was great to bring together local charities, faith leaders, and leader of Wandsworth Council, Simon Hogg who are all working tirelessly to support local families through the cost-of-living crisis.\nI have already been contacted by countless Tooting residents who are concerned about how they are going to pay their bills and put food on the table this winter, and I fear this will only get worse as we move further into the winter months. With so many households already feeling the squeeze, it’s crucial that we work together to tackle poverty. Representatives from Earlsfield and Wandsworth foodbanks as well as Dons Local Action Group and Little Village Tooting told me that they are seeing unprecedented demand at present, as more and more of those who were just-about-managing become unable to afford the basics. All the organisations represented spoke of the added difficulties the rise in energy prices have brought. The hike in energy prices has meant that even the local charities who are there to address the crisis are struggling to pay their bills, and this means they are less able to help those in need. This comes at the worst possible time, when demand is at it’s highest level for decades. Everyone at the event had numerous stories of people facing hardship, people in overcrowded accommodation, people not being able to put food on the table or buy school uniforms for their children. Many people are also concerned about how they will meet the additional cost of christmas. Despite heartbreaking stories, it was uplifting to see so many people who donate their time, energy and money into making things better for people in our community. I am always amazed by the generosity of people in Tooting. However, in Britain in 2022 these organisations and charitable schemes shouldn’t have to exist. It is imperative that the Government take action immediately to support people through the months ahead. 44 years of Tory rule in Wandsworth came to an end with Labour taking control of the Council after the local elections. Labour won 35 seats, whilst the Tories won 22. I was thrilled to play a part along with our fantastic Councillors, candidates, and activists in putting Labour into power locally.\nLabour’s historic victory here represents a new start for our borough, and it’s great to see Wandsworth’s group of Labour Councillors already taking action to help residents through the cost-of-living crisis. Talking to residents right across the borough, it was obvious to see that people in Wandsworth have rejected Conservative neglect both locally and nationally. The cost of living crisis is hitting residents hard, and it’s clear the Tories aren’t doing enough to address it. Wandsworth residents simply do not trust the Tories. The road to Labour in Government runs through our local councils, and I am hopeful this local victory will be the springboard to Labour’s general election victory. The Local Elections are hastily approaching on 5th May. After 44 long years of Tory rule, Wandsworth needs a breath of fresh air and a Labour council.\nOver the next four weeks, I will be out on the campaign trail - knocking on doors, delivering leaflets and working to help our fantastic Labour candidates. I would like to thank all the local residents for their support and warm welcome on the doorstep. Together we can turn Labour red this May! This week the Council finally listened to us! Our beloved Tooting Bec Athletics Track will be saved and get the investment it so desperately needs and deserves. To lose such a valuable asset in our community would be a devastating blow to so many of our young people. Having this track will be useful for encouraging young people to be physically active and lead a healthy lifestyle. Thank you to everyone who joined the efforts to save our track! There was significant concern locally about Wandsworth Council’s decision to extend Controlled Parking Zone restrictions in areas of Earlsfield and Tooting from 9:30am to 9:30pm each day. Over 1400 local residents completed my consultation on the change. I am pleased that, following our pressure, Wandsworth Council have U-turned on their plans to extend CPZ restrictions. Instead, Event Day only restrictions are planned from 1 October - a far more sensible solution, and something which other councils with stadiums do. I received more than double the number of responses to Wandsworth Council’s rushed, ill-thought out consultation. In fact, over 93% of respondents were not happy with the council’s plans. This should never have happened. But I am pleased the Council finally listened and have U-turned on their attempt to rush through restrictions that would simply act as another cash-grab on hardworking local residents. The future of Tooting Bec Athletics Track is still yet to be secured, with vital repairs still needing to be undertaken. Tooting Bec Athletics Track is a much-loved and well-utilised facility, both by local residents and the wider London community. The track is a home to schools, clubs such as Herne Hill Harriers, as well as aspiring athletes. To lose such a valuable asset would be a devastating blow to so many of our young people in our local area. Top British athletes are made at Tooting Bec Athletics Track - Jade Johnson, who represented Great Britain at two Olympics, trained at the track since childhood, as has Katie Snowden, who will represent Great Britain in Tokyo next month. By allowing the track to fall into disrepair, Wandsworth Tories are destroying the legacy of London 2012, and seriously damaging the chances of our next generation of Olympic hopefuls in the process. The deadline for the petition to save Tooting Bec Athletics Track has been extended until 1 August – click here to sign and show Wandsworth Tories how much our community cares about the future of our young people. The issue of litter in our local area is not a new problem. Indeed, back in 2019 I provided Wandsworth Council with a number of solutions to this issue, which were not acknowledged or enacted upon. I have recently been inundated with complaints from residents who have received Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs). As you may know, FPNs cannot be appealed, and I am concerned about the lack of oversight and accountability this procedure affords. It is clear from the litter on our streets that fining residents for putting out their household waste is not defeating the issue of fly-tipping. Fly-tipping fines need to be issued to the right people, for the right reasons – to deter genuine incidences of fly-tipping. Instead of being a deterrent, I am concerned that these fly-tipping fines are being misused as a Council cash-grab – making money from hardworking residents under the guise of keeping our streets clean. I have written to Paul Martin, Chief Executive at Wandsworth Council, and Paul Chadwick, Director of Environment and Community Services, to ask what action they will take to address these concerns. Keep an eye out for updates here. Wandsworth Council is currently consulting local residents on its ‘Local Plan’ document on developments for the borough across the next 15 years. This plan identifies Tooting as a potential area for regeneration, where proposals include new sustainable transport, improvements to public realm, and contributions to the health and wellbeing of residents.\n3. 56 Tooting High Street on the west corner of the Garratt Lane and Tooting High Street junction: The Council are considering using this site for a development of sustainable architecture and urban design, as well as considering the planting of street trees on Garratt Lane.\nFurther information on these proposals can be found here. Whilst I hold no authority over Wandsworth Council, it is important to me that residents, businesses and organisations have their say on these proposals. If you would like to submit comments on the ‘Pre-Publication’ Draft Local Plan, you must do so before 11.59pm on Monday 1 March 2021 using the following link: https://www.wandsworth.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy/local-plan/draft-local-plan-pre-publication/ A number of local residents have raised their concerns about people rough sleeping during this exceptionally cold spell, and of course amidst the pandemic.\nLike many, I believe the Government’s delay in housing rough sleepers during this third lockdown was completely irresponsible and lacked basic human compassion. In London alone, the Office for National Statistics estimates that 1 in 30 people have coronavirus, and we know that sleeping rough - without adequate shelter or access to basic hygiene facilities - leaves people more exposed to the virus. Today, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick MP announced that councils will collectively receive an additional £10 million in funding to house those currently sleeping rough, as well as an extension to the ban on bailiff evictions. Whilst I welcome this much-needed funding, this money will not help get everyone off the streets, and the ban on bailiffs fails to sufficiently protect renters. Many residents have contacted me with concerns for those who are sleeping rough outside Tooting Broadway tube station, Buzz Bingo and Sainsbury's. I want to reassure residents that I have recently written to the Head of Wandsworth Neighbourhood Policing Team to ensure these people are supported in the best way possible. Beyond the coronavirus emergency, there can be no return to business as usual. It is paramount that Ministers end rough sleeping for good. In a country as well-off as ours, we need to ensure that everyone has the right to a safe place to live. Today Wandsworth Council has announced that it is suspending the Low Traffic Neighbourhoods that it implemented across our community. Wandsworth Council failed from the start to communicate the implementation of LTNs to local residents, and instead of listening and reviewing they have now decided to pull them out because do not want the fuss.\nAs I have said before, I was not consulted and nor were local residents on these changes. They were brought in overnight and pitted neighbour against neighbour, causing fierce rows and division. The Council should be ashamed. When the going got tough, they tried to pass the buck, and now Wandsworth Council is wasting tens of thousands of pounds by scrapping the LTNs entirely. The Conservative Cabinet Member for Transport's position is untenable. Attention will now turn to the TfL Streetspace scheme on Upper Tooting Road, Balham High Road and Tooting High Street. I know that this is a scheme that has its issues and needs reviewing. However, I am confident that TfL want to make it work for our local environment. Contrast TfL's response with that of Wandsworth Council. TfL is taking feedback on board, they are hosting a virtual public meeting next week to gather feedback from local people and I am meeting with a TfL representative next week to discuss the scheme. I will be taking him to meet some of the affected businesses and discussing the issues emergency services have had. TfL evidently want the scheme to work and they deserve credit for trying. I have been clear from the start that I am supportive of schemes which encourage cycling and make our streets safer. We do that by engaging in polite and respectful discussion to bring about changes collectively. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Pleasure to invite local residents to share a cuppa and hear about their local issues. Thanks to local organisations and the police for coming along and listening to residents.\nToday, I brought together officials from Wandsworth Council and Wandsworth Police to discuss what we can do to make Tooting Broadway a safer, cleaner and more vibrant place to live and work.\nTonight I joined Andrew Marr on LBC to talk about the appalling hospital conditions doctors face in Palestinian hospitals.\nThe Tories have scrapped the Mental Health Act - failing thousands of patients.\nLabour must seize the opportunity to modernise mental health legislation, with the Joint Committee's recommendations in mind. Read my piece in New Statesman here.\nTonight, I voted on an amendment to the King's Speech to support a ceasefire in Gaza.\nRead my full statement here:\nTonight, I joined with representatives of all faiths and none at the BATCA annual peace ceremony in Tooting.\nThank you to everyone for their prayers of peace. They are needed now more than ever and I am so proud to represent such a wonderful, caring community.\nToday, I read out the names of the fallen and laid a wreath at St Nicholas Church in Tooting with local councillors, Rex Osborn, Kate Forbes and Kemi Akinola and members of our emergency services.\nSince the horrific terrorist attacks on Israel in October, more than 1,000 incidents of antisemitic hate crimes have been reported to Community Secure Trust.\nToday, I visited their headquarters in London to see the work they are doing to tackle antisemitism. It is a stain on our society. It must be combatted and those who perpetrate it must face the full force of the law.\nToday, the Government have scrapped their pledge to reform the Mental Health Act.\nMore than six years of reports, campaigning and hard work has gone down the drain. Last year, I sat on the Joint Committee on the Draft Mental Health Bill. There was overwhelming cross-party support for reforming the Act. To this day, the Government has failed to respond to the committee's recommendations. Earlier this year, the Conservatives scrapped their own 10-year mental health plan. Dither, delay and failure is on form with the Tories' approach to tackling the crisis in mental health services. Black people are five times more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act. The Tories have scrapped a once in a generation opportunity to tackle this burning injustice. Last month, I challenged the Health Minister to commit to reforming the Mental Health Act, her response was less than insightful. It is disappointing that the Tories continue to bury their heads in the sand and neglect mental health services. They are out of ideas and it's costing patients their lives. Only Labour can provide the transformation needed to improve services.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

This year was particularly challenging. For many pupils, this was their first experience of exams in a formal sense, after GCSEs were suspended during the pandemic. Grade boundaries were also raised to return to 2019 levels. However, our students and schools excelled, with a number of Tooting schools exceeding the London average of 30% A*-A grades – itself a pass rate that is the highest in the country. London schools are still benefitting from the London Challenge investment of the last Labour government. Our Tooting students and our Tooting schools and staff are something to celebrate. We are so proud of you. As an A&E doctor and mother, I am incredibly concerned about the impact of poor air quality in our local area. I see many people attending hospital with breathing difficulties directly linked to toxic air, which contributes to thousands of premature deaths every year. It is my belief that it is the right thing to do to adopt enforceable targets and bring in preventative measures to tackle air pollution. As such, I am supportive of the ULEZ expansion coming to Tooting.\nHowever, I also acknowledge its impact on people’s budgets. I called on Sadiq to expand the scrappage scheme support – which he delivered on without Government support despite money being provided for similar schemes in other cities. Furthermore, I am pleased that he has further expanded the scheme, and information about the scrappage scheme can be found here. Wandsworth Council have also announced support through the Wandsworth Sustainable Travel Fund, details of which can be found here. The expansion of ULEZ was also mandated by the Government as part of the TfL bailout deal during the height of the pandemic – so they wanted the expansion to go ahead as well. It is incredible to see the work being done in Wandsworth Town Hall by the new Labour council. Recently, it was announced that free school meals would be available during school holidays for eligible children, while parents of pupils on free school meals will also have access to uniform vouchers to help cover this expense. With the Tory cost-of-living crisis, this is a hugely beneficial scheme for hard-working families across the borough.\nThis is the difference that Labour makes in power and I look forward to continued close cooperation with the new council administration in order to make our communities even better places to live. For further details, see here. In September, I’ll be taking on the London to Brighton cycle along with Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney. We’re fundraising as part of the Time for a Change appeal to help support St George’s Hospital Charity in their work to provide assistance to patients, their families, and the staff who care for them across St George’s Hospital, Queen Mary’s Hospital, and community sites.\nIt’s a 55-mile route from Clapham to Brighton, and we’ll be joined by other fantastic #TeamGeorges participants. Neither of us have done this before and it’s a big challenge for us. The Time for a Change Appeal is supporting children’s services at St George’s Hospital. We know that St George's Trust provides absolutely outstanding care for patients and incredible support for families, but sadly the facilities often don’t reflect this level of care. If you want to support us, our JustGiving link is here: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/fleurandrosenal2b\nOn the 75th birthday of the NHS, I joined the amazing team at St George’s Hospital, to say, a big thank you for the incredible care and compassion they show every day. I'm proud to work side-by-side with the team.\nAs part of National Care Home Week. I recently met some of the incredible staff and residents at Nightingale House in Balham to see first-hand the fantastic work being done in the local community.\nThe annual BATCA Fun Day is always good fun - and this year was no exception. I was delighted to celebrate the helpers, heroes and happy Tooting residents at this wonderful community event.\nIt was my pleasure to open the Quirky Dovetail Market. There was such a fantastic display of local arts and crafts on sale, which demonstrated the truly incredible talents that local people have to offer.\nOur local NHS board have announced that Trinity Medical Centre will close on 31st July.

I have already called on the Health Secretary, Steve Barclay, to meet with the community to see the impact of this decision first-hand and to reverse this disastrous decision. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Support my campaign to make this a reality and sign the petition below: The Government are right that expanding Heathrow will boost growth. However, the damaging impact that expansion will have on noise and air quality of people living under the flightpath cannot be ignored.\nMy position has always been the same and I remain opposed to the expansion of Heathrow airport. While I do not support a third runway at Heathrow, I do agree with the expansion of Gatwick. It can expand faster and with a less negative impact on people living under the flightpaths. Today, on Holocaust Memorial Day, I am at Auschwitz commemorating 80 years since its liberation.\nThis day serves as a stark reminder of the sheer evil that led to the murder of 6 million Jews. We remember them and promise to never forget the horrors they faced. It's finally Friday and what better way to prepare for the weekend than by reading my latest column in the South London Press.\nRead my article on the steps Labour are taking, both nationally and locally, to tackle the housing crisis here. Since the beginning of this terrible violence in October 2023, I have been unrelenting and unequivocal in my calls for an immediate, unconditional ceasefire in Gaza. I have equally been clear that the October 7 attacks by Hamas were completely abhorrent, and hostages must be released.\nTens of thousands of innocent lives have been lost, with each story as heartwrenching and tragic as the last. There are no words for the pain, suffering and anguish that millions have experienced as a result of this awful war. This ceasefire deal, therefore, is a welcome and significant step towards peace. We must remain cautiously optimistic that this fragile peace will hold. Ahead of the ceasefire taking effect on Sunday 19 January, we have seen the escalation of strikes on Gaza by the Israeli Defense Forces and the international community must do everything to ensure that the terms of the ceasefire are met in full and on schedule. Only by ending the violence and bloodshed, as well as releasing the hostages, can reconstruction of the devastated Gaza Strip begin. The influx and distribution of urgent humanitarian aid must be a priority, as hundreds of thousands of Gazan civilians are starving and on the brink of famine. Over 2 million people on both sides of the border have been displaced from their homes, with many of them now having nothing to which they can return. Regardless of the events of the next few weeks and months, I will continue to be a vocal proponent of peace, reconciliation and a sustainable two-state solution. As 2024 draws to a close, I wanted to take this opportunity to look back on the events of the past year. It has been a year of change and renewal - full of ups and downs - but as I enter into my ninth year as your Member of Parliament for Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting, it remains the greatest honour of my life to represent the community in which I was born and raised. Entering the new year, I would like to pay tribute to the incredible frontline workers working around the clock to keep the country going through the festive period. From our NHS services to local hospitality staff to food bank volunteers - you all have my heartfelt gratitude for your tireless work this Christmas and throughout the year. A year for democracyWhat a year it has been for elections, both locally and across the country. We began the year with a fantastic win in the Tooting Broadway by-election, increasing the Labour vote share by nearly 7% to a whopping 58% majority. Then came the Mayoral elections in May, when we kept London red by electing my Tooting predecessor Sadiq Khan to a historic third term as Mayor of London. Finally - and most importantly - we finally elected a new Labour Government after 14 long years, with areas up and down the country voting Labour for the very first time. It was humbling to receive the most votes of any Labour MP and thanks must go to everyone who voted for me - your support means the world. £100m to fix Wandsworth PrisonAfter years of campaigning - and countless stories of mismanagement and scandal - the Ministry of Justice announced a £100 million funding package for HMP Wandsworth. This will go a long way to reduce the impact of overcrowding, repair crumbling cell blocks and facilities, and ensure that prison guards can work in a safe environment. Delivering for everyone in TootingThousands of local people have contacted me this year regarding a variety of issues, I have dealt with 15,000 cases. I reclaimed tens of thousands in unpaid pensions or benefits for local people, got decisions on hundreds of delayed passport or visa applications, and helped countless local residents get repairs to their homes. My door is always open and please get in touch if there is anything I can help with. On the NHS frontline\nSpeaking up for Gaza It has now been over a year since the horrific 7th October attacks and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza. The humanitarian disaster we have seen unfold there in the time since, has been truly heartwrenching. This year, I've raised the issue numerous times in Parliament, visited the region in the spring, and held evidence sessions with humanitarian experts. Revitalising Tooting town centre\nThis Morning and Loose Women Using my background as an NHS doctor, I have enjoyed trying my hand at being a TV medic this year! The lovely people at This Morning and Loose Women have had me on many times to talk about a range of topics from mental health to medical emergencies and even gave me space to open up about my own childhood challenges with speech, in a bid to end stigma and help others. Work in Parliament\nKeeping our streets safe in 2024, I successfully campaigned for a tripling of the Tooting neighbourhood policing team, putting more bobbies on our streets. In the summer, Operation Kenny run by the Metropolitan Police resulted in a 70% reduction in crime in Tooting town centre. This work will continue with the new Government's plans to recruit 13,000 new officers and return policing to communities. Cleaning up the local area I have never stopped campaigning for cleaner streets. This year saw a 15% reduction in fly-tipping in Wandsworth, with thousands of fines issued to people dumping their bulky rubbish on our streets. Meanwhile, Wandsworth Labour introduced food recycling for the first time ever in the borough. Free School Meals roll-out\nMental health reform Mental health is incredibly important to me and, for far too long, much-needed reforms were swept under the rug by a Conservative Government that simply wasn't interested. After much hard work, it was fantastic to see reform of the Mental Health Act announced in the King's Speech in July - this was long overdue.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

I have urged the Secretary to review and reconsider NHS England's decision as soon as possible. The beginning of Mental Health Awareness week was marked by grim tidings that, for the first time in recorded history, the number of people on an waiting list for mental health treatment has hit 2 million.\nThis is more than the combined population of four major British cities and is a shocking indictment of the Tories' failed record on mental health.\nFollowing a recent spot inspection of HMP Wandsworth by the Chief Inspector of Prisons. an Urgent Notification was issued to the Secretary of State for Justice, meaning that the Chief Inspector has serious and immediate concerns about the day-to-day operation of the prison.\nThe report was damning and laid the blame for the deficiencies squarely at the Government's door, citing a lack of leadership at the very highest levels. I have been raising these issues for years now and my concerns have gone unheeded by this Tory Government, even after a high-profile alleged escape last autumn. Read my Twitter thread on the subject below:\nNew data published by the Environment Agency recently revealed that sewage was pumped in our local rivers, the Graveney and Wandle, for over 700 hours last year. This is equivalent to the entire month of February and demonstrates this Tory Government's complete disregard for our natural environment.\nOnly Labour has a plan to clean up our waterways and hold water companies to account by fines for illegal discharges, blocking bonuses for bosses of companies that violate the rules and holding these bosses personally criminally liable for any violations.\nAs someone who grew up with and later overcame a stammer, I know all too well the difficulties and challenges that having one can bring. I was very glad and honoured to join Dermot and Alison on This Morning once again to talk about stammers and the wonderful work that Stamma charity do.\nAs someone who has had close friends and family members with eating disorders, I know just how damaging and dangerous they can be. I was proud to join my friend Hope Virgo at the Dump The Scales march to Parliament Square on Saturday with hundreds of campaigners and activists.\nThe Government’s attitude towards eating disorders must fundamentally change. They must listen to campaigners and experts, like Hope, to ensure everyone with an eating disorder gets the care they need. It was brilliant to speak at the Watercooler event in the ExCeL London today, for a discussion on mental health in Government and the NHS.\nRather than railing against a \"sick note\" culture as Rishi Sunak has done recently, we must be encouraging more openness and understanding around mental health.\nAs part of my previous work as Shadow Minister for Mental Health and in my capacity as an A&E doctor at St George's, I know firsthand the toll that working on the NHS frontline can take.\nToday, I asked the Government whether they will continue to fund mental health support services past the 12 months they've committed to. Shamefully, the Minister refused to commit to funding. This is just further proof that this Tory Government couldn't care less about our NHS heroes.\nThe Tories' Rwanda Bill is one of the most shameful pieces of legislation in recent memory on both moral and practical grounds, which is why I voted 20 times against the Bill last night.\nAs part of my former role as Shadow Minister for Mental Health, I worked very closely with Melanie Leahy and other campaigners affected by the terrible deaths in Essex mental health hospitals.\nThe Terms of Reference for the inquiry into this scandal have now at long last been published. This inquiry has been beset by delays since the beginning, which is simply not good enough.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

With its causes and symptoms, it’s a complex issue. But in a country as decent and well off as ours, we should not be seeing this increase in rough sleeping on our streets. I invited council reps, the City Hall housing team and local police to join me and see the issues in our community first-hand. I'm working hard to bring agencies together and effect change. The Year 2s at Tooting Primary School have been learning all about strong women. I was honoured to be invited to speak with the pupils all about being what it means to be a doctor and represent our wonderful community as MP. It is so important that we recognise and champion the voices and stories of strong women. And the students had great questions. They even taught me a few strong women facts! The Government recently released their “Plan for Health and Social Care”, in which they pledge to help the NHS recover from the coronavirus pandemic and reform the adult social care system - funded by a 1.25% increase in National Insurance payments.\nLow-paid families will now be hit with a double whammy of a Universal Credit cut and a hike in tax. In fact, some key workers will end up more than £1,000 worse off. While I have long called for investment in social care, this is not the appropriate way to fund it. Once again the Tories have put the very wealthiest above working people. I am proud to have voted against this National Insurance increase, which will be a damaging blow to so many working people in Tooting. I am concerned about South Western Railway’s planned cuts to local services. Earlsfield Station could lose two trains per hour off-peak, and direct services to Shepperton could be cut. With residents gradually returning to offices, I believe that these cuts to rail services are ill-considered. In addition, if we are to tackle air pollution and reduce carbon emissions, we need to be encouraging public transport use - not making it more difficult to use. The South Western Railway’s Consultation on this matter closes on Sunday 19th September. If you are affected by these planned changes, I would encourage you to submit your view to the consultation here. Local community champions Dons Local Action Group have joined forces with AFC Wimbledon to continue their fight against food poverty in our community. The Dons will be collecting donations at every home game this season, which will support even more families in need. The Dons are requesting donations of tinned meat, vegetables, fish, fruit, and pulses. Collection points are located by each stadium entrance. Next match day, please support this wonderful initiative in any way that you are able – the spirit of giving is what makes our Tooting community so special! Many local residents have been in touch regarding the expansion of the Cambo Oil Field, 75 miles to the west of the Shetland Islands in Scotland. I want to be clear in the fact that I oppose the expansion of the Cambo Oil Field. The climate crisis is the defining issue of our generation and should be treated with the urgency required. By expanding oil and gas exploration, we are abandoning our obligations to end the ongoing climate crisis. Ahead of COP26, we must support the end of oil and gas exploration whilst protecting our communities and jobs. It was an honour to host my first ever radio show on Riverside Radio last night on all things mental health. Mental health struggles are nothing to be ashamed of, and tackling the stigma starts with open, honest conversations. Thank you to all the wonderful listeners who called up with their mental health questions during the show, and to Sahar Beg from Tooting Community Kitchen who joined me in the studio. If you missed the show, you can listen back here. Our Tooting community always comes together in the face of adversity, and I know many local residents will want to help those impacted by the current situation in Afghanistan in any way they can. That is why I have compiled a list of organisations and charities currently working to support Afghan refugees:\nTo provide refugee accommodation: Refugees at Home: UK charity which connects those with a spare room with refugees and asylum seekers in need of somewhere to stay. Apply to be a host here. Room for Refugees: Community hosting network that offers safe, temporary homes and emotional support for insecurely-housed refugees, asylum seekers and vulnerable groups - families, the sick, the elderly and unaccompanied asylum seeking children with no recourse to public funds. Apply to offer accommodation here. Wandsworth Borough Council: Residents, businesses, or other landlords who could offer a property for new arrivals are being asked to register their details - they are particularly keen to hear from those with 3 to 4 bedroom properties available. To offer accommodation, contact Wandsworth Borough Council via email at [email protected]k or by phone on 020 8871 7333. Local Organisations: Care4Calais: Asking for volunteers, financial donations and donations clothes, shoes, phones or other essentials at drop off points:\nNational Organisations: Choose Love: Supporting projects providing vital aid and services to Afghan people who have fled the country: clothes, shelter, support for children and groups protecting women and children’s rights.\nBritish Red Cross: Calling for donations to help staff and volunteers provide emotional support and essential items, including warm clothes, blankets, soap, toothbrushes and nappies.\nSave the Children: Calling for donations to an emergency fund.\nAction Aid: Calling for emergency donations to help charity provide emergency humanitarian assistance including food, water, and essential items such as hygiene kits, cash, tarpaulins, tents, cooking utensils, clothing, and bedding.\nAfghanaid: Afghanaid is a British humanitarian and development organisation, currently asking for donations to assist response to the Afghan crisis\nUNICEF: Raising money to support children in Afghanistan\nUNHCR: Calling for donations to help the organisation in the distribution of family tents, hygiene kits, core relief items like blankets, sleeping mats and kitchen sets.\nThe Big Give: Delivering emergency support to families whose lives have been destroyed or uprooted by the conflict.\nMuslim Aid: Calling for donations to Afghanistan Emergency Appeal.\nIslamic Relief: Calling for donations to aid Afghan’s on the ground in Afghanistan, and when they come to the UK.\nDoctors Without Borders: The MSF teams are responding to the crisis in Afghanistan, providing medical aid, expertise and life-saving supplies during the escalating crisis. Donate here. Paiwand: Established an Afghan Resettlement Emergency Fund, supporting displaced Afghans in need of assistance.\nRefugee Council: Providing aid, including mental health support, for refugees arriving in the UK.\nThis week, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan announced London will be welcoming 150 families from Afghanistan. To each and every family coming to Tooting - you are so welcome here. Want to help those arriving from Afghanistan? Here is what you can do: Little Village: Urgently in need of warm baby clothes, 9 months - 2 years and 4 - 6 years (specifically pyjamas, snow suits, jumpers and coats). Moses baskets, muslins, small toys and activity packs also needed. Regular collections are being held at Chancery Mews, SW17 7TD and Chillerton Road, SW17 9BE. Please do check their Facebook page for more information. Tooting Community Kitchen: Urgently in need of jogging bottoms and jeans in sizes 26-34 waist, jumpers, t-shirts, coats and trainers in sizes 38-45. Donations can be dropped off Friday 9-1pm and Saturday 3-5pm at Price Close (entrance at 104 Upper Tooting Road). I was also pleased to write to the Leader of Wandsworth Council alongside my colleagues, Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney, and Marshsa De Cordova, MP for Battersea, to call on Wandsworth Council to welcome in refugees from Afghanistan and provide them with a safe place to live. On Monday 6 September, I’ll be live on Riverside Radio diving into why mental health matters and, perhaps most importantly, all your mental health matters. The last 18 months have been incredibly challenging for so many of us and have highlighted the importance of mental health care. We need true parity of esteem between physical and mental health. One step we can take towards reducing any stigma is by being open in our conversations around mental health. Join me for an honest, straight-talking hour, 6-7pm next Monday! And if you have any questions about mental health that you want to ask on air, please email [email protected]. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

The Committee published our report on the ongoing crisis. You can read more about it here\nToday I met with the Prison Officers Assocation from Wandsworth Prison and Battersea and Wandsworth TUC to discuss the brutal conditions officers face.\nThey told me about appalling conditions with three assaults on staff every day. This simply can’t go on - the Govt must get a grip on the crisis in our prisons. When I look at myself in the mirror, I want to be proud of the person looking back. We have a moral responsibility to stop more innocent people being killed. That is why I am voting for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.

It was an absolute pleasure to take part in Wimbledon Sustainable Fashion Week with Wimbledon Go Inspire. I was so inspired by the incredible panel talking about sustainable fashion.

I want to be clear in the fact that I oppose the expansion of the Cambo Oil Field. The climate crisis is the defining issue of our generation and should be treated with the urgency required. By expanding oil and gas exploration, we are abandoning our obligations to end the ongoing climate crisis. Ahead of COP26, we must support the end of oil and gas exploration whilst protecting our communities and jobs. The issue of litter in our local area is not a new problem. Indeed, back in 2019 I provided Wandsworth Council with a number of solutions to this issue, which were not acknowledged or enacted upon. I have recently been inundated with complaints from residents who have received Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs). As you may know, FPNs cannot be appealed, and I am concerned about the lack of oversight and accountability this procedure affords. It is clear from the litter on our streets that fining residents for putting out their household waste is not defeating the issue of fly-tipping. Fly-tipping fines need to be issued to the right people, for the right reasons – to deter genuine incidences of fly-tipping. Instead of being a deterrent, I am concerned that these fly-tipping fines are being misused as a Council cash-grab – making money from hardworking residents under the guise of keeping our streets clean. I have written to Paul Martin, Chief Executive at Wandsworth Council, and Paul Chadwick, Director of Environment and Community Services, to ask what action they will take to address these concerns. Keep an eye out for updates here.\nWhen the water has been turned off, the water flow can disturb sediment in the pipes, which can then cause the water to appear to be dark in colour. I have been in contact with Thames Water regarding this and they have assured me that it is not harmful.\nWith the colder weather, Thames Water have also advised the following to help prevent water leaks: • Check pipes – thaw frozen pipes with a hot water bottle or a towel soaked in water • Bleed the radiators – use a radiator key to open the valve and release trapped air • Look after your central heating – get your boiler serviced often and keep the heating on low when not at home • Find your stop tap – these are usually found under the kitchen sink. Turn right to tighten and left to loosen • Keep a plumber on hand – keep details of a reputable plumber on hand and make sure to check home insurance cover In the instance that you see a leak, you can report it to Thames Water here, then phone a plumber immediately. Please do keep an eye on my Twitter, where I am posting updates on the water issues as they arise. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

I have urged the Secretary to review and reconsider NHS England's decision as soon as possible. Today's announcement by NHS England that children's cancer services will be moved away from the world-class unit at St George's Hospital is profoundly disappointing.\nAs a doctor, I am clear that this decision has not been made in the interests of patients or their families and we're losing more than 25 years of expertise in the field of children's cancer care. I'm calling on the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Victoria Atkins to immediately review this decision.\nIn recent weeks, thousands of people across south London and south-east England have signed my petition calling on NHS England to keep children's cancer services at St George's Hospital, including many parents who have told me how worried they are about this proposed closure.\nLast week, NHS England launched its consultation on the future of services at St George’s Hospital and I want to make sure that we have every chance to defend and protect our local services. Keeping services at St George's is best for our patients and best for the NHS, but this can only happen with the support of people in the community who will be affected by this decision. Please spare a few minutes to complete to consultation questionnaire and share your views with the NHS. The consultation is running until Monday 18 December.

I can't believe just how challenging it was and I want to thank everyone who helped us to smash our fundraising target. You can still donate here In September, I’ll be taking on the London to Brighton cycle along with Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney. We’re fundraising as part of the Time for a Change appeal to help support St George’s Hospital Charity in their work to provide assistance to patients, their families, and the staff who care for them across St George’s Hospital, Queen Mary’s Hospital, and community sites.\nIt’s a 55-mile route from Clapham to Brighton, and we’ll be joined by other fantastic #TeamGeorges participants. Neither of us have done this before and it’s a big challenge for us. The Time for a Change Appeal is supporting children’s services at St George’s Hospital. We know that St George's Trust provides absolutely outstanding care for patients and incredible support for families, but sadly the facilities often don’t reflect this level of care. If you want to support us, our JustGiving link is here: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/fleurandrosenal2b\nOn the 75th birthday of the NHS, I joined the amazing team at St George’s Hospital, to say, a big thank you for the incredible care and compassion they show every day. I'm proud to work side-by-side with the team.\nThe children's cancer centre at St George's Hospital is at risk of closure.\nThis is deeply concerning. The St George's children's cancer centre has more than 25 years of expertise delivering the highest quality care for patients, which will be lost if the services are moved away from Tooting. Under these plans, patients will be forced to travel to a site in central London. Parents have made it very clear that it is easier, cheaper, safer, and more comfortable to take their children to St George's. There is also a huge added cost. The plans to relocate services will cost an estimated £90 million, more than three times the cost to redevelop facilities at St George's Hospital. Today, I've launched a petition calling on the Government and NHS England to keep the children’s cancer service at St George's Hospital.

That is why I have compiled a list of organisations and charities currently working to support Afghan refugees:\nTo provide refugee accommodation: Refugees at Home: UK charity which connects those with a spare room with refugees and asylum seekers in need of somewhere to stay. Apply to be a host here. Room for Refugees: Community hosting network that offers safe, temporary homes and emotional support for insecurely-housed refugees, asylum seekers and vulnerable groups - families, the sick, the elderly and unaccompanied asylum seeking children with no recourse to public funds. Apply to offer accommodation here. Wandsworth Borough Council: Residents, businesses, or other landlords who could offer a property for new arrivals are being asked to register their details - they are particularly keen to hear from those with 3 to 4 bedroom properties available. To offer accommodation, contact Wandsworth Borough Council via email at [email protected]k or by phone on 020 8871 7333. Local Organisations: Care4Calais: Asking for volunteers, financial donations and donations clothes, shoes, phones or other essentials at drop off points:\nNational Organisations: Choose Love: Supporting projects providing vital aid and services to Afghan people who have fled the country: clothes, shelter, support for children and groups protecting women and children’s rights.\nBritish Red Cross: Calling for donations to help staff and volunteers provide emotional support and essential items, including warm clothes, blankets, soap, toothbrushes and nappies.\nSave the Children: Calling for donations to an emergency fund.\nAction Aid: Calling for emergency donations to help charity provide emergency humanitarian assistance including food, water, and essential items such as hygiene kits, cash, tarpaulins, tents, cooking utensils, clothing, and bedding.\nAfghanaid: Afghanaid is a British humanitarian and development organisation, currently asking for donations to assist response to the Afghan crisis\nUNICEF: Raising money to support children in Afghanistan\nUNHCR: Calling for donations to help the organisation in the distribution of family tents, hygiene kits, core relief items like blankets, sleeping mats and kitchen sets.\nThe Big Give: Delivering emergency support to families whose lives have been destroyed or uprooted by the conflict.\nMuslim Aid: Calling for donations to Afghanistan Emergency Appeal.\nIslamic Relief: Calling for donations to aid Afghan’s on the ground in Afghanistan, and when they come to the UK.\nDoctors Without Borders: The MSF teams are responding to the crisis in Afghanistan, providing medical aid, expertise and life-saving supplies during the escalating crisis. Donate here. Paiwand: Established an Afghan Resettlement Emergency Fund, supporting displaced Afghans in need of assistance.\nRefugee Council: Providing aid, including mental health support, for refugees arriving in the UK.\nThis week, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan announced London will be welcoming 150 families from Afghanistan. To each and every family coming to Tooting - you are so welcome here. Want to help those arriving from Afghanistan? Here is what you can do: Little Village: Urgently in need of warm baby clothes, 9 months - 2 years and 4 - 6 years (specifically pyjamas, snow suits, jumpers and coats). Moses baskets, muslins, small toys and activity packs also needed. Regular collections are being held at Chancery Mews, SW17 7TD and Chillerton Road, SW17 9BE. Please do check their Facebook page for more information. Tooting Community Kitchen: Urgently in need of jogging bottoms and jeans in sizes 26-34 waist, jumpers, t-shirts, coats and trainers in sizes 38-45. Donations can be dropped off Friday 9-1pm and Saturday 3-5pm at Price Close (entrance at 104 Upper Tooting Road). I was also pleased to write to the Leader of Wandsworth Council alongside my colleagues, Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney, and Marshsa De Cordova, MP for Battersea, to call on Wandsworth Council to welcome in refugees from Afghanistan and provide them with a safe place to live. The situation which has unfolded in Afghanistan is shocking and terribly regrettable. It is simply not good enough for world leaders to say the speed of the Taliban advance took them by surprise, when many have been warning of this for months. There has either been a monumental failing of our intelligence services or an unacceptable lack of transparency. Either way the Government has reacted too late. In 2010, I worked (pictured) as a Humanitarian Aid Doctor in the North West Frontier Province, on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan, following the flood crisis. I met many people who had suffered unimaginable pain at the hands of the Taliban. I am continuing to receive a high volume of emails from local residents concerned about loved ones in Afghanistan. Myself and my team are working to respond as quickly as possible. If you are worried about someone, please do not hesitate to get in touch by emailing their details to [email protected]. Please include the following information so I can take action quickly:\nWe must not allow history to repeat itself. Careless leadership from the Prime Minister enabled this tragedy to happen on his watch, while he had taken his eye off the ball. The world must not turn its back on the Afghan people. Following the recall of Parliament on Wednesday, I remain in close contact with my colleagues in the Shadow Foreign Team and will continue to be on hand to support local residents through this. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

One of the most fulfilling parts of my role as your MP is helping local people solve problems and, in this case, save money.\nA Furzedown pensioner had been denied over £12,000 in backdated pension payments and Pension Credit, however following my intervention with the Department for Work and Pensions, this money was recouped. If you have a problem with your state benefits or pension, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me and I'd be happy to help. I wish everyone in Tooting and beyond a peaceful and blessed Eid. My thoughts and prayers are especially with all those facing hardship and suffering at this time.\nMaking Wandsworth a greener and cleaner borough was a key policy in our campaign in the 2022 local elections, which is why I'm delighted that the new Labour administration in the Town Hall have now rolled out food waste recycling bins across the local area.\nThis morning, I invited residents from Tooting to share a cup of tea and a biscuit at my local coffee morning. As the local MP, I am here to help and my door is always open.\nEvery corner of Wandsworth thrives with culture and creativity. Our art, food and history are what makes our community great.\nThat's why I'm so proud that Wandsworth has been selected as London's Borough of Culture in 2025. Thanks to everyone who has worked to make this happen.\nSending my best wishes to everyone in Tooting and around the world. I hope you have a blessed Ramadan.\nSpecial thoughts and prayers going to Palestinians and all Muslims around the world enduring hardship and suffering at this time. This week marks International Women’s Day. It’s a time to celebrate all the brilliant women who make our community, the incredible place it is.\nToday, I brought together a group of fantastic leading women in business and community organisations. Their stories were inspiring and shows what women can do when we support each other. There is a disused council site on Swaffield Road which I want to see converted into a pocket park for local families. I was overwhelmed by the support that this plan has received.

I have been clear from the start that I am supportive of schemes which encourage cycling and make our streets safer. We do that by engaging in polite and respectful discussion to bring about changes collectively. I have received lots of correspondence from local residents regarding the changes that have been made to our roads as part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood and the Streetspace schemes on the A24 (Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road). As part of the Low Traffic Neighbourhood schemes, many streets have had filters put in to close the road to all vehicles except cycles and some now have turning restrictions. As part of the Streetspace scheme, a number of changes have been made to Tooting High Street/Upper Tooting Road/Balham High Road including the installation of wands to segregate cycle lanes, a number of turning restrictions as well as changes to bus stops.\nThese changes have come about as a result of statutory guidance that the Government issued in May, stating that local authorities were expected to make significant changes to their road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians “as swiftly as possible”. (If you would like to read more about this statutory guidance you can read it in full here.) As a result, TfL made £55m of funding available to the 33 councils in London as part of its “Streetspace for London” programme to urgently create new segregated cycle lanes, extend pavements and close roads to traffic. Wandsworth Council was given £1,923,500 by TfL and used this money to implement the LTNs. TfL has, in consultation with Wandsworth Council but acting separately, implemented changes to the A24. I am supportive of initiatives which reduce car usage, make our streets safer, encourage cycling and create a better local environment. But we must make it work for everyone in Tooting and Balham. I know that lots of local residents have concerns and comments about how the changes have affected our community. The only way to have your voice heard is to feed into the consultations that Wandsworth Council is running and to let TfL know what you think by emailing them. To respond to Wandsworth Council's consultation, click here. To provide feedback to TfL please email: [email protected] It is important to note that I was not consulted prior to the implementation of these changes to our roads and I have no control over the decisions that have been made. As the local MP, I can lobby the Government and the relevant Ministers, but I cannot make decisions for the Conservative Council. I am listening and engaging with local residents on this but I cannot make alterations to these changes. If you have already provided your feedback to Wandsworth Council's consultation and/or emailed TfL, and you want to raise your concerns with other officials, you may also wish to contact Wandsworth Council's Transport spokesperson Councillor John Locker via email at [email protected], or the Government's Minister of State with responsibility for cycling and walking Chris Heaton-Harris MP via email at [email protected] |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_policing-and-safety_2/content_514.html": "|\nToday, Justin Madders MP and I met with the Retail trade union Usdaw and a group of retail workers in Westminster to talk about how the cost-of-living crisis, rising violence and abuse in stores, and the impact of Christmas holiday trade is affecting the mental health of customers and colleagues.\nFar too many people are facing this Christmas period worried about how to provide for their families. With so many Usdaw members having their mental health impacted as a result of the cost-of-living crisis and increased levels of abuse in the workplace, it is deeply important that we, as politicians, take the time to listen. It was great to be joined by Wandsworth Police for my community safety event last night. We discussed local crime concerns, updated residents on local safety initiatives, and learned new ways to keep our homes safe. A big thank you to all who joined - the community feeling is strong. Additionally, it was great to hear from local residents about how we can make our area safer & about our success of the #SafeSpace campaign. Finally, we discussed future plans to tackle violence against women and girls. Many local residents have shared with me their concerns about pickpocketing in the Balham area.\nI have met with Wandsworth Police about this issue, who I know are working hard to ensure that our streets are safe. I have been assured that the police have now increased foot patrols around identified hotspots, in order to identify suspects and to tackle these worrying crimes. Unfortunately, although these crimes are reported on social media, very few of these are reported directly to the police. In order that the police can act on crime, it is vital that any offences are reported as soon as it is possible to do so, either via 999 or 101. This will help the police identify where to direct resources and provide the best opportunity to apprehend those responsible. Stay safe. The recent vigil on Clapham Common was our chance to come together and grieve the loss of Sarah Everard's life. Our chance to mourn the lives of the women lost to violence. And it was a chance to mourn our own lived experiences. I share the frustrations and disappointment felt over police action taken that day. In light of events at Clapham Common, I know many are concerned about the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, and what this divisive law would mean for the right to protest. I want to be clear: Tonight, I will be voting against this Bill. I believe that the Government has undermined this Bill through draconian measures that impose disproportionate controls on free expression and the right to protest. I believe these measures will have an unfair impact on Black, Asian, and ethnic minority people. I also believe 10 year sentences for crimes against statues – significantly longer than the sentences for crimes which disproportionately impact women – is a worrying priority. Under this Government, rape convictions have fallen to an all-time low, delays in the Crown Courts are at an all-time high, and justice is not being served for thousands of women and girls. This is now the time for the Government to correct their woeful record and commit to putting in place long overdue protections for women. In light of the recent tragic events, many residents have been in touch to share their concerns about the lighting in Tooting and Wandsworth Commons. Indeed, many women feel unable to use the Commons in the evening due to the poor lighting, whereby many of the paths are unlit. All our local residents, including women, should feel safe to access these vital green spaces, which is why I have written to Paul Chadwick, Director Environment and Community Services at Wandsworth Council, and Neil Blackley, Head of Parks at Enable, who manage Wandsworth’s green spaces on the Council’s behalf, calling for action to improve the lighting across both sites as quickly as possible. Please check back here for updates on the Council’s response. Our hearts go out to Sarah Everard's friends and family at this unspeakably difficult time. My statement on this and the #ReclaimTheseStreets vigil here: As puppy prices soar across the UK, I am aware of concerns with the recent rise of dog thefts in our community, with incidents taking place particularly on and around Tooting Common. Perpetrators have been using a number of tactics, including snatching leads from dog owners’ hands, using dog whistles to attract dogs roaming off-lead, and impersonating RSPCA employees to gain access to dogs. One strategy involves approaching people walking their dogs and informing them that their dog resembles an animal that has been reported lost, before asking to scan the dog’s microchip in their van. Once near the van, dogs are being separated from their unsuspecting owners before driving away. The RSPCA reminds that their officers will always be wearing uniforms bearing the charity’s logo and will be carrying identification, and asks that any member of the public who believes someone is impersonating an officer report the incident to the RSPCA and to local police. Suspicious activity – including being approached with questions about your dog, asking for photographs to be taken of your dog – should also be reported. I have written to Inspector Barrie Capper, Head of Wandsworth Neighbourhood Policing Team, asking them to take action to protect our pets and tackle this awful crime. In the meantime, Blue Cross have provided a helpful list of actions you can take to help keep your dog safe.\nClick here for more information. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_all_20/content_710.html": "|\nToday, the Committee's Report on the Draft Mental Health Bill has been published - this is a once in a generation opportunity to improve the rights of patients experiencing a mental health crisis and to tackle the health inequalities enshrined in current legislation.\nOver the last six months, I've been proud to work with my committee colleagues, listening to patient voices and evidence from experts. We heard heartbreaking accounts from patients. Above all else, the legislation has to protect them and ensure they receiving appropriate care. For years, the Government kicked updating this legislation into the long grass, and now, the current draft bill still does not go far enough to tackle the racial disparity of those detained under the Mental Health Act. Patient voices must be at the heart of this legislation. Read the full report here: https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt5803/jtselect/jtmentalhealth/696/report.html After cutting services through Earlsfield station for commuters since the pandemic, South Western Railway have announced that no services will run through Earlsfield from 19 December until 2 January, ostensibly due to industrial action. SWR is keeping 28 stations open in London through this period, of which 21 have lower passenger usage than Earlsfield. Only big hubs, such as Clapham Junction, Wimbledon and Waterloo, have higher passenger numbers than Earlsfield - this is simply not good enough! Add your name to my open letter calling for an immediate reconsideration of the decision not to run services through Earlsfield and a full explanation of why this decision was taken in the first place. Today, Justin Madders MP and I met with the Retail trade union Usdaw and a group of retail workers in Westminster to talk about how the cost-of-living crisis, rising violence and abuse in stores, and the impact of Christmas holiday trade is affecting the mental health of customers and colleagues.\nFar too many people are facing this Christmas period worried about how to provide for their families. With so many Usdaw members having their mental health impacted as a result of the cost-of-living crisis and increased levels of abuse in the workplace, it is deeply important that we, as politicians, take the time to listen. Recently, I visited the fantastic team at Love Triangle, a brilliant pizza restaurant situated between Balham and Tooting Bec.\nThey’ve been selling pizza to the community for two and a half years now, but things are getting increasingly difficult. The cost-of-living crisis is hitting small businesses hard, with customers having less money to spend to things such as meals out, and the cost of energy and supplies rising astronomically. Will, who owns Love Triangle, told me that despite trying many different creative ways to stay afloat, things are only getting more difficult. Love Triangle have tried different opening times, and an array of different promotions and deals to help combat the challenges, but it is still far from easy, just to keep their head above water. The rising cost of food and energy, coupled with the reduction in disposable income for many is proving a difficult picture to navigate. Speaking to Will, and other business owners in our community, one message stands out. It is crucial to support local businesses where you can, or we risk losing more of our fantastic local businesses from Tooting, and across the country. Watch my visit to Love Triangle here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1599084624847642624?s=20&t=xq-atIy2mtAe0cDqI51dLw It was great to bring together local charities, faith leaders, and leader of Wandsworth Council, Simon Hogg who are all working tirelessly to support local families through the cost-of-living crisis.\nI have already been contacted by countless Tooting residents who are concerned about how they are going to pay their bills and put food on the table this winter, and I fear this will only get worse as we move further into the winter months. With so many households already feeling the squeeze, it’s crucial that we work together to tackle poverty. Representatives from Earlsfield and Wandsworth foodbanks as well as Dons Local Action Group and Little Village Tooting told me that they are seeing unprecedented demand at present, as more and more of those who were just-about-managing become unable to afford the basics. All the organisations represented spoke of the added difficulties the rise in energy prices have brought. The hike in energy prices has meant that even the local charities who are there to address the crisis are struggling to pay their bills, and this means they are less able to help those in need. This comes at the worst possible time, when demand is at it’s highest level for decades. Everyone at the event had numerous stories of people facing hardship, people in overcrowded accommodation, people not being able to put food on the table or buy school uniforms for their children. Many people are also concerned about how they will meet the additional cost of christmas. Despite heartbreaking stories, it was uplifting to see so many people who donate their time, energy and money into making things better for people in our community. I am always amazed by the generosity of people in Tooting. However, in Britain in 2022 these organisations and charitable schemes shouldn’t have to exist. It is imperative that the Government take action immediately to support people through the months ahead. It was great to attend and speak at the annual Balham and Tooting Community Association’s multi-faith peace ceremony in Tooting Broadway.\nLocal people of all faiths and none gathered to celebrate all that unites us. We heard prayers and moving speeches from leaders of six different faiths and school students. I love representing a community where so many faiths are represented. People of all faiths and none live and work alongside each other in our community and I was honoured to be part of such a joyous occasion that celebrates our diversity and our commitment to common values of tolerance and understanding. Leaders from Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh communities spoke and prayed in their own traditions. Senior school pupils from Al Risalah Girls Secondary School spoke of what their faith means to them and their hopes for peace. This event has taken place in Tooting for many years now and it’s always an inspiring and uplifting event that I look forward to attending. It’s always fantastic to see our community come together. Thank you to all who attending and to those who worked so hard to make this event a success. I've written to the Chief Executive of Bellway on behalf of residents at Fitzgerald and Fleming Houses on St George's Grove, many of whom have been left in limbo, unable to sell or re-mortgage their properties due to the flammable cladding that was installed by Bellway, when the houses were built. In May, London Fire Brigade instituted a waking watch on both of the buildings due to fire risk, which residents were forced to pay for themselves. I have been working alongside Bellway resident directors in good faith for months but have been met with delay and excuses while their properties remain without a suitable facade. My position is clear: Developers must fund remediations works on these properties and the replacement of the cladding to the new required standard. Leaseholders cannot be held liable for these costs. To add your name to the letter, sign below. An undercover joint investigation by Sky News and The Independent has raised serious concerns about the safety of patients at inpatient settings ran by the Huntercombe Group.\nThis is the third investigation into abuse in secure inpatient mental health settings, in four weeks. The system is broken. I previously wrote to Therese Coffey, the previous Health Secretary, to raise my concerns about other similar investigations highlighting allegations of abuse, by Channel 4 Dispatches and BBC Panorama, but did not receive a response. The Government has been silent over these allegations and for weeks there wasn’t even a functioning Mental Health Minister. Patients, and their families, deserve answers. They deserve dignity, respect and access to high quality treatment, which is why I have called for a rapid review into mental health services and the way patients are treated in inpatient settings. See my statement in Parliament here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1587420289662492672?s=20&t=Gj2YhL3GB3Os4nSrRoGK7Q There were so many fantastic events across Tooting to celebrate Black History Month, which is celebrated in October.\nIt was great to see Wandsworth Council celebrate the contributions of black business owners, and other influential members of the blakc community make to our borough. Many of our local libraries were host to brilliant events where black authors could share their stories with the community. A series of videos published online celebrated the brilliant contributions to local creative industries. I know that many residents particularly enjoyed the pop up street food event celebrating some of the best cuisine from across Africa and the Caribbean. My personal highlight was attending the Roots and Culture event in Tooting, where dancers, musicians, poetry, comedy, and fantastic street food stalls showed some of the best of African and Caribbean culture. It was great to see how well attended all these events were, and great to see our community coming together to celebrate the cultures of the black communities here in Tooting. Thank you to everyone who attended and helped to organise these events! I was deeply concerned to hear pupils at Graveney School in Tooting were being targeted in a recent spate of muggings. I have been in touch with local police leadership to insist on swift action to address this issue. I know that the police are actively working to identify and arrest those responsible.\nEvery child deserves to walk our streets without fear. I am therefore pleased to hear that the local police force are carrying out high visibility patrols and are carrying out regular weapon sweeps around the school. Police are also patrolling the area in unmarked cars to try and identify and arrest the suspects. Pupils at Graveney School have also received assemblies on how to keep safe and how to report a street crime. The local police have also liaised with local CCTV to ensure appropriate coverage. It is vital that all of these issues are reported to the police so they can bring these worrying incidents to an end as quickly as possible. Anyone who has been a victim of a street robbery in this area who is yet to report the incident to the police are advised to do so. Please be assured, I will continue to work with our local police team to resolve this issue as quickly as possible, and I will continue to follow this case as a matter of urgency. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_ae/content_304.html": "|\nIt was fantastic to join Dermot and Alison on the This Morning medical segment again; this time to talk about rashes and what to look out for.\nRashes can be difficult to see on darker skin tones and this can lead to delayed treatment and poorer outcomes, which is why it's especially important to be aware of the different symptoms and nuances.\nI was thrilled to join Dermot O'Leary and Josie Gibson for the health segment on This Morning today to talk about working as an emergency doctor in the NHS and when to seek help.\nYes, A&E departments are under huge strain and pressure, but always remember - if you need help, we are here.\nPatients experiencing a mental health crisis often find themselves stuck in A&E.\nThe Health Secretary should be ashamed. Today, I asked the Health Secretary when will he finally get his act together and back Labour's plans to recruit thousands of additional staff to bring down waiting times? See my question here Our exclusive data reveals that children in a mental health crisis spent more than 900,000 hours in A&E in England, last year. The total delays across England, in the past year alone, equate to 103 years of waiting time. This is a huge rise, up four-fold in the last decade.\nThe figures, made public through Freedom of Information requests, show the staggering number of hours that children have spent in a mental health crisis in Emergency Departments. With nowhere to turn, children with a mental illness are left to deteriorate – at which time A&E is the only place left for them to go. Emergency Departments are incredibly unsuitable settings for children in crisis, yet we’re witnessing increasingly younger children having to present to A&E in desperation. The next Labour Government will prioritise a truly preventative plan for mental health services and will put patient care first. We will ensure access to mental health professionals in every school and put an open access hub in every community, in addition to guaranteeing mental health treatment within a month for all who need it, by recruiting 8,500 new mental health staff to treat a million additional patients a year by Labour’s first term in office., funded by closing tax loopholes. Read the full article here With the Officer for National Statistics estimating that 1 in 30 Londoners now have coronavirus, and the Mayor of London declaring a major incident across all London hospitals, the ongoing situation could not be more serious. NHS services in the capital are at risk of becoming overwhelmed in just a matter of days.\nWorking as a doctor in St George’s A&E department, I understand how emotionally drained healthcare workers are feeling. Indeed, ‘overwhelmed’ was the word used by nurses, consultants and registrars at our local hospital in Tooting when they were interviewed for a special report by the BBC, with one senior staff nurse saying she has “never felt so demoralised in her life.” The report conducted by BBC London's Political Correspondent, Karl Mercer, showed the heartbreaking situation in high dependency units at St George’s. The hospital has now had to increase intensive care capacity from 60 to 120, the vast majority of which are for coronavirus patients. Wandsworth alone recorded a further 2394 cases this week – the 13th highest in London. Whilst better times are on the horizon with the recent announcement of the approved Moderna vaccine, I can only implore residents to continue to follow latest public health advice on the virus to ensure we can protect as many lives as possible. On behalf of all my colleagues working on the frontline, please stay at home. London Covid-19 doctor says soon staff will be forced to choose whose life to saveRosena Allin-Khan, a Labour MP and A&E doctor, reveals ‘heart-wrenching’ decisions facing hospital workers\nRosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting and an A&E doctor, is still working regular shifts. On Sunday she worked at St George’s hospital in her south London constituency. She explains how the coronavirus pandemic has affected staff: I’ve been an A&E doctor for 15 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this before. The departments are quieter because people are staying away from hospital, but the patients are sicker. We’re seeing a distinct rise in the numbers coming in with respiratory symptoms, who are testing Covid-19 positive. On Sunday, very early in the morning, the entire resuscitation department, where the absolute sickest patients go, was full to capacity with patients with breathing difficulties. We had to move other very ill patients to the paediatric resuscitation area to keep them safe. This is only set to get worse. We’re seeing patients now who would have only contracted the virus two weeks ago. In the coming 10 days we expect the entire A&E department will be taken up with suspected Covid-19 patients. Doctors and nurses are brave, and the A&E department is known for being on the frontline and high risk, but there’s a palpable fear among staff for three reasons. Firstly, they’re frightened for their own health and those of the people they love. When I finished my shift yesterday, which was Mother’s Day, I came back to the house and I couldn’t touch or hug my two little girls until I put all my clothes in the wash and had a shower. The second reason is that staff expect, very soon, potentially to have to make heart-wrenching choices about whose life can be saved if we don’t have enough ventilators. That goes counter to everything you’ve ever learned as a doctor or nurse – to make life-and-death decisions, where we could possibly have saved every one of those people, is unimaginable. This is what our colleagues in Italy are living through now. Third, the patterns described thus far for symptoms of coronavirus are not what we’re now seeing in the emergency department. We’re seeing young, previously very healthy people, who are ill in hospital. Some are in their 30s, and they need ventilators to stay alive. Some patients are presenting with abdominal pain, which we hadn’t heard of before. A person can come in and say they have a stomach pain, and they’re put in the “green” area of the department – but then they mention they also have a cough. Everybody should be assumed to be Covid-positive until proven otherwise at this point. There’s also a real concern among staff around the country about personal protective equipment. They either don’t have any, or if they do many feel it’s being rationed. It’s very hard to listen to some colleagues say that as a result of there not being enough equipment to go round, they’re resigned to catching the virus – it’s just a matter of when. On social distancing, the messaging from the government hasn’t been clear enough. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has banned public gatherings of more than two people. It’s clear and easy to understand. There has to be no ambiguity in the language because people’s lives depend on it. Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives. The MP for Tooting has been working in her local hospital where doctors and nurses are already dealing with cases of covid-19. She warns that many of those being treated are in their 30s and 40s.\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan is the MP for Tooting but she is also a practising doctor in A&E. She regularly goes in to do shifts in her local hospital St George's and has been in contact with her colleagues. This Sunday she took a record down for Mirror readers about the situation faced by nurses, doctors and others on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus. She said her latest shift had been a \"deeply, deeply eye-opening\" experience with previously fit and healthy people in their 30s and 40s \"attached to machines, fighting for their lives\". And she has been deeply critical of the approach taken by the government in tackling the spread of the deadly virus. \"The Prime Minister has been blase about this from the start, waiting for others to make decisions so he doesn't have to. It is costing lives,\" she said. Mirror Diary - Sunday 22 March6.30am – Leaving the HouseOn the way to work in A&E, to help out the real heroes of the frontline – the NHS staff who work day-in, day-out to keep us all safe. I am a bit apprehensive after seeing the stories that are being reported about Covid-19 and having spoken to colleagues across the country, but we need to come together at times like these for our communities. 7am – Reporting for DutyJust finished handover, which is when the day shift gets given notes on the patients who have come in overnight. There’s a very real sense that the number of cases are growing extremely quickly, something that will present a real challenge in the coming days and weeks. Some of the sickest patients that have been admitted have been young – they’re in their 30s and 40s, previously fit and well, but now fighting for their lives in Intensive Care (ICU). There was a lot of talk in January that this was a virus just like the flu that only affects older people – that simply isn’t the case. There’s a real sense of apprehension ahead of the shift – we’re all expecting a rocky road ahead in the coming days. 8am- Protective EquipmentThe first part of the shift was spent looking for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – these are masks and aprons that keep those working on the frontlines safe. While we’d all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. Frontline staff across the country are scared. We’re scared that we’re going to lose patients – we have spent years training to save every life that we can. We are scared of passing this deadly virus onto our loved ones because we don’t always have the PPE that we so desperately need. We’re scared that that if we aren’t properly protected, that we run the risk of spreading the virus between patients. It’s vital that people practice social distancing measures properly – crowded areas will only add to the number of cases, and the number of people being admitted into hospitals across the country. In the coming days and weeks, difficult decisions will be made by my colleagues in ICU about who gets a ventilator – it’s that serious. Midday – Resus overwhelmedThe whole of resus is full of patients with respiratory problems – this is the part of A&E where the sickest patients go. Patients are arriving breathless, with crackles so fine in their lungs, you can hardly hear them. Their X-rays show white lungs where normally, they would look clear and black, full of air. Major trauma, such as heart attacks and victims of car crashes, are now being moved into paediatric A&E. The situation around Covid-19 is clearly getting worse by the day. The talk amongst the team is that we feel that we will be overwhelmed in the coming days. I’m going for a refresher course on ventilators for staff – they’re also training new staff on how to use ventilators. The talk is, of course, feeling quite bleak as the day goes on – but this is what we’ve all been trained for. 4pm – Leaving A&EJust leaving A&E now – it’s been a difficult shift and a difficult Mother’s Day. At times like these, we must think about our loved ones - if we want to protect those dearest to us, we must stay indoors. I’ve just called my husband and asked him to let our daughters know that they won’t be able to cuddle me and give me their handmade presents when I get home. Instead, I’ll be getting straight in the shower and throwing my clothes in the washing machine – it is our duty to protect the ones we love. If we all work together, keeping our communities safe, we can, and we will, save lives. NHS workers battling coronavirus are facing a “national shortage” of protective clothing, HuffPost UK has been told.Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan, a working doctor who still works shifts in A&E, said scientists had told her that there were not enough body suits in the right sizes, while some doctors were only now starting to receive protective clothing.\nIt came amid new official estimates suggesting 5,000 to 10,000 people in the UK have coronavirus, leaving many doctors, nurses and other health workers at risk of infection. Last month, the World Health Organisation also warned that there was a global shortage of protective masks and body suits. One NHS source who worked at a hospital where coronavirus patients were being treated told HuffPost UK: “There were staff forced to wear oversized suits because that’s all they had. “All we have left is XL. “There is a national shortage of suits but this was raised with the government at least three weeks ago so something should have been done.” Appearing on HuffPost UK’s Commons People podcast, Allin-Khan repeated the concerns. “I held a meeting today with some people from the scientific community and they said their concern was though they had been testing out various modes of protective clothing, it turns out that there is a lack of the clothing they need available, the sizes aren’t available,” she said. “Just yesterday - because people still contact me because I’m a doctor still, to let me know what’s going on - someone said they were a GP and had only started receiving the necessary protective clothing yesterday and this has been going on for a month now. The Labour deputy leadership candidate criticised the government for moving too slowly to tackle from coronavirus. In a departure from Labour’s broad support for the government, Allin-Khan called for tougher measures to tackle the outbreak, including testing those with symptoms for the virus as a matter of course. Allin-Khan said the government’s testing programme could be “more robust”, reporting that “friends in the NHS” said people were being given “really unclear messaging”. She gave an example of two people who returned from northern Italy who phoned NHS 111 and were told to wait for a call back which did not come for five days, during which time they self isolated. When they eventually spoke again to NHS staff, they had to give their details again and had to self-isolate for eight days before finally being tested for coronavirus. Test results are also taking three to five days to materialise. Allin-Khan said: “We need to be moving quicker, people need to have a better idea of how to access testing, what it means for their daily lives. “The messaging needs to be clearer and the testing needs to be more robust.” She added: “We should have moved into the delay phase sooner than now and I don’t think we should measure our performance compared to what other countries are doing. “I think we should be looking at what’s best for us and when you look at the fact that China had the same number of cases that we already have surpassed before implementing measures we do need to be listening to what the other scientific community, for example some eminent epidemiologists, listen to what they’re saying. “Because ultimately we can’t leave the scientific community to be scapegoated for the government making bad decisions if they are proven to be wrong.” Allin-Khan meanwhile sidestepped questions on whether she wants to be shadow health secretary under the next Labour leader. “I like to focus on one thing at a time, genuinely, and I don’t think you should ever have a plan B because that’s implying you’ve accepted that your plan A won’t work out,” she said. “So I am genuinely, steely focused on winning this deputy leadership bid.” Put to her that she would be a good fit for the job, she replied: “Well I am a practising NHS doctor and I have got a master’s degree in public health and I care about our party so that’s honestly for whoever is the leader to decide.” |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_previous_33/content_731.html": "|\nI am aware of residents’ concerns regarding the planning application at 56 Glenburnie Road, which on granting would see the existing house demolished to make way for nine flats. Whilst not a conservation area, I know many are worried about the occupancy increase and a potential increase in traffic congestion, as well as the removal of the existing family home. So far, 51 residents have objected to these applications, which were approved by Wandsworth Council on December 4th 2020 with conditions. On behalf of those Glenburnie Road residents who have expressed their concerns with these proposals, I have written to the Planning Technical Support Team at Wandsworth Council to make clear the strength of feeling on this issue locally. It is important to me that concerns are properly recognised at this time. Please be assured that I remain in close communication with the local Councillor Annamarie Critchard and will continue to monitor developments on this closely. Beyond all doubt, the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated existing issues within the private renting sector. I know that many have fallen behind on household bills and rent due to financial pressures caused by many factors such as unemployment and furlough. Studies show one in four private renters have seen their earnings fall since the start of the pandemic and half a million private tenants are in rent arrears and at risk of eviction. I want to say that my thoughts are with those experiencing uncertainty. I strongly believe it is important that Ministers drop their proposals to cut UC, end the five-week wait for housing benefit, and suspend the benefit cap. Furthermore, Local Housing Allowance (LHA) should also be increased to cover average rents throughout the pandemic. In the meantime, the following organisations may be of some assistance if you are experiencing any financial difficulties: • Shelter’s online webchat and advice pages • Citizens Advice Wandsworth: 0800 144 8444 • Turn2Us (for issues relating to benefits): 0808 802 2000 For those unaware, latest Government guidance states that those with a serious mental health illness are now eligible to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.\nSerious mental health illnesses include those such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. However, this list is not exhaustive and anyone who is severely affected by a mental health problem is encouraged to contact their GP if they have not yet been invited to receive the vaccine. If you are a carer for a person with a severe mental illness, you could also be eligible. Click here for more information on eligibility or contact your GP. If you are eligible, to book or manage an existing vaccination appointment, click here. The inability to afford everyday hygiene and personal grooming essentials is sadly a growing problem. With people and families hit hard by the ongoing pandemic, hygiene poverty is a bigger problem than ever before - many are struggling to afford essential products like soap, shampoo, toothpaste, period products, and hand sanitiser. Here in Wandsworth, a new hygiene bank has opened to tackle this growing problem and alleviate the issue of hygiene poverty in our local area. As a volunteer-run project, all the money raised by the hygiene bank goes directly towards providing much-needed essentials for local residents, with all donated products distributed to local frontline organisations in the borough. To find out more about the Hygiene Bank Wandsworth, or to make a donation, see here. The issue of litter in our local area is not a new problem. Indeed, back in 2019 I provided Wandsworth Council with a number of solutions to this issue, which were not acknowledged or enacted upon. I have recently been inundated with complaints from residents who have received Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs). As you may know, FPNs cannot be appealed, and I am concerned about the lack of oversight and accountability this procedure affords. It is clear from the litter on our streets that fining residents for putting out their household waste is not defeating the issue of fly-tipping. Fly-tipping fines need to be issued to the right people, for the right reasons – to deter genuine incidences of fly-tipping. Instead of being a deterrent, I am concerned that these fly-tipping fines are being misused as a Council cash-grab – making money from hardworking residents under the guise of keeping our streets clean. I have written to Paul Martin, Chief Executive at Wandsworth Council, and Paul Chadwick, Director of Environment and Community Services, to ask what action they will take to address these concerns. Keep an eye out for updates here.\nWhen the water has been turned off, the water flow can disturb sediment in the pipes, which can then cause the water to appear to be dark in colour. I have been in contact with Thames Water regarding this and they have assured me that it is not harmful.\nWith the colder weather, Thames Water have also advised the following to help prevent water leaks: • Check pipes – thaw frozen pipes with a hot water bottle or a towel soaked in water • Bleed the radiators – use a radiator key to open the valve and release trapped air • Look after your central heating – get your boiler serviced often and keep the heating on low when not at home • Find your stop tap – these are usually found under the kitchen sink. Turn right to tighten and left to loosen • Keep a plumber on hand – keep details of a reputable plumber on hand and make sure to check home insurance cover In the instance that you see a leak, you can report it to Thames Water here, then phone a plumber immediately. Please do keep an eye on my Twitter, where I am posting updates on the water issues as they arise. The end of 2020 brought the news that we’d been waiting for - the first vaccine was approved for use in the UK. I’m hugely grateful to all the scientists who have made this happen. Around the world they’ve been working non-stop – just like our frontline healthcare professionals and key workers - to put a stop to this virus and allow us to get on with life as normal. Now another milestone in the vaccination programme is happening on our doorstep. St George’s is one of four sites participating in a new study to assess the safety and immune response of the Oxford-AstraZenaca jab in healthy children aged 6-17 years old. Building on previous trials of the vaccine, which have shown that it is safe, produces strong immune system responses, and has high efficacy in all adults, this trial will assess if children and young adults make a good immune response with the vaccine. I recognise that some have concerns about the vaccine, and dangerous myths circulate on social media – it’s simply not good enough to just ignore them and hope they go away. Labour has offered to work with ministers to tackle online harms. And we can all play our part in putting friends and family members at ease by reminding them that we can trust the NHS to take care of us in these difficult times. If the vaccine is good enough for scientists and the regulator, it’s good enough for my family and I. Indeed, I have joined together with a cross-party group of MPs, encouraging everyone to take up the vaccine. The video can be viewed here. We won’t see changes overnight and we still need to look out for our communities. Let's regain the spirit of coming together like we did in the first days of the pandemic and work to eradicate this virus.\nTeachers and school teams are doing a phenomenal job, and I know that digital poverty is a real worry for them, as well as for families across Tooting. Early on in the pandemic, Labour called for a set of measures that would see a mass roll-out of devices and internet access to students currently struggling to learn online, alongside steps such as ‘zero-rating’ of educational websites to ensure data charges are not putting barriers on access to education during lockdown.\nThe digital divide risks failing a generation. I am so pleased to have been able to help close this gap. I know that the Climate and Ecological Emergency (CEE) Bill is one of interest to many people here in Tooting. On 9th February, the CEE Bill was debated in a thirty-minute adjournment debate. Adjournment debates are spaces at the end of the Parliamentary day when MPs can debate a specific topic. As you may know, the CEE Bill is a Private Members Bill (Presentation Bill), meaning that it does not involve a debate or a vote in Parliament, but rather it is a way of drawing attention to an issue. I support the principles of this Bill and will therefore continue to support Parliamentary measures that seek to implement many of the principles laid out in the Bill. Indeed, I have already supported several amendments to the Environment Bill in order to improve it, such as Clause 2 for environmental targets on particulate matter and Clause 7 for Environmental Improvement Plans. I will absolutely continue to support strong and effective amendments to the Environment Bill when it returns to the House of Commons in due course. The climate crisis is an imminent threat to current and future generations. Please know that I am committed to holding the Government to account on their approach to climate change. As puppy prices soar across the UK, I am aware of concerns with the recent rise of dog thefts in our community, with incidents taking place particularly on and around Tooting Common. Perpetrators have been using a number of tactics, including snatching leads from dog owners’ hands, using dog whistles to attract dogs roaming off-lead, and impersonating RSPCA employees to gain access to dogs. One strategy involves approaching people walking their dogs and informing them that their dog resembles an animal that has been reported lost, before asking to scan the dog’s microchip in their van. Once near the van, dogs are being separated from their unsuspecting owners before driving away. The RSPCA reminds that their officers will always be wearing uniforms bearing the charity’s logo and will be carrying identification, and asks that any member of the public who believes someone is impersonating an officer report the incident to the RSPCA and to local police. Suspicious activity – including being approached with questions about your dog, asking for photographs to be taken of your dog – should also be reported. I have written to Inspector Barrie Capper, Head of Wandsworth Neighbourhood Policing Team, asking them to take action to protect our pets and tackle this awful crime. In the meantime, Blue Cross have provided a helpful list of actions you can take to help keep your dog safe.\nClick here for more information. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_mental-health_5/content_633.html": "|\nToday, the BBC revealed that in 2018 4,500 people in mental health crisis were unlawfully held in police custody due to a lack of mental health beds.\nI spoke about this matter on BBC News earlier today. There is no question that the system must change immediately. This is nothing short of a scandal. Rest assured I will be pressing the Government on this issue. Children and young people have suffered immensely during the pandemic. But the mental health crisis facing Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) is nothing new. CAMHS services are at breaking point. They were before the pandemic. Tens of thousands of children are being turned away from mental health services – support they vitally need. Parents have raised this issue. Doctors have raised this issue. The stats provide the evidence. When will the Government admit that CAMHS services need to be better resourced? “Prior to 2017, no Government invested in or prioritised mental health services.”\nI couldn’t have put it better myself - and I didn’t need to, for these are not my words. They are the words of Nadine Dorries, the Mental Health Minister. The devastation left behind by the cuts to mental health services is staggering. And who was the architect of these cuts? No one other than the new Health Secretary during his time as a Treasury Minister. This matter cannot go unaddressed. That is why in Parliament today I asked the new Health Secretary to explain why a quarter of mental health beds have been cut since 2010, why 140,000 children were turned away from mental health services last year, and, finally, if he is ashamed of his track record. See here to view the video. Last week, along with Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney, I was fortunate to visit Heathmere School - a local primary supported by the fantastic mental health charity, Place2Be. It was a wonderful opportunity to hear how Heathmere is promoting positive mental wellbeing for pupils, as well as learn more about the range of support Place2Be provides for schools across Wandsworth and the rest of the UK. During the visit, we heard first-hand from pupils who have benefitted from Heathmere’s whole school approach to mental health and Place2Be’s support. In addition, we were able to meet with Heathmere’s Headteacher, Emma Lewis, Place2Be’s Area Manager for South West London, Khalad Musse, and Place2Be’s Chief Executive Catherine Roche to discuss children’s mental health. It is so important that we shine a spotlight on the incredible work organisations, such as Place2Be, are doing to support children and young people. As we move beyond the pandemic, it is vital that we dedicate our care and attention to listening to young people to understand how we can best support them. This May marks Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) Month. BPD, also known as Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD), is a serious and complicated mental illness that around 1 in 100 people live with. A type of ‘personality disorder’, BPD affects how individuals cope with life, manage relationships, and feel emotions. Those with BPD can experience deep distress, which is often caused by previous trauma. If you would like to find out more information on BPD, Mind and Rethink - two leading mental health charities - have dedicated pages on their websites. Mind’s can be viewed here and Rethink’s here. If you are experiencing BPD, BPD World also provides information and support to those affected by personality disorders. To find out more about the support they offer, see here. It is vital that we raise awareness of BPD to ensure that people receive the support they need and deserve without feeling stigmatised. Rites for Girls is a local group which aims aims to prepare girls for that all-important transition from primary to secondary school, focusing on their wellbeing and self-esteem. Girls in Year 6 and 7 are being offered the opportunity to participate in monthly sessions over the course of the year, in which they will be taught about puberty, and learn strategies to take charge of their emotional, social, and physical wellbeing. As we look to the end of Government lockdown measures, during which time many girls have reported feeling disconnected from family and friends, the support Rites for Girls offers girls is more important than ever. Sessions will be held at the Woodfield Pavilion, Tooting Bec Common. For more information see here, or to book a place for your daughter contact [email protected]. As a new mum, it can be vital to talk and share your experiences with those in the same situation as you. No new mother should have to suffer in silence if they are struggling with their mental health. To mark Maternal Mental Health Week, I would like to share some brilliant charities and support services available for women and birthing people: Family Action offers specialist support services for parents with mental health difficulties. This includes services during pregnancy and after birth. Further information on Perinatal Support Services Family Lives can be found here. The Association for Postnatal Illness offers information and support for those experiencing postnatal depression. The APNI are available between 10am and 2pm, Monday to Friday on 0207 386 0868. Alternatively, an online chat box on the bottom left of their website can be found here. Family Lives offers confidential support, information and advice for parents. Support is available via email [email protected] or via there helpline on 0808 800 2222. PaNDAS - Postnatal Awareness and Support is a community organisation offering peer-to-peer support. PaNDAS has a free helpline, open 7 days a week, 11am to 10pm on 0808 1961 776. Alternatively, they can be contacted via email on [email protected] and a trained volunteer will aim to get back to you within 72 hours. If you are at crisis point, the Samaritans can be contacted 24/7 on 116 123. Following on from the BBC’s successful documentary in March last year, ‘Stacey Dooley: On The Psych Ward’, Stacey Dooley returned to Springfield in a moving programme aired on Tuesday (13th April 2021). Stacey Dooley: Back On The Psych Ward follows the dedicated mental health professionals working on the frontline at Springfield, as well as a number of brave patients who came forward to share their experiences of life at Springfield during lockdown. I am always exceptionally proud of everyone working in mental health across the country. As both the Shadow Minister for Mental Health and Member of Parliament for Tooting, I remain committed to ensuring that local mental health services receive the funding they deserve. With the easing of Government restrictions, The Share Community are seeking volunteer befrienders to help local residents with learning disabilities get back out into the community. Share is a registered charity with a site in Tooting providing support to adults with learning disabilities and/or autism. Their befriending project matches people with similar interests to go for walks, bike rides, or coffee. Befriending is incredibly rewarding, providing companionship to those who are socially isolated and regular contact with a friendly face outside their usual circle. I am told that reliability and being a good listener are the only prerequisites to be a volunteer befriender. If this sounds like you, Share would love to hear from you! Click here to find out more. It was a pleasure to join Basildon Councillor Gavin Callaghan as well as local Basildon organisations to talk about mental health this week. Coronavirus has had a profound impact on our mental health support services and it is always great to see a local authority listen to and work with local organisations on the front line providing help where it is most needed. We need to take inspiration from Basildon Council and create an environment at a national level where community organisations and peer support groups work in tandem with local authorities and local health services. A huge thank you to Kim Bailey of Purple Genie Life Coaching, Karen Pullen of Craig Tyler Trust, Jonathan Barrow of Sociability, and Alison Cunningham of The Listening Post, for taking part. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

The Tooting and Balham Community has rallied together to support the appeal for Ukraine since the Russian invasion in March. Since the appeal was launched, the White Eagle Club has sent 74 trucks, 112 vans, and a massive 1,800 tonnes of goods to Ukraine as part of their humanitarian aid mission. They have also provided many Ukrainian nationals who have recently fled to the UK with clothes, shoes, toiletries, and supplies for babies and infants. It’s always amazing to see the community come together to help those in need. There is however, still much more that the White Eagle Club needs, both for Ukrainian nationals arriving in the UK and to be sent to those still living in Ukraine. Items that are most in need include; medical supplies, toiletries, sanitary products and baby powder, as well as clothes for those who have recently arrived in the UK. You can donate items to 211 Balham High Street at the following times: Tuesdays: 11.00 - 20.00 Wednesday: 10.00 - 17.00 Thursday: 11.00-20.00 Friday: 10.00-17.00 Saturday 10.00-17.00 It was great to visit Mount Carmel Rehabilitation centre again recently. I’ve enjoyed working with this fantastic organisation over the last few years. Mount Carmel offers residential and day programmes to people struggling with addictions. Their Counsellors provide a series of programmes, including a range of talking therapy groups, art therapy and equine therapy, to help people overcome their addiction issues. The pandemic has left Mount Carmel more stretched than ever, with many people seeking help after relapsing or struggling with new addiction problems during the lockdowns. Despite the increased demand, the team at Mount Carmel continue to provide first class care to all their clients. I look forward to continuing to work with the team at Mount Carmel, and seeing all that they go on to achieve. If you would like to support the work they do in our community, you can donate to their Just Giving page below Tooting Bec Athletics Track reopened this summer after a successful community campaign against its closure. It was great to be at their official reopening along with local Councillor Judi Gasser.\nIt was great to meet some young athletes and see the wide range of facilities that they offer, including a seven-a-side football pitch, an eight lane track, and a state of the art fitness centre. I am so grateful we have this brilliant resource on our doorstep in Tooting. The fantastic facilities at Tooting Bec Athletics Track will be vital in helping Tooting’s children become the Olympians of tomorrow. I have no doubt that future Team GB medalists are already training here and I look forward to seeing what they all go on to achieve. It was a pleasure to invite Royal Mahal, led by Adil Javid, to the Tooting Heroes Awards in Parliament on Monday.\nAdil, and his team, have provided exemplary services to our community, delivering free food parcels to the homeless; supported soup kitchens in Tooting, Balham, Croydon, Norbury, and Purley; provided free school meals to children unable to afford a hot meal and emergency public services, namely the NHS, Police and Fire Services. I would like to send my personal thanks to the Royal Mahal team for being a shining example of a successful local business and key community hub. On behalf of the Tooting community, I wish them the best of luck in continuing to do so. On Monday 13 June, I was delighted to welcome organisations and individuals from across Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting to Parliament, in order to recognise their fantastic contributions to society in the face of adversity in the last few years. It was a sheer joy to see the pillars of our communities together in one place and I look forward to continuing to collaborate and support the inspiring people who do so much for the local area.\nI presented the following organisations and individuals with trophies for truly exceptional services in the community: Councillor Andy Gibbons, for his dedicated public service over the last three decades.

I would like to thank all those who attended - I cannot overstate how proud I am of our community. Each and every one of you is a true Tooting Hero. The Local Elections are hastily approaching on 5th May. After 44 long years of Tory rule, Wandsworth needs a breath of fresh air and a Labour council.\nOver the next four weeks, I will be out on the campaign trail - knocking on doors, delivering leaflets and working to help our fantastic Labour candidates. I would like to thank all the local residents for their support and warm welcome on the doorstep. Together we can turn Labour red this May!\nIt was so nice to be at Smallwood Primary School to learn about the fantastic work of the Chefs In Schools. It's amazing that all catering is now in-house, with chefs cooking food that has been grown by the students themselves. The children were so enthusiastic about their freshly cooked and nutritious lunches. I believe that the work we’re doing with Chefs in Schools will go a long way to promote positive attitudes and relationships with food and mealtimes for our young people. It was great to be able to support!\nThis week, we celebrated our fantastic women business owners in Tooting. Over the last two years, many women have felt a disproportionate economic hit. Women hold the key to supercharging our economy as we recover from the pandemic. Today I was delighted to welcome Anneliese Dodds MP to Tooting and meet with women business owners. I believe it is essential that we recognise the significant contribution women make and commit to tackling the challenges that they still face today. Also, we welcomed some of our community's many impressive business women and community leaders to Parliament. Tooting is home to so many - it's only right we back women in business. Lastly, a big thank you to Sir Keir Starmer MP for hosting. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_local/content_300.html": "|\nFollowing the decision to relocate children's cancer services in South East England away from St George's Hospital, I met with the Health Secretary with a cross-party group of MPs to raise our concerns.\nWhen I visited the Pinckney Ward where this care is conducted, I met with Jackson, a former patient there, and his parents, who told me that such a move would be detrimental for parents, children and the hospital alike. I have urged the Secretary to review and reconsider NHS England's decision as soon as possible. Eight years ago today, I was selected as the Tooting Labour candidate for the by-election caused by Sadiq becoming a candidate for Mayor of London.\nIt has been a huge honour and privilege to serve as the representative for the community in which I was born and raised. My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has supported me on this incredible journey.\nFollowing a recent spot inspection of HMP Wandsworth by the Chief Inspector of Prisons. an Urgent Notification was issued to the Secretary of State for Justice, meaning that the Chief Inspector has serious and immediate concerns about the day-to-day operation of the prison.\nThe report was damning and laid the blame for the deficiencies squarely at the Government's door, citing a lack of leadership at the very highest levels. I have been raising these issues for years now and my concerns have gone unheeded by this Tory Government, even after a high-profile alleged escape last autumn. Read my Twitter thread on the subject below:\nNew data published by the Environment Agency recently revealed that sewage was pumped in our local rivers, the Graveney and Wandle, for over 700 hours last year. This is equivalent to the entire month of February and demonstrates this Tory Government's complete disregard for our natural environment.\nOnly Labour has a plan to clean up our waterways and hold water companies to account by fines for illegal discharges, blocking bonuses for bosses of companies that violate the rules and holding these bosses personally criminally liable for any violations. History was made last Thursday as my friend and predecessor as MP for Tooting, Sadiq Khan, was re-elected for an unprecedented third term as Mayor of London.\nAfter weeks of hard graft, the result was a decisive victory for Sadiq and Labour with our wonderful capital rejecting the divisive, toxic politics of the Tory candidate. I look forward to continuing to work with Sadiq to make Tooting and our wider city a greener, cleaner, safer and more prosperous place to live. Yesterday, I was delighted to join CEN for their Healing our Broken Village Black Mental Health Conference at the New Testament Assembly church in Tooting.\nWith continued racial disparities in sectioning and the use of community treatment orders, more must be done to bring about much-needed change. One of the most fulfilling parts of my role as your MP is helping local people solve problems and, in this case, save money.\nA Furzedown pensioner had been denied over £12,000 in backdated pension payments and Pension Credit, however following my intervention with the Department for Work and Pensions, this money was recouped. If you have a problem with your state benefits or pension, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me and I'd be happy to help.\nMaking Wandsworth a greener and cleaner borough was a key policy in our campaign in the 2022 local elections, which is why I'm delighted that the new Labour administration in the Town Hall have now rolled out food waste recycling bins across the local area.\nThis morning, I invited residents from Tooting to share a cup of tea and a biscuit at my local coffee morning. As the local MP, I am here to help and my door is always open.\nToday's announcement by NHS England that children's cancer services will be moved away from the world-class unit at St George's Hospital is profoundly disappointing.\nAs a doctor, I am clear that this decision has not been made in the interests of patients or their families and we're losing more than 25 years of expertise in the field of children's cancer care. I'm calling on the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Victoria Atkins to immediately review this decision. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

It was an horrific experience to watch the door close on a whole generation as the Tories won a huge majority to continue their destructive and damaging agenda. But I was also hugely proud and honoured to produce the only Labour gain of the night, as I became the new MP for Putney. It was, I hope, a rare bright light in an otherwise long, dark night for all those Labour activists, members and volunteers who worked tirelessly during the election. Rosena’s help and support was vital to that win. She is my friend and colleague, as we were councillors together and she is the MP for the neighbouring constituency of Tooting. It’s sometimes forgotten how difficult it can be for prospective parliamentary candidates, especially ones who’ve never stood to be an MP before. Of course, it’s a huge honour to be given the chance to represent your local community, and to make their voices heard in the corridors of power – but you also have to put your life on hold for months, spending hardly any time with your friends and family, working and campaigning relentlessly, whatever the weather, rain or shine. And at the end of it all, there’s absolutely no guarantee you’ll get the job, especially in a marginal seat like Putney. It’s incredibly rewarding, but it’s hard work too. Rosena was there for me every step of the way, helping me, guiding me, giving me advice and encouragement and very practical support too. I cannot thank her enough. She is a real campaigner – she knows how to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in, and every single voter who meets her comes away with a positive impression and a smile on their face. I should know - we stood to be Councillors together in the same ward in 2014 - fighting a seat that had been Tory for 24 years - and we won, through sheer hard work and positive conversations. Rosena is a relentless optimist – she always finds the positives in every situation and she never gives up, no matter what. Her life-story is a true demonstration of our Labour values – she comes from an impoverished background, failed her A-levels first time around but persevered, and because of reforms introduced by a Labour government, she was able to study at Cambridge and become a doctor before becoming an MP - it shows the difference a Labour Government can make to the lives of people across our country. Rosena is now running to become the next Deputy Leader of Labour. There’s no doubt she’s the underdog in the race, but that’s never stopped her before, and I know it won’t stop her now. She would be a phenomenal Deputy Leader of our Party, and that’s why she’s got my total support. She’s got the most interesting and substantive ideas of any of the candidates, and she’s already published a fantastic Grassroots Revival manifesto of how the Labour Party can improve our campaigning practices to get back to winning ways ahead of the local elections in May. As Deputy Leader, she would be a campaigner-in-chief, not a leader-in-waiting. In Putney, I saw the real difference she made with her energy, her optimism and her campaigning skill. Thanks to Rosena’s help, we turned blue seats into red ones, and if she’s elected as the next Deputy Leader, we can start doing that across the whole country - at both a local and a national level. Let’s take Labour forward. Fleur Anderson is Labour MP for Putney. Comments are closed.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Although it wasn't the result we wanted, our fantastic team can hold their heads high in pride for their performances and spirit. A World Cup final following on from a European championship win last year is an incredible record and I am sure we will be right up there again in four years. My family were firmly glued to the sofa all tournament and many spirited debates were had about England's best player. My eldest and I were firmly Team Lauren James, while my youngest maintained throughout thaT Russo is our star. Either way, very well done once again to the Lionesses and congratulations must go to Spain too for a well-played final.\nRecently I visited the fantastic Balham Ballers holiday club, based at Ravensbourne Primary school.\nBalham Ballers provide a sports programme for young people aged five to twelve over the school holidays, focusing mainly on football but also giving young people a chance to enjoy a wide range of other sporting activities. I have loved working with the Balham Ballers team over the last few years and it has been fantastic to see them go from strength to strength. Balham Ballers are passionate about promoting a love of sports amongst both boys and girls. This is something that I am particularly supportive of. Following the Lionesses' fantastic win at the Euros earlier this month, the England football team have said \"every girl should be given the chance to play football at school.\" However, currently only 63% of schools offer equal access to football, a number that falls to just 44% at secondary schools. It was great to see so many young people in our community enjoying football, and I even took a penalty myself! To find out more about the Balham Ballers, click here. What a fantastic summer of sport we’ve been treated to! I was lucky to be able to experience the absolutely electric atmosphere at Wembley as the Lionesses roared to an inspirational victory which was one of many sensational memories from the tournament, from Russo’s backheel to Toone’s winner, I know so many young girls will be inspired to continue the wonderful legacy left by this team. The Commonwealth Games have also had a more local hero. Eden Cheng won a silver medal in the 10m synchro platform competition along with Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix. Eden is a brilliant example of our community producing talented athletes, and I am sure many will aspire to reach Eden’s success. Congratulations to Eden, and all the medal winners at the Games! Tooting Bec Athletics Track reopened this summer after a successful community campaign against its closure. It was great to be at their official reopening along with local Councillor Judi Gasser.\nIt was great to meet some young athletes and see the wide range of facilities that they offer, including a seven-a-side football pitch, an eight lane track, and a state of the art fitness centre. I am so grateful we have this brilliant resource on our doorstep in Tooting. The fantastic facilities at Tooting Bec Athletics Track will be vital in helping Tooting’s children become the Olympians of tomorrow. I have no doubt that future Team GB medalists are already training here and I look forward to seeing what they all go on to achieve. This week the Council finally listened to us! Our beloved Tooting Bec Athletics Track will be saved and get the investment it so desperately needs and deserves. To lose such a valuable asset in our community would be a devastating blow to so many of our young people. Having this track will be useful for encouraging young people to be physically active and lead a healthy lifestyle. Thank you to everyone who joined the efforts to save our track! On the eve of Tokyo 2020, Tooting is preparing to celebrate a hero of the Antwerp Games a century earlier - champion middle-distance runner Albert Hill. Hill, who took gold at the 1920 Olympics, was born and raised in Tooting. A blue plaque commemorating his outstanding achievements is now set to be erected outside his former home. The plaque was funded through community donations, and is the result of the tireless efforts of the students of Fircroft Primary School, who campaigned for its creation. Local historian Geoff Simmons said, “It’s great that Great Britain’s Olympic past is being honoured, but its future is under threat. Tooting Bec Athletics Track, home to the historic athletics club Herne Hill Harriers, and used by 80,000 young people every year, has been ruled unfit for competition and is in need of repair.” Click here to sign the petition calling on Wandsworth Tories to fund vital repairs to Tooting Track. On Sunday I had the great honour of presenting the medals and winners’ trophy to the Sinjun Grammarians under 12s cricket team - 2021 champions of the Surrey Tier Three League. Masterfully managed by Mukesh Dev, and captained with distinction by Rufus Ford, the team’s achievement is all the more remarkable on account of the club’s small size – with a membership of just over 50 junior players, Sinjun Grammarians rarely have enough players in the same age group to enter into league competitions. Their success is also astounding for the fact that the playing group, who were experiencing league competition for the first time, marched to the title unbeaten in all their 10 games. I could not be more proud of this group of talented young athletes, not only for overcoming the odds and taking the title so convincingly, but for the focus, determination, sportsmanship, and teamwork they showed along the way. This is what Tooting is all about: the players are truly a credit to themselves, their families, their club, and our community. I was absolutely bowled over by the Club’s decision to award me the title of Honorary President of Sinjun Grammarians Cricket Club. This success is undoubtedly the first of many such achievements for this passionate group of young cricketers, and I look forward to celebrating with them again in coming seasons. Well done, team! The future of Tooting Bec Athletics Track is still yet to be secured, with vital repairs still needing to be undertaken. Tooting Bec Athletics Track is a much-loved and well-utilised facility, both by local residents and the wider London community. The track is a home to schools, clubs such as Herne Hill Harriers, as well as aspiring athletes. To lose such a valuable asset would be a devastating blow to so many of our young people in our local area. Top British athletes are made at Tooting Bec Athletics Track - Jade Johnson, who represented Great Britain at two Olympics, trained at the track since childhood, as has Katie Snowden, who will represent Great Britain in Tokyo next month. By allowing the track to fall into disrepair, Wandsworth Tories are destroying the legacy of London 2012, and seriously damaging the chances of our next generation of Olympic hopefuls in the process. The deadline for the petition to save Tooting Bec Athletics Track has been extended until 1 August – click here to sign and show Wandsworth Tories how much our community cares about the future of our young people. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

I’m hugely grateful to all the scientists who have made this happen. Around the world they’ve been working non-stop – just like our frontline healthcare professionals and key workers - to put a stop to this virus and allow us to get on with life as normal. Now another milestone in the vaccination programme is happening on our doorstep. St George’s is one of four sites participating in a new study to assess the safety and immune response of the Oxford-AstraZenaca jab in healthy children aged 6-17 years old. Building on previous trials of the vaccine, which have shown that it is safe, produces strong immune system responses, and has high efficacy in all adults, this trial will assess if children and young adults make a good immune response with the vaccine. I recognise that some have concerns about the vaccine, and dangerous myths circulate on social media – it’s simply not good enough to just ignore them and hope they go away. Labour has offered to work with ministers to tackle online harms. And we can all play our part in putting friends and family members at ease by reminding them that we can trust the NHS to take care of us in these difficult times. If the vaccine is good enough for scientists and the regulator, it’s good enough for my family and I. Indeed, I have joined together with a cross-party group of MPs, encouraging everyone to take up the vaccine. The video can be viewed here. We won’t see changes overnight and we still need to look out for our communities. Let's regain the spirit of coming together like we did in the first days of the pandemic and work to eradicate this virus. Comments are closed.\n|\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_antisemitism/content_102.html": "|\nSince the horrific terrorist attacks on Israel in October, more than 1,000 incidents of antisemitic hate crimes have been reported to Community Secure Trust.\nToday, I visited their headquarters in London to see the work they are doing to tackle antisemitism. It is a stain on our society. It must be combatted and those who perpetrate it must face the full force of the law.\nNothing prepares you for seeing a colleague in tears over antisemitism.\nLabour deputy leadership hopeful, Rosena Allin-Khan, speaks about her heritage informing her fight against Jew-hate, and her commitment to mending ties with the community. “There is nothing that prepares you for seeing a colleague in tears,” says Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, one of five hopefuls standing for Labour’s deputy-leadership. Committed to winning back the trust of the community – and standing up for MPs such as Luciana Berger and Ruth Smeeth who are no longer in Westminster – Allin-Khan, currently the MP for Tooting, seems sincere in her battle against hate. She grew up as the daughter of immigrants – her father hailing from Pakistan, her mother from Poland, herself the descendent of resistance fighters killed by the Nazis. But she’s aware that hate and prejudice won’t be solved over a chat with tea and biscuits. Before her career in politics, she was a humanitarian doctor, working on the ground with Palestinians, while her mother’s family from Poland were killed by the Nazis. It’s these experiences which allow her to reconcile speaking out against Israeli policies, while committing herself to the fight against antisemitism, drawing praise from the community in carefully balancing these issues. The first of her pledges is to meet with the Jewish Labour Movement, should she get elected. It would be “essential to the restructuring” of relations, and “how we rebuild trust.” She is also keen on an education program, saying “people use antisemitic tropes and they don’t even realise what they’re doing and they repeatedly do so.” While indicating she would speak with “any group that was looking to acknowledge there was a problem, and work towards coming up with a solution to fix it” she adds that she is the “only deputy leader candidate who hasn’t nominated a leader”. She’s willing to “work with whomever the leader is” on rebuilding trust. Calling the demise in relations between the community and the party “sad” and “terrible”, she opens up about “people I know that I am very close to, who have been really brave and speaking out antisemitism in the party.” “They have received torrents of abuse and nothing’s been done about it”. “Any leader seeing something like this unfolding needs to be all over it”, she says. But was Corbyn’s team responsible? She says they were not the “cause of the antisemitic problem in Labour, I think they didn’t deal with the problem, well enough”. Yet, she’s under no illusions as to the extent of the problem, saying it must be tackled “from a grassroots membership level first and take it all the way to MPs themselves”. “The complaints process wasn’t dealt with properly”, Allin-Khan says, adding: “As people began to show antisemitic abuse .. the more they saw it wasn’t being dealt with the more they felt able to do so.” On mending ties, she wants an “independent” process for tackling complaints with “outstanding cases to be dealt with within a particular time”, and “automatic expulsion” for antisemitism, though she wouldn’t be drawn on whether she would intervene, like Tom Watson, who she is trying to succeed. Her drive to fight antisemitism is in part inspired by her heritage. “My mum’s Polish and I lost lots of family during the war. They were not Jewish, but they fought alongside Jewish friends and my great uncle died during that time, my grandma was pregnant in the Warsaw ghetto with my uncle.” “That whole experience is a very real part of my history, and it is a shared history that I understand deeply and I’m very saddened about with the Jewish community. She was embroiled in a dispute with the Israeli Deputy Ambassador in 2016, following a radio discussion about Palestinians’ access to medical aid. After revealing the two had met in person to discuss the issue, she was accused of being “bought by Zionists”, facing significant online abuse. Her response drew praise, with Dave Rich from the Community Security Trust saying it “illustrated the difference between pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist”. She says: “I am a doctor, and have been a humanitarian doctor for my whole professional life.” “It is possible, and fair, to identify areas where there could be improvement to somebody’s life and health and not to conflate that with a whole antisemitic issue. “ I will always be proud to stand up for people’s basic human rights, and I’m also very aware of my history and my shared history with the Jewish community. I feel it’s perfectly possible to manage the two.” There is absolutely no place for antisemitism within the Labour Party, and I will put all my energy into rebuilding trust with the Jewish community.\nMy first major meeting will be with Jewish Labour Movement - they are Labour's official Jewish affiliate and we must trust them. I’ll separate the complaints process from head office, making it truly independent - to begin the process of rebuilding the trust. Once that new team is in place, I'll immediately get them to review all cases, acting swiftly and expelling antisemites. For future, I'll put a time limit on when cases need to be resolved by (for now and in future). The investigation from the Equality and Human Rights Commission is not an optional piece of diversity training, it's an embarrassment that this issue has gone so far without real action. The report they produce and the actions they want Labour to take are not optional - they are legally binding. I promise to fully adopt, without hesitation - every single one of their proposed steps. We are an open party, who welcome everyone from every background, no longer can we kick these issues into the long grass and offer the bare minimum in support and process. As Deputy Leader no form of racism will be accepted in our party. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

Meeting on the second Wednesday of each month, this wonderful organisation provides a place for members to learn new skills, meet others in the community, discuss topical issues, and share interests. Previous sessions have involved everything from career mentoring and coding, to craftivism and calligraphy, while a variety of smaller groups meet to engage in more niche interests, including a supper club, which visits a new restaurant in Tooting each month, a book club, and a craft club, to name a few. Click here for more information. Many local residents have shared with me their concerns about pickpocketing in the Balham area.\nI have met with Wandsworth Police about this issue, who I know are working hard to ensure that our streets are safe. I have been assured that the police have now increased foot patrols around identified hotspots, in order to identify suspects and to tackle these worrying crimes. Unfortunately, although these crimes are reported on social media, very few of these are reported directly to the police. In order that the police can act on crime, it is vital that any offences are reported as soon as it is possible to do so, either via 999 or 101. This will help the police identify where to direct resources and provide the best opportunity to apprehend those responsible. Stay safe. For so many, our Tooting Bec Lido is a source of great local pride. During the most recent Government lockdown, I know residents have missed using Tooting Bec Lido and have felt the mental and physical pressure from not being able to swim regularly. I am so pleased that the Lido opened once again to the public from Monday 29th March and would like to thank volunteers from the South London Swimming Club for their efforts in preparation for its opening. As per previous rules, you will need to book to use the lido in advance and booking can be made via the Places Leisure app or website here: If you are going to enjoy a swim in the spring sunshine, please do make sure you follow the guidelines in place to keep everyone safe. Places Leisure have emphasised that there will be no lockers or changing facilities available at this time and that swimmers must stick to width-lane swimming only in order to abide by social distancing guidelines. As the weather gets warmer, I look forward to residents enjoying a safe, outdoor swim. Last week the Balham and Tooting Community Association (BATCA) celebrated its 15th anniversary.\nBATCA is a network of diverse individuals and organisations committed to creating a cohesive, thriving community in Balham and Tooting. Their annual events – the Fun Day on Broadwater Road, the Tooting Broadway Peace Ceremony, and the Community Heroes Awards – are local institutions. BATCA have continued their good works throughout the pandemic, moving events online and acting as a platform for groups to share news and information. BATCA are always looking to welcome new members to help them further the organisation’s aims. Click here to find out more, and to join this wonderful collective. In light of the recent tragic events, many residents have been in touch to share their concerns about the lighting in Tooting and Wandsworth Commons. Indeed, many women feel unable to use the Commons in the evening due to the poor lighting, whereby many of the paths are unlit. All our local residents, including women, should feel safe to access these vital green spaces, which is why I have written to Paul Chadwick, Director Environment and Community Services at Wandsworth Council, and Neil Blackley, Head of Parks at Enable, who manage Wandsworth’s green spaces on the Council’s behalf, calling for action to improve the lighting across both sites as quickly as possible. Please check back here for updates on the Council’s response. As we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel, many of our Tooting community are looking forward to spending time with our loved ones once again. However – for a variety of reasons – not all of us have this opportunity.\nOnly one in five children spend time with their grandparents, whilst half a million people aged 65+ go at least five days without seeing or speaking to anyone, this is a fantastic organisation. The Wiser Collective – a local intergenerational community initiative that connects older people with younger families who can benefit from their skills and experience – was formed in 2018. Before the pandemic, The Wiser Collective hosted a variety of local events to combat loneliness across the generations, including the monthly ‘Skill Share Saturdays’, where neighbours of different generations meet to make new local friends, share talents, hobbies, passions, and chat over tea and cake. During the lockdown, the group helped the elderly with shopping deliveries, the collection of prescriptions, and stopped by for doorstep chats. To find out more and get involved with this wonderful organisation, visit their website: thewisercollective.com/ For those unaware, latest Government guidance states that those with a serious mental health illness are now eligible to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.\nSerious mental health illnesses include those such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. However, this list is not exhaustive and anyone who is severely affected by a mental health problem is encouraged to contact their GP if they have not yet been invited to receive the vaccine. If you are a carer for a person with a severe mental illness, you could also be eligible. Click here for more information on eligibility or contact your GP. If you are eligible, to book or manage an existing vaccination appointment, click here. The inability to afford everyday hygiene and personal grooming essentials is sadly a growing problem. With people and families hit hard by the ongoing pandemic, hygiene poverty is a bigger problem than ever before - many are struggling to afford essential products like soap, shampoo, toothpaste, period products, and hand sanitiser. Here in Wandsworth, a new hygiene bank has opened to tackle this growing problem and alleviate the issue of hygiene poverty in our local area. As a volunteer-run project, all the money raised by the hygiene bank goes directly towards providing much-needed essentials for local residents, with all donated products distributed to local frontline organisations in the borough. To find out more about the Hygiene Bank Wandsworth, or to make a donation, see here. The issue of litter in our local area is not a new problem. Indeed, back in 2019 I provided Wandsworth Council with a number of solutions to this issue, which were not acknowledged or enacted upon. I have recently been inundated with complaints from residents who have received Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs). As you may know, FPNs cannot be appealed, and I am concerned about the lack of oversight and accountability this procedure affords. It is clear from the litter on our streets that fining residents for putting out their household waste is not defeating the issue of fly-tipping. Fly-tipping fines need to be issued to the right people, for the right reasons – to deter genuine incidences of fly-tipping. Instead of being a deterrent, I am concerned that these fly-tipping fines are being misused as a Council cash-grab – making money from hardworking residents under the guise of keeping our streets clean. I have written to Paul Martin, Chief Executive at Wandsworth Council, and Paul Chadwick, Director of Environment and Community Services, to ask what action they will take to address these concerns. Keep an eye out for updates here.\nWhen the water has been turned off, the water flow can disturb sediment in the pipes, which can then cause the water to appear to be dark in colour. I have been in contact with Thames Water regarding this and they have assured me that it is not harmful.\nWith the colder weather, Thames Water have also advised the following to help prevent water leaks: • Check pipes – thaw frozen pipes with a hot water bottle or a towel soaked in water • Bleed the radiators – use a radiator key to open the valve and release trapped air • Look after your central heating – get your boiler serviced often and keep the heating on low when not at home • Find your stop tap – these are usually found under the kitchen sink. Turn right to tighten and left to loosen • Keep a plumber on hand – keep details of a reputable plumber on hand and make sure to check home insurance cover In the instance that you see a leak, you can report it to Thames Water here, then phone a plumber immediately. Please do keep an eye on my Twitter, where I am posting updates on the water issues as they arise. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_previous_30/content_723.html": "|\nOn Tuesday, I was alerted to a team of Met Police officers stopping fast food delivery drivers and carrying out immigration checks on Mitcham Road. The only concerns I have received from local residents (which authorities were copied into) were about social distancing, for which an operation of this size seems excessive. However, the police say it was 'a road safety policing operation'. The Home Office say it was in relation to 'suspected immigration offences'. This looks like racial profiling - and under the Equalities Act 2010, this may amount to indirect discrimination due to its disproportionate impact on ethnic minority groups. If it's not unlawful, then it's definitely immoral and I cannot defend it. Our community here in Tooting is inclusive, diverse and welcoming. The celebratory nature of the police’s response to any arrests is not in line with our local values. I have met with the police since and encouraged them to focus their time on fighting crime – not targeting people at work. This May marks Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) Month. BPD, also known as Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD), is a serious and complicated mental illness that around 1 in 100 people live with. A type of ‘personality disorder’, BPD affects how individuals cope with life, manage relationships, and feel emotions. Those with BPD can experience deep distress, which is often caused by previous trauma. If you would like to find out more information on BPD, Mind and Rethink - two leading mental health charities - have dedicated pages on their websites. Mind’s can be viewed here and Rethink’s here. If you are experiencing BPD, BPD World also provides information and support to those affected by personality disorders. To find out more about the support they offer, see here. It is vital that we raise awareness of BPD to ensure that people receive the support they need and deserve without feeling stigmatised. I would like to congratulate Sadiq Khan on his return to City Hall, where he will be serving as Mayor of London for a second term. As a fellow Tooting-ite, having grown up on the Henry Prince Estate, I know our community has a sense of collective pride seeing Sadiq returned as Mayor of our incredible city. I would also like to congratulate Leonie Cooper on her re-election as Assembly Member for Merton and Wandsworth. Thank you to every single person in Tooting and across London who put their trust in the Labour Party, and thank you to all of the volunteers who hit the ground running, knocking on doors, delivering leaflets, and making phone calls. We will leave no stone unturned to get our city back on its feet. A brighter future is possible, and we’ll deliver it together. Rites for Girls is a local group which aims aims to prepare girls for that all-important transition from primary to secondary school, focusing on their wellbeing and self-esteem. Girls in Year 6 and 7 are being offered the opportunity to participate in monthly sessions over the course of the year, in which they will be taught about puberty, and learn strategies to take charge of their emotional, social, and physical wellbeing. As we look to the end of Government lockdown measures, during which time many girls have reported feeling disconnected from family and friends, the support Rites for Girls offers girls is more important than ever. Sessions will be held at the Woodfield Pavilion, Tooting Bec Common. For more information see here, or to book a place for your daughter contact [email protected]. As a new mum, it can be vital to talk and share your experiences with those in the same situation as you. No new mother should have to suffer in silence if they are struggling with their mental health. To mark Maternal Mental Health Week, I would like to share some brilliant charities and support services available for women and birthing people: Family Action offers specialist support services for parents with mental health difficulties. This includes services during pregnancy and after birth. Further information on Perinatal Support Services Family Lives can be found here. The Association for Postnatal Illness offers information and support for those experiencing postnatal depression. The APNI are available between 10am and 2pm, Monday to Friday on 0207 386 0868. Alternatively, an online chat box on the bottom left of their website can be found here. Family Lives offers confidential support, information and advice for parents. Support is available via email [email protected] or via there helpline on 0808 800 2222. PaNDAS - Postnatal Awareness and Support is a community organisation offering peer-to-peer support. PaNDAS has a free helpline, open 7 days a week, 11am to 10pm on 0808 1961 776. Alternatively, they can be contacted via email on [email protected] and a trained volunteer will aim to get back to you within 72 hours. If you are at crisis point, the Samaritans can be contacted 24/7 on 116 123. As the backdrop for the BAFTA winning series 24 Hours in A&E, St Georges is now opening their doors to the Fetal Medicine Unit in Channel 4’s new series ‘Baby Surgeons: Delivering Miracles’. The documentary follows obstetrician Professor Basky Thilaganathan and his team as they work to save the lives of unborn babies with complex medical conditions. In one moving episode, Professor Thilaganathan was seen helping parents Becky and Richard, who were told that their baby had no chance of surviving. At Becky’s nineteen week scan, baby Annie was showing signs of congenital heart failure due to pressures from a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung. In simpler terms, this meant that Annie had a tumour on her lung the size of a malteaser. Owing to developments in medicine, Professor Thilaganathan was able to complete a non-invasive operation immediately on Becky and Annie by placing a tube near the mass, and feeding a laser through it, to zap and kill a rogue blood vessel. Remarkably, despite the parents being told that Annie’s heart could stop at any time, the procedure was successful and Becky gave birth to Annie several months later, with no signs of the surgery she had undergone before she was born. This is, yet again, proof of what amazing talent and humanity we have here in Tooting. It was a pleasure to get out on the doorstep with our Greater London Authority candidate for South London, Candice Atterton, today! Alongside Candice and Ruth Cadbury MP for Brentford and Isleworth, it was a privilege to visit Hounslow Youth Counselling Service. The post-pandemic recovery must have young people at its heart, so it was fantastic to spend the morning hearing about the great work taking place in Hounslow to support and champion young people’s mental health. With her background in youth work and youth justice, Candice is determined to focus on support and opportunities for young people. I have no doubt that she will be a great addition to Mayor Sadiq Khan’s Labour Team in City Hall! The Bike Project - a wonderful local charity which supplies refugees with old, unloved, and abandoned bicycles – is looking for someone to provide a new Tooting drop-off point. A drop-off point is a place where local residents can leave their unwanted bikes to be collected by the charity, who repairs them before they are donated to refugees and asylum seekers. With just £37.75 a week to live on, these bikes can make an enormous difference to the lives of refugees. If you are able to volunteer a space to act as a new drop-off point in our area, or to arrange a time to donate a bike, email Julia from The Bike Project at [email protected]. We have been blessed with wonderful sunshine throughout this week, which has undoubtedly brought out the best of our surroundings here in Tooting. Working in St George’s Hospital, I know what a real difference the green spaces in the grounds make to patients, visitors and staff alike. I would therefore like to express my sincere thanks to the hospital gardening team, in particular their Head of Gardening, John Greco, who have put their all into this wonderful display of spring blooms for us all to enjoy. The bright array of tulips and blossom trees will no doubt be a great comfort to what is an often anxious time for patients and visitors to the hospital. Thank you team! Several cases of the South African variant of Covid-19 has been found in Wandsworth, and the Council is encouraging everyone over the age of 11 who lives, works in, or travels through Wandsworth to book a PCR test – including those of us who have had the vaccine, even if you are not showing any symptoms.\nPCR testing sites have opened across Wandsworth, including one at Tooting Leisure Centre by appointment only. Tests can also be ordered online, or collected without an appointment at Wandsworth Town Hall. Tests are also available on a strictly appointment-only basis at many local pharmacies. It is necessary to book a PCR test because although the widely available rapid lateral flow test can determine positivity for Covid-19, only the PCR test is able to detect specific variants. It is important that we are all tested because one-in-three people who have Covid-19 are asymptomatic, and could be spreading the virus without knowing it. Let’s all do our part to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 variant. Click here to order a home testing kit, or to book an appointment at a testing centre or local pharmacy. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

The Government response is poor - rejecting vital calls for a Mental Health Commissioner, refusing to ban discriminatory Community Treatment Orders and ignoring a right to culturally appropriate advocacy. Why make us wait so long and not provide any meaningful change? With waiting lists higher than ever, we need bold action on mental health. It is clear the Tories are simply not up to the job. A Labour Government must bring forward mental health reform with the recommendations of the committee at its core.\nToday, I joined Politics Live to discuss the Tories' botched Rwanda plan. The policy is an inhumane, unworkable gimmick - now they have blocked plans to protect victims of human trafficking and individuals who have supported our armed forces.\nIt's all done to appease the right of the party.\nToday's announcement by NHS England that children's cancer services will be moved away from the world-class unit at St George's Hospital is profoundly disappointing.\nAs a doctor, I am clear that this decision has not been made in the interests of patients or their families and we're losing more than 25 years of expertise in the field of children's cancer care. I'm calling on the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Victoria Atkins to immediately review this decision.\nThere was a huge turnout today for the Oxfam Lobby Day event calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. I was proud to join other MPs and charities calling for an unconditional, immediate ceasefire.\nThank you to the charities who helped support it and to all attendees, who brought a powerful energy to the room.\nTonight, I joined Robert Peston on ITV alongside Conservative MP, Paul Scully, Government Minister, Kevin Hollinrake and environmental campaigner, Fergal Sharkey to discuss the hot topics of the day. We chatted about the appalling comments made by a Tory donor about Diane Abbott and extremism in the UK.\nEvery corner of Wandsworth thrives with culture and creativity. Our art, food and history are what makes our community great.\nThat's why I'm so proud that Wandsworth has been selected as London's Borough of Culture in 2025. Thanks to everyone who has worked to make this happen.\nSending my best wishes to everyone in Tooting and around the world. I hope you have a blessed Ramadan.\nSpecial thoughts and prayers going to Palestinians and all Muslims around the world enduring hardship and suffering at this time. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_earlsfield_2/content_560.html": "|\nAs the MP for Tooting, the safety of our community is my top priority. I am delighted that more than 100 local businesses have already signed up to become a Safe Space.\nFor more details, head to the Safe Space here\nOn Small Business Saturday, I’m at the local family-run business, Lark in Earlsfield, to showcase small businesses, who are the beating heart of our community.\nThis year, make sure you show our small businesses some love and buy local.\nThis morning, I joined pupils at Garratt Park School in Earslfield to plant the 500,000th tree of Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan's Trees for London scheme.\nIt's vital that we make London a green city for the future, where everyone has access to healthy outdoor space.\nVisiting Earlsfield Primary, I saw first-hand how universal free school meals are working to produce a level playing field in schools and provide all children with a delicious and nutritious lunch.\nLunch should never be a struggle for families or a time of stress and stigma for children – and Labour Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan’s funding means it won’t be here in London. The verdict from the judges that matter: the Red Velvet cake with beetroot was a hit.\nAfter cutting services through Earlsfield station for commuters since the pandemic, South Western Railway have announced that no services will run through Earlsfield from 19 December until 2 January, ostensibly due to industrial action. SWR is keeping 28 stations open in London through this period, of which 21 have lower passenger usage than Earlsfield. Only big hubs, such as Clapham Junction, Wimbledon and Waterloo, have higher passenger numbers than Earlsfield - this is simply not good enough! Add your name to my open letter calling for an immediate reconsideration of the decision not to run services through Earlsfield and a full explanation of why this decision was taken in the first place. It was great to bring together local charities, faith leaders, and leader of Wandsworth Council, Simon Hogg who are all working tirelessly to support local families through the cost-of-living crisis.\nI have already been contacted by countless Tooting residents who are concerned about how they are going to pay their bills and put food on the table this winter, and I fear this will only get worse as we move further into the winter months. With so many households already feeling the squeeze, it’s crucial that we work together to tackle poverty. Representatives from Earlsfield and Wandsworth foodbanks as well as Dons Local Action Group and Little Village Tooting told me that they are seeing unprecedented demand at present, as more and more of those who were just-about-managing become unable to afford the basics. All the organisations represented spoke of the added difficulties the rise in energy prices have brought. The hike in energy prices has meant that even the local charities who are there to address the crisis are struggling to pay their bills, and this means they are less able to help those in need. This comes at the worst possible time, when demand is at it’s highest level for decades. Everyone at the event had numerous stories of people facing hardship, people in overcrowded accommodation, people not being able to put food on the table or buy school uniforms for their children. Many people are also concerned about how they will meet the additional cost of christmas. Despite heartbreaking stories, it was uplifting to see so many people who donate their time, energy and money into making things better for people in our community. I am always amazed by the generosity of people in Tooting. However, in Britain in 2022 these organisations and charitable schemes shouldn’t have to exist. It is imperative that the Government take action immediately to support people through the months ahead. 44 years of Tory rule in Wandsworth came to an end with Labour taking control of the Council after the local elections. Labour won 35 seats, whilst the Tories won 22. I was thrilled to play a part along with our fantastic Councillors, candidates, and activists in putting Labour into power locally.\nLabour’s historic victory here represents a new start for our borough, and it’s great to see Wandsworth’s group of Labour Councillors already taking action to help residents through the cost-of-living crisis. Talking to residents right across the borough, it was obvious to see that people in Wandsworth have rejected Conservative neglect both locally and nationally. The cost of living crisis is hitting residents hard, and it’s clear the Tories aren’t doing enough to address it. Wandsworth residents simply do not trust the Tories. The road to Labour in Government runs through our local councils, and I am hopeful this local victory will be the springboard to Labour’s general election victory. I am concerned about South Western Railway’s planned cuts to local services. Earlsfield Station could lose two trains per hour off-peak, and direct services to Shepperton could be cut. With residents gradually returning to offices, I believe that these cuts to rail services are ill-considered. In addition, if we are to tackle air pollution and reduce carbon emissions, we need to be encouraging public transport use - not making it more difficult to use. The South Western Railway’s Consultation on this matter closes on Sunday 19th September. If you are affected by these planned changes, I would encourage you to submit your view to the consultation here. It was a pleasure to visit Earlsfield Foodbank recently with local Labour councillor Graeme Henderson. The team here do incredible work in supporting those families most in need across Earlsfield. In a country as well off as ours, the fact we have so many who rely on foodbanks is nothing short of outrageous. We discussed our shared aim to end this. If you’d like to support Earlsfield Foodbank, you can donate here or add to the foodbank collection points at Sainsburys Local (Earlsfield) or Co-op on Garratt Lane. If you need support from the Earlsfield Foodbank and would like to collect some food or arrange a delivery, email or call on 07585064428. Earlsfield Foodbank is open at St Andrew’s Church (on Garratt Lane) Thursdays 9.30am - 12pm. It was a pleasure to, once again, attend the annual Nicholas Stewart Project Community Day on the Henry Prince Estate in Earlsfield. It was a real honour to have been asked to lay flowers in memory of Nicholas, who tragically lost his life seven years ago. The Nicholas Stewart Project was founded in the wake of Nicholas Stewart’s murder and encourages young people to reject negative influences in their life and turn away from knife crime. It is always so inspiring to hear the work of the NSP in supporting young people and be part of our community standing together in hope. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",

I was very proud to see that Tooting Islamic Centre raised £16,000 for the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal for relief funds.\nIt is always incredibly touching to see the love, generosity and kindness demonstrated by our fantastic community - thank you to all those that donated and to Arshad Daud, imam at TIC, for all his hard work. Donations can still be made here Recently, I visited the fantastic team at Love Triangle, a brilliant pizza restaurant situated between Balham and Tooting Bec.\nThey’ve been selling pizza to the community for two and a half years now, but things are getting increasingly difficult. The cost-of-living crisis is hitting small businesses hard, with customers having less money to spend to things such as meals out, and the cost of energy and supplies rising astronomically. Will, who owns Love Triangle, told me that despite trying many different creative ways to stay afloat, things are only getting more difficult. Love Triangle have tried different opening times, and an array of different promotions and deals to help combat the challenges, but it is still far from easy, just to keep their head above water. The rising cost of food and energy, coupled with the reduction in disposable income for many is proving a difficult picture to navigate. Speaking to Will, and other business owners in our community, one message stands out. It is crucial to support local businesses where you can, or we risk losing more of our fantastic local businesses from Tooting, and across the country. Watch my visit to Love Triangle here: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1599084624847642624?s=20&t=xq-atIy2mtAe0cDqI51dLw It was great to bring together local charities, faith leaders, and leader of Wandsworth Council, Simon Hogg who are all working tirelessly to support local families through the cost-of-living crisis.\nI have already been contacted by countless Tooting residents who are concerned about how they are going to pay their bills and put food on the table this winter, and I fear this will only get worse as we move further into the winter months.

It was great to attend and speak at the annual Balham and Tooting Community Association’s multi-faith peace ceremony in Tooting Broadway.\nLocal people of all faiths and none gathered to celebrate all that unites us. We heard prayers and moving speeches from leaders of six different faiths and school students. I love representing a community where so many faiths are represented. People of all faiths and none live and work alongside each other in our community and I was honoured to be part of such a joyous occasion that celebrates our diversity and our commitment to common values of tolerance and understanding. Leaders from Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh communities spoke and prayed in their own traditions. Senior school pupils from Al Risalah Girls Secondary School spoke of what their faith means to them and their hopes for peace. This event has taken place in Tooting for many years now and it’s always an inspiring and uplifting event that I look forward to attending. It’s always fantastic to see our community come together. Thank you to all who attending and to those who worked so hard to make this event a success. It is an honour to have been unanimously re-selected by all the local party branches and affiliated organisations to stand as Labour’s candidate for Tooting in the next general election.\nI want to say a huge thank you to all the members and affiliates who took part, and who continue to put their trust in me to represent our community. Serving as the Member of Parliament for the community I grew up in is an honour. From helping local residents with casework, playing a part in winning the council, defending our NHS and serving as the shadow Minister to Mental Health - I have the best job in the world. My job is made even greater by the fantastic support local members show me all year round, so I want to take this opportunity to say a big thank you to them all! The next election is make-or-break for our party, we simply must win. I’m looking forward to working hard to make this happen. The NHS is being dismantled, I see it every time I work a shift. More people than ever are relying on foodbanks, and the cost-of-living crisis is having a devastating impact on people locally and across the country. I will be absolutely committed to doing everything I can to put Labour into Government and make the changes this country so desperately needs. Thank you again to everyone who voted. Recently I visited the fantastic Balham Ballers holiday club, based at Ravensbourne Primary school.\nBalham Ballers provide a sports programme for young people aged five to twelve over the school holidays, focusing mainly on football but also giving young people a chance to enjoy a wide range of other sporting activities. I have loved working with the Balham Ballers team over the last few years and it has been fantastic to see them go from strength to strength. Balham Ballers are passionate about promoting a love of sports amongst both boys and girls. This is something that I am particularly supportive of. Following the Lionesses' fantastic win at the Euros earlier this month, the England football team have said \"every girl should be given the chance to play football at school.\" However, currently only 63% of schools offer equal access to football, a number that falls to just 44% at secondary schools. It was great to see so many young people in our community enjoying football, and I even took a penalty myself! To find out more about the Balham Ballers, click here. It was great to visit the wonderful volunteers at the White Eagle Club in Balham recently. The Tooting and Balham Community has rallied together to support the appeal for Ukraine since the Russian invasion in March. Since the appeal was launched, the White Eagle Club has sent 74 trucks, 112 vans, and a massive 1,800 tonnes of goods to Ukraine as part of their humanitarian aid mission. They have also provided many Ukrainian nationals who have recently fled to the UK with clothes, shoes, toiletries, and supplies for babies and infants. It’s always amazing to see the community come together to help those in need. There is however, still much more that the White Eagle Club needs, both for Ukrainian nationals arriving in the UK and to be sent to those still living in Ukraine. Items that are most in need include; medical supplies, toiletries, sanitary products and baby powder, as well as clothes for those who have recently arrived in the UK. You can donate items to 211 Balham High Street at the following times: Tuesdays: 11.00 - 20.00 Wednesday: 10.00 - 17.00 Thursday: 11.00-20.00 Friday: 10.00-17.00 Saturday 10.00-17.00 It was a pleasure to invite Royal Mahal, led by Adil Javid, to the Tooting Heroes Awards in Parliament on Monday.\nAdil, and his team, have provided exemplary services to our community, delivering free food parcels to the homeless; supported soup kitchens in Tooting, Balham, Croydon, Norbury, and Purley; provided free school meals to children unable to afford a hot meal and emergency public services, namely the NHS, Police and Fire Services. I would like to send my personal thanks to the Royal Mahal team for being a shining example of a successful local business and key community hub. On behalf of the Tooting community, I wish them the best of luck in continuing to do so. On Monday 13 June, I was delighted to welcome organisations and individuals from across Balham, Earlsfield, Furzedown and Tooting to Parliament, in order to recognise their fantastic contributions to society in the face of adversity in the last few years. It was a sheer joy to see the pillars of our communities together in one place and I look forward to continuing to collaborate and support the inspiring people who do so much for the local area.\nI presented the following organisations and individuals with trophies for truly exceptional services in the community: Councillor Andy Gibbons, for his dedicated public service over the last three decades.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_communities_4/content_558.html": "|\nBaroness Casey's independent findings of racist, misogynistic, and homophobic abuses of power within the Met Police are deeply shocking and will leave many residents in Tooting concerned that the trust between the police and our community has been shattered.\nIt is clear that there is a failure of leadership from the Home Office and today's report lays bare the scale of the challenge needed to reform the Met Police. The rot runs right through the force, so no stone can be left unturned in the push for change. I welcome the work that Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has already begun with the new Commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, in addressing these deep-rooted issues and regaining the trust of residents and victims of crime in Tooting. However, under this Home Secretary and this Conservative Government, the Met Police are lacking the leadership, ambition and resources needed to grasp the scale of this challenge. Over the last 13 years, neighbourhood policing has been decimated, whilst prosecutions for violent and sexual crimes have hit the lowest levels on record, and victims of crime are now unsure that if they report a crime, the police will even turn up. It is clear we need a Government with a plan to overhaul policing in London which will deliver cultural and systematic change. Under a Labour Government, we will overhaul policing and raise standards, with strengthened training and mandatory vetting, and the restoration of neighbourhood policing. I would like to thank our hardworking neighbourhood police officers who have always worked constructively with me and for their continuing efforts to keep our local community safe. Following my letter to Network Rail regarding step-free access at Wandsworth Common Station, I was very pleased to receive confirmation that the station will be nominated for funding in the next round of the \"Access for All\" programme.\nThis programme has funded step-free access and other accessibility measures in stations across the country, including just down the line at Balham. This is a very encouraging first step in ensuring that public transport is available and convenient for everyone in the local community. My thoughts and prayers went out to everyone affected by the recent tragic earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. I was very proud to see that Tooting Islamic Centre raised £16,000 for the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal for relief funds.\nIt is always incredibly touching to see the love, generosity and kindness demonstrated by our fantastic community - thank you to all those that donated and to Arshad Daud, imam at TIC, for all his hard work. Donations can still be made here Following reports from local residents of increased levels of speeding on Blackshaw Road, I am pleased that the police agreed to my suggestion of increased speed watches around the local area. Given that there is a nursery and St George's Hospital along this road, it is vital that speed levels are stringently enforced to ensure everyone's safety.\nI will continue to work with the police, Wandsworth Council and local councillors to keep our streets safe and accessible. To this end, I am very pleased to hear that the council is currently considering implementing a zebra crossing outside the nursery to protect both children and parents. Today, Justin Madders MP and I met with the Retail trade union Usdaw and a group of retail workers in Westminster to talk about how the cost-of-living crisis, rising violence and abuse in stores, and the impact of Christmas holiday trade is affecting the mental health of customers and colleagues.\nFar too many people are facing this Christmas period worried about how to provide for their families. With so many Usdaw members having their mental health impacted as a result of the cost-of-living crisis and increased levels of abuse in the workplace, it is deeply important that we, as politicians, take the time to listen. Recently, I visited the fantastic team at Love Triangle, a brilliant pizza restaurant situated between Balham and Tooting Bec.\nThey’ve been selling pizza to the community for two and a half years now, but things are getting increasingly difficult. The cost-of-living crisis is hitting small businesses hard, with customers having less money to spend to things such as meals out, and the cost of energy and supplies rising astronomically.

This comes at the worst possible time, when demand is at it’s highest level for decades. Everyone at the event had numerous stories of people facing hardship, people in overcrowded accommodation, people not being able to put food on the table or buy school uniforms for their children. Many people are also concerned about how they will meet the additional cost of christmas. Despite heartbreaking stories, it was uplifting to see so many people who donate their time, energy and money into making things better for people in our community. I am always amazed by the generosity of people in Tooting. However, in Britain in 2022 these organisations and charitable schemes shouldn’t have to exist. It is imperative that the Government take action immediately to support people through the months ahead. It was great to attend and speak at the annual Balham and Tooting Community Association’s multi-faith peace ceremony in Tooting Broadway.\nLocal people of all faiths and none gathered to celebrate all that unites us. We heard prayers and moving speeches from leaders of six different faiths and school students. I love representing a community where so many faiths are represented. People of all faiths and none live and work alongside each other in our community and I was honoured to be part of such a joyous occasion that celebrates our diversity and our commitment to common values of tolerance and understanding. Leaders from Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh communities spoke and prayed in their own traditions. Senior school pupils from Al Risalah Girls Secondary School spoke of what their faith means to them and their hopes for peace. This event has taken place in Tooting for many years now and it’s always an inspiring and uplifting event that I look forward to attending. It’s always fantastic to see our community come together. Thank you to all who attending and to those who worked so hard to make this event a success. I was deeply concerned to hear pupils at Graveney School in Tooting were being targeted in a recent spate of muggings. I have been in touch with local police leadership to insist on swift action to address this issue. I know that the police are actively working to identify and arrest those responsible.\nEvery child deserves to walk our streets without fear. I am therefore pleased to hear that the local police force are carrying out high visibility patrols and are carrying out regular weapon sweeps around the school. Police are also patrolling the area in unmarked cars to try and identify and arrest the suspects. Pupils at Graveney School have also received assemblies on how to keep safe and how to report a street crime. The local police have also liaised with local CCTV to ensure appropriate coverage. It is vital that all of these issues are reported to the police so they can bring these worrying incidents to an end as quickly as possible. Anyone who has been a victim of a street robbery in this area who is yet to report the incident to the police are advised to do so. Please be assured, I will continue to work with our local police team to resolve this issue as quickly as possible, and I will continue to follow this case as a matter of urgency. Recently I visited the fantastic Balham Ballers holiday club, based at Ravensbourne Primary school.\nBalham Ballers provide a sports programme for young people aged five to twelve over the school holidays, focusing mainly on football but also giving young people a chance to enjoy a wide range of other sporting activities. I have loved working with the Balham Ballers team over the last few years and it has been fantastic to see them go from strength to strength. Balham Ballers are passionate about promoting a love of sports amongst both boys and girls. This is something that I am particularly supportive of. Following the Lionesses' fantastic win at the Euros earlier this month, the England football team have said \"every girl should be given the chance to play football at school.\" However, currently only 63% of schools offer equal access to football, a number that falls to just 44% at secondary schools. It was great to see so many young people in our community enjoying football, and I even took a penalty myself!

Millions are facing starvation. How many more need to die before the Government call for a ceasefire?\nWe have heard lots about the Government's heartless Rwanda scheme. This circus is the latest saga in the Tory melodrama, but it is the most vulnerable people whose lives they're playing with. Britain is better than this cruel, cynical Tory Government. I have worked with refugees for more than a decade. I have heard their experiences of war, violence and terror. Nobody leaves their homes, communities and livelihoods unless they must. That is why I will always stand against the inhumane Rwanda Bill.\nWith the nights getting longer and recent rise in crime, some people feel uncomfortable walking in public alone. I’ve launched my Safe Space campaign, where local businesses can sign up to offer a place of safety.\nFor businesses that would like to sign-up, head to drrosena.co.uk/safespace\nIt was wonderful to attend the Furzedown Project Christmas Party with a great carol performance from local children from Penwortham Primary School. Truly brilliant to see the community come together ahead of Christmas.\nIn today’s Guardian, I reveal the scandal of new mothers being turned away from mental health services.\nFor some time, I’ve been concerned that new mothers are being left to suffer in silence. My figures show that last year, nearly 20,000 new mothers were turned away from mental health services. Maternal mental health services are being rationed. This is despite maternal illness costing the whole of society £8.1 billion a year. It is an absolute scandal. The 8,500 new staff Labour will recruit are vital to solving this crisis. Read the full article here\nOn Small Business Saturday, I’m at the local family-run business, Lark in Earlsfield, to showcase small businesses, who are the beating heart of our community.\nThis year, make sure you show our small businesses some love and buy local.\nThis morning, I joined pupils at Garratt Park School in Earslfield to plant the 500,000th tree of Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan's Trees for London scheme.\nIt's vital that we make London a green city for the future, where everyone has access to healthy outdoor space. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_afghanistan/content_182.html": "|\nThe situation which has unfolded in Afghanistan is shocking and terribly regrettable. It is simply not good enough for world leaders to say the speed of the Taliban advance took them by surprise, when many have been warning of this for months. There has either been a monumental failing of our intelligence services or an unacceptable lack of transparency. Either way the Government has reacted too late. In 2010, I worked (pictured) as a Humanitarian Aid Doctor in the North West Frontier Province, on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan, following the flood crisis. I met many people who had suffered unimaginable pain at the hands of the Taliban. I am continuing to receive a high volume of emails from local residents concerned about loved ones in Afghanistan. Myself and my team are working to respond as quickly as possible. If you are worried about someone, please do not hesitate to get in touch by emailing their details to [email protected]. Please include the following information so I can take action quickly:\nWe must not allow history to repeat itself. Careless leadership from the Prime Minister enabled this tragedy to happen on his watch, while he had taken his eye off the ball. The world must not turn its back on the Afghan people. Following the recall of Parliament on Wednesday, I remain in close contact with my colleagues in the Shadow Foreign Team and will continue to be on hand to support local residents through this.

  "http_www_drrosena_co_uk/http_www_drrosena_co_uk_news_category_all_25/content_725.html": "|\nThe Government recently released their “Plan for Health and Social Care”, in which they pledge to help the NHS recover from the coronavirus pandemic and reform the adult social care system - funded by a 1.25% increase in National Insurance payments.\nLow-paid families will now be hit with a double whammy of a Universal Credit cut and a hike in tax. In fact, some key workers will end up more than £1,000 worse off. While I have long called for investment in social care, this is not the appropriate way to fund it. Once again the Tories have put the very wealthiest above working people. I am proud to have voted against this National Insurance increase, which will be a damaging blow to so many working people in Tooting. I am concerned about South Western Railway’s planned cuts to local services. Earlsfield Station could lose two trains per hour off-peak, and direct services to Shepperton could be cut. With residents gradually returning to offices, I believe that these cuts to rail services are ill-considered. In addition, if we are to tackle air pollution and reduce carbon emissions, we need to be encouraging public transport use - not making it more difficult to use. The South Western Railway’s Consultation on this matter closes on Sunday 19th September. If you are affected by these planned changes, I would encourage you to submit your view to the consultation here. Local community champions Dons Local Action Group have joined forces with AFC Wimbledon to continue their fight against food poverty in our community. The Dons will be collecting donations at every home game this season, which will support even more families in need. The Dons are requesting donations of tinned meat, vegetables, fish, fruit, and pulses. Collection points are located by each stadium entrance. Next match day, please support this wonderful initiative in any way that you are able – the spirit of giving is what makes our Tooting community so special! Many local residents have been in touch regarding the expansion of the Cambo Oil Field, 75 miles to the west of the Shetland Islands in Scotland. I want to be clear in the fact that I oppose the expansion of the Cambo Oil Field. The climate crisis is the defining issue of our generation and should be treated with the urgency required. By expanding oil and gas exploration, we are abandoning our obligations to end the ongoing climate crisis. Ahead of COP26, we must support the end of oil and gas exploration whilst protecting our communities and jobs. It was an honour to host my first ever radio show on Riverside Radio last night on all things mental health. Mental health struggles are nothing to be ashamed of, and tackling the stigma starts with open, honest conversations. Thank you to all the wonderful listeners who called up with their mental health questions during the show, and to Sahar Beg from Tooting Community Kitchen who joined me in the studio. If you missed the show, you can listen back here. Our Tooting community always comes together in the face of adversity, and I know many local residents will want to help those impacted by the current situation in Afghanistan in any way they can. That is why I have compiled a list of organisations and charities currently working to support Afghan refugees:\nTo provide refugee accommodation: Refugees at Home: UK charity which connects those with a spare room with refugees and asylum seekers in need of somewhere to stay. Apply to be a host here. Room for Refugees: Community hosting network that offers safe, temporary homes and emotional support for insecurely-housed refugees, asylum seekers and vulnerable groups - families, the sick, the elderly and unaccompanied asylum seeking children with no recourse to public funds. Apply to offer accommodation here. Wandsworth Borough Council: Residents, businesses, or other landlords who could offer a property for new arrivals are being asked to register their details - they are particularly keen to hear from those with 3 to 4 bedroom properties available. To offer accommodation, contact Wandsworth Borough Council via email at [email protected]k or by phone on 020 8871 7333. Local Organisations: Care4Calais: Asking for volunteers, financial donations and donations clothes, shoes, phones or other essentials at drop off points:\nNational Organisations: Choose Love: Supporting projects providing vital aid and services to Afghan people who have fled the country: clothes, shelter, support for children and groups protecting women and children’s rights.\nBritish Red Cross: Calling for donations to help staff and volunteers provide emotional support and essential items, including warm clothes, blankets, soap, toothbrushes and nappies.\nSave the Children: Calling for donations to an emergency fund.\nAction Aid: Calling for emergency donations to help charity provide emergency humanitarian assistance including food, water, and essential items such as hygiene kits, cash, tarpaulins, tents, cooking utensils, clothing, and bedding.\nAfghanaid: Afghanaid is a British humanitarian and development organisation, currently asking for donations to assist response to the Afghan crisis\nUNICEF: Raising money to support children in Afghanistan\nUNHCR: Calling for donations to help the organisation in the distribution of family tents, hygiene kits, core relief items like blankets, sleeping mats and kitchen sets.\nThe Big Give: Delivering emergency support to families whose lives have been destroyed or uprooted by the conflict.\nMuslim Aid: Calling for donations to Afghanistan Emergency Appeal.\nIslamic Relief: Calling for donations to aid Afghan’s on the ground in Afghanistan, and when they come to the UK.\nDoctors Without Borders: The MSF teams are responding to the crisis in Afghanistan, providing medical aid, expertise and life-saving supplies during the escalating crisis. Donate here. Paiwand: Established an Afghan Resettlement Emergency Fund, supporting displaced Afghans in need of assistance.\nRefugee Council: Providing aid, including mental health support, for refugees arriving in the UK.\nThis week, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan announced London will be welcoming 150 families from Afghanistan. To each and every family coming to Tooting - you are so welcome here. Want to help those arriving from Afghanistan? Here is what you can do: Little Village: Urgently in need of warm baby clothes, 9 months - 2 years and 4 - 6 years (specifically pyjamas, snow suits, jumpers and coats). Moses baskets, muslins, small toys and activity packs also needed. Regular collections are being held at Chancery Mews, SW17 7TD and Chillerton Road, SW17 9BE. Please do check their Facebook page for more information. Tooting Community Kitchen: Urgently in need of jogging bottoms and jeans in sizes 26-34 waist, jumpers, t-shirts, coats and trainers in sizes 38-45. Donations can be dropped off Friday 9-1pm and Saturday 3-5pm at Price Close (entrance at 104 Upper Tooting Road). I was also pleased to write to the Leader of Wandsworth Council alongside my colleagues, Fleur Anderson, MP for Putney, and Marshsa De Cordova, MP for Battersea, to call on Wandsworth Council to welcome in refugees from Afghanistan and provide them with a safe place to live. On Monday 6 September, I’ll be live on Riverside Radio diving into why mental health matters and, perhaps most importantly, all your mental health matters. The last 18 months have been incredibly challenging for so many of us and have highlighted the importance of mental health care. We need true parity of esteem between physical and mental health. One step we can take towards reducing any stigma is by being open in our conversations around mental health. Join me for an honest, straight-talking hour, 6-7pm next Monday! And if you have any questions about mental health that you want to ask on air, please email [email protected]. With the Springfield Development well underway, I recently contacted local residents to understand the impact, if any, of ongoing works. I received a great response to the call for residents to share their experiences of the ongoing development at Springfield Village. Following the close of the consultation on 21 August 2021, I have written to David Thomas, Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer of Barratt Developments, to outline the concerns raised with me. See the letter below: It was a pleasure to visit Earlsfield Foodbank recently with local Labour councillor Graeme Henderson. The team here do incredible work in supporting those families most in need across Earlsfield. In a country as well off as ours, the fact we have so many who rely on foodbanks is nothing short of outrageous. We discussed our shared aim to end this. If you’d like to support Earlsfield Foodbank, you can donate here or add to the foodbank collection points at Sainsburys Local (Earlsfield) or Co-op on Garratt Lane. If you need support from the Earlsfield Foodbank and would like to collect some food or arrange a delivery, email or call on 07585064428. Earlsfield Foodbank is open at St Andrew’s Church (on Garratt Lane) Thursdays 9.30am - 12pm. |\nCategories\nAll\nArchives\nApril 2025\n|",
