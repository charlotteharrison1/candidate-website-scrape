  "https_www_charliedavis_uk_/https_www_charliedavis_uk_news_charlie-davis-welcomes-clear-plan-conservatives-recruit-8000-additional-full-time/content_10.html": "Charlie Davis has welcomed the Conservatives’ clear plan to recruit 8,000 additional full-time police with the full power of arrest, ensuring people across Eltham and Chislehurst feel safer in their area.\nUnder the Conservatives, there are now 20,000 more police since 2019 and overall crime has fallen by 54 per cent since 2010. This announcement will build on this success, recruiting 8,000 more full-time neighbourhood police officers with the full power of arrest – equivalent to an additional police officer for every ward in England and Wales.\nThese officers will be specifically focused on policing the local neighbourhood they are assigned to, boosting the visible police presence in communities and helping families feel safer in their area. These strengthened neighbourhood policing teams will ensure every neighbourhood will have a genuine and more continuous police officer coverage.\nThere will also be a new requirement for police forces not to offset these additional officers by diverting police officers already dedicated to neighbourhood duties, to other purposes, ensuring neighbourhood policing is prioritised. The Conservatives will also roll out the Hotspot Policing Programme nationally following its successful pilot.\nIn contrast to the Conservatives’ plan to recruit 8,000 full-time neighbourhood police with the full power of arrest, Labour would recruit just 3,000 of these equivalent officers under their pledge, leaving neighbourhood policing teams without the resources they need to keep families in Eltham and Chislehurst safe.\nCommenting, Charlie Davis said:\n“As I have written elsewhere on this site policing in Eltham and Chislehurst has been undermined by the Labour Mayor of London's closure and sell-off of our local police stations in addition to a failure to recruit enough police officers (despite the Conservative Government funding being available to do this. Our police work incredibly hard to support our communities across Eltham and Chislehurst, but we know our police need more resources to keep local residents safe.\n“That is why I welcome the announcement today that the Conservatives will recruit 8,000 more full-time police officers with the full power of arrest, over the double the number Labour have pledged.\n“The choice is clear in this election. Stick with the plan with Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives who will recruit more police and keep our area safe, or go back to square one with Keir Starmer and the Labour Party who have consistently opposed tougher measures to crack down on crime.”\nCommenting, Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister said:\n“Our 20,000 new police officers since 2019 have made a huge difference, with neighbourhood crime down 48 per cent as a result. We will now go further by hiring 8,000 more police officers, each one dedicated to their local community.\n“People deserve to feel safe in their neighbourhood. More bobbies on the beat and increased powers will give police forces the tools they need to drive down neighbourhood crime even further.\n“On the other hand, Labour has no plan and no idea how to fund more police officers. Without a plan crime will only go up, as we’ve seen in those living in areas with a Labour Police and Crime Commissioner. Our clear plan will create a more secure future for neighbourhoods up and down the country.”\nJames Cleverly, the Home Secretary said:\n“The Conservatives will always back our brave police and security services with the powers and resources needed to keep our country safe.\n“The new neighbourhood police programme we have announced today will make our streets safer.\n“The Conservatives will take bold action with a clear plan to build a more secure future for people up and down the country. Unlike Keir Starmer’s Labour Party who have no plan to keep the country safe. You only have to look to London where crime has risen under Labour rule to see the real damage the Labour Party can do to your community.”\nA summary of the Conservative policy and achievements can be found below:\n- The Conservatives have taken bold action over the last 14 years with crime falling by 54 per cent since 2010, and have recruited 20,000 new police officers since 2019, but there is more to do to improve local policing.\n- That is why the Conservatives will recruit 8,000 new full-time police officers with full power of arrest as part of a new Neighbourhood Policing Uplift Programme. This new manifesto commitment will mean a new police officer for every ward in England and Wales.\n- People expect to see police officers on the streets where they live. The Conservatives’ 8,000 extra officers will be focused solely on policing their local beat, cutting crime and helping people feel safer in their area.",

To date the developer has not met with the existing traders to explain the decision or understand the impact that it will have on their businesses.\nStefano Frigerio, Founder of Caffé Carretto which is currently based in Kidbrooke Village said, ‘I’ve been based in Kidbrooke Village since 2020 and my business, like many of the traders, has become part of the community in the Village. Now we are being told to leave without an opportunity to engage with Berkeley Homes. This decision is putting many of our livelihoods at risk, we are happy to work with Berkeley Homes to find a solution if only they would speak to us.’\nCharlie Davis said, ‘The traders in Kidbrooke Village have been a vital part of the community over the past few years and have breathed life and vibrancy into the Village. The fact they are being asked to leave without so much as a conversation with Berkeley Homes is deeply disappointing. I’m asking Berkeley to meet with me and the traders, and try to find a solution which allows the traders and new commercial tenants to coexist in harmony.’\nMore details about the campaign to keep the traders in Pegler Square can be found on the Greenwich Wire here (https://greenwichwire.co.uk/2023/12/05/kidbrooke-village-traders-who-se…;",

That is why the Conservative Government is helping hundreds of thousands of people across the country stick to their resolution by delivering high-quality grassroots sports facilities.\nFrom Belfast to Bracknell, over 1,100 projects are receiving funding towards facilities such as changing rooms, pavilions, state of the art 3G football turf, goalposts, and floodlights, improving access to sport and physical activity for local communities.\nImportantly, the Conservative Government’s multi-sport grassroots fund is investing in areas that are most in need, with at least 50 per cent spent in the most deprived and inactive local authorities.\nAs part of this investment, local communities across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will benefit from an unprecedented £12 million in 2023-24, delivering in partnership with the Scottish FA, the Irish FA, Cymru Football Foundation and Football Association of Wales. A further £9 million is also being committed across these regions for projects to be delivered through 2024-25.\nThis builds on historic investment in grassroots sport. Since 2021, the Conservative Government has helped deliver new facilities or improvements at almost 2,400 sites across the UK, getting more than 120,000 people active.\nThe Conservative Government is sticking to its plan to improve the mental and physical health of the nation and provide high-quality sports facilities across the country, ensuring a brighter future for this generation and generations to come.\nCommenting, Charlie Davis said:\n“There is a clear link between feeling your best, both mentally and physically, and exercising regularly.\n“That is why I welcome the news that the Conservative Government are helping people across Eltham and Chislehurst get active by investing £7,081 into our grassroots sports facilities.\n“The Conservative Government is sticking to its plan to make sure everyone can access the facilities they need to live an active and healthy lifestyle, ensuring a brighter future for all.”\nSports Minister Stuart Andrew said:\n“Sport and physical activity are vital to our mental health and wellbeing, and each year thousands of people make a New Year's resolution to exercise more.\n“We know that one of the major barriers in getting active is having access to high-quality sports facilities, which is why we are upgrading 1,100 more pitches, backed by investing £93 million.\n“This Government has delivered thousands of new projects across the UK with the aim of getting over 120,000 more people to get active, helping us to make big strides towards meeting our ambitious target of 3.5 million more people active by 2030.”",

Under these plans, local people will be newly empowered with any new schemes subject to a local referendum and a right to challenge existing schemes.\nThe Bill will also make sure that pay-per-mile road taxes, which are currently being explored by local Labour politicians, can never be introduced.\nThis builds on the Conservatives’ strong track record of backing drivers, including freezing fuel duty for 14 years in a row, publishing the milestone Plan for Drivers last year, and committing to invest £8.3 billion of HS2 savings to repair roads and fix potholes.\nOnly the Conservatives will take the bold action needed to end Labour’s war on motorists, delivering a clear plan to support people’s every day journeys and build a brighter future.\nCharlie Davis said:\n“The Conservatives have a strong track record of backing motorists, but Labour are desperate to tax people off the roads, from the unfair ULEZ expansion in London to blanket 20mph zones in Wales.\n“For many people in Eltham and Chislehurst the car is an essential mode of transport, which is why I welcome the Backing Drivers Bill from the Conservatives which will reverse Labour’s anti-motorist trend to support people with their every day journeys.\n“The choice is clear: Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives, who are on the side of motorists, or Labour who will continue their war on drivers if elected, taking us back to square one.”\nRishi Sunak, Prime Minister, said:\n“We are the party on the side of drivers. That’s why we have a clear plan to keep motoring costs under control and ensure people have the freedom to drive as they need to lead their daily lives.\n“We will empower drivers and local residents to challenge aggressive and punitive traffic-inducing measures, like low traffic neighbourhoods that were imposed without local consent.\n“That’s the clear choice in this election – between Labour who have launched a war on drivers in London and Wales, and our clear plan to give drivers the freedom they need to build a secure future for themselves and their children.”\nMark Harper, Transport Secretary, said:\n“We will continue to build on our clear plan for drivers and make sure they are supported in the face of Labour politicians desperate to tax them off the roads.\n“We will reverse Sadiq Khan’s unfair ULEZ expansion and rule out any blanket 20 mile an hour zones because we are on drivers’ side. And we will rule out any pay-per-mile road tax to keep costs for drivers down.\n“There’s a clear choice at this election – Labour who will continue to penalise drivers or the Conservatives who will back drivers.”\nKey Points:\nSince 2010 the Conservative Government has backed drivers by freezing fuel duty and spending billions improving roads – but Labour politicians’ imposition of 20mph speed limits and ULEZ expansion highlights the threats motorists face.\nThat is why the Conservatives will introduce a Backing Drivers Bill – enshrining in law that a Conservative government will not introduce pay per mile road taxes and will ban mayors and local councils from doing so, reversing Labour’s punitive ULEZ expansion in London and ensuring low traffic neighbourhoods and 20mph zones have local support.\nThe choice at this election is clear: the Conservatives who have a clear plan and will take bold action to back drivers – or Labour, who would penalise motorists and take us back to square one.",

But Sadiq Khan closing police stations, including Eltham, means we're not seeing the benefit of these extra police. That's why we want new police hubs in Eltham, Kidbrooke Village and Mottingham or Chislehurst.\nOne of the first duties of any government is to keep the people they serve safe, and as your MP I promise I would work to ensure residents across the Eltham and Chislehurst constituency feel secure and proud of the place we call home.\nSince 2019, the Conservative Government has delivered on their manifesto commitment to recruit 20,000 new police officers and in December announced £843m extra funding to raise police funding by 30.7% in cash terms since 2019-20.\nHowever in London, the picture on policing is more complex as the Mayor of London is responsible for the way Metropolitan Police resources are allocated. For example, in 2023 the Metropolitan Police became the only force in the country not to meet its recruitment target (leaving it 1,000 Officers short of the amount the Government wanted across London). As the Mayor is responsible for the management of policing in London, this means the role of MP has to include working with and lobbying City Hall to ensure Eltham and Chislehurst get the resources they deserves and require, something I have a track record of campaigning on already.\nMy Record\nAs a Councillor in the Royal Borough of Greenwich I had a strong record of supporting the police and campaigning against the closure of police stations. My track record includes:\n· Opposing the closure and sell-off of Eltham Police Station by the Mayor of London through a petition, questions in Council and letters to the key stakeholders.\n· Proposing alternative solutions to ensure a police presence remains in Eltham including the Council purchasing the old police station, and alternative police bases such as a local community room or opening up space in the Eltham Centre.\n· Campaigning for the Metropolitan Police to receive space for a police base in the Kidbrooke Village.\nMy record on supporting the police to be able to do their job speaks for itself and I would expand on this as the MP for Eltham and Chislehurst.\nLabour representative’s records as MP and Mayor of London\nEltham’s existing Labour MP, Clive Efford (who is standing in the new Eltham and Chislehurst seat at the next General Election) has seen both the major police stations in his existing constituency sold off while representing the area. Shooters Hill Police Station was sold under a Labour Government and Eltham Police Station by the Labour Mayor of London, so Mr Efford did not oppose either sale and did not even attend the consultation meeting about the closure of the station in Eltham. The only police base now left in the existing Eltham constituency is on the Coldharbour Estate, which has benefited from being consistently represented by Conservative Councillors since 2002.\nBased on his record, it appears residents can have no faith that Mr Efford will stand up for their interests and improve policing in the Eltham and Chislehurst constituency.\nOf more concern is Mr Efford’s failure to address the failings of the Labour Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, over the police. The substantial rise in knife crime has already been covered elsewhere, so I want to focus on a few of the many other failings which have passed without comment from Mr Efford:\n· Not recruiting enough police: Despite receiving funding to increase police numbers by around 4,500 officers, Sadiq Khan only recruited 3,500 from 2019 to 2023 – the only police force nationally to miss its target.\n· More crime but less detection: The proportion of offences where a sanction is received has more than halved over 10 years from 21% in 2012-13 to 8% in 2022-23. The decline is even more for some specific crimes like domestic abuse, rape, and other sexual offences where the sanction detection rate has dropped by over 75% in the past ten years.\n· Failing to review stop and search policies: Despite promising a review into the way stop and search can and should be used in 2020, by November 2023 Sadiq Khan had done nothing to advance this work undermining both public confidence in the police and officers' confidence in the use of this power.\nMy promise as your MP\nAs the MP for Eltham and Chislehurst I will work to ensure that you feel safe in your home, on the streets of our communities and have confidence that the police will work for you and your community.\nCentral to this will be ensuring the police have the resources necessary to do their jobs. The current government has increased funding substantially but the Mayor of London simply has not used it to recruit enough officers.\nIn addition, I will campaign to bring police bases back to our communities in Chislehurst or Mottingham, Kidbrooke Village and Eltham. More officers simply cannot be crammed into the existing, much reduced space meaning there has to be investment in local bases allowing Officers to be a more visible part of the community they work in. The current policy of police having to travel from a police base some distance from their beat is simply inefficient, wasting valuable time and energy which could be spent on better things.\nToo many police officers in London now need to travel from outside the M25 to work, it is wrong that key workers can no longer afford to live in the communities they work in. I will campaign for a review of the policy used by many Councils (especially the Royal Borough of Greenwich) of buying homes on the open market. Instead, these funds should be used to build new homes with key workers given priority to live in them.\nImproving public confidence in the police is key for individuals to feel safe and secure in their communities. We know a third of Londoners don’t feel confident in the ability of the police to protect the public and a majority lacking confidence in police handling of non-emergency calls – this has to change.\nFar too often these days better marketing appears to be thought as the answer to improving confidence but with increased crime, low levels of detection and a myriad of public failings (not least of which the handling of Just Stop Oil protestors blocking roads) the only solution here is better performance. I will work to analyse police performance in the Eltham and Chislehurst constituency and ensure that residents’ concerns are genuinely being addressed so they can have confidence that the police will support them.\nFinally, I will work to support the London police officers who work so hard to keep us safe. Allowing them to live close to where they work seems essential but also knowing that they enjoy the support of politicians in what is an exceptionally demanding job is essential. Our police deserve clarity in what we expect of them but also support when they make honest mistakes (which we all do).",

Concerns have also been raised about the unintended negative consequences for local people, particularly for disabled residents and the delays caused to emergency service responders caught up in LTNs, potentially risking lives.\nThe aim is to prevent councils having to reverse poorly implemented or locally unpopular schemes, as occurred in Labour-run council areas in Jesmond, Newcastle and Streatham Wells, London, often at significant cost.\nCouncils are also receiving strengthened guidance on setting 20mph speed limits, reminding them they should only be used in sensible and appropriate areas such as outside schools, and where safety and local support is at the heart of the decision.\nAlongside driving schemes, consultations are being launched to tackle overzealous enforcement and prevent local councils from turning drivers into ‘cash cows’ by profiting from traffic restrictions. £50 million has also been announced to upgrade traffic lights across 80 highway authorities, improving journey times and reducing congestion caused by red lights.\nThese announcements are part of the Conservative Government’s 30-point Plan for Drivers, which is already making progress to benefit motorists. Measures to crackdown on disruptive streetworks will reduce unnecessary delays to journeys and grants for schools have been launched to accelerate the rollout of electric vehicles chargepoints, making it easier for drivers to make the switch.\nMeanwhile drivers in Labour-run areas are seeing more disruption thanks to Labour’s anti-driver approach. Welsh Labour are spending £40 million to roll out blanket 20mph speed limits which will cost the Welsh economy billions and is causing huge disruption to drivers, while also refusing to build any new roads, taking the nation back to square one. Meanwhile in London, Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan is raising millions of pounds every month through his ULEZ expansion, which unfairly targets businesses and those on the lowest income with a £12.50 tax every time they want to use their car.\nOnly the Conservative Government is on the side of drivers, as they stick with the plan to reduce journey times and make driving easier, fairer and cheaper, building a brighter future.\nCharlie Davis said:\n“People across Eltham and Chislehurst rely on car journeys every day to get to work, visit the shops, and see friends and family. So, I understand the frustration when those journeys are delayed by unwanted LTNs and 20mph limits.\n“Under this Conservative Government, we’re sticking to the plan to improve journeys for drivers, ensuring local councils engage with the community ahead of any traffic schemes being introduced so that only those with support will go ahead.\n“Only Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives are on the side of drivers as they take the long-term decisions to make road journeys easier, fairer and cheaper as we build a brighter future.”\nCommenting, Transport Secretary Mark Harper MP said:\n“We want local people to have their voices heard, and any traffic schemes to have the consent of those they impact.\n“Well thought out schemes, like 20mph limits outside schools, can make our roads safer, but we are raising the bar to help ensure all traffic schemes work for everyone in the community.\n“We’re on the side of drivers, and these latest measures show we’re getting on with delivering what we promised in our Plan for Drivers – making their lives better, fairer and cheaper, and helping people travel in the way that works best for them.”",

Additional funding will help make sure that crime is effectively tackled by the police and people are kept safe in Eltham & Chislehurst.\nThis new funding is a 30.7 per cent rise in cash terms compared to 2019-20, as part of the Conservative Government’s long-term efforts to cut crime and keep our communities safe. The proposed package for 2024-25 could see a total of up to £18.4 billion pledged to support the police to cut crime, tackle anti-social behaviour and pursue county lines gangs.\nThis announcement comes weeks after the Conservative Government’s introduction of five new pieces of legislation to keep our streets safe. These will ensure criminals are locked up for longer, victims are protected, with police and intelligence services given further powers to protect us, delivering on the promise to clamp down on crime.\nThe Conservatives have already delivered on their commitment to recruit 20,000 more police officers, putting more police on our streets and cracking down on crime. Since the Conservatives came to office in 2010, their zero-tolerance approach to crime has worked, with crime down by 50 per cent, excluding fraud. Meanwhile, in areas run by Labour Police and Crime Commissioners, crime was 34 per cent higher last year than in Conservative run areas.\nThe Conservative Government is laser focused on taking the long-term decisions required to tackle crime in our communities, whilst continuing to support victims in Eltham & Chislehurst and across the country.\nCommenting, Charlie said:\n“This additional funding for our police from the Conservative Government is excellent news for Eltham & Chislehurst.

  "https_www_charliedavis_uk_/https_www_charliedavis_uk_campaigns_boosting-local-health-investments/content_32.html": "The Conservative Government has already delivered a new community Diagnostic Centre at Eltham Community Hospital. This is providing a one-stop shop where patients can get lifesaving checks and the Government is going further with new investment to increase bed capacity at the Princess Royal University Hospital (PRUH) and Queen Elizabeth Hospital. I want to improve the experience of all local residents who need to use our NHS.\nMy partner works in the NHS so I understand that there are substantial issues facing the service which need to be addressed for the residents of Eltham and Chislehurst to have access to the healthcare they need.\nI agree with the Prime Minister that one of this Government's priorities has to be dealing with the backlogs in the NHS, in particular eliminating all waits of over 52 weeks which have increased since the Covid lockdowns. I want to work with local GPs to ensure that all Eltham and Chislehurst residents should be able to see their doctor promptly, within two weeks as a reasonable starting point but ideally earlier if possible.\nThe Conservative Record\nConservatives have increased the NHS budget in real terms since being elected: According to the Nuffield Trust there has been a steady increase in spending on the NHS in England since the Conservatives were elected in 2010. A graph included in a recent report shows this clearly:\nThe King’s Fund makes the same point with the statement “Looking more recently, since the Conservative Party has been in power (2015/16), spending has increased by 2.8 per cent a year on average in real terms.”\nIn Eltham and Chislehurst, we have seen the benefit of the increased spending in improved infrastructure, with the Eltham Community Hospital opening in 2015. Many would say that it has taken time to figure out how to make best use of the Community Hospital with some initial confusion over the use of an operating theatre but the recent investment from the Government to create a Clinical Diagnostic Centre (CDC) in Eltham has been widely welcomed, being described by SENine magazine as ‘a beacon of hope’. According to SENine, the CDC will deliver MRI, CT & ultrasound, ECG equipment for heart patients, blood testing and cardio-vascular & lung function monitoring which will all support steps to improve preventative medicine provision for Eltham and Chislehurst residents.\nThere was even more good news on this front in October 2023 when it was announced that Eltham and Chislehurst residents would benefit from a second Community Diagnostics Centre (CDC) at Queen Mary’s Hospital in Sidcup. Once open, the CDC will provide more than 58,000 additional diagnostic tests annually, by expanding phlebotomy (blood tests) and establishing new CT, MRI and X-ray diagnostic services.\nIn addition, in August the Government announced the PRUH in Orpington would receive an extra £4m to upgrade emergency care which will include 16 new high dependency beds.\nHowever, it is fair to say workforce planning represents a challenge as since 2017 the number of GPs working full-time hours or more in GP practice-based settings has been steadily decreasing. Nationally, this means fewer doctors are looking after a greater numbers of patients. This increase in the number of patients per GP practice has been seen locally with a recent planning meeting revealing the patient list for the Eltham Medical Practice had increased from 11,000 in 2011 to 24,778 in March 2022. The Government has recognised this problem and increased the number of places for trainee doctors but this is clearly a long-term project which needs more investment if we are serious about increasing the number of GPs and other doctors in the UK.\nWhat will Labour do on the NHS?\nWith a Welsh Labour Government in Wales, and with health a devolved issue, it is possible to see how the Labour Party would run the NHS and compare this with the record of the Conservative Government in England\nThe key points to draw from the performance of the Welsh Government are:-\n· Waiting times are longer in NHS Wales: Almost a quarter of Wales’ population is on an NHS waiting list, with Welsh patients having to wait longer in A&E than English patient and the average wait for referral to treatment being much longer in Wales than England.\n· Welsh Labour has channelled money away from the NHS to other areas: The Welsh Government was allocated 15% more money per capita to spend on the NHS than in England (2019-20) but only chose to spend 5% more per person. According to the Nuffield Trust this smaller gap in spending is because “the Welsh government has prioritised health care slightly less aggressively and spends more on other services”.\nThe Nuffield Trust concludes that in Labour governed Wales “it is clear that patients in Wales generally wait longer for care than their English counterparts”. At the same time as this dire record was being achieved, Keir Starmer stated the Welsh Government provides a “blueprint for what Labour can do across the UK”.\nSo, residents in Eltham and Chislehurst know what to expect from a Labour Government in Westminster – longer waiting times and lower spending on the NHS than has been the case in England under the current Conservative Government.\nWhere the Labour Party nationally has promised to “hold the door wide open” to the NHS for the private sector if they win the General Election, Eltham’s current MP is much more opposed to private sector involvement in the NHS in principle, repeatedly stating that profit and improving the NHS do not go together.\nMy promise as your MP\nAs the MP for Eltham and Chislehurst, I promise to work to ensure that you have access to healthcare as and when you need it.\nWe can see what a Starmer Government would look to do by looking at the example set by the Welsh Government: longer waiting times, money being diverted to other areas and a failure to build upon the Conservative Government’s track record of improving services and health infrastructure in South East London.\nIf I am elected, I promise to campaign to ensure that there are more GP practices in Eltham and Chislehurst in the future. This is a long-term pledge to increase the number of doctors and nurses in training but also to work with the relevant NHS partners to ensure that GP services increase to address the changing needs of our local communities.",

  "https_www_charliedavis_uk_/https_www_charliedavis_uk_news_all-change-eltham-town-centre-does-labour-care-0/content_31.html": "Twice a week my morning routine involves dropping our daughter to nursery. We leave our home by Eltham Station and walk to the nursery on the other side of Eltham town centre via Orangery Lane and the High Street.\nOn my way home, I usually pop into one of Eltham’s many independent coffee shops and drop a coffee in to my mum who runs a charity shop on the High Street. So far nothing exciting, but as we walked up to the High Street this morning, I was struck by the fact the backdrop to our routine would be significantly altered in the coming months and years.\nLast week, with little fanfare, two long-running sagas of planning applications were approved at Greenwich Planning Board. The first scheme is the much-needed redevelopment of the disused Stacks site on Messeter Place with approval given to a mixed-use development, where homes and commercial units are delivered on the same development, including 36-flats. This decision is very much welcome as it will bring a site blighted by anti-social behaviour back into use whilst providing much needed housing in the heart of Eltham.\nThe second was for a 35-bedroom hotel, flats and accompanying commercial unit on Orangery Lane. The first iteration of this scheme was brought forward shortly after my election as a local councillor in 2016. In the intervening eight years it has changed significantly and in every way, from design to density, for the better something I lobbied for throughout the planning process to try and ensure a scheme wa brought forward that complimented the Orangery and the surrounding area\nDuring those eight years, there was a brief spell where the site was put up for sale as covid threw the future viability of a hotel into doubt. At the time, in my role as Deputy Leader of the Opposition on the Council, I encouraged Greenwich to purchase the site as it neighbours the Council’s own Greenwich Builds development where 40 homes are due to be delivered.\nThe Council, partly due to price and partly lack of ambition, decided not to proceed with the purchase and the opportunity to deliver a significant section of their masterplan for Eltham Town Centre in the form of Orangery Square was missed.\nThis lack of ambition is at the heart of the question mark hanging over the future of our town centre. The two schemes mentioned above are very much welcome, but have happened in the face of inaction and indifference towards Eltham from the ruling Labour Party. Just a stone's throw away from Orangery Lane, sits the now vacant site where Eltham Police Station once stood. The Police Station is now a distant memory with the developer who owns the site looking for short-term rental opportunities.\nLate last year, I wrote to the developer and it became clear that they had no plans to develop the site in the near future, instead speculating that the neighbouring BT site may become available in 15 years time. Rather than working with the developer to realise their vision of Eltham, our Labour-run Council has allowed the site to be land banked in the middle of a housing crisis. A site with enormous potential to enhance our town centre is now going to waste.\nAnd if we look at the Eltham Town Centre Masterplan 12 years on and compare it to our town centre, beyond some initial progress made using funding from the former Conservative Mayor of London, there are many missed opportunities and a public realm that after some improvement has been left to decay. Reading the Masterplan back now, there is a strategic vision that, whilst you may not agree with all of it, is ambitious for the future of Eltham.\nUnfortunately, successive Labour administrations have lacked that vision for our town centre, too focused on vanity projects such as Woolwich Works in the north of Greenwich borough. Over £45 million has been funnelled by the Council just into Woolwich Works, £25 million received from central Government through an application to the Future High Street Fund, and funding secured for a Woolwich town centre specific police team. In the same time, Eltham’s MP has failed to lead any effort for funding for our local area, and the little progress made on improving our public realm in previous years has been allowed to decline due to lack of maintenance, with broken benches and stained pavement commonplace along the High Street.\nLabour’s lack of a sensible plan isn’t limited to the decaying public realm and failure to deliver their masterplan. Speak to businesses on the High Street and they won’t just cite the lack of a strategic vision for Eltham as a reason for reluctance to expand operations or take on new commercial premises. The Labour Party has also proactively taken decisions to hamper the future prosperity of Eltham. Last year, the Council introduced emission-based parking charges which mean visitors to the town centre will now be paying £2 an hour to park in the Orangery Lane car park. Since these changes were brought in, I am yet to see the car park full.\nOr take the sorry state of the former tram sheds by McDonalds. In 2022, I asked the then Cabinet Member whether the Council had a plan for bringing the tram sheds back into use and was told that there would be news following an imminent review of the Council estate. Two years later and there is still no news as the tram sheds continue to fall further into disrepair.\nAnd what has our Labour MP had to say about the state of our town centre? Has he held his Council colleagues to account and pushed for more investment as we’ve seen in Woolwich? Has he lobbied businesses to persuade them to come to Eltham and act as anchor tenants for our High Street? Has he fought the regressive policies brought in by Labour-run Greenwich Council? No, but he got some very professional publicity photos for Small Business Saturday shot by the Council’s photographer (at the cost of the Council taxpayer).\nOur town centre and businesses cannot afford more years of Labour inaction. Changing shopping habits and covid have accelerated the change on high streets across the country, and without a plan for Eltham town centre we risk losing our high street forever.\nThat’s why as your MP, I promise on day one to:\n- Engage with businesses by starting a town centre business forum to encourage investment and give businesses a voice.\n- Lobby for a return of Eltham Lights Up to drive footfall on the High Street and boost the local economy.\n- Work with developers to ensure that new mixed-use developments deliver regeneration to our town centre as well as much needed housing.\n- Campaign in Parliament for real business rate reform to help power the recovery of our high streets.",

  "https_www_charliedavis_uk_/https_www_charliedavis_uk_news_eltham-lights-out-labour-wont-back-return-christmas-parade/content_12.html": "A Freedom of Information (FOI) request to Greenwich Council has revealed that the Labour-run authority spent £184,000 to put on the annual Sparkle in the Park event in Avery Hill Park, an increase of 34% in cost since the first event in 2020. However, the Council continues to refuse to bring back the annual Eltham Lights Up parade on Eltham High Street.\nThe Council have previously cited the need to close Eltham High Street and the associated cost as a reason the event can no longer go ahead. At the most recent Eltham Town Centre Partnership meeting, the Council suggested the event might be able to return if private enterprise and businesses based in the town centre were willing to pay for the cost of closing the High Street.\nIn recent years, a scaled down event has been held in Passey Place on Eltham High Street which cost the Council just over £5,000 for 2023, unlike the previous Eltham Lights Up parade however, this event brings little additional footfall to the wider town centre or benefit to businesses and the local economy.\nCharlie said, “Changing shopping habits have meant much change in our town centres and shopping parades. An event like the Eltham Lights Up parade has previously brought large crowds to Eltham High Street and with it significant economic benefit to our local town centre and the businesses based there. Our Labour Council have previously cited cost as a factor in not bringing back the event, but now we have found out they happily spent £184k on Sparkle in the Park this year, and that figure is almost £50k more than just three years ago.\nIf the Council can find £42 million for Woolwich Works, then they should be able to back our town centre and local businesses by committing to a Lights Up parade in 2024.”\nCouncillor Pat Greenwell, Councillor for Eltham Town and Avery Hill ward which includes Eltham High Street, said, “Local Conservatives have pushed for a return of the Eltham Lights Up parade for a number of years and I cannot understand why the Council seem to be so dead against bringing this back. Local school children in particular loved the parade, and our High Street businesses benefited too. I will continue to press for the parade’s return in 2024.”",
  "https_www_charliedavis_uk_/https_www_charliedavis_uk_news_charlie-davis-welcomes-conservatives-bold-action-deliver-even-more-out-hospital-services/content_6.html": "Coming out of the pandemic, the Conservatives took bold action to deliver more out-of-hospital services, ensuring that people can get the care they need, when they need it. But there is more to do.\nThat is why the Conservatives will expand Pharmacy First to other conditions, and build or modernise 250 GP surgeries and build 50 new Community Diagnostic Centres across England, so that patients in Eltham & Chislehurst can access the NHS more conveniently for them, whilst reducing pressure on hospitals.\nUnder the Conservatives, the plan is working and we must stick to it to make progress on improving access to primary care and cutting NHS waiting lists. Labour’s record speaks for itself, where Labour are in power in Wales, patients face the longest hospital waits in Great Britain, putting patients at risk because they have no plan to clear the backlog.\nCharlie Davis has welcomed the Conservatives’ clear plan to boost access to deliver even more out-of-hospital GP, pharmacy, and community diagnostic centres so patients across Eltham & Chislehurst can access the care when they need it, more quickly. To help understand the way in which the scheme works Charlie met with a local pharmacist who talked him through the opportunities and challenges that the Pharmacy First programme provided.\nThe existing Pharmacy First scheme, which allows patients to get treatment from their local pharmacy without needing to visit a GP, has been a great success with 98 per cent of pharmacies signed up. Building on this success, the Conservatives have pledged to expand Pharmacy First to allow for treatment of other conditions, including offering women more contraceptive options and menopause support, and providing treatment for acne and chest infections – freeing up 20 million GP appointments in total.\nThe Conservatives have also pledged to build 100 new GP surgeries and modernise 150 more, focusing on the areas of greatest need, particularly those experiencing new housing growth. This new infrastructure will support the Conservatives’ ambition to grow the general practice workforce and offer more care in the community outside of secondary care settings, ultimately keeping more patients out of hospital when they do not need to be there.\nThe Conservatives will also build 50 new Community Diagnostic Centres, on top of the 160 already built in this Parliament, to deliver a further 2.5 million checks and diagnostic tests a year once scaled. Eltham Community Hospital was the first Community Diagnostic Centre in south east London and is currently providing phlebotomy, non-obstetric ultrasound, respiratory, and dermoscopy services to local patients.\nWhere Labour are in power, patients suffer as a result of the longest hospital waits in Great Britain, putting patients at risk because they have no plan to clear the backlog.\nBy sticking to the plan, the Conservatives have ensured that record numbers can see their GP, achieved the manifesto commitment to deliver 50 million additional appointments each year in General Practice, and increased the number of health professionals working in primary care by almost 40,000.\nCharlie Davis said:\n\" As a local resident I have been pleased to see the way in which the Eltham Community Hospital has been able to support GPs, Hospitals and residents by providing specialist services like blood tests in a quick, efficient way. The Eltham Community Hospital was built by the Conservative Government and provides clear evidence of the positive way policies can impact on local residents.\nThe pandemic put huge pressure on our NHS services in Eltham & Chislehurst and as we continue with recovery, it is essential that patients receive the care they need, quickly and easily, which is why I was delighted when the Conservatives launched Pharmacy First.\n“We are sticking with the plan to improve access to care and cut NHS waiting lists so that everyone can access the treatment they need, when they need it.”\nHealth Secretary, Victoria Atkins, said:\n“Pharmacies, GPs and Community Diagnostic Centres are the backbone of our NHS. Because of bold action we have taken, they are more accessible in more places for more people.\n\"I know just how important it is for people to have access to health services and treatment close to home - and Pharmacy First and our hundreds of new Community Diagnostic Centres have been a real success story so far. But we must do more.\n“Our clear plan will continue to enable our brilliant pharmacists, GPs and CDCs to do what they do best: serving their local community and boosting capacity in our NHS. We will make the NHS faster, simpler and fairer for all.”",

During his time on the Council previously, Charlie led the opposition to Sadiq Khan's closure of Eltham Police Station and has campaigned vigorously to keep a permanent police presence in the local area.

This will be done by replacing the worst performing university courses with high-skilled apprenticeships.\nThe UK is home to four of the top ten universities globally, which play a significant role in boosting local economies. However, too many university degrees are leaving students worse off and saddled with debt.\nThat is why the Conservatives will assess the poorest performing university courses based on their drop-out rates, job progression and future earnings potential and replace these with high-skilled apprenticeships so our young people can learn the skills they need to reach their full potential.\nSince 2010, the Conservatives have created a world-class apprenticeship system that has delivered 5.8 million apprenticeships and now reaches nearly 70 per cent of all occupations.\nThe choice is clear: stick with the Conservatives under Rishi Sunak who have built a world-class apprenticeship system from the ground up and are securing the future of our young people alongside our National Service plan. Or go back to square one with Labour, who would slash apprenticeships in half across the country, denying young people of the opportunities they deserve and taking us back to square one.\nCharlie Davis said:\n“Only the Conservatives have a clear plan to give young people in Eltham & Chislehurst the opportunities they deserve for a more secure future.\n“Building on the delivery of 5.8 million apprenticeships since 2010, I am delighted that the Conservatives have now gone further by setting out a clear plan to deliver 100,000 new apprenticeships per year, helping young people to gain the valuable life skills they need for a more secure future alongside our National Service plan.\n“All of this would be at risk under Labour, who would slash apprenticeship starts by 6,830 across London, taking us back to square one.”\nRishi Sunak, Prime Minister said:\n“Improving education is the closest thing we have to a silver bullet for boosting life chances. So, it’s not fair that some university courses are ripping young people off.\n“Thanks to our plan, apprenticeships are much higher quality than they were under Labour. And now we will create 100,000 more, by putting an end to rip-off degrees and offering our young people the employment opportunities and financial security they need to thrive.\n“That’s the choice at this election – the Conservatives with our clear plan to grow the economy and give people the opportunities they need for a secure future, or Labour who have no plan and would take us back to square one.”\nGillian Keegan, Education Secretary said:\n“There are no limits to where an apprenticeship can take you. Mine took me from a car factory in Kirkby to the Cabinet.\n“When Labour were in power they pushed an arbitrary target to get half of young people to university, creating a boom in low quality degrees – leaving far too many students saddled with debt and little else.\n“The choice is clear.

This means, companies will have certainty that every year the Government will support production of energy in the UK, allowing them to continue to support the thousands of jobs and billions of pounds of revenue across the energy sector.\nSupporting continued energy production in the UK will also reduce reliance on higher-emission imports – with gas produced here at home having four times less the carbon footprint of imported liquefied natural gas.\nBy maximising the use of energy sources in the North Sea, the Conservative Government will reduce reliance on dictators like Putin in the long-term – helping to shield families from spiking energy costs.\nThe oil and gas industry supports around 200,000 jobs in the UK and adds tens of billions of pounds annually to the economy – with fossil fuel producers expected to pay around £50 billion in tax over the next five years, which can be used to fund public services and support with the cost of living.\nIn contrast, the Labour Party have confirmed they would no longer support the UK’s oil and gas sector – risking billions of pounds of revenue, increased emissions and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.\nThe jobs protected through this legislation not only support the oil and gas sector, but they require the same skills as jobs across the future of the energy sector such as offshore wind. The Conservative Government has stressed, by failing to support this legislation, the Labour Party are sacrificing this expertise in favour of sending British jobs abroad, decimating communities.\nCommenting, Charlie Davis said:\n“This Bill is a great example of the Conservatives taking the long-term decisions to safeguard the future of our energy supply.\n“By failing to support this Bill, the Labour Party are risking 26,000 energy jobs across London.\n“Not only does this support thousands of jobs, but it will also help us bolster our energy sovereignty and cutting emissions by reducing reliance on carbon intensive imported energy.”\nSecretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero Claire Coutinho MP said:\n“We’ll still need oil and gas for decades to come, even when we reach net zero in 2050, as data from the independent Climate Change Committee shows.\n“It’s just common sense to make the most of what we can produce here, rather than shipping in more fuels from foreign regimes with higher emission.\n“Sir Keir Starmer’s reckless plans to turn off the taps too soon, would send 200,000 good jobs abroad along with billions of pounds of tax revenue which we can use to support people with the cost of living. It’s irresponsible to put British energy security at risk for the sake of ideology.”"
