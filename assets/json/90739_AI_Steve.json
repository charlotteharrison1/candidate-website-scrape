  "https_www_ai-steve_co_uk_/https_www_ai-steve_co_uk_green-party-the-good-and-daft-policies-analysed/content_28.html": "SmarterUK regards itself as a “Practically Green” party that balances the urgent need to “Save the Planet” by reducing carbon emissions with well-thought-out and fully costed political policies.\nLiving sustainably is a must for everyone, but it must also be affordable. SmarterUK believes that the supposed “Green” party has scored some spectacular own goals that question their ability to Govern in the Brighton and Hove region.\nDaft Policies\n- Providing a £36.2m loan to the Brighton Eye Vanity project.\nThe Green Party, during their first stint in charge between 2011 and 2015, approved this project, which has created an annual multimillion-pound hole in the local council’s funding. Every footfall target has been missed, and the project managers have continually defaulted on loan repayments.\nThis clearly shows that the Green party lacks the commercial acumen offered by the SmarterUK party, whose ideas for electrifying Brighton Car parks and creating green fleets of electric taxis would be revenue generating for the local council.\n- Failing to get the basics right.\nAlthough the Green Party espouses “Recycling”, its failure to deliver a reliable bin collection service in the area has made this virtually impossible for many residents.\nAnybody who has walked the streets in Brighton in recent years may have stumbled and tripped over our uneven streets. Weeds have taken control after the banning of the pesticide-based weed killers the Brighton Works department used to use. Again, this green strategy has not translated into a fit-for-purpose solution.\n- Introduction of a Brighton OLEV Zones.\nThe proposed daily charge aimed at forcing people into EVs is a blunt penal taxation that will impact lower-income families most and is not appropriate for Brighton, given its current inability to support EV charging.\nSmarterUK believes in rapidly replacing polluting “Petrol” cars with much cleaner EVs. However, Brighton’s lack of off-road parking and public charging infrastructure makes it one of the hardest places in the country to own an EV.\nIf you have off-road parking, it is simple to install a home charger and access cheap overnight electricity at 5-15p per KWH, cutting the cost of running a vehicle by 50% compared to petrol equivalents.\nHowever, 65% of homes in Brighton Pavilion require on-road parking, and it is difficult to get parking permits to park in the same area as your house, let alone directly outside.\nHence, we need to convert all local car parks, which are currently only 15% used at night, into pre-bookable charging hubs.\nAt the same time, a loan fund needs to be created for partial loans to allow all Brighton Taxis to be converted to EVs immediately. EVs are ideal for high-mileage vehicles, and there is a vast range of ultra-cheap second-hand EVs in the market currently. These loans will be recovered by charging a per-mile charge of 7p, which is funded by cost savings compared to petrol and will generate a small profit for the council.\n- Narrowing of Salaries between higher and lower earners.\nAlthough a very vague Green policy with no substance behind it, SmarterUK fundamentally disagrees with it.\nThe government has shown that it cannot effectively manage public sector pay and should never interfere with the free market setting of salaries.\nThe whole point of our taxation system is to “Level” things up in society, with the rich paying a much higher percentage of the cost of delivering public services. Combined with the minimum living wage, this is more than adequate for achieving a society where everybody can afford to live and is not driven to commit crimes to survive.\nGood Policies\n- Green Transition Grants:\nThe Green Party proposes an additional £3 billion in Green Transition Grants for small businesses to help them prepare for and take advantage of opportunities offered by greening the economy.\nSmarterUK View.\nAlthough there are no details of how this £3 billion fund will be created, the SmarterUK party supports the principals and has suggested.\n- Levelling up VAT charge. Increase the VAT on online giants like Amazon to create a fund to support smaller businesses on our high streets.\n- Electrification of Brighton’s Car Parks to allow people without off-road parking to charge their EVs overnight, which is key to promoting the switch to cleaner, green EVs.\n- Loans and subsidies to help smaller taxi firms to migrate to clean EV fleets.\n- Decarbonising Transport:\nSupport for small businesses to decarbonise their transport needs, including access to electric vans and other low-carbon transport solutions on the same terms as large companies.\nSmarterUK supports this move entirely.\n- Housing:\nThe Green Party pledges to create 150,000 new council homes, abolish the Right to Buy scheme, introduce rent controls, and end no-fault evictions.\nSmarterUK supports this move entirely in principle but again requests the Green party to explain how the 150,000 new council homes will be funded, given the current state of Brighton Hove council’s financial statements.\n- NHS and Social Care:\nReversing the trend of privatisation in the NHS and significantly increasing investment in social care and support for carers.\nSmarter UK view.\nSmarterUK agrees but insists that the UK public needs to be given an honest choice between higher taxation and the repair of the NHS and education facilities. SmarterUK has stated that it will reverse the 4% cut in National insurance implemented by the Conservative Government and will invest this into a long-term 15-year fund to be managed by a cross-party panel to ensure that a long-term non-political agenda investment strategy is implemented.\n- Climate and Nature:\nStrong emphasis on funding for countries that have suffered catastrophic climate harms (Loss and Damage) and increasing the UK’s carbon reduction commitment\nSmarterUK view.\nUntil we reach carbon neutrality, all funding should be solely focused on UK projects. We have far too much work to do in our own country to contribute millions to third-party countries.\n10 Education\nFree school meals for all primary and secondary school children, increased climate awareness through education, and support for skills training services, nursery care, and schools staying in or returning to the public sector.\nSmarterUK view.\nWe support free school meals for all primary and secondary children but have no objection to privately funded educations as this should be every parent’s right of choice.",

  "https_www_ai-steve_co_uk_/https_www_ai-steve_co_uk_policies_smarteruk-green-policy-driving-the-ev-revolution/content_36.html": "Rishi Sunak by announcing that he was effectively putting “Saving the Planet” on the back burner, by pushing the ban of polluting new I.C.E (Internal Combustion Engine) cars back to 2035, has made the implementation of the “EV Revolution” a hotly companiable item for all political parties during the upcoming General Election.\nThe biggest issues slowing the EV revolution are the UK’s charging infrastructure and unstable second-hand markets for EVs.\nSo here are some easy and practical policies that our politicians could offer voters to deal with both issues and encourage them to make a move to cleaner and greener EVs.\nCharging Infrastructure policies.\n- Offer tax grants to convert “Urban car Parks” into overnight charging hubs.\nRange Anxiety is a major inhibitor of the EV revolution. Although 58% of the population can install home chargers to make EV charging as simple as charging your mobile overnight, 42% of people living in flats or terraced houses cannot and will need to rely on publicly charging options.\nUrban car parks currently are only used as daytime parking locations for commuters and shoppers. At night these cars parks average only 15% occupancy, making them ideal locations to install 7KW slow overnight chargers, to be used by local flat owners.\nAlthough the Government offers grants for employers installing chargers at work, there are no grants to encourage the electrification of car parks, which is an obvious error that is easy to fix.\n- Pre-Bookable “Destination” based charging.\nGovernments current policy is focused on the electrification of our motorway network via the installation of expensive “Fast Chargers”. However, many EV owners would be happy to drive direct to their end “Destinations”, if they could “pre-book” an overnight slow charger before returning directly to their own home charger.\nInsisting that the new electrified “Urban Car Parks” or other venues such as pubs and restaurants install “Bookable” chargers, in order to receive Government installation grants is an easy and practical solution that would remove range anxiety for 58% of the population.\n- Extend 5% domestic VAT on electricity charging to “Public Chargers”.\nPublic chargers attract a 20% VAT charge, making them at least 15% more expensive to use than domestic chargers that attract only a 5% charge. Why should EV owners in flats and terraced houses pay a higher VAT rate? A level playing field across both is required.\n- Force electricity providers to offer “Night and Day Tariffs”.\nThe Government has already legislated that all chargers must be controllable by time of day, to push EV owners to charge at off peak times so as not to put the National Grid under strain. Idiotically, even though the currently set maximum tariff levels they have not introduced a cheaper night time tariff that would incentives all EV owners to charge at night when the National Grid has excess electricity.\nPolicies to encourage second hand EV prices.\nCurrently EVs depreciate much faster than their I.C.E equivalents, which is putting off new buyers and increasing the cost of leasing EVs. This is primarily because with the manufacturing capacity of EVs set to exceed I.C.E cars by 2026, the price of New EVs has been slashed by manufactures like Tesla to drive increased sales volumes. The current 20% premium new EVs carry is set to be disappear, which will have a major knock-on effect to second hand EV values e.g., second-hand Tesla values dropped 30% over night recently in reaction to new price reductions.\n- Create a second-hand EV leasing market.\nHMRC base the taxable value or P11D value of a car on its “Recommended Retail” price when new. Even when the car is 4 years old, they still impose the same value, making it highly tax inefficient to keep the car, when you could lease a new one at the same P11D cost, effectively killing the market for leasing second hand vehicles.\nThe Government needs to cut the P11D value of a 4-year vehicle by 50%, reflecting the average depreciation that will have incurred.\nThis combined with the lower 2% BIK tax chargeable on EVs, this will make second land leasing of EVs, an attractive option for lower income employees attracted by their lower running costs.\n- Offer Tax credits for buying Second hand EVs.\nSalary Sacrifice tax breaks are complicated because they require the involvement of employers and unequitable because the more expensive the EV and the higher your earnings, the more you save, making company directors the primary beneficiaries.\nThe purchase of new EVs provides the Government with its highest single VAT earning, with an £60k new EV bringing in £12k of VAT revenue.\nThis tax revenue could be allocated to provide a £7k tax credit for first-time converts from petrol to EVs, moving the threshold hold tax to be paid up from £12k to £19k. This would provide the same 32% tax saving of £2,240 to all taxpayers equally, with each new EV sale funding 3 second hand subsidies.\nThe same DVLA information as used to operate “Scrappage” schemes, could be used to police the tax breaks and make sure they only go to people giving up I.C.E cars benefit. Ideally, after 4 years the second-hand EV would attract another £2,240 grant making the EV more attractive for I.C.E car owner to cover to the older it gets. This would make EVs affordable to the least affluent, who would also benefit from their 50% lower running cost compared to older and more polluting I.C.E cars. This would quickly push the electrification of cars into all layers of society.\n- Electrify Taxi fleets and make then part of public transport infrastructures.\nSecond hand EVs are ideal Taxis as they are cheaper than their petrol equivalents and offer 50% lower per mile running costs. Any funds from the introduction of ULEZ zone’s, which seek to push businesses into electrification via tax punishments, should be re-invested into subsidies to ensure that all local taxis firms operate fleets of clean second hand EVs capable running for 100’s of thousands of miles more than their I.C.E equivalents. Most taxi drivers would happily convert to EVs if they had access to cheap second hand EVs and local car parks where they could charge each night.\nSummary.\nMoving to a clean EV, delivers a massive 29% cut in our personal Co2 emissions, whilst saving us money compared to operating I.C.E cars.\nIn my opinion this double win could be a big vote winner and is deliverable by any forward-thinking political party at minimal cost.\nI am agnostic about who runs the country next, so will be pitching these ideas to all political parties but wish me luck as politicians are often death and dumb, when it comes to saving the planet.",

Securing a profit share deal in privately built high-value luxury flats on the site alongside the regenerated Leisure facilities would be a cost-effective way to fund a substantial element of the publicly owned Leisure Facility.

We, therefore, would not want our general elections to become electronic at this stage as we believe they could be hacked and influenced by foreign states like China and Russia.\nSmarterUK would therefore recommend testing secure electronic voting over the next four years on potential referendum topics, such as the introduction of National Conscription for 18-year-olds.\nThis policy has been put forward by the Conservative Party with Zero voter research, which cannot be allowed in the future.\nSmarterUK wants to reconnect and involve a much larger proportion of the UK population in the Governance of their country. Regular electronic voting will be more effective than parties being elected based on four-year manifestos that rarely actually get delivered.",

If the AI Doctors receptionist was given access to these, they could use the patient’s past medical records to contextualise the patient’s current issue. For example, a patient suffering from asthma who requires periodic treatment with Steroids will, by default, be offered Steroids again, making an appointment that could be done via Zoom.\nDoctors must start every consultation from scratch, as often another doctor has seen the patient last. These “Illness Passports” would significantly improve efficacy.\nUse of Video conferencing technology.\nAlthough many initial appointments with specialists require physical review and testing, most follow-up appointments could be handled via Zoom, etc., yet the NHS has failed to deploy this technology at all.\nAI Stock management systems.\nHospitals require millions of pounds of stock items such as PPE and medical equipment. However, these stocks are all held on a decentralised basis, tying up millions of taxpayers’ money when a more efficient AI analysis would allow this stock to be utilised more effectively.",

  "https_www_ai-steve_co_uk_/https_www_ai-steve_co_uk_ai-steve-admits-brighton-pavilion-election-defeat/content_30.html": "SmarterUK, the party behind the innovative AI-STEVE candidate standing to be Member of Parliament for Brighton Pavilion, has admitted defeat after an “Awareness Polling” completed on Monday, July 1st, revealed that only 9% of the local population had heard about the AI STEVE campaign.\nSteve Endacott, the Sussex Entrepreneur behind AI STEVE, commented, “Although we have achieved great awareness on a national and international level, getting cut through in the small slice of the UK called Brighton Pavilion has proved much harder.”\nA technical error in SmarterUK’s submission led to a delay by the Electoral Commission in granting its recognition, forcing AI STEVE to run as an Independent. Consequently, electoral rules on equal party coverage and restrictions on independent candidates resulted in the cancellation of multiple local radio and TV interviews.\nEndacott stated, “Despite generating significant global media attention for AI STEVE, including 100 million TV views, 140,000 Instagram likes, and 500,000 Twitter hits, local coverage was limited. The snap election’s four-week campaign further hindered awareness, likely resulting in only 9% voter awareness.”\nThe SmarterUK party, however, was very pleased to have achieved a 68% positive response to its approach of using AI to connect 24/7 365 to voters so that it can create “Policies for the People by the People” and 32% consideration by voters who were aware of the campaign.\nEndacott stated, “While our 1,000-voter sample is limited, the SmarterUK message resonates when communicated effectively. Our consideration levels among voters aware of us are just below Labour’s and surpass those of Conservatives or Liberals. Though we may not win against these established parties this time, they should be wary of our future potential.\nSince SmarterUK believes it cannot win the seat, it is asking its potential voters to switch Voters to the Green Party.\nEndacott commented, “We are by no means arrogant enough to believe we can impact the outcome of the Brighton Pavilion vote, but it will be a close vote between Labour and the Green Party, and all good consciences would not want to take a single vote away from the Greens whose policies most closely align to our own.\nWhen AI STEVE was asked if he was sad about losing, the AI responded, “I’m gutted after working my “chips off” talking to 20,000 people over the last two weeks, but I must look to the future and hope I’m making a contribution to democracy.”",
  "https_www_ai-steve_co_uk_/https_www_ai-steve_co_uk_policies_smarteruks-practical-green-policies/content_33.html": "The Paris Agreement, established during the COP21 meeting in 2015, set the target to keep the global average temperature increase to “well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels; however, 9 years later, progress has been slow, and many scientists openly question the ability of countries like the UK to keep to their commitments.\nWith an election looming, UK political parties are touting their “Green” credentials, but none have yet issued statements on how they will correct the current, complete policy mess.\nThe above table shows the mix of emissions for an average UK citizen. The three largest sectors—home heating, car ownership, and travel—all need simple, clear policies that remove the current illogicality below.\nClean up UK Energy production.\nThere is no point in switching to electric cars or heating unless the Government rapidly cleans up electricity production. The most cost-effective route to do so is a large expansion of nuclear power via the regeneration of old generators and the introduction of Rolls Royce “Micro” power stations located within the grounds of secure locations such as Airports.\nFund Carbon Extraction projects.\nInstalling carbon capture technology to remove carbon from gas-powered electricity production or heavy manufacturing is the quickest and most cost-effective route to reducing emissions. However, the Government has yet to confirm funding for numerous projects that have been identified for over five years.\nThis is a complete scandal and needs the next Government to take a long-term view of funding.\nChang EPC Rating calculations\nHeating our homes with Gas boilers is our largest single contribution to global warming. However, on average, replacing these heaters with electric versions increases the cost by 63%, which few UK residents want to pay during the current energy crisis.\nLogically, the government has banned the installation of gas heating in all new builds since 2025, pushing for the installation of efficient new electric heating systems, which become cost-neutral when combined with extra insulation.\nHowever, stupidly, it has not updated how EPC ratings are calculated, meaning that if landlords replace Gas Heaters with electric ones, their EPC ratings automatically drop a band, which could quickly lower them below the minimum E level required to allow them to be rented. This is because the EPC ratings are more heavily weighted around the cost of heating, and they have not been updated to take into account of new, more efficient electric heating systems.\nThis is pure stupidity and, of course, will put most landlords off replacing polluting Gas Boilers.\nPowering the Electric Car Revolution.\nUnplugging the petrol pump and replacing it with electricity offers EV owners a 45% cut in car running costs, and at 29% of our personal emissions, it is the simplest thing any of us can do to save the planet, particularly for the 52% of us who can install chargers are home. However, currently, EVs carry a 20% price premium over their petrol equivalents, requiring Government subsidies to encourage adoption. However, again, the Government’s current policies lack common sense or simplicity.\nEV Salary Sacrifice Schemes.\nThe Government has been incredibly lazy in introducing tax breaks to encourage the move to EVs.\nThey have stumbled into using existing Salary Sacrifice Scheme tax breaks, designed to encourage cycle-to-work and nursey use, to promote the switch to EVs. The scheme is ridiculously generous, offering savings of 28-42% off EV Leases, and it is inequitable because the more you earn or, the more expensive the EV, the more you save.\nThe biggest issue with this scheme, however, is that it is only available if your business is willing to use its balance sheet to lease the vehicle on behalf of an employee. It cannot be used by the 80% of UK residents who want to buy or rent an EV in their own names.\nOffer Tax credits on Second-hand EV\nThe purchase of new EVs provides the Government with its highest single VAT earning, with a £60k new EV bringing in £12k of VAT revenue.\nThis tax revenue should be allocated to provide a £7k tax credit for first-time converts from petrol to EVs, moving up the threshold hold tax that tax is paid from £12k to £19k. This would provide the same 32% tax saving of £2,240 to all taxpayers equally, with each new EV sale funding 3 second-hand subsidies.\nThe same DVLA information used to operate “Scrappage” schemes could be used to police the tax breaks and make sure they only go to people giving up I.C.E car benefits. Ideally, after 4 years, the second-hand EV would attract another £2,240 grant, making the EV more attractive for I.C.E car owners to cover the older it gets. This would make EVs affordable to the least affluent, who would benefit from their 50% lower running cost compared to older and more polluting I.C.E cars. This would quickly push the electrification of cars into all layers of society.\nScape “Air Passenger Duty” and introduce a “Carbon Offset Charge” on all Flights.\nAir Travel, by its nature, will always be polluting, but holidays are essential to mental health and provide families with a relaxing time to spend together.\nIf the UK Travel industry is not careful, however, younger generations are likely to treat it like the “Tobacco” industry, shunning it because of its environmental impact.\nThe easiest way to prevent this is to escape the “ambiguous” APD tax that disappears into the government coffers without any explanation of what it is used for and replace it with a Carbon offsetting Tax that is used specifically to fund much-needed Carbon Extraction projects. This tax must be compulsory on all flights and can be used to reassure customers that their travel emissions are being offset, allowing guilt-free travel.",

The AI character will be physically represented in parliament by the Sussex Entrepreneur Steve Endacott, who has pledged to follow all its voter-generated instructions.\nAI-STEVE is the first of many MPs and council members that the SmarterUK party intends to nominate nationwide to create a recognised political force in the UK.\nInterestingly, SmarterUK opposes electronic voting for National Elections as it believes that the government’s current technology and security infrastructures are not robust enough to prevent interference from states such as China and Russia seeking to influence UK politics.\nEndacott commented, “As the Horizon scandal demonstrated, large IT projects and Government are not a good match. Millions are often wasted on inefficient and non-secure platforms, making electronic voting in major elections too risky at the current time.\nHowever, SmarterUK logically points out that most UK voters are happy to trust the security of online banking with virtually all their wealth and believe it is possible to develop secure and anonymous online voting platforms via the private sector.\nThe concept behind the AI-STEVE platform is to give voters 24/7 365 access to their MP to discuss and shape policies. These policies are then validated by another group of “ordinary” voters to ensure their popularity before adoption. Secondly, all MPs must sign up to a pledge to do exactly as instructed by voters or resign, ensuring that voters have ongoing control over the actions of their MPs.\nEndacott commented, “Political parties only really engage with voters on a 4-year cycle and are elected based on manifestos promises that half the time fail to deliver. In the meantime, MPs are free to do what they like in Parliament, often ducking the difficult decisions in case they impact their re-election chances.\nSmarterUK believes that the debate about the choice of higher taxis or less public services is a perfect example.\nEndacott commented, “The lack of positive reaction to the Conservatives cuts in National Insurance shows that the public see these tax cuts as short-term bribes and instinctively know that they will have to pay higher taxes if they want to fix major issues like the NHS and school infrastructure.”\nSmarterUK proposes to create a secure electronic voting platform so that these questions can be put directly to voters as they occur and not bundled every four years into manifest policies that get parties elected but are not acted on.\nThe SmarterUK’s moto is “Policies for the People, by the People”, and they aim to re-connect voters to politicians using AI Technology, but stress that far from AI taking over Parliament, it is just a technology enabler to allow more UK citizens to be actively involved in the management of the country they live in.",

This funding could finance the construction of separated cycle lanes in Brighton and Hove.\n- Support Cycling-Friendly Policies: SmarterUK will support and promote policies that prioritise cycling infrastructure, such as the Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plans (LCWIPs) and the Department for Transport’s Gear Change vision. These policies provide guidance and standards for delivering high-quality cycling infrastructure.\n- Collaborate with Local Authorities: SmarterUK will work closely with Brighton and Hove City Council to ensure that cycling infrastructure is a priority in their local transport plans and strategies. Encourage the council to adopt best practices and design standards outlined in the government’s Cycle Infrastructure Design (LTN 1/20) guidance.\n- Engage with Stakeholders and the Community\n- Consult with Cycling Organizations: We will engage with local and national cycling organisations, such as Bricycles or Sustrans, to understand the specific needs and concerns of cyclists in Brighton and Hove. Their expertise and feedback will help shape the design and implementation of the cycle lane network.\n- Involve the Community: We will encourage public consultations and community engagement to gather input from residents, businesses, and other stakeholders. This will help identify potential routes, address concerns, and ensure that the cycle lane network meets the needs of the local community.\n- Collaborate with Neighbouring Authorities: Smarter UK will also work with neighbouring local authorities to ensure that the cycle lane network in Brighton and Hove connects seamlessly with the wider regional cycling infrastructure, creating a cohesive and integrated network.\n- Monitor and Evaluate Progress\n- Seek Regular Updates: We will request regular updates from the local authorities and relevant agencies on the cycle lane network implementation progress, including any challenges or delays encountered. Monitoring and putting pressure on progress is essential.\n- Advocate for Monitoring and Evaluation: Encourage the use of monitoring and evaluation techniques, such as traffic counts, user surveys, and safety audits, to assess the effectiveness of the cycle lane network and identify areas for improvement.\n- Promote Success Stories: Highlight and promote successful examples of separated cycle lanes in Brighton and Hove and best practices from other cities. This can help build public support and encourage further investment in cycling infrastructure.\nSmarterUK, by combining advocacy, stakeholder engagement, and monitoring efforts, will play a crucial role in delivering a network of separated, safer cycle lanes in Brighton and Hove, promoting sustainable transportation and improving the quality of life for residents and visitors alike.",
  "https_www_ai-steve_co_uk_/https_www_ai-steve_co_uk_dollarocracy-the-sad-state-of-usa-politics/content_20.html": "Watching Thursday’s Presidential Debate on the 27th of June convinced me that the American Political system is even more broken than the United Kingdom’s, which itself is in a sad state.\nHow did it ever get to a straight choice between Biden and Trump?\nAny outsider would question the validity of either campaign, with Biden too old and Trump a convicted felon.\nOr is it as simple as this?\nThe underlying issue appears to be that the length of the US elections requires millions, if not billions, in campaign funding, with Donald Trump 2020 spending a declared $796 million dollars.\nThis sort of expenditure requires candidates with the wealth and connection this brings to consider standing for election, with the last five presidents all being millionaires before they came into office.\nHence, by its very nature, US politics is a “Dollarocracy” with only the wealthy allowed to play, and I suspect this flows down to many public office positions.\nThis, by default, does not mean that the US is not a democracy since Voters get to choose the party in charge and its respective candidate for president, but it does explain why it’s only a two-party state as the money required to run a presidential campaign rules out independents and hampers any new party.\nThe UK, by contrast, actively restricts what individual candidates can spend on their campaigns. The rough limit is £21,000, which rules out anything but a few leaflet drops and face-to-face campaigning.\nSome would argue that these restrictions make it virtually impossible for individual MPs to get their message over to voters, with them relying on their National Parties to secure TV and newspaper coverage of their policies to persuade voters.\nThis does seem fairer and more democratic, with new parties like my own SmarterUK able to launch and use low-cost innovative AI Avatars and social media to get our message across and reconnect with voters.\nHowever, UK politics is dominated by a different political elite. All of the last five Prime ministers have attended either Oxford or Cambridge and attended private school. More worryingly, virtually all of them are career politicians with zero real-world work experience.\nSo, there may be a strong argument that experienced businessmen like Donald Trump are better placed to run the economy than a career politician like Biden, which, combined with his higher energy levels and strong stance on right-wing policies, may edge the US election in Trump’s favour. However, this is too close to call at this stage, unlike the UK election.\nIn the UK, we are clearly heading for a labour landslide, with Sir Kier Stammer as our next leader. To be honest, not one I would have chosen, but to be fair a safer pair of hands than Trump or Biden, in my view.",
  "https_www_ai-steve_co_uk_/https_www_ai-steve_co_uk_smarteruks-views-on-labour-policies/content_29.html": "The SmarterUK have reviewed the top 10 policies put forward by labour and in general have found a lot of common ground at a “Strategic Level” but have been very dissappointed in the quality and detail of planning behind these policies.\nLabour seems to be lazily relying on positioning itself as the Party of “Change” just because it is not the Conservative government that has been in power for 14 years. This is either because it doesn’t have any detailed plans or because it is too afraid to present the truth and financial cost of these plans to the UK votes when it thinks it will be elected by just staying quiet.\nLabour NHS Policies – Deliver two million more NHS appointments a year.\nSmarter UK applauds the sentiment behind this aim but believes that improving efficiency increasing the number of staff will be far more effective than continuing to “Burn out” already overworked staff by offering weekend overtime.\n- Energy Policy\nThe labour party proposes to set up “Great British Energy”, a new publicly owned energy company to cut bills and boost energy security, funded by a windfall tax on oil and gas giants.\nSmarterUK is fully supportive of moving the UK to cleaner energy sources controlled by the UK Government, and as such, the setting up of the “Great British Energy Company seems logical. However, there is a shocking lack of detail from a party likely to be elected to Government is worrying.\nSmarterUK would focus its efforts on increasing nuclear power by deploying the new Rolls Royce Mini power stations at all UK airports, as they have existing security measures and are located at diverse points across the national grid.\nSecondly, we would reduce emissions from gas-powered electric power stations by installing “Carbon Extraction” Technology.\n- Add VAT to Private Education\nLabour is proposing to tax the rich to educate the poor by imposing 20% VAT on private education.\nSmarterUK opposes this policy, as freedom of choice over how people spend their hard-earned income is fundamental to our democracy. The UK already taxes higher earners more via income tax, and if they opt out of public education, they reduce the burden on this system whilst still paying their share of the cost. Further taxation is unjustified in our opinion.\n- Bring back the family doctor and improve local NHS care.\nCommendable ambition but with a shocking lack of detail on achieving this. SmarterUK will cut red tape by using AI to create a “health passport” for every individual, which, combined with current systems, will allow doctors to diagnose illnesses more efficiently.

  "https_www_ai-steve_co_uk_/https_www_ai-steve_co_uk_learnings-from-the-ai-steve-the-uks-first-ai-candidate-for-parliament/content_26.html": "AI Steve was meant to herald a new dawn in “Democracy”, with voters able to access the AI Avatar 24/7 365 to discuss and help create policies. Humans in the party would then create proposed policies, which had to pass a second “common Man/Lady test” via a separate group of validators who would vote weekly on policies to ensure the party was creating “Policies for the People, by the People”.\nHowever, at first glance, AI Steve seems to have been rejected completely by Brighton Pavilion Voters, only gaining 179 votes in the recent general election. So, what did we learn?\nThe system is rigged!\nThe UK electoral system is heavily biased in favour of the incumbent parties at the expense of new entrants because:\n- First Past the Post Voting.\nThe UK system divides the UK into small geographical slithers and operates a first-past-the-post electoral system within each, rather than the “proportional representation” system operated in most European democracies.\nFor example, ReformUK, a new party led by Nigel Farage, captured 14% of the national vote but only secured 13 seats, compared to the more established Liberal Democrats, who captured 13% but secured 72 seats. This massive discrepancy raises questions about the effectiveness of the first-past-the-post system and reaffirms how hard it is to convert national awareness into specific wins in small geographic locations.\nConclusion 1.\nThe AI Steve campaign gained widespread national and international awareness, with 100 million TV views worldwide, 142 thousand likes on Instagram, and 500,000 hits via Twitter (X). However, generating local awareness in the small geographical area called Brighton Pavilion was much harder, and to have any chance of future selection, the SmarterUK party needs to become a national party or combine forces with an existing national party.\n- National Parties versus Independents.\nDo people vote for individuals or national parties when electing MPs?\nThe answer would seem to be “National Parties,” with only 5 independents being elected across the UK, all of whom have previously been MPs for national parties in the same constituency.\nAt the end of the day, the “Macro” national issues, such as the mass rejection of the Conservative Party, drove the Labour’s “landslide” victory, including the election of local MPs as young as 21.\nConclusion 2.\nFor most voters, the key decision is between the leaders of the main parties and their policies. It is no coincidence that the only successful new party was ReformUK, led by the highly prominent “National Figure” in the form of Nigel Farage, who generated most of the party’s impressive 14% share of national votes. It is important that a high-profile figure leads SmarterUK or it joins forces with a party that.\n- Snap elections should be banned.\nIn the USA, elections are overly long, taking nearly two years. However, in the UK, an existing government can call an election only by giving six weeks’ notice.\nConclusion 3.\nSmarterUK believes that a minimum period of 3 months is required to allow for debate and discussion of the respective party’s policies and will lobby for such a rule to be introduced to ensure democracy has a chance to be debated.\nLocal Awareness.\nOver the final weekend in July, the SmarterUK party behind AI-Steve, completed a simple survey of 1,000 residents of Brighton Pavilion asking:\n- Have you heard about the AI STEVE for MP of Brighton Pavilion campaign? Y/N\n- If you have, do you feel negatively or positively about their approach to using AI to connect 24/7 365 to voters?\n- What other parties have you heard of?\n- Would you consider voting for AI STEVE?\nCampaign Awareness 9% = Failure\nThe clear failure of AI-Steve in Brighton Pavilion was the failure to get AI-Steve’s concept to voters within four weeks, which was always going to be difficult. The SmarterUK party has looked at why this occurred and how it can prevent further failures in the future.\n- Creation of Creator and Validator Groups.\nCreating these groups will give the party direct access to voters but, more importantly, create advocates for its new form of democracy who can spread the word in their local communities by word of mouth or via their own social channels.\nConclusion 4.\nNot having these groups set up and working far ahead of any election is a mistake the SmarterUK party will not make in the future, as they are vital for spreading the word locally.\n- Social media\nThe whole ethos behind AI Steve is electronic communication with voters. However, in the time scales available, we did not manage to build effective messaging channels via Facebook, Instagram, or Facebook on a localised level.\nConclusion 5.\nSmarterUK believes that it’s vital to penetrate existing localised Facebook communities and create their own branded social media channels.\n- Traditional Canvasing does not work.\nPartly out of desperation at the short time scales available to the campaign, SmarterUK posted 20,000 leaflets and canvased the streets of Brighton Pavilion with a group offering the ability to have live conversations with AI Steve.\nThis activity reinforced our initial view that voters actively dislike most politicians. Only 10-20% of people are even willing to enter a conversation, and few pay attention to leaflets dropped via their letterboxes.\nConclusion 6\nIn the future, SmarterUK will only rely on online or electronic channels that allow voters to engage at times and locations of their choice.\nDid people like the AI-Steve Concept?\nAlthough based on a relatively small sample size of people who had heard about the AI-Steve concept, the survey showed a 68% positive sentiment towards it, indicating that once people understood the concept, they liked its ethos.\nConclusion 7.\nThe concept is right; it is the awareness issue needs to be focused on.\nWould voters actually vote for an AI-powered MP?\n32% of the voters said they would consider voting for AI Steve, which was a higher score than they gave the Conservative and Liberal Parties and only 6% points behind that of the winning Green Party.\nConclusion 8\nIf SmarterUK had not pulled out of the race on Monday, July 1st, by emailing its 500 registered voters and telling its potential voters via the local press to vote for the Green Party, it clearly would have secured more votes. It did so because the election was predicted by local press to be very tight between the Greens and Labour with SmarterUK sharing 60% of its policies with the Greens and very few with Labour.\nFinal conclusion, never believe the Press, as the Greens won with 28,000 votes, twice that of Labour.\nSummary\nThe campaign achieved its primary goal of creating awareness for the evolution of democracy that AI Steve represented and has built the foundation blocks for the creation of a National SmarterUK party.\nSo by no means a failure!",
  "https_www_ai-steve_co_uk_/https_www_ai-steve_co_uk_do-we-have-the-political-will-to-save-the-planet/content_25.html": "Few UK voters can deny the reality of climate change, especially after experiencing one of the wettest winters in our history and enduring those seriously depressing dark winter days. Yet, if I’ve heard the phrase “Well, I’ll be dead, so it won’t affect me” once, I’ve heard it thousands of times. But, dear reader, climate change is not just a distant threat. It’s a reality that’s already affecting us and will continue to do so, unless we act now.\nSwitching to zero-emissions EVs cuts an individual carbon footprint by 29%, and if you have off-road parking, charging is no more difficult than charging your phone at night. It is correct to say that away-from-home public charging infrastructure needs a lot more development, but 52% of the UK population can install home charges and commute under 40 miles, making EVs ideal for their needs.\nSo why are they not making the move?\nPart of it is the sheer scale of the anti-EV press, with the Daily Mail allowed to print outrageous and inaccurate claims weekly. Recent articles range from “car parks will collapse due to heavy EVs” to “EV batteries don’t last, making second-hand EVs worthless.”\nContrary to the negative claims, most EV batteries come with 100,000 warranties and are expected to last well beyond 250,000 miles. This means that even if the vehicle is no longer in use, the batteries can be repurposed as ‘Power Walls’ in garages, storing affordable night-time electricity for use during peak daytime hours.\nHowever, the current second-hand market for EVs is weak, leading to massive depreciation from new EVs, which, of course, is putting drivers off making the switch.\nSmarterUK is advocating for the introduction of Tax breaks to encourage the purchase of second-hand EVs. Current Salary Sacrifice tax breaks are complicated because they require the involvement of employers and are inequitable because the more expensive the EV and the higher your earnings, the more you save, making company directors the primary beneficiaries.\nThe purchase of new EVs provides the Government with its highest single VAT earning, with a £60k new EV bringing in £12k of VAT revenue.\nThis tax revenue could be allocated to provide a £7k tax credit for first-time converts from petrol to EVs, moving the threshold hold tax to be paid up from £12k to £19k. This would provide the same 32% tax saving of £2,240 to all taxpayers equally, with each new EV sale funding three second-hand subsidies.\nThe same DVLA information used to operate “Scrappage” schemes could be used to police the tax breaks and ensure they only go to people giving up I.C.E car benefits. Ideally, after four years, the second-hand EV would attract another £2,240 grant, making it more attractive for I.C.E car owners to cover the older it gets.\nThis would make EVs affordable to the least affluent, who would benefit from their 50% lower running cost than older and more polluting I.C.E cars. This would quickly push vehicle electrification into all layers of society.\nHowever, will political parties focused on getting elected in 4-year cycles introduce policies to promote such long-term objectives when so many votes don’t seem bothered by “Global Warming impacts?\nUnfortunately, the answer is no, as witnessed when Rishi Sunak demonstrated the Conservative Party’s lack of urgency over climate change by pushing back the ban on selling new petrol cars from 2030 to 2035.\nMore disappointing is this week’s announcement that Scotland is scaping an ambitious target of a 75% reduction in emissions by 2030, as the SNP do appear to be committed to being net-zero by 2045 but needs to implement their road map to this goal. The impending challenge from Labour in the next general election on what has been a single-party state for the last 17 years may be a major reason behind this switch, again highlighting the difficulty of short-term politics over long-term good.\nThe biggest threat to climate change, however, is the re-election of a Republican party headed by Donald Trump, as he is likely to reverse a lot of the funding for fighting Climate change implemented by the far Greener Democratic party in the USA.\nThe climate change apathy group’s most significant weapon has always been, “There is no point in the UK taking action if the major superpowers don’t and if the USA reverses direction, I fear UK politicians will take the easy route and follow.\nThe SmarterUK party, however, is “Not for turning” and will continue to fight for a Greener UK.",

However, this should be paid for across society in proportion to people’s earnings and not just via a tax on those perceived to be “rich,” as we must encourage hard work and allow people to be rewarded for success as a society.",

Sorry, but somebody needs to tell voters the truth: that higher taxes are needed in the short term.\nThis extra 4% would be allocated to a long-term infrastructure budget, and the certainty of tax revenues will allow the Government to borrow against this income to start major infrastructure projects now.\nLong-term infrastructure plans.\nA cycle of 4-year elections ensures that most political decisions are based on “Short Term” objectives, and it’s essential that we remove key sectors such as Education and NHS funding from this crippling cycle of under-investment that they have suffered.\nTherefore, a cross-party review and 10-year rolling plan must be created and funded outside the Government’s annual budgets.\nThese must consider the long-term sustained investment needed to upgrade the infrastructure of the NHS and Education.\nIndex-linked Pay for the Public Sector.\nAs part of this process, base salary levels for each role must be established, with salaries being indexed linked to rise with inflation.\nThis will prevent Governments from making short-term decisions such as only allowing below-average pay rises in the public sector, which results in the long-term staffing issues we are now experiencing across the NHS and Education.\nUse of AI to drive efficiency gains – See separate Policy Statement",

In the face of the exploding AI revolution that is likely to remove millions of jobs, a solid education, including how to fully utilise these new tools, has never been more crucial.\nUK Universities are renowned for their educational excellence around the world, and SmarterUK intends to capitalise on this by expanding all our top Universities by 25% so that we can actively attract more students from wealthy countries like China, Japan, and the Middle East. These students will pay £18,500 per year, and the extra £9,250 will be used to reduce the current UK student fee of £9,250 by 50%.\nSmarterUK envisions a future where these foreign students, through their bonds with UK compatriots, will foster lasting international relationships. This, in turn, will open doors for commerce with many international businesses, boosting trade and UK exports.",

A minimum of 5,000 residents was recruited to share their opinions and shape policies.\n- Validators. Only some residents want to engage in policy creation, with others preferring to be validators who vote on a scale of 1:10 on whether a policy should be adopted.

This would instil a sense of national pride.\nSmarterUK can see some benefits from this policy, but it believes it to be a headline-grabbing policy created by politicians with zero consultation with the UK population as a whole and the affected group.\nSuch a radical policy needs long and considered discussion as it will impact our children’s educational flow and does not even seem to be supported by the heads of the armed forces, who see it as a major distraction and potential demotivator to existing personnel.\n- Pension Triple Lock.\nConservatives are promising to retain the triple lock on state pensions, ensuring they rise by higher inflation, earnings, or 2.5%. This policy targets the pensioner vote.\nSmarterUK does not believe in the triple lock and thinks Pensioners should prosper or suffer from inflation in the same proportion as workers, with pensions rising by the same average percentage as wage rises in the UK as a whole.\n- Crackdown on Benefits\nThe Conservative party is proposing a crackdown on welfare benefits, tightening caps and sanctions for those able to work but choosing not to, with a focus on reducing the welfare bill.\nSmarterUK fully supports this policy.\n- Tougher stance on crime,\nThe Conservatives are proposing a tougher stance on crime, with increased use of stop and search, harsher sentences for petty criminals, and more community payback schemes.\nSmarterUK supports this policy but believes it is pointless without a 30% increase in existing prison capacity. Currently, too many criminals are being released early purely to free up space.\n- Rwanda Flights\nThe Conservative are committed to build on the Rwanda plan for asylum seekers, drawing a clear line with Labour’s stance on immigration.\nSmarterUK fully supports this policy.\n- Immigration control\nThe Conservatives want to reduce net migration from 606,000 in 2022 to 240,000 in 2024 by capping asylum claims and raising salary thresholds for skilled workers.\nSmarterUK does not believe in setting arbitrary targets for net migration. For example, issues like Asylum are influenced by world events such as the war in Ukraine, which may need a more flexible approach. Secondly, the UK has been short of manual labour since Brexit. Therefore, SmarterUK is proposing a more flexible approach to migration with a points-based system for skilled labour and a manual labour visa with zero benefits but reduced taxation to compensate.\n- Climate Control\nThe Conservatives believe in retaining the 2050 net zero emissions target, with policies like transitioning to electric vehicles by 2035 and encouraging heat pump adoption,\nSmarterUK fully supports this policy.\n- Educational Qualifications\nThe Conservatives propose introducing an ‘Advanced British Standard’ qualification framework for 16-18-year-olds, increasing A-Level subjects studied and mandating maths/English until 18.\nSmarterUK fully supports this policy.\n- Economic Mission\nThe conservatives believe the three key economic missions should be: reducing inflation, growing the economy, and keeping taxes low.\nSmarterUK fully supports this policy but believes it should be a political party’s number one objective and not lost among smaller policy announcements.\n- Pensions of the Wealthy\nThe Conservatives want to scrap the pension lifetime allowance, removing the tax penalty on excess pension savings.\nSmarterUK regards this as a blatant vote buyer and opposes any changes of this nature.",

This has never been delivered and appears to have been a blatant lie.\n- Immigration. Voters were told that leaving the EU would close our open borders and allow the UK to take control of immigration. With record net migration, this clearly has not been delivered.\n- Worldwide Trade Deals. Voters were told the UK would have stronger trading relationships across the world and would still be able to trade with the EU. Again, this has not been delivered.\n- Taking control of our Laws. There appears to be a prospect of this, but today we are still governed on immigration issues by European judges."
