We will work to bring about a County Council that responds effectively to residents’ queries and values their experience; that makes the most of Council budgets and invests in core services; and that shares information transparently with early and meaningful consultations on new projects.\nLocal government reorganisation in Hertfordshire\nLate in 2024, the UK Government announced its intention to reorganise local government, including in Hertfordshire, potentially replacing the current ten district councils and the county council, with one or more unitary authorities. This is part of a wider plan to streamline local governance. The Government also wants unitary authorities to be headed by a strategic mayor (similar to London).\nProponents argue that larger councils could deliver services more efficiently and reduce costs, and powers could be devolved from Westminster to mayors. However, critics, including the Green Party, warn that the changes could undermine local democracy by concentrating power in fewer hands and reducing representation for smaller communities. Whilst devolution is to be applauded in principle, the Government’s plans look more like centralisation. The crucial connection between residents and local community councillors could be broken if councillors are overseeing much larger areas.\nHertfordshire’s district councils, including the Green-run East Herts Council, have raised concerns about the loss of accountability and community focus. They argue that a single unitary council may not adequately represent diverse local needs. The Greens have strongly opposed the plans, emphasising that smaller councils play a crucial role in addressing local issues and ensuring residents’ voices are heard. Discussions are ongoing, and no final decisions have been made.\nThe new unitary arrangement is due to be set up in 2027 and take over from the district and county councils in 2028..\nPrevious local election results\nThe Green Party has seen growing success in St Albans District in recent years. Simon Grover became their first district councillor in 2011, representing St Peter’s ward on St Albans City & District Council. He has since been re-elected five times, establishing a strong Green presence in the area.\nIn 2023, the party gained a second seat on the district council when Matt Fisher won in Clarence ward. Later that year, Juliet Voisey secured a third Green seat by winning a by-election in St Peter’s ward. Juliet was re-elected in 2024.\nIn parliamentary elections, Simon Grover ran as the Green candidate for St Albans in 2024, achieving 6.3% of the vote – an increase from previous results. These wins reflect a steady rise in Green support in St Albans, with their councillors leading projects on sustainability, waste reduction, and wildlife-friendly policies.\nIn 2025, Matt Fisher was also elected to Herts County Council, joining a group of 5 Greens there.",

So you do not need to vote tactically. There is plenty of room for you to vote Green.\nThere are many reasons to vote Green in St Albans, even if we don’t win here.\nFirst, we really need Green MPs to push back against a cautious Labour Government that’s sticking with Tory budget cuts and watering down their environmental plans. The Greens are eyeing four seats and could very well make gains. The more support they get nationally, the stronger their voice in challenging Labour.\nSecondly, media attention is driven by national vote percentages. If the Green vote is low, their viewpoints on key issues like the environment, the cost of living, and public services, won’t get the airtime they deserve.\nThird, even if Green candidates don’t win, a strong showing can sway MPs of all stripes to pay more attention to Green priorities, since MPs do keep tabs on how the other parties are doing and often adjust their stance based on voter sentiment. Look at what happened with Ukip.\nFourth, there’s also money on the line. Opposition parties get funds based on their vote share, which they use to support their parliamentary work. For the Greens, who don’t have big corporate or union backers and rely on small donations, every vote that bumps up their percentage can mean a big boost in resources.\nThe Green vote has been kept down for too long, and it’s shown in slow government responses to environmental crises. If you think it’s time for a stronger Green influence in politics, voting Green this election is the way to go.",
