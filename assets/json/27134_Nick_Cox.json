He’s a long-standing member of Greenpeace and a life member of the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA).\nHe is a leading authority on sustainable refrigeration and air conditioning, and has provided refrigerant environmental impact assessments to blue chip clients, the UK government and EU.\nNick Says:\nI care passionately about the local area, I’m a regular walker along the Lea Valley towpath and I’m a keen supporter of live music events in Hoddesdon and Broxbourne. I already work with local pressure groups.\nMy platform will be based on the following aims of the Green Party:\n- taking back our NHS from creeping privatisation;\n- creating a fair economy that works for all;\n- secure, affordable, decent homes for everyone;\n- investing in fossil free affordable energy;\n- abolishing tuition fees and investing in quality education; and\n- making public transport public."
