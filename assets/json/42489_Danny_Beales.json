  "https_www_dannybeales_com/https_www_dannybeales_com_acceptable-behaviour/content_31.html": "ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR POLICY\nIntroduction\nDanny Beales MP understands that people may act out of character in times of trouble or distress. There may have been upsetting or distressing circumstances leading up to a constituent approaching our office.\nHowever, Danny will not tolerate behaviour nor actions that result in unacceptable or excessive demands on his staff.\nThis may include actions or comments directed at a third party.\nWe’ll give you a chance to change your behaviour before we stop helping you – unless your behaviour threatens the safety of our staff or other people.\nDefinition of Unacceptable Behaviour\nAggressive or abusive behaviour\nThis is behaviour or language (written or spoken) that could cause Danny Beales' staff to feel afraid, threatened or abused. This includes threatening emails, telephone calls, meetings, and comments on social media or elsewhere.\nFor example:\n-\ninsulting or degrading or patronising language, including inappropriate banter or innuendo;\n-\nmakes serious malicious allegations that individuals have committed criminal, corrupt or perverse conduct without evidence;\n-\nany form of physical violence or threats of physical violence\n-\nderogatory racist, sexist, ageist, homophobic or transphobic remarks;\n-\ncomments relating to disability, perceived gender, religion, belief, or any other personal characteristic.\nViolence is not restricted to acts of aggression that may result in physical harm. It also includes behaviour or language (whether verbal or written) that may cause staff to feel offended, afraid, threatened or abused.\nUnreasonable demands and vexatious complaints\nUnacceptable demands may include:\n-\nRepeatedly demanding a response within an unreasonable timescale;\n-\nInsisting on, or refusing to, speak to a particular member of staff, when that is not possible;\n-\nDemanding repeated surgery appointments;\n-\nMaking repeated and unnecessary contact during the course of us handling a case, waiting for a reply from a third party or carrying out an investigation;\n-\nKeep raising the same issue when we’ve already helped you or we have told you we can’t help further;\n-\nRefusing to accept a decision when it related to issues where Danny has no direct authority or would be inappropriate for her to be involved (e.g. court decisions).\nUnacceptable or persistent levels of contact may include:\n-\nRepeated telephone calls over a short period, for example, a high number calls in one day or week;\n-\nLengthy telephone calls repeating the same points;\n-\nHigh volumes repetitive correspondence by email or post;\n-\nunnecessarily or excessive copying Danny into emails to third parties.\nIt is not acceptable to knowingly provide Danny with incorrect or false information, and doing so prevents his office from successfully dealing with your case.\nHarassment\nExamples include:\n-\nrecording telephone discussions and publishing the information online or via social media;\n-\ncontacting staff using their personal details or social media presence including Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn;\n-\npublishing personal, sensitive or private information about staff online or on noticeboards or newsletters.\nHow will we respond to unacceptable behaviour\nWe do not expect our staff to tolerate unacceptable behaviour when communicating with constituents.\nWhen this happens on the telephone, letter or email, we have the right to:\n-\nplace callers on hold;\n-\nend the call;\n-\nnot reply to an abusive letter or email.\nIn person, for example at a surgery or our office, we have the right to ask you to leave.\nBefore taking such action, we will always warn constituents that they are behaving in an unacceptable way to give them the chance to change their behaviour. However, a warning will not be given in extreme cases to protect our staff, for example, when a serious threat is made.\nWhere these circumstances arise, we will take the following steps:\n-\nwe’ll ask constituents to modify their behaviour and explain why;\n-\nif the behaviour continues to be unacceptable, our employees will remove themselves from the situation. If the communication is by telephone, the caller will be told that the call will be ended;\n-\na record of the incident. In all cases, Danny or her representative will investigate the situation and decide what action to take. This could include limiting a constituent’s contact with us;\n-\nwe’ll refer the matter to the police where a criminal offence has been threatened or committed.\nLimiting contact may include:\n-\nAppointing a specific point of contact for the constituent;\n-\nCommunicating only in writing or via a representative;\n-\nNo longer making surgery appointments for a constituent;\n-\nDeciding not to proceed in a case when behaviour has been unacceptable;\n-\nEnding all contact with a constituent.\nWhere a decision to limit contact has been made, then Danny will inform the constituent in writing.\nHow we will take account of our duties under the Equality Act\nDanny makes sure that her office meets the requirements of the Equality Act 2010. This includes making sure we consider adjustments for people with protected characteristics.\nWe understand that some people may have difficulty expressing themselves or communicating clearly and/or appropriately. We will always consider the needs and circumstances that we have been made are aware of, before deciding how best to manage the situation. This will include making reasonable adjustments.\nExamples of reasonable adjustments might include:\n-\nUsing a different method of communication;\n-\nproviding written communication in large print, coloured text, or translated to another language;\n-\ngiving clear warnings if conversations become unproductive and allowing constituents to opportunity to modify their behaviour before ending a call.\nHowever, this does not mean we will tolerate abusive language, violence, shouting, or other unacceptable behaviour or actions.\nIf an individual with a protected characteristic becomes the subject of a restriction under this policy, we will consider whether the restriction may affect them more than someone without that characteristic. If this is the case, we may make different arrangements so they can still receive support from Danny Beales MP.",
