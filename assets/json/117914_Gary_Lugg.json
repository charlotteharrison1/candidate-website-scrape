Phil Redshaw (LibDem, Cottingham North) has welcomed the decision by the East Riding of Yorkshire Council to allocate an additional £100k to combat fly-tipping at last week’s Budget meeting.\nCllr. Redshaw said “Having long-campaigned on this issue, working closely with Council Leaders and officers, I am delighted to see that this problem is now set to be properly addressed.”\nDespite the Council’s difficult financial position, Cllr. Wilkinson (Con, Howdenshire) announced that the 2025-2026 Budget to tackle “the scourge of fly-tipping” across the East Riding will be £170k, an increase of £100k.\nNote: Cllr. Wilkinson’s mention of fly-tipping at the Full Council Meeting on 6th February 2025 can be viewed on the below link, at 29.00 minutes.\nCllr. Redshaw is now hopeful of securing measures such as additional street lighting and CCTV cameras (including trail-cams) to tackle hot-spots around Cottingham and Dunswell, including Orchard Park Road, North Moor Lane and Dunswell Lane.\nFunding for CCTV cameras on Middledyke Lane and at a lay-by on the south side of the A1079 near Dunswell have already been agreed.\nCllr. Redshaw added “This is an example of Councillors across parties working together to address what is a growing issue across the East Riding. This will enable us to target unlicenced traders and to prevent future dumping through the use of trail-cams, mobile cameras, street lighting and permanent CCTV installations, which will finally allow us to get these sites cleared.”",

This includes data gathered via third parties, such as social media sites, and which is therefore also covered by their own Privacy Polices.\nThis policy was last updated on 2nd May 2018. Any updates will be posted to this version of the policy. If you wish to see a previous version of the policy, or have any other questions, please get in touch.\nWe may collect personal data about you such as:\nWe may also collect information when you interact with the party digitally, such as by visiting one of our websites or communicating with one of our social media channels. This may include additional data to that above, such as:\nWe may also collect information about you from other public sources, such as the Land Registry, Companies House or other commercially available sources.

This may include, for example, checking the eligibility of a potential donor and may include additional data to that above, such as:\nWe may use your personal data to further our objectives, share it with our elected representatives and/or contact you in future. Examples of the way we may use your data include to:\nFor more specific information about how we use your data for these activities, and the legal basis on which we rely to process your data in this way, please see the ‘Why the Party is allowed to use your information in this way’ part of this Notice.\nIf you have provided us with your email, mobile phone number or landline phone number and we have a legal right to use them for such purposes, we may use that information to contact you to promote causes and campaigns that we support, such as by sending you an email, online advert, or a text message.\nWe will respect any registration you hold with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) except where you have opted in to receive phone calls on that number from us.\nYou may opt out of communications from us at any time.\nDepending on how and why you provide us with your personal data it may be shared within the Party (i.e. between local, regional and national parts of the party and with our elected representatives) or with companies that provide services to the Party (“service providers”). For more information on service providers, please see here: https://www.libdems.org.uk/data-sharing.\nIn addition, we may share your personal data with third parties when we are required to do so by law (for example, with the Police where they ask us to assist them with their investigations).\nHowever, save for the limited circumstances noted above, we will never pass your personal data to any unrelated third parties unless you have given us your permission to do so. For example, where you have signed a petition and are clearly informed that this petition will be presented to a third party.\nThe Party is a registered national political party in the UK; our work is designed to promote our values and to engage UK citizens in the democratic process.\nAccordingly, our work is considered to be of substantial public interest. Because of that public interest basis we are entitled to process sensitive personal data which relates to your political opinions, and your personal data more generally, for the purposes of enabling us to perform our work effectively. Specifically, that processing may include using those aspects of your personal data to help us to plan and execute political campaigns, canvass for your support (such as by visiting or calling you), raise funds, and perform casework that relates to you and your local community.\nYou do have rights to ask us to stop processing your data for these purposes, and you can read details about those rights here . In addition to the above we may also process your data for other purposes where you ask us to, or enter into a relationship with us that requires us to.\nFor example, if you choose to join us as a volunteer we will need to process your personal data to record that you have given us your support in this way. A contract will be put in place between you and us and we will process your personal data to the extent that we need to in order to fulfil our obligations under that contract.\nSimilarly, you may from time to time give us your consent to send you communications by e-mail (or similar mediums) which promote our work. Where you do that we will use your details to send you those kinds of communications until you tell us otherwise. Should you ever ask us to stop sending those kinds of communications we will hold your details on file to ensure that we respect that request – we justify that retention on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in holding your data in that way.\nFinally, where we have received your personal data in the various ways described above, we may continue to hold it as part of our records after the relevant processing has stopped. We hold data in this way because we have a legitimate interest in doing so. Specifically, where you have been a member or a volunteer (or have otherwise engaged with us such as by attending a conference or event, or by responding to a survey or questionnaire) we have a legitimate interest in holding your personal data to help us to monitor the numbers and the diversity of people who engage with us, as well as a legitimate interest in making sure that we can follow up any complaints or grievances which you may raise (or which people may raise about you).\nThe Party will not sell your personal data to third parties.\nDepending on how and why you provide us with your personal data it may be shared within the Party (e.g. between local, regional and national parts of the party) and our elected representatives. It may also be shared with those who provide services to the Party (“service providers”).\nWe may use service providers to undertake processing operations on our behalf to provide us with a variety of administrative, statistical, advertising and technical services. We will only supply service providers with the minimum amount of personal data they need to fulfil the services we request. We oblige all of our data processors to sign contracts with us that clearly set out their commitment to respecting individual rights, protecting your personal data – including not using it for any purpose other than providing us with an agreed service or fulfilling their legal obligations - and their commitments to assisting us to help you exercise your rights as a data subject.\nWith your consent, service providers may hold personal data about you in order to facilitate the provision of future services or financial transactions to which you have agreed, such as a payment processor retaining your payment details in order to process agreed future payments from you.\nPlease note that some of our service providers are based outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). Where we transfer your data to a service provider that is outside of the EEA we seek to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to make sure that your personal data is held securely and that your rights as a data subject are upheld – in almost all cases we do this by ensuring that the agreements between us and our chosen service providers contain what are called the ‘model clauses’ that oblige them to treat your personal data as if they themselves were based in the EEA.\nIn addition, we may share your personal data with third parties when we are required to do so by law (for example, with the Police where they ask us to assist them with their investigations). In some cases, this may result in your personal data becoming public.\nIn particular, the Party and our candidates are required to submit records, including personal data, of donations above certain thresholds to the relevant regulatory authority. In some cases, some of these donation details are made public.

The Party may store your personal data on secure servers either on our premises or in third party data centres.\nClick on the following link to learn more about our Cookies Policy.\nWe only keep your personal data for as long as required to meet the purposes set out in this Notice, unless a longer retention period is required by law. For example, this may include holding your data after you have ceased to engage with the party (such as by resigning or ceasing to be a member) where we have a legitimate interest in doing so, such as to enable us to respond effectively to grievances that may arise after you cease to engage with us. Where we collect and hold your details as part of our public interest work, this may also include retaining those details for as long as you remain a registered voter in the UK.\nWhere permitted by law, we may also save personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, including historical research. This may involving passing such data to third parties who run historical archives .\nThe exact details of this are set out in our Data Retention Policy, a copy of which is available here (https://www.libdems.org.uk/data-retention) and all the above is subject to your legal rights, such as to have data in certain cases deleted or corrected, as set out below.\nYou have legal rights over any of your personal data that we hold.\nYou may, at any time, request access to the personal data that we hold which relates to you (sometimes called a subject access request).\nThis right entitles you to receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you.

You may also ask us to erase personal data if you do not believe that we need to continue retaining it (sometimes called the right to be forgotten).\nPlease note that we may ask you to verify any new data that you provide to us and may take our own steps to check that the new data you have supplied us with is accurate. Further, we are not always obliged to erase personal data when asked to do so; if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to erase we will tell you what that reason is at the time we respond to your request.\nWhere we process your personal data on the legal basis of us having a legitimate interest to do so, you are entitled to ask us to stop processing it in that way if you feel that our continuing to do so impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms or if you feel that those legitimate interests are not valid.\nYou may also ask us to stop processing your personal data (a) if you dispute the accuracy of that personal data and want us verify its accuracy; (b) where it has been established that our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where we no longer need to process your personal data (and would otherwise dispose of it) but you wish for us to continue storing it in order to enable you to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.\nIf for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to stop processing, we will tell you what that reason is, either at the time we first respond to your request or after we have had the opportunity to consider and investigate it.\nYou may, at any time, write to us to ask us to cease processing your personal data which relates to your political opinions (such as how you have voted in the past, and things that you have told us about how you are likely to vote).\nPlease note that these requests can only be made about data which relates to your political opinions; they will not affect our right to use other aspects of your personal data.\nWhere you wish to transfer certain personal data that we hold about you, which is processed by automated means, to a third party you may write to us and ask us to provide it to you in a commonly used machine-readable format.\nWherever possible, we will provide you with a choice about how we can contact you to share information about the Party.

Each of these underpin the party's specific policy proposals.\nLiberty\nWe believe in the right of individuals to make their own decisions about how they live their lives, as long as they do not cause harm to others.\nOur aim is to empower and support individuals to pursue their dreams, to make the most of their talents and to live their lives as they wish.\nEquality\nWe stand by the idea that without equality, true liberty cannot be realised.\nThis requires an active state to: ensure that no one is held back by poverty, poor health, or discrimination, including on the basis of personal characteristics or beliefs; provide access to education or training, and other public services, including a welfare safety net; and guarantee that everyone enjoys equality before the law.\nDemocracy\nWe understand that through democracy, every citizen is empowered to make their voice heard, without being dominated by entrenched interests or the power of money; checks and balances, so that those in power cannot abuse their positions for personal gain or political advantage; and a plurality of views, where no individual or organisation is deterred from speaking truth to power.\nCommunity\nWe believe it is important to provide support for a diverse range of organisations that enable individuals to join together in the pursuit of common goals or activities; and the decentralisation of political and economic power to local government and the nations and regions of the UK.\nHuman Rights\nProviding, defending and promoting equal legal rights for everyone to pursue their lives according to their abilities, wishes and means, with no discrimination on the basis of religion or belief, gender, sexuality, age, ethnicity, disability, or minority status in their country of birth or permanent residency is highly important to us.\nInternationalism\nWe support a fairer and more equal, tolerant and connected world and collaboration with the UK's neighbours - including, ultimately, rejoining the EU - in guaranteeing peace and security, tackling the climate and nature emergencies, standing up to corporate power and spreading prosperity around the world.\nEnvironmentalism\nWe value the importance of acting at home and internationally to promote environmentally sustainable means of production and consumption and living in harmony with nature.\nOur policies\nLearn more about the influence these values have on Liberal Democrat policy",

Phil Redshaw (Cottingham North) said “The remedies imposed as part of the 2021 Review are simply not fit for purpose. We are calling on Ofcom to take a proactive approach and introduce both transparency and effective regulation”.\nThe Hull Telecoms area is regulated very differently to Openreach in the rest of the UK, particularly regarding Physical Infrastructure Access (PIA).\nKCOM’s competitors have to rely on the Access to Infrastructure (ATI) regulations, which are far too cumbersome to facilitate the rapid deployment of gigabit capable services.\nMS3 and Connexin are therefore building their own separate infrastructure, with a triplication of last mile delivery apparatus, including telegraph poles and catenary wires.\nA Market Review combined with a pause in build, should consider:\n- Imposing a duty on telecoms companies to demonstrate reasonable efforts have been made to reach an agreement with KCOM for access to infrastructure.\n- Compel KCOM to publish pricing for access to its infrastructure.\n- In the event that no agreement is reached, oblige companies to pursue a formal Dispute via Ofcom, prior to installing further infrastructure of their own.",
