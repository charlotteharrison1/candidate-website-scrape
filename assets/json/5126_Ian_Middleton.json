You can watch it here.\nOf course in Yarnton, Begbroke and Gosford (where I’m standing to become the new local County Councillor) it’s in the forefront of everyone’s minds because, if it goes ahead, we’ll be the ones living in the middle of a building site for possibly the next 10 years. We’ll also see our small rural communities destroyed and replaced with a single medium sized town, one that will probably also double up as a university campus for the Begbroke Science Park.\nBut even in Kidlington, (which comprises a large part of the County division) it’s going to have a huge impact. There may not be as many houses built in the area, but the additional strain on our local resources, such as health services, education and leisure facilities will be very detrimental. We’ll also see a noticeable reduction in air quality which is likely to have health impacts on the most vulnerable, as well as increased risks of flooding. The A44 will probably become a car park during busy times, giving us all the chance to sit and admire the 4 storey apartment blocks that will tower over the edge of the dual carriageway.\nThere’s also a good chance that Kidlington will finally lose the argument about hanging on to it’s status as a village. In 10 years time, when the population has possibly tripled, there’s likely to be a much greater push to establish the whole area as a suburb of a Greater Oxford City. Not a prospect I, or anyone else in the area, relishes but something we may have little choice over.\nI for one won’t stop fighting for that until the last blade of grass has fallen under the bulldozer’s tracks.\nAll this might be acceptable to a greater degree if these houses were going to provide affordable accommodation for local families, many of whom are crammed into a single house with perhaps 3 generations under one roof. But these aren’t for the likes of them. These will be expensive luxury executive houses built for investment purposes, with the so-called ‘affordable’ houses reserved for people in Oxford City. The District Council saw to that when they handed control of those houses over to the City Council in a closed meeting at the beginning of the first lockdown. None of these houses will be within reach of local residents.\nA lot of people have told me that all this is inevitable and that the 4400 houses are a ‘done deal’. Well that isn’t the case until we know the outcome of the legal challenge being brought to the high court next month. Until that’s over we have no idea if these proposals will stand up or collapse. There have been reports in other areas recently where challenges have been upheld, and if we get the same result Cherwell District Council will have to think again. In those circumstances we’ll need as much support on the District Council as possible which is why I’m supporting Fiona Mawson to become our second Green Party Councillor on CDC.\nBut even if we fail to stop these devastating plans though the courts, we can at least do our best to limit some of that devastation by having engaged and active councillors at all levels of local government. On the County Council fighting for infrastructure and other important considerations like flood protection, and of course at District and Parish level scrutinising the individual planning proposals themselves. We also have to be vigilant in opposing ‘infilling’ which may become more of an issue as the amount of development space in the area is snapped up by the bigger developers.\nSo I hope I and Fiona can count on the support of our local residents in the elections on Thursday. We’ve seen how our current crop of Conservative councillors have let us down on these issues, and let’s not forget that this whole idea was the brainchild of the Conservatives on Cherwell District Council in the first place, in cahoots with Oxford University, the City Council, the Oxfordshire Growth Board and the Local Enterprise Partnership. After Thursday we may have more leverage to defend our small rural communities against these faceless, unelected and anti-democratic quangos and take back control of our green heritage.\nI for one won’t stop fighting for that until the last blade of grass has fallen under the bulldozer’s tracks. I hope you’ll all support me as your Green Councillor in that long battle.",

Here’s my article on Huffington Post dealing with the rather rabid right wing press hysteria that followed Natalie Bennett’s appearance on TV this Sunday.\nIt’s been receiving quite a bit of attention!\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/green-party-policy_b_6551676.html",

Begbroke and Yarnton and plonk 4400 houses in the middle of an area with overloaded roads and infrastructure. A plan that would see the three communities amalgamated into one sprawling conurbation, created not to serve local affordable housing needs, but to supposedly provide housing for workers in the city, even though most of the jobs are based in the east.\nYou can read the full response here\nAs everyone involved knows the oft-touted claims that this will include so-called ‘affordable’ housing is laughable. Valuable green belt land will become ten times more valuable once it becomes ripe for development and the landowners and luxury house builders will stand to make a fortune.\nI along with several others were allowed a five minute representation to the councillors in the chamber, some of whom it was later reported couldn’t even be bothered to listen to those who had come to plead their case. One was even photographed using a mobile phone during the speeches!\nSeeing the lack of connectedness demonstrated by the predominately Conservative council enraged me more than I imagined it would. If you watch the video footage from the planning meeting a few weeks ago you can hear me heckling quite loudly throughout some of speeches from Barry Wood and Colin Clarke.\nNormally I wouldn’t do something like that. They deserve their time to speak just as I and the other campaigners had. But being the last to have their say (as Cllr Wood ensured he would be) they were able to simply brush aside the very salient points raised by protesters and other councillors.\nTory councillor after Tory councillor stood up and gave no logical reason why these plans should be forced through in the face of what everyone recognised was an historic level of opposition from the people in the district they represent.\nOver 1500 responses were given to the plans, nearly all of them objecting to this wanton and unnecessary destruction of our precious green belt. Yet the council seemed oblivious to them, to the cogent arguments put forward by speakers and even to the legal opinions that were presented by the two main campaigning groups.\nThe cavalier attitude of Barry Wood, who I’d previously challenged for seeming to pre-judge the outcome of the consultation, was amply demonstrated when he and his fellow councillors abdicated their responsibility to the people of Cherwell and threw their objections at the feet of the planning inspector.\nHis closing argument was that it was the inspector who would make the final decision not them, even though they were elected to represent us. As I suspected months ago, the council had already made its mind up, and the consultation was simply a box ticking exercise. The fate of our green spaces, our wildlife habitats, our clean air and the distinctiveness of our communities has been thrown into the lap of an outside agency because the Tories on the council didn’t have the guts or the inclination to properly consider the alternatives.\nSo I hope you’ll forgive me some heckling out of pure frustration at the lack of professionalism and respect for democracy being shown by these people.\nThat’s why I want to win this election. I want a guaranteed voice in that chamber so that I can represent the views of the people in Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke – an area that is so remote from that chamber, way up at the other end of the district that people like Barry Wood and Colin Clarke feel it’s safe to throw us all under the bus for the sake of expediency.\nIt’s also why the Green Party in Kidlington is working with the Liberal Democrats in this election to elect me in Kidlington East and Alaric Rose in Kidlington West. You can see our joint statement about that here.\nI hope you’ll give me and Alaric a chance to be a strong voice for you after May 3rd.\nYou can see the full video of the planning meeting (including the heckling) on the Cherwell District Council Website. You can see my speech to the chamber here.",

Moreover a spectacular win for my electoral partner, Libdem candidate Alaric Rose in Kidlington West who nearly doubled the Libdem vote and completely wiped the floor with the Conservatives!\nIt would have been great to have won my seat as well, but with such a short campaign it was hard to get the message out to enough people. Ultimately it was a total validation for both of us of our decision to work together for the common good.\nSlightly galling that the Carmen Griffiths kept her seat as I understand she was hardly seen on the campaign trail. She wasn’t at the count, didn’t make an appearance on polling day (to my knowledge) and instead sat back and let local Tory cult figures like Maurice Billington do all the campaigning for her.\nJudging by her attendance record at council meetings this seems to be a pattern of behaviour for a pretty lacklustre councillor. I think many of the voters in the ward didn’t actually know which blue candidate they were voting for and seemed oblivious to the fact that there were more dedicated candidates on offer who would much more effectively represent them in Cherwell.\nPerhaps when Carmen and her remaining Tory colleagues fail to turn up at other key planning meetings and the green belt is concreted over, bringing with it traffic chaos, pollution, and the collapse of local infrastructure, all those that trooped into the polling station to dutifully put a cross in the Tory box, regardless of the candidate, will realise their mistake. It might be a bit late then though.\nOne other stark reality from the results is that if Labour had endorsed me (as we suggested) and we had endorsed them in one of the North Oxfordshire wards (as we offered) we would both have easily won our seats, meaning a new Labour, Green and Libdem seat on the council and 3 Tory losses instead of 1. Just imagine what sort of message that would have sent out! Especially on important and urgent local issues like the building on green belt in the area.\nLabour really need to wake up to the reality of fractured left politics in this country and work with other parties like the Greens and the Libdems. We need to stop living in the past and embrace the future. There’s more that unites us than divides us and if we’re going to stop yet another Conservative government in 2022 we must start building alliances. If anyone from Labour wants to talk, I’m all ears.\nIn the meantime I intend to go on being a thorn in the side of Cherwell’s complacent Tory leadership and will be working closely with Alaric as part of our pre-election co-operative agreement. I may not be able to vote on council matters, but I can certainly speak up in the council chamber and outside in the media. I’ll be fighting hard on local green belt and conservation issues and keeping a wary eye on the attendance record of my Tory opponent. The Greens will be fighting the elections in the ward once again next year and I hope that will again be in partnership with the Liberal Democrats.\nFinally a big thank you to everyone who voted for me and to the dedicated people who helped us pull together such a professional campaign in such a short time. the Greens made historic gains across the country yesterday and I think it’s a credit to all our members that we can do this stuff on such a small budgets and with small teams. Just think what we could do in government!\nStay tuned and follow this website/blog for updates on what I and the Green Party will be doing between now and the next elections.\nVoteGreen#2019",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_banbury_page_3/content_404.html": "We were told the last election was all about Education – Education – Education. This one should be NHS – NHS – NHS.\nThe road to privatisation of the NHS has been a long one and began under the Conservatives in 1992 with the Private Finance Initiative. It’s a neat trick that enables huge amounts of debt to be moved off the national balance sheet whilst still expanding operational infrastructure.\nNew Labour saw it as something too good to be true, as it allowed them to build new hospitals, without borrowing more money or raising taxes. But like most things that seem too good to be true, it was. By the end of their tenure Labour had saddled the NHS with £80Bn in repayments on total capital assets worth around £11Bn, and we’re still paying for it now.\nThen along came the Conservatives again who just love to privatise things. Every time they’ve been in government they’ve privatised something. The trains, electricity, gas, BT, the post office – which they practically gave away.\nBut the Tories have a problem when it comes to the NHS. They can’t flat out privatise it, because that’s politically toxic.\nSo in 2012 – The year that Danny Boyle showed us in his spectacular Olympic opening ceremony what a glorious thing the NHS is – the Conservatives brought in the Health and Social Care Bill.\nA bill that many people didn’t even notice passing through parliament. But a bill that arguably affects all of us more than any other legislation in our lifetime. A bill based on the premise that the NHS was a poorly performing institution that needed reform and another £3Bn top down reorganisation that we’d been promised before the election wouldn’t happen. A bill that ignored the core values of the NHS and characterised it’s staff as a problem to be dealt with rather than it’s greatest asset. A bill that achieved the Tory Nirvana of laying the NHS open to private contractors, furthering their ideology that the state should not be responsible for providing public services.\nIt effectively legislated against free universal comprehensive healthcare and flung the door to privatisation wide open. And private health firms are falling over themselves to come inside.\nJeremy Hunt has just announced £780Million worth of private contracts to 11 firms, many of which have a chequered history. Many of them are also donors to the Tory Party. There are also plans in Staffordshire to privatise cancer care in a £700M contract and ‘End of life care’ worth another £500M\nIn a leaked confidential document it’s proposed that these contractors will be :\n“Given ‘discretion’ to design services they would like to deliver, slash spend per patient and propose the payment structures most beneficial to themselves”.\nIn that one clause we get a glimpse of how private companies will pervert the ethos of the NHS to their own end.\nFirst the add on services will be an extra cost. Then any new treatments, drugs or therapies will be extra\nIn effect we’ll end up with a RyanAir NHS – Your operation will be free, but they’ll charge you £500 for the bed and another fifty for using the toilet.\nThe government consistently claims the NHS budget is protected but in reality, it’s being forced to make cuts dressed up as efficiency savings of £15bn – £20bn by the end of this year. No wonder we’re losing services. And across the country, A&Es, maternity and other services are being closed, with thousands of jobs lost. Competitive tendering also fragments healthcare. Where patients are sent miles to access different care resources around the country based on contractor costs.\nI’m standing as Parliamentary candidate for the Green Party in Banbury, where people are rightfully worried about that fragmentation and the future of their beloved Horton General Hospital. Labour have already tried to close it once, and more recently the coalition began a reduction in the range of services offered there, with the removal of emergency abdominal surgery facilities. This has resulted in some patients being forced to make a 3 or 4 hour, 50 mile round trip to services at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Not only is this extremely inconvenient, it also potentially impairs patient outcome as additional stress is added to their situation.\nBanbury has a long history of returning Conservative MPs, but this time every voter in the constituency has to ask themselves the question – do I still want to have access to a fully free and fully funded NHS in 5 years time?\nIf the answer is yes you have to remember that, no matter how much you might like the Conservative candidate this time (and I’ll admit I like her too), a vote for Victoria Prentis will just make another Tory led government more of a reality. No matter how much she says she’ll fight for the Horton, she’ll be forced to follow her party’s privatisation agenda. Even if she votes against the whip she’ll be a lone voice in a government she helped to put into power.\nI want to see an end to all privatisation of the NHS and I believe the NHS should be brought back entirely into public ownership.\nThe Green Party supports the NHS re-instatement bill, we’d negotiate an exit from PFI and repeal the Health and Social Care Act. We’d also fight TTIP which could have a huge impact on the NHS. We believe that NHS staff deserve a fair deal and that they should be supported and valued rather than treated as a problem to be dealt with\nAneurin Bevan was once asked how long he thought the NHS would survive. He replied: “As long as there are folk left with the faith to fight for it.”\nEvery party is pledging to invest more money into the NHS but the Green Party won’t just invest cash, we’ll also invest our faith. We all have to show that faith now or by the end of the next parliament Danny Boyle’s proud Olympic love letter to our wonderful NHS could become it’s epitaph.",

But with the help of a few progressive minded Labour voters I could be assured of that win.\nLabour and the Greens share many ideals about social justice, unions, anti-austerity and creating a fairer society for everyone. I have a chance to forward those aims in Kidlington as the most likely candidate to take the seat from the incumbent Tory.\nIf you want to see a Conservative defeat in Kidlington West, I’m your best chance of that. I hope you’ll give real thought to voting tactically today to help me help you send a message to the Conservatives that their days of heartless government are numbered.\nPlease vote Green today and let’s all score a win against Conservative complacency!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_page_26/content_476.html": "The government announced plans today for a new ‘Garden City’ to be built on ex-MOD land on the outskirts of Bicester in Oxfordshire. The proposals will be backed by £100M of government funds and will include ‘sustainable’ transport infrastructure, green spaces and new local amenities.\nOn the face of it this could be a boost for Bicester, but I suspect the devil will be in the details.\nMuch of the announcement seems to cover projects that are already in planning or underway. The new railway station for example. There’s also some confusion over if this is to be a re-imagining of the much vaunted eco-village or an entirely new project.\nIt is encouraging however to see that the project is to be built on a brown field site.\nConfusingly, the definition of a ‘garden city’ is being left to the developer’s imaginations with the government saying it doesn’t want to “impose any definition of what garden cities are”. This could likely mean we’ll end up with another estate full of either ‘luxury homes’ that ordinary people can’t afford, or shoe-boxes crammed together to generate maximum profit. That would probably mean any aspirations to provide gardens and green space will go right out the window.\nIf Nick Clegg really wants this to be development different from all the other clone estates thrown up around the country, I’m afraid he’s going to have to nail his colours to some sort of mast and properly define his intentions. But that might prove more difficult than a glib press release full of utopian imagery.\nThere would also need to be a clear vision that the people living in this new ‘city’ will be contributing to the local economy and society as well as working in it. With a train station on the doorstep, such a development could easily become a dormitory for London commuters or a sink hole of buy-to-let properties.\nAffordability will be the key. If these homes are intended for people on middle and lower incomes, then I’d support the idea. But I suspect such values won’t be compatible with what Nick Clegg sees as a ‘garden city’.\nPersonally I’d like to see more genuine thinking along these lines, subject to the above caveats. But ultimately this may all just come to nothing.\nSo many of these big legacy projects either evaporate into the ether once they’ve generated enough headlines, or turn into something very different once the realities of cost, demand and political will begin to bite.\nThere’s a veritable tsunami of these grandiose announcements coming out from government at the moment though. Like the spurious claims for new spending on road infrastructures announced earlier this week, many of them are just old or existing projects being re-launched as new spend to give the impression of a go-ahead administration full of exciting possibilities for the future.\nAnyone would think there was an election round the corner!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2019_12/content_213.html": "Last night we saw the Cherwell Conservatives in their true colours as they waved through some fundamental changes to the council constitution despite the report they were based on being full of errors and inconsistencies.\nThe report itself had not been through the scrutiny and overview process, neither had any councillor, to my knowledge, been previously consulted or invited to comment on it. It was simply dropped on to the December meeting agenda, possibly in the hope that it wouldn’t receive too much attention from councillors in the run up to Christmas.\nThis throws up a fundamental question on how the council is run. Should significant issues of democratic accountability be amended by officers with virtually no input from elected councillors? I’d argue not. Councillors are bound by the constitution and the rules governing meetings. They should at the very least be consulted appropriately on any changes that will affect these rules.\nThe proposals included restrictions on motions and amendments length, shorter notice periods for questions to council, and the ability to reject motions on the basis of heavily subjective assessments of them being ‘vexatious’ or ‘frivolous’. They are arguably designed to limit both the scope of debates and, by implication, the ability of councillors to fully represent their ward residents.\nArguments were put forward that these rules already exist on some local councils, yet in Oxfordshire only one out of 5 district councils have similar rules (although with far greater latitude on things like motion length) and only the County Council has anything approaching this level of restriction. It’s arguable that the County, with usually a far greater number of motions and procedural matters need a more streamlined system, but at district level this has never been an issue in Oxfordshire.\nOne has to ask what the motivations would be for the council agreeing to these proposals so readily. It’s probable that after the recent change in the makeup of the council, with more non-conservative councillors being elected every year, the Tories are simply frightened of public debate.\nThis would appear to be predicated on the Conservatives bare-faced admission that they had already decided how they would vote on issues before any motion was proposed or debate initiated. Barry Wood’s repeated claim in meetings that all his councillors will essentially do as they are told completely undermines the basis of individual councillor representation.\nEven though the report containing these proposals was significantly flawed, it was voted through by the Conservatives on the apparent understanding that it could be re-written or corrected later, without the need for further ratification. That in itself would seem to be a ludicrous approach. How can any such changes be approved in advance of knowing what they are?\nAs we have seen on numerous occasions, this is the reality of democracy in Cherwell, where the dominant follow-my-leader Tories vote en-bloc on everything, regardless of the interests of the people they represent.\nThis was evident during the debate at the same meeting over a second successive motion brought to the council calling on it to oppose the Oxford to Cambridge Expressway. This included claims from Councillor Dan Sames – the council’s lead on green issues – that he is “passionate” about the environment, whilst simultaneously keeping an ‘open mind’ about a huge motorway being built, possibly through environmentally sensitive areas like Otmoor, which he represents. Councillors like this voted for a climate change emergency motion and then somehow reconcile that with building a huge motorway. This shows just how little commitment they really have towards care for the environment.\nCherwell District Council is now the only council in Oxfordshire not to have voted to oppose the Expressway. As a result they are tacitly supporting it subject only to the final route. Any route will be environmentally damaging, but this doesn’t seem to be an issue for the ‘Concreting Conservatives’.\nThe fact that council leader, Barry Wood, is also the Chair of the Arc Leaders Group appointed by the MHCLG to promote the expressway plans, as well as being an OxLEP and Oxfordshire Growth Board member – both organisations with a vested interest in promoting the expressway – seems not to be regarded as significant bias by the council. I’d surmise that that is the only reason why we’re still having this debate in Cherwell – the instruction from Cllr Wood to his poodle councillors appears to be that they should not undermine his position on all these bodies by opposing one of their keynote projects.\nI do not have an open mind about the Expressway and will continue to oppose it at every opportunity in favour of much more sustainable and environmentally sensitive projects such as East/West Rail. We do not need any more massive major road building projects in this part of the county (or arguably anywhere else) regardless of which route they may take. The Green Party’s commitment to tackling climate change cannot be overruled by the imperatives of growth for its own sake that lie at the heart of Conservative proposals in Oxfordshire.\nYou can view a webcast of the entire meeting on the Cherwell District Council website here http://modgov.cherwell.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=114&MId=3240&Ver=4",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2014_11_page_2/content_392.html": "This is a piece I wrote for Huffington Post earlier this week. I think it speaks for itself, although after it was published I thought I should have pointed out that none of the the politicians I refer to in the studio on election night were Greens. As usual we weren’t invited to the BBC party. There were however representatives from Labour, Conservative, Libdems and UKIP. Given that the Greens had a reasonably good showing in the last General Election in Rochester (for a ‘marginal’ party) I’d have thought we’d have been worth a mention at least. But apparently not.\nAnyway I hope this serves as a good first post on my website/blog and you can see the original article here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/westminster-politics_b_6199214.html?utm_hp_ref=tw.\nFeel free to comment below or on the original article on the Huffington Post site.\nI recently became a parliamentary candidate for the Green Party. After years of railing against politicians, the irony, and perhaps the hypocrisy, of becoming one myself has not been lost on me.\nThen again, there were the constant jibes about my complaining a lot but doing nothing positive to make a change. So when my local party group asked me to stand, I said I’d give it a go. And here I am. Feel free to point the finger.\nOne of the first things I’ve noticed about the underbelly of politics is just how strategic it is. Target wards, target seats, candidates standing in constituencies where they don’t live for the sake of political expediency. None of this is new, or unusual, or even un-democratic, but it does take some getting used to.\nBut watching the BBC election special on the Rochester and Strood by-election, you could be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the political world has turned into some kind of wife swapping party from the mid 70s. It seems these days that political manoeuvring between the ruling parties has moved beyond juggling their own family jewels, and has been reduced to chucking their keys into the fruit bowl with anyone who fancies a quick fumble with their majority.\nFirstly we had UKIP’s Deputy Chairperson Suzanne Evans being interviewed about where her party would go after the predicted win in Rochester. This consisted of a serious of nods and winks about who might and might not leap out of their own party bed and sneak into theirs when the neighbours weren’t looking. A sort of Carry-On Westminster, but with less laughs.\nShe then went on to explain, with barely concealed glee, that her fondest ambition was to seduce someone from Labour to join in their little tryst. Nigel is apparently talking to a couple of MPs but she couldn’t reveal more. She did everything but tap the side of her nose, elbow Andrew Neil in the ribs and give a little Babs Windsor giggle.\nThen we had an analysis from a political expert explaining how UKIP’s performance in the by-election would determine how other sitting MPs would behave in the run up to next years general election. His premise was that if UKIP did well in Rochester, many other career politicians would be considering their position in the next few months. The expectation is apparently that if they think UKIP is a better bet for them to hold on to their seat (ooh matron!), then they would switch allegiances in order to do so.\nNow you’ll have to excuse me. I’m quite new to this game. But when one joins a party isn’t there something about ideology written into the contract? Or am I now being ridiculously naive?\nJudging by the behaviour of at least two recent pantheons of British democracy I suppose I am. It seems that standing on a platform with a bunch of like minded individuals in the hope of doing something good for the country isn’t what it’s about any more.\nNo, apparently it’s more about hanging on to the House Of Commons parking place, the expense account, and access to the House of Commons bar, rather than the boring stuff like philosophical conviction. Some back-benchers are evidently more interested in maintaining a comfortable position for themselves, rather than for their constituents. Yet, in true British carry-on style, they still keep getting elected.\nAs a newcomer to this world, I saw with fresh eyes last night these four sombre suited politicians sitting uneasily with each other, smugly carving up the political cake amongst themselves. Like children at birthday party trying to decide who gets the last portion of jelly and ice cream, the polemic was about anything other than the issues that this country and the planet really face.\nIain Duncan Smith spent a good deal of his time justifying a particularly vituperative campaign poster that portrayed the idea of voting for Mark Reckless as on a par with seeking Pol Pot as a spiritual adviser. Reckless used to be an investment banker, he didn’t live in the area, he’d only moved there to take a safe seat. All very salient points for the local electorate, but ones that seemed exquisitely irrelevant when he was the Conservative MP only a few months ago.\nMeanwhile UKIP expounded their claim that they listened to the people, and were offering an alternative to the status quo of careerist politicians who’d never done a days honest labour in their lives. Odd then that their success last night, and in Clacton a few weeks ago, relied on exactly the reverse of those ideals by welcoming with open arms two MPs firmly rooted in the rotten political establishment they claimed to despise.\nOn the point of principle I am in total agreement with them. The current political establishment has reduced democracy to the level of swapping football cards in the playground. But it’s a tawdry game of top trumps that they have just as much of a hand in as all the other entrenched Westminster parties.\nIf this is the future of politics in this country, I’m glad to be a member of a party that currently stands as an exemplar of how it is still possible to operate democratically without playing these cynical games. We may now have one less MP than UKIP, but at least ours is there on merit, rather than because she swapped her rosette for a more appealing colour.\nAnd Caroline Lucas has just won MP of the year, which is something that gives me hope. Even so, she’s now the focus of a campaign to unseat her by the Labour party in Brighton, because, and despite of the fact, that Labour and the Greens share many of the same aims.\nMoreover, if all these people care about is hanging on to their positions at all costs, what really is the point? And if the electorate is so fickle that they can’t see through this charade, maybe we deserve the graceless, flagitious mess they all seem to be making of the world.\nOne apocryphal anecdote from Rochester I heard today was that someone had voted UKIP because the sitting Tory MP hadn’t done enough for the local area. If that’s true, it’s an indictment of the great British voter more demoralising than anything supposedly implied by hanging a flag out of the window of your mock-Georgian semi.\nBut as an accidental politician I have to hope that it isn’t true, or at least typical. I have to trust that people in the UK will see past all the identikit politicos, the vested interests and the horse trading of their democratic heritage, and vote for real change and genuine representation in the next government.\nI am ever the optimist.",

Lots to say on this, but as always happens with these things, a 10-minute interview gets condensed into a 10-second comment!\nOn the way back we passed several signs on field gates warning about how the area is under threat from the Oxford to Cambridge Expressway. As someone who’s been involved in the campaign to stop this ridiculous and unnecessary development I thought I’d add a few more comments by way of a video and also expand a bit on what the Green Party would do to protect our vital green spaces.\nThis is something I’ve been involved with for a number of years now, right across the county, trying to combat the epidemic of projects that want to destroy these areas in the name of profit and greed.\nYes we need housing, but it has to be the right housing in the right places. Building on green belt will never be viable in terms of affordable housing as the land is so expensive. Developers build in a set level of profitability, usually a staggering 20%! That means that removing protection from green spaces like these just increases the number of high value, unaffordable houses being built.\nNot only that, concreting over green spaces means they can no longer lock up the carbon that we need to reduce in our environment, and they also increase the likelihood of flooding as they can no longer absorb the increased level of rain we’re getting as the climate patterns shift.\nThe Conservatives back all these projects because they are there to help wealthy landowners, developers and investors make a fat profit out of our rural heritage. As your MP I would resist all these projects, just as I now resist them as a District and Parish Councillor.\nGreens CAN WIN\nAs we’ve just seen in Wallingford, where another Green councillor has just been elected to the county council, Greens CAN WIN and we WILL WIN if people get out and give us their vote. Even if I don’t win in Banbury, a significant increase in the Green vote there will send a strong message to government that we demand change. An increased Green vote will be a visible signal of that, whereas another ‘heroic defeat’ for the other parties will get lost in the usual fog of post-election reporting.\nNow more than ever we need a strong Green voice, for the environment, for our future and for our children’s future. Please vote Green on December 12th.",

It has serious environmental and quality of life issues for all of us, but particularly for those of us who live in areas that sit on top of these deposits. Unfortunately for us, that included large areas of North Oxford and Cherwell.\nFracking has been sold as being the answer to the UK’s energy problems, but in areas like the USA where it’s been widely used, this has not been proved to be the case. What has been shown is that it contaminates water supplies and creates huge amounts of noise and disruption for local residents. It’s also been implicated as the cause land movements and in some cases actual earthquakes. Indeed when the first test drill was sunk in the UK near Blackpool, they experienced one of the strongest earth tremors recorded in the area in decades.\nThe main process involves drilling large bore holes, often sideways underneath properties not owned by the drilling companies (as right that has now been granted to them by the government) and pumping a cocktail of water and up to 90 different chemicals, many of them highly toxic, into the ground under immense pressure. This cracks the rock and releases trapped gas. The water is then recycled back into the normal water system where it’s treated and used again. That is apart from the water that leaks into local water courses and along with some of chemicals and the gas.\nIf you want to see how this process affects local people watch the film Gasland and Gasland 2, clips of which are available on YouTube.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZe1AeH0Qz8\nAnother main method is something called underground coal gasification, which involved drilling into coal seams and then setting them alight. The controlled burn then generates coal gas which is extracted. This process is often hard to control and becomes every bit as horrific as it sounds. This is the type of extraction that we could see being used in areas like Bloxham which sits on large coal deposits.\nA national pressure group has also been set up called ‘Frack Off’. They recently released a short video that explains what we may see in our area if fracking is allowed to go ahead.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYniYtJEeeI\ngovernment’s presumption against fracking in designated areas, such as national parks, goes to show that the Coalition recognises that hydraulic fracking will harm the environment and presents significant risks.\nThe Green Party calls on the government to offer all communities the same protection from dirty and dangerous fracking and shift energy policy focus instead towards clean, renewable energy sources and energy conservation.\nThe latest bidding process for licenses to extract shale gas from large parts of the UK is under way. The government is also proposing to pay large amounts of money to local councils that support fracking, regardless of local residents wishes.\nAbout half the UK is open to exploration, but tightened rules cover areas of outstanding beauty and large areas of Cherwell. The Green Party is the only mainstream political party fighting to stop fracking being pushed through by a government which consistently puts corporate profit over people.\nCaroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, said:\n“While the Government has signalled an intention to ensure some protective measures, we can have little confidence in promises of a robust regulatory framework.\n“We know fracking can cause water contamination and shortages, as well as air and soil pollution. And this is an industry that’s made a catalogue of errors already. But legitimate concerns over its very real environmental and health risks are falling on deaf ears.\n“By seeking to lock us ever-more firmly into fossil fuel dependence the Government is turning a blind eye to reason. It’s crystal clear that we need to be shifting to clean, renewable energy sources.\n“We need a rapid shift to a zero carbon economy and that is not going to happen by pouring resources into establishing an entirely new fossil fuel industry.”\nAs your MP I would fight tooth and nail to prevent our wonderful communities and countryside from being torn apart by this ‘bottom of the barrel’ technology. The Green Party is the only major party standing up against these proposals and we need support of local communities to help us stop these wells from being set up before it’s too late. Once the process is begun we may all live to regret the fact that we didn’t stand up to be counted when we had the chance.",

After that I went on to study for an MSc in applied psychology and technology assessment at Cranfield Institute of technology in Bedford.\nIn the 1980s I was a struggling musician for a number of years, during which time I made a living selling jewellery from market stalls in Greenwich and Camden Lock with my partner Fiona, who I met at university in 1981. We finally married in 2020 after what can be described as a long engagement!\nI moved to Yarnton with Fiona in 1993 and a year later we opened our first small shop in central Oxford. From there we went on to grow the business to a 6 store chain with branches across the country. We closed all our stores in 2015 in the face of huge overheads and falling sales on the high street. We now focus on our online business and I also do work as a retail analyst and speaker and write on retail, business and the environment.\nI’m a regular runner and outdoor enthusiast, I also enjoy rambling, scrambling, some climbing and cycling. I only take holidays in the UK, usually involving mountains or hills. I love all wildlife and I’m concerned that local habitat for many of our indigenous inhabitants is not lost. I’m also a vegan and animal rights campaigner.\nI joined the Green Party in 2012 after becoming disillusioned with the three other main parties. I saw that the Green Party had moved on from its origins as a single policy party to offer credible solutions to fill the ideological vacuum left between Labour and Conservative.\nI’ve stood in every local election since then and in the 2019 was delighted to be elected to Cherwell District Council as it’s first ever Green councillor. I was also elected to two parish councils in Kidlington and Yarnton the same year and later seconded on to Gosford and Water Eaton Parish Council. In 2021 I was elected to Oxfordshire County Council for the Kidlington South Division and am now the leader of the County Green group and the deputy leader of the Green/Libdem Alliance. This obviously keeps me very busy, but I enjoy working for the local community and holding the other parties to account on the District Council.\nI’m a writer and campaigner for independent retail, and I write a regular column for the national magazine Retail Week. I’ve also written pieces for other local and national magazines, including The Independent, The Evening Standard and The Guardian, as well as local newspapers in Oxford and Banbury. I’ve appeared on National TV, radio and online, discussing economic, high street issues and animal welfare issues. I’ve also written for a number of online publications including Huffington Post, Evolve Politics and The London Economic. I’ve recently been focussing on the idea of how businesses can be operated on a more sustainable and ethical footing and I’m also increasingly concerned with how consumerism can be balanced sustainably against finite natural resources.\nI stood in the 2015, 2017 and 2019 General Elections in Banbury. I believe that the Green Party now has policies that can provide fair and sensible solutions to the wider issues in society as well as focussing on the environmental concerns. I also think that in years to come green issues will become unavoidably bound to everything we do as a society and only a party with a realistic grasp of that relationship will be able to deal with the problems that will be facing us over the next several decades.\nWhile some other parties pay lip service to the idea of a green future, the Green Party allows such a concept to inform and evolve within its mainstream policies. I’m convinced that this is an essential element in world politics to ensure our future survival and prosperity as a nation and even as a species.\nThe Greens were the first to introduce climate change emergency motions to local and national government, and we are the only party who has consistently supported green initiatives, including the Green New Deal that was first proposed by Caroline Lucas over 10 years ago.\nI’m an ardent advocate on both national and local green issues, particularly relating to sustainable farming methods, the green belt, the treatment of animals in food production and green energy. As a local independent businessman, I’m also and avid promoter of local enterprise and businesses that put back as much into society as they take out.\nThis is particularly relevant in today’s retail world where the future of the UK high street is in some doubt. As a retailer for over 30 years and a former operator of one of the last remaining independents in central Oxford, I know exactly how hard it is for small businesses to compete and survive in the face of the large multi-nationals. I’m involved in many initiatives and local and national projects aimed at dealing with growing problems facing small businesses such as high rents and rates and the skills gaps opening up in many areas of commerce.\nHealth and education provision are issues of particular relevance to everyone, especially with many health and support services under attack from both local and national government spending cuts. I’m believe strongly that the NHS should be returned to full public ownership and control, in the face of the erosion that has been forced on it by successive governments. There are no easy solutions, but the one thing I am sure will not work is the privatisation by stealth that the Conservatives have already set in motion.\nI support pragmatic solutions to problems wherever possible and believe local issues are always better dealt with by local people with local resources. Only The Green Party has the vision and commitment to these ideals in the face of increasingly bland and unimaginative policies from the three other main parties.\nThe Greens offer an alternative social contract that has been shown to be effective in many other parts of the world. It’s time we embraced this vision in the UK and took back control of our local services, our lives and our planet from massive profit-driven corporations and the vast majority of the cynical Westminster elite who have only their own interests at heart.\nI hope you’ll join me in working to make the country a Green and pleasant land for ourselves, our children and the generations to come.\nIan Middleton",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_rivers/content_229.html": "I’ve just spent a couple of days in the gorgeous village of Stonesfield researching the state of the river Evenlode which was recently given the unenviable title of the most polluted river in England.\nAnd it’s hardly surprising given that in the past few years the amount of sewage being pumped in to the river has risen from 8000 hours per year to 12000 hours. The river itself is not insubstantial, being deep enough in some areas to swim in, although these days you’d be brave to risk it given the level of E coli and other nasties lurking in its once crystal clear depths.\nI spoke to brilliant local councillor Genny Early about the history of the river that she’s lived near for the past 30 years and the tale was not a happy one. Where once you could look out from the local footbridge at fish swimming amongst the river weeds and watch local dogs play happily in the waters, we now have a soupy grey clag, virtually devoid of life and reputedly toxic to everyone including our canine companions.\nThe cause is toxic dumping from up to 9 different local sewage works, given effective carte blanche by the Conservative government to use this river, and others in the area, as an open sewer to enable companies like Thames Water to pay out record dividends to investors whilst doing next to nothing to fix inadequate infrastructure.\nThis is the starkest example of how privatisation has failed us all with greedy and cynical corporations grabbing every opportunity to make obscene amounts of money by (in this case) quite literally shitting on local communities.\nI made a video with Genny showing just how bad things have got in this area, in sickening contrast to the beautiful local landscape. You can watch it by clicking here.\nWe simply can’t allow this situation to continue and only the Greens have the real solution to take privatised utilities back into public control where they belong. Water is quite literally an essential for life on this planet. If we’ve reached the point where that is simply a commodity to be bartered between corporations on the open market we really have reached the bottom of a very murky barrel.\nGreens would take water and other essential public utilities and services back into public control as the only way to deal with this obscene failure of duty to keep our waterways and rivers clean and accessible for wildlife and recreation. Other parties are suggesting half way houses of fines and extra taxation. None of that will work in an industry that simply doesn’t care any more.\nWe need radical solutions to these unprecedented outcomes and only the Green Party has a vision bold enough to deliver those.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_huffington-post/content_369.html": "This is a piece I wrote for Huffington Post earlier this week. I think it speaks for itself, although after it was published I thought I should have pointed out that none of the the politicians I refer to in the studio on election night were Greens. As usual we weren’t invited to the BBC party. There were however representatives from Labour, Conservative, Libdems and UKIP. Given that the Greens had a reasonably good showing in the last General Election in Rochester (for a ‘marginal’ party) I’d have thought we’d have been worth a mention at least. But apparently not.\nAnyway I hope this serves as a good first post on my website/blog and you can see the original article here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/westminster-politics_b_6199214.html?utm_hp_ref=tw.\nFeel free to comment below or on the original article on the Huffington Post site.\nI recently became a parliamentary candidate for the Green Party. After years of railing against politicians, the irony, and perhaps the hypocrisy, of becoming one myself has not been lost on me.\nThen again, there were the constant jibes about my complaining a lot but doing nothing positive to make a change. So when my local party group asked me to stand, I said I’d give it a go. And here I am. Feel free to point the finger.\nOne of the first things I’ve noticed about the underbelly of politics is just how strategic it is. Target wards, target seats, candidates standing in constituencies where they don’t live for the sake of political expediency. None of this is new, or unusual, or even un-democratic, but it does take some getting used to.\nBut watching the BBC election special on the Rochester and Strood by-election, you could be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the political world has turned into some kind of wife swapping party from the mid 70s. It seems these days that political manoeuvring between the ruling parties has moved beyond juggling their own family jewels, and has been reduced to chucking their keys into the fruit bowl with anyone who fancies a quick fumble with their majority.\nFirstly we had UKIP’s Deputy Chairperson Suzanne Evans being interviewed about where her party would go after the predicted win in Rochester. This consisted of a serious of nods and winks about who might and might not leap out of their own party bed and sneak into theirs when the neighbours weren’t looking. A sort of Carry-On Westminster, but with less laughs.\nShe then went on to explain, with barely concealed glee, that her fondest ambition was to seduce someone from Labour to join in their little tryst. Nigel is apparently talking to a couple of MPs but she couldn’t reveal more. She did everything but tap the side of her nose, elbow Andrew Neil in the ribs and give a little Babs Windsor giggle.\nThen we had an analysis from a political expert explaining how UKIP’s performance in the by-election would determine how other sitting MPs would behave in the run up to next years general election. His premise was that if UKIP did well in Rochester, many other career politicians would be considering their position in the next few months. The expectation is apparently that if they think UKIP is a better bet for them to hold on to their seat (ooh matron!), then they would switch allegiances in order to do so.\nNow you’ll have to excuse me. I’m quite new to this game. But when one joins a party isn’t there something about ideology written into the contract? Or am I now being ridiculously naive?\nJudging by the behaviour of at least two recent pantheons of British democracy I suppose I am. It seems that standing on a platform with a bunch of like minded individuals in the hope of doing something good for the country isn’t what it’s about any more.\nNo, apparently it’s more about hanging on to the House Of Commons parking place, the expense account, and access to the House of Commons bar, rather than the boring stuff like philosophical conviction. Some back-benchers are evidently more interested in maintaining a comfortable position for themselves, rather than for their constituents. Yet, in true British carry-on style, they still keep getting elected.\nAs a newcomer to this world, I saw with fresh eyes last night these four sombre suited politicians sitting uneasily with each other, smugly carving up the political cake amongst themselves. Like children at birthday party trying to decide who gets the last portion of jelly and ice cream, the polemic was about anything other than the issues that this country and the planet really face.\nIain Duncan Smith spent a good deal of his time justifying a particularly vituperative campaign poster that portrayed the idea of voting for Mark Reckless as on a par with seeking Pol Pot as a spiritual adviser. Reckless used to be an investment banker, he didn’t live in the area, he’d only moved there to take a safe seat. All very salient points for the local electorate, but ones that seemed exquisitely irrelevant when he was the Conservative MP only a few months ago.\nMeanwhile UKIP expounded their claim that they listened to the people, and were offering an alternative to the status quo of careerist politicians who’d never done a days honest labour in their lives. Odd then that their success last night, and in Clacton a few weeks ago, relied on exactly the reverse of those ideals by welcoming with open arms two MPs firmly rooted in the rotten political establishment they claimed to despise.\nOn the point of principle I am in total agreement with them. The current political establishment has reduced democracy to the level of swapping football cards in the playground. But it’s a tawdry game of top trumps that they have just as much of a hand in as all the other entrenched Westminster parties.\nIf this is the future of politics in this country, I’m glad to be a member of a party that currently stands as an exemplar of how it is still possible to operate democratically without playing these cynical games. We may now have one less MP than UKIP, but at least ours is there on merit, rather than because she swapped her rosette for a more appealing colour.\nAnd Caroline Lucas has just won MP of the year, which is something that gives me hope. Even so, she’s now the focus of a campaign to unseat her by the Labour party in Brighton, because, and despite of the fact, that Labour and the Greens share many of the same aims.\nMoreover, if all these people care about is hanging on to their positions at all costs, what really is the point? And if the electorate is so fickle that they can’t see through this charade, maybe we deserve the graceless, flagitious mess they all seem to be making of the world.\nOne apocryphal anecdote from Rochester I heard today was that someone had voted UKIP because the sitting Tory MP hadn’t done enough for the local area. If that’s true, it’s an indictment of the great British voter more demoralising than anything supposedly implied by hanging a flag out of the window of your mock-Georgian semi.\nBut as an accidental politician I have to hope that it isn’t true, or at least typical. I have to trust that people in the UK will see past all the identikit politicos, the vested interests and the horse trading of their democratic heritage, and vote for real change and genuine representation in the next government.\nI am ever the optimist.",

Emergency measures call for committed and ambitious actions, not vague aspirations and get-out clauses. The climate takes no prisoners. It doesn’t care what we think is possible, it only responds to what is needed. We need to move faster and be more ambitious in our climate change mitigation measures and take into account the impact of all council policies on climate change\nMy amendment was supported by Labour and Independent members, but was blocked by the Conservatives (as usual).\nAs if to prove the point, in a later debate on the main modifications to the local plan partial review, campaigners from North Oxford Golf Club pleaded with the council to protect their 103-year-old club grounds from proposed development. This would include the destruction of a large number of trees. The Council’s proposals also call for the release of yet more green belt land and the virtual erasure of the previously sacrosanct ‘Kidlington Gap’.\nLabour and Libdem councillors opposed the motion along with me for the Greens. The proposals were agreed with all but one Conservative voting them through.\nYet again we see Cherwell’s Conservatives talking the talk on climate change, but when it comes to positive action they default to business as usual\nIt makes no sense to anyone other than Cherwell’s Tories to propose a measure to increase tree numbers in the district in one motion and then vote in the very same meeting to destroy hundreds of mature trees in the face of massive opposition from local residents and environmental campaigners.\nIt’s clear from this, and from the lack of any solid progress on the climate emergency proposals 6 months on from passing them, that Cherwell’s Conservatives simply want to box-tick the climate change issue, whilst pursuing broader policies on unnecessary growth that will be hugely damaging to the environment.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_council-tax/content_234.html": "Cherwell District Council announced it’s budget last week detailing £4.4m in cuts and extra charges that it will be imposing on the residents of Cherwell as well as an increase in council tax.\nDuring the budget debate I raised my concerns that around a third of these cuts and charges were as a result of losses incurred over the past two years in Banbury\nIn a nutshell the centre is predicted to make a loss of around £1.6m in the 21/22 financial year after having made a similar loss in 20/21. On a broader scale, taking into account some small gains in the first 2 years the council owned the development, it will have racked up losses in the region of £2.5m by the end of the next financial year if the current predictions are correct. To close the gap left by that hole in the budget there have been additional service cuts with around a third of those in the forthcoming budget directly attributable to pressures from Castle Quay.\nYou may have seen some of this in the press this week in Oxford Mail and the Banbury Guardian\nI was also interviewed by BBC Radio Oxford, although my section was recorded and heavily edited, after which Cllr Tony Ilot ,the Lead Member for Financial Management & Governance on Cherwell District Council, was invited on the show live to respond. If we’d been on at the same time I might have pointed out that as the councillor responsible for this development it would have been more encouraging had he bothered to do his homework before coming on. At one point he seemed uncertain about how much the losses amounted to (he guessed at £1.3m and the interviewer had to correct him that it was £1.6m) and he also claimed that the £1.6m was a cumulative loss since the council took ownership. It’s not, it’s just the predicted loss for the forthcoming year on top of a similar one for the last year. You’d think the Lead Member for Financial Management & Governance might have been a little more cognisant of the situation given the scale of problem, but this lack of concern over important details is a familiar theme with Cherwell’s Conservatives.\nCllr Ilot also seemed quite laid back about the fact that the centre is now worth less than half what was paid for item having lost a whopping £30m in value. They are also currently spending even more than the original purchase price for the shopping centre on the canal side extension which, as a retail analyst myself, I think they are going to struggle to make a return on.\nYou can listen to the interview in full here\nThe council’s line on this has been that the losses at CQ have not directly resulted in an increase in the council tax. As that increase was already in the pipeline anyway that’s probably fair to say, but it also fair to say that if this white elephant wasn’t providing such a huge financial drag on the council’s resources, we may not have needed to increase the tax and we certainly wouldn’t have need many of the cuts in services.\nIt will be interesting to see how much support we get for the high street in Kidlington and the Exeter Close project in the light of all this. Certainly something we can point them to if they start penny-pinching on our project to support the eye-watering amounts of public money that’s being poured into one scheme in the far north of the district that we’re all footing the bill for.",

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_social-care/content_92.html": "For me this has always been an absolute red line in terms of how our society is organised. I’ve never been opposed to the free market, even though in my experience in business the free bit is usually very far from free.\nBut there are certain services that society needs to function, and our economy is also dependent on. These are broadly health, education, social care, welfare, transport, police, fire services, the military and local infrastructure. I may have missed something but you get the gist.\nOver the past 10 years we know that these have all been the subject of cuts, and we’ve all seen the results. Not only has this left us impoverished as a nation, it’s also applied serious downward pressure on our productivity and our economy.\nIt’s analogous to the way that businesses are run when they start to get into trouble. First you cut the things you don’t really need, then the things you think you can do without but would like to have, then you cut they think you do need but try to work around, then things you actually need to operate like stock and equipment and then finally you realise you’ve removed your ability to actually do anything productive.\nWe’re pretty much at the end of that process now, and we need to fix it.\nAdditionally, we know that many of the things that were cut didn’t need to be cut. The Tories are never one to let a good crisis go to waste and used the financial crash as an excuse to decimate social services and welfare, dismantle the NHS and remove many of the support services for those in the greatest need.\nThis was driven more by ideology and the Tories obsession with reducing the deficit at all costs, even though this had very little discernible effect on the national debt. When productivity and the economy stall, you end up with less money coming into the coffers and you have to borrow more. That’s where we are now.\nThere should be a real end to the culture of austerity and public service cuts. We’re one of the richest nations in the world, with everyone paying their fair share we should be able to care for and protect all our citizens and keep the infrastructure we all rely on well maintained and working properly.\nThe cost of train fares for example is absolutely ludicrous at the moment and are some of the highest in Europe with some of the worst services being provided. This gives lie to the idea that privatisation makes things more efficient. That said, I know that nationalised services gained a bad reputation back in the old days, but I think that was more an issue of management culture. There’s no reason why things can’t be run completely in the public sector by staff and management who are properly motivated.\nOverall though there are vital services keep our economy moving, and they should be properly supported by government. I’d like to see all of them eventually brought back fully into public ownership and run collectively for the good of the people who rely on them on a zero-sum gain basis. If private businesses can make a profit out of these services now, there’s no reason why they can’t be revenue generating for society or provided at a reduced, subsidised cost where appropriate. It may even be possible to provide some of them for free! Hopefully much freer than the so-called free market!",

I believe it is one of the most serious threats we have ever faced. Yet it’s a threat that many people haven’t even heard of.\nThis proposed agreement has implications on a national and global level, particularly the Investor-State Dispute Settlements clause which allows corporations and private companies to take legal action against governments if they pass laws that are regarded as restricting their ability to make profits.\nThis strikes directly at the heart of our democracy, whilst effectively handing over sovereignty of all signature countries to the whim Amongst other things, TTIP also has the potential to force this country to accept genetically modified organisms into our food supply.\nIt loosens banking regulations (as the more stringent US banking laws could be subject to the lighter laws in the UK) and it could threaten jobs as more companies will be able to base their operations in the USA where labour law, employee protection and health and safety are less strictly applied.\nTTIP could also have very serious implication for the NHS in terms of the penetration of public services by private companies. Indeed TTIP could very easily be used to prevent any future moves to stop the creeping privatisation of the NHS as this may be regarded as restrictive by corporations wanting a piece of the action.\nWhilst the Conservatives, Labour and the Libdems have all stated an ambition to ensure the NHS is excluded from TTIP, we have seen no guarantees on this from any quarter.\nMoreover the extremely secretive nature of the treaty and the way it is being negotiated on our behalf behind firmly closed doors, leads me to distrust the ability or even the will of some of our representatives to ensure such exclusions will be applied.\nThe fact that both Labour and the Conservatives have self evidently displayed an ambition to see large parts of the health service and social care hived off to private companies, amid a culture of marketisation and capitulation to private providers, leaves me with very little confidence in a positive outcome for our cherished NHS.\nThe Green Party is firmly committed to blocking TTIP where we are able to, and our MEPs have already expressed deep concern about what appears to be an unavoidable quiescence to this agreement.\nYou might like to read this article by Molly Scott Cato MEP, who was recently allowed into the inner sanctum where the treaty is being drafted. Although as you will see she was sworn to secrecy and was subject to extreme measures to prevent her from recording and/or reporting what she saw. This alone sounds some very loud alarm bells with me! http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/04/secrets-ttip-corporations-not-citizens-transatlantic-trade-deal\nIf I were to be elected, I would most fervently resist the inclusion of the UK within the TTIP treaty and I would also demand that the secret negotiations now being held in Brussels should be openly and frankly reported.\nHonest and open government is our only guarantee that those trusted to look after our interests do so diligently and effectively.",

So many people have told me this is one of their major concerns in the area. Cyclists in particular are worried about poor maintenance of cycle paths and the spaces on roads that they have to use.\nLast year I highlighted the County Council’s cynical actions in painting a cycle path marking over the top of an appalling road surface that was actually dangerous for cyclists to use. I said then that they were quite literally painting over the cracks in their road maintenance responsibilities.\nThings haven’t improved in the meantime and I thought it was about time some of these appalling road surfaces were documented for posterity. Also I’m hoping that my video can be used to shame the council into finally dealing with damaged roads in our areas that have remained untouched for years. You can watch it for yourself here\nMany of our local roads and walkways haven’t been properly repaired for years. County Councillors need to be lobbying for more funds to keep our roads in a decent state of repair and focusing on making proper cycling infrastructure more plentiful across the county.\nIf we al wake up to a new County Council next week I hope one of the first things they set about doing is getting a grip on this worsening situation. I know that if I’m one of those councillors I will certainly be calling for this as soon as possible.\nPlease can you enable Churchill Road in Kidlington to get the potholes fixed. They have been determining over the past 2 years. I have written twice to the Fix My Street website and messagecomes back saying being looked at. Occasionally an odd one has been filled, but the larger, shallow ones left. With Co Op lorries using this road most days and much school parking too there is a large amount of wear.\nMany thanks,\nJackie Garlick\nLikeLike\nHi Jackie – if you could send me some photos of the holes and an idea of location, I’ll pass it on. Also if you have the responses from Fix My Street that would be useful to show to officers to prove its been raised before.\nLikeLike",

But as the County and District Councillor for the area that Stratfield Brake sits within, I think the County Cabinet’s agreement to enter into negotiations with OUFC was premature, given that there were still so many unanswered questions a year on from the initial approaches from the club to the council.\nOf course we all want to help the club find a new home, but if we’re talking about using public assets to do that, we need transparency about what they’ve done to help themselves. For example, we still don’t have evidence that they’ve have explored all legal remedies to stay where they are.\nIt also appeared from the club’s own long-awaited report that they hadn’t even started looking at other alternative sites until October last year, after claiming at the beginning of 2022 that they had already explored all other options.\nAfter waiting 8 months for the full report on the club’s plans, it took a further 2 months for it to be circulated to stakeholders in a heavily edited form which doesn’t suggest that they are willing to be as transparent with local residents and stakeholders as they have claimed in the past.\nKidlington Parish Council (KPC) had been waiting for most of last year for the report from the club showing their detailed plans for the main Stratfield Brake site (which they are leaseholders of) so that they could be put out to local consultation. They could not take a decision on relinquishing their lease until they had consulted with the local residents who they represent.\nThe club has tried to blame the council for delays in making a decision on the initial very broad proposals but that was simply not the case. KPC wanted to make a decision on an informed basis and had been working towards a genuine local consultation, but to facilitate that they needed details of what the club were proposing. Thus any delay in the decision by the council are entirely the fault of the football club. Instead of engaging properly with KPC to help them hold a local consultation, they have gone around them by moving their plans to the site known as the Triangle which KPC has no direct control over.\nAs a result, I made a plea to the cabinet to include an amendment to the proposals to enter into negotiations with the club that would also commit the council to a full local consultation on the proposals before any final decision was made which should include the option to accept or reject the proposals. This wasn’t even responded to.\nAs the local county councillor I was disappointed that my call to the County Cabinet for a full local consultation didn’t seem to be endorsed. That would at least have given local residents some comfort that their views, both for and against the proposals, would be properly taken into account.\nThere was a reference to future engagement with stakeholders but it’s not clear who would undertake this and if it would be at a point where the local community would have a chance to say yes or no to the plans once they know what they are. With so many questions still left unanswered, we need a definite assurance that such a consultation will be part of the final decision process, otherwise we may find ourselves overtaken by circumstances as plans progress and positions become embedded”.\nWhilst I’m pleased to see the council took note of local concerns raised in last year’s country-wide engagement exercise, what is being proposed now is a rather different prospect and doesn’t completely deal with local views about having yet another significant development sited on some of Kidlington’s dwindling green spaces.\nIf we’re going to condone building on the green belt we need to ensure there is quantifiable local support for that. There are a range of views, as we saw at the meeting, and I want to make sure I’m fully representing the balance of local opinion, but until we ask the whole community we don’t know what that is.\nMy position as the local councillor for the area is that I have to support the majority view of the residents that will be affected by this development whatever they are. I don’t understand why there is a resistance from both the club and their fans as well as the council to asking local people directly what they think of this idea. There may be opposition, but there may equally be majority support for the plans. If so we can proceed on that basis knowing that the club would be welcomed by the village. Surely that would be a better outcome for all concerned, especially OUFC’s owners who I assume wouldn’t want to impose themselves on to a community that would resent them being there.\nI will continue to advocate for a full local consultation both internally within the council and with other local representatives, particularly the local MP Layla Moran.",

The party gained 2686 votes giving them 4.6% of the vote up from 1.7% in 2010. He is a former musician, writer and ethical entrepreneur who spent 25 years in the retail sector building a national high street retail business which moved exclusively online in 2015. He has campaigned in the past for issues as diverse as fair business rates for small businesses to animal rights and now writes on politics, the environment and business for Huffington Post and Retail Week Magazine. Ian Says :\n“I’m honoured to have been chosen to stand in North Oxfordshire again. I feel I learnt a lot from the last campaign and I’m looking forward to having a second opportunity to put forward the case for a progressive Green future”\n“My priorities for this election are the NHS, Education, Housing, the environment and Brexit”\n“Theresa May called this election for purely opportunistic reasons. She claims to offer strength and stability yet throws the country into turmoil just as the clock starts ticking on Brexit negotiations. Whilst our changed relationship with Europe is one of the most important issues we’ve faced for a generation, we’ve also had 2 years to see what the Conservative Party has done to health, education and housing and it’s not a pretty sight.\nThe NHS in particular is facing an existential crisis with yet another round of swingeing cuts being imposed by further Conservative in the guise of sustainability. Already we’ve seen the results with the closure of full maternity services at the Horton and warnings from the Oxfordshire CCG that we stand to lose hundreds of beds across the county. This may be the last chance to save our wonderful NHS before the Conservatives achieve their ultimate goal of slashing services and privatising what’s left.\nTheresa May wants this election to be all about Brexit, I think we should be holding her party to account for it’s appalling record so far.

Indeed in Oxfordshire as a whole we retained 4 out of 6 deposits and showed voter shares up to 9.2% and in one local result we actually came second! Well done to Jenny Tamblyn!\nIn Banbury itself we knew we were never going to win, but we largely achieved the goal we had set ourselves of raising our profile in the constituency and showing people that the Green Party is the rightful repository of support from anyone concerned about real social justice and progressive politics.\nNationally, The Green Party has seen over a million people demonstrating that voting for what you believe in is never a waste of time. Our share of the vote was nearly 4 times what it was in 2010 and our membership increased by nearly 2000 in the two days after the election. In Oxfordshire we’ve had 56 new members in the last 2 days!\nWe now need to build on that support and engage more than ever with a local and national dialogue about how we want to see our society shaped for the future. The Greens have always been a party with long term vision and I think, as the next 5 years unfold, that vision is going to be needed more than ever.\nIn the meantime I’d like to thank all the Green supporters in the constituency that voted for me, and those who campaigned for me, put up posters, leafleted, knocked on doors and stood in the street with me. You’re some of the unsung heroes of this campaign and you should be rightly proud of your achievement.\nMy gratitude of course also goes out to my dedicated campaign team and members of The Banbury and Cherwell Green Party branch. In particular my agent and campaign manager John Haywood, researcher and adviser Colin Clark, our Chairman Chris Manley, the irrepressible Lisa Miller for her exertions on Facebook, and all those others too numerous to mention who have worked so hard over the last 5 years to get us where we are now.\nA special thank you goes to our press officer and my partner Fiona Mawson, who’s practical and emotional support was invaluable to me throughout the campaign, even though she beat me in the local elections!\nAfter the result of the general election we now more than ever need to see a continuation of the Green surge to offer the people of Britain an alternative to the Conservative agenda of austerity and cuts and the holding of the poor and vulnerable to ransom to pay for the lifestyles of the rich and privileged.\nMoreover we need to re-double our efforts to protect our cherished NHS from the clutches of private healthcare providers that will now be given a free reign by a government ideologically opposed to free and comprehensive state health provision.\nI’ll remain as our Prospective Parliamentary Candidate (PPC) for the foreseeable future, unless my circumstances change or the local branch decide they want or need someone new. So I’ll be keeping this website up and running as a place for me to drop the occasional post about local, national and global Green issues. I hope people will choose to engage with me on them during that time.\nIf you’d like to read more I have two other blogs you might like to follow.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2019_12_06_housing-on-green-belt-will-never-be-affordable/content_360.html": "I took a day out of campaigning this week to attend and speak at the public inquiry of the Oxford City local plan.\nIt was a feeling of déjà vu for me as I spent several days doing the same thing in Cherwell earlier this year when our local plan partial review was being examined. Cherwell is pushing to build thousands of houses on green belt land in the south of the district and I have been campaigning for the past 2 years to protect those vital green areas for future generations.\nI was at the inquiry into the city plans because it’s those proposals that are forcing local district councils to add to their own housing requirements to service what the city claims is an ‘unmet need’. Whilst I and other campaigners don’t dispute that Oxford has a need for housing for its own workers, claims that they can’t meet that need within their own boundaries are hotly disputed.\nIt’s generally believed that the reason they can’t meet that need themselves is that they would rather use their own land for economic development to build more shops, offices, hotels, restaurants and student accommodation. The Labour run city council then expect the surrounding rural districts to meet their housing need for them and Conservative run councils like Cherwell are only too glad to oblige as this gives them a perfect excuse to enrich the local landowners and developers who support them.\nIt’s sad to see that both Labour and the Conservatives are pursuing a policy of green belt destruction in Oxfordshire when there really is no need. There are plenty of brownfield sites available to build on, as well as empty properties that should be re-purposed or brought back into use.\nI want to see more genuinely affordable housing for people on average incomes. More social and council housing. Rent controls on private landlords and an end to unfair developer lease & ground rent charges, but we will never see large amounts of affordable housing in Oxfordshire if they are built on high value green belt land. The only reason these areas are targetted is because they are ripe to be used by developers to build high value executive homes and mini-mansions to make a massive killing.\nThere should not be development on Green Belt land except where there is an incontrovertible need to do so. Our precious green spaces should not be handed over the developers simply to make huge profits for landowners and speculators, especially when much of that housing is not affordable in any real sense.\nGreen spaces are also now even more vital to help combat climate change and flooding. Concreting them over and adding more roads and houses with inefficient heating systems just piles on the pressure to the environment and exports Oxford’s poor air quality standards to the rural areas of the county.\nThe Green party has pledged to build 100,000 genuinely affordable socially rented properties every year for 10 years. Houses that will be built to the Passive House standard meaning they will be both sustainable and affordable to maintain and heat.\nThis will not only provide much-needed homes for people of average incomes, they will be the right houses in the right places and will also provide employment for thousands of builders and manufacturers.\nThis is on top of retrofitting every house in the country to make them more energy efficient as part of our Green New Deal.\nAs a founding member of a housing co-op in London in the 1980s, I also want to encourage other ways of getting people into affordable housing such as Land Trusts and Co-ops and see more social and council housing built.\nYou can find out more about our policies on housing in our manifesto here https://www.greenparty.org.uk/assets/files/Elections/Green%20Party%20Manifesto%202019.pdf",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2021_03/content_44.html": "At the full Cherwell District Council meeting in February I brought a motion calling for a more joined up approach to flooding response in our area and across Oxfordshire which was passed unanimously by members of the council.\nThe motion called for areas that are at risk of flooding to establish a ‘flood resilient community’, including the formation of local flood response groups and forums for residents to feedback information on current and potential flooding risks,\nTo support these groups I suggested the setting up of local flood response stores to provide locally available flood alleviation equipment. I had hoped that there would be funding for this, but there was some push back on this from the County Council due to shortage of money. I still don’t think that’s good enough and will be pursuing this more fully in the future.\nThe motion also said that updated surveys and maintenance programs, with maps of drainage and flood defences and associated repair responsibilities should be published regularly to help local groups and response agencies to maintain and monitor them.\nFinally I called on risk management agencies across the county to set up a cooperative task force, including the provision of a centralised contact point which can trigger an immediate, proportionate response to all emergency flooding events. It is envisaged that all local councils and other agencies would play a part in this.\nFlooding in Yarnton\nI was very glad we managed to debate this motion, even though it only just made it before the new 11pm guillotine imposed by the Conservatives in the recent constitutional review. If it hadn’t been discussed at this meeting, it would have been another 5 months before it would have been heard and obviously we could be facing many more flood incidents before then.\nAs a councillor, I’ve been trying to help local residents deal with flooding in both my Parish and District council wards. It’s become apparent that there is no central co-ordination and no single contact point that can be called on to manage flooding at all levels. Smaller floods are often given a low priority by the relevant agencies and even the new guidance issued by the County and District councils doesn’t provide a timely response to these incidents.\nCherwell District Council recently resumed responsibility for flood defence in the region and as we also work closely with the county council we are in a unique position to take some leadership on this issue and improve responses to these distressing and costly incidents. This is even more important in areas like Yarnton and Begbroke which have been flooded recently and where the council has recently identified areas for development as part of the local plan review.\nCovering areas in tarmac and concrete is only going to increase the likelihood of flooding and we need to ensure that suitable and long lasting flood alleviation measures are included along with responsibility for maintenance.",

Lots to say on this, but as always happens with these things, a 10-minute interview gets condensed into a 10-second comment!\nOn the way back we passed several signs on field gates warning about how the area is under threat from the Oxford to Cambridge Expressway. As someone who’s been involved in the campaign to stop this ridiculous and unnecessary development I thought I’d add a few more comments by way of a video and also expand a bit on what the Green Party would do to protect our vital green spaces.\nThis is something I’ve been involved with for a number of years now, right across the county, trying to combat the epidemic of projects that want to destroy these areas in the name of profit and greed.\nYes we need housing, but it has to be the right housing in the right places. Building on green belt will never be viable in terms of affordable housing as the land is so expensive. Developers build in a set level of profitability, usually a staggering 20%! That means that removing protection from green spaces like these just increases the number of high value, unaffordable houses being built.\nNot only that, concreting over green spaces means they can no longer lock up the carbon that we need to reduce in our environment, and they also increase the likelihood of flooding as they can no longer absorb the increased level of rain we’re getting as the climate patterns shift.\nThe Conservatives back all these projects because they are there to help wealthy landowners, developers and investors make a fat profit out of our rural heritage. As your MP I would resist all these projects, just as I now resist them as a District and Parish Councillor.\nGreens CAN WIN\nAs we’ve just seen in Wallingford, where another Green councillor has just been elected to the county council, Greens CAN WIN and we WILL WIN if people get out and give us their vote. Even if I don’t win in Banbury, a significant increase in the Green vote there will send a strong message to government that we demand change. An increased Green vote will be a visible signal of that, whereas another ‘heroic defeat’ for the other parties will get lost in the usual fog of post-election reporting.\nNow more than ever we need a strong Green voice, for the environment, for our future and for our children’s future. Please vote Green on December 12th.",

This gives us 4 members now having grown from the single member we had in 2019 (me).\nAs I reported last year we were poised to take control in 2023 as part of a 4 way alliance with the Lib Dems, Labour and the Independents. That whole project collapsed at the 11th hour when Labour pulled out of the deal because the didn’t want to work with the Greens. So we had to double our efforts this year to gain additional seats, along with the Lib Dems so that we could finish the job of removing the Conservatives from power across the whole of Oxfordshire. This was something both our parties had promised in 2023 but at that point without Labour’s support we couldn’t deliver on that pledge.\nHappily this year we can!\nAlong with our Lib Dem colleagues we had the numbers this year to take minority control of the council. Sadly we are still 3 seats short of an overall majority, but we felt we needed to deliver on our promises and so have formed an administration. The comprises of two groups – the Lib Dems, who now sit as a single group rather than as part of a group with the Greens and the Independents who have now formed their own separate group which I lead. We joined with the single independent who had previously ben part of the Progressive Oxfordshire Group – the alliance I was a founding member of in 2019.\nOur new group is called the Green and Independent Alliance, which neatly forms the acronym ‘GAIA’ which we thought was appropriate for a group of 4 Greens and one Independent, especially as the independent member is a Green in all but name.\nOur two groups have now signed a formal coalition agreement to run the council together with 2 Greens, Myself and To Beckett sitting on the executive in Green and Environment roles.\nThis is a great outcome for us and we hope for the people of Cherwell. We hope to make the district a better place to live and work for everyone as well as improving nature recovery and tackling climate change.\nOf course we have since been overtaken by events when on the very day we agreed our new administration Rishi Sunak called a General Election. I must admit that this rather caught us all on the hop just as we were all starting to get to grips with our new leadership roles on the council.

He is also standing for a seat on Kidlington Parish Council in Exeter Ward.\nIn Kidlington West the Liberal Democrats will be standing candidates in two seats, including the one vacated by Alaric Rose who moved away from the area recently.\nNeither party will be standing candidates against each other in the district council elections and will be endorsing each other’s respective campaigns. All three candidates have pledged to work to forward the aims of both parties if some or all of them are elected.\nThey are campaigning for :\n- A stronger and more effective opposition to the Conservatives’ unhealthily large majority on Cherwell District Council;\n- Continued opposition to Cherwell DC’s plan to build 4,400 houses on the Green Belt in Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke to meet Oxford City’s housing needs. They want to ensure that any houses that are built should be genuinely affordable and aimed at local need;\n- Strong opposition to the Conservative’s plans for an Oxford to Cambridge Expressway especially with regard to it’s environmental and air quality impacts;\n- An end to Conservative cuts to local services and their failure to maintain local roads, cycle paths and pavements, schools and health facilities.\nGreen candidate for Kidlington East, Ian Middleton, said: “At a local level our two parties still agree on most key issues and we hope to build on the successes of last year’s campaign for both of us. Far more continues to unite us than divides us at this crucial time for our community.”\nLiberal Democrat candidate for Kidlington West, Katherine Tyson, said: “We want to work with the local community to make our area a better place to live.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_community_page_9/content_440.html": "Dear Mr Hudspeth\nI was the Green Party Parliamentary Candidate for Banbury in May. I’ve met you a couple of times, the most recent being after the public meeting held in Banbury Town Hall as part of Oxfordshire County Council’s consultation process on the proposed additional £50m cuts to local services.\nSo it was with great interest that I read your correspondence with David Cameron, splashed across national headlines last week, which painted a clear picture of a Prime Minister with only a tenuous grasp on the realities of the demands he has made on local authorities such as Oxfordshire, where he also happens to be an MP.\nAt the meeting we briefly touched on the magnitude of the savings being demanded in the context of our national finances. I made the case that with a national debt of £1.56 trillion – nearly half of which was added by our Conservative Chancellor during the tenure of the last government – a deficit of £83bn and annual interest payments of around £43bn, saving £50m from local authority spending was the equivalent of trying to pay your mortgage off by skipping breakfast once a year.\nWhilst these cuts will have virtually zero impact on the debt left to future generations, they will have a huge effect on those who depend on the front line services being withdrawn. In particular on adult social care facilities and the children’s centres you plan to close which were amongst Mr Cameron’s principal concerns.\nYour reply to me was that we all had to “do our bit”. Well it seems from your response to the PM that ‘our bit’ has already been well and truly done.\nAs a local politician expected to deliver on these impossible polices, I’m sure you know that they are economically illiterate. Cuts to social care will impact on the health service as a whole. Cuts to support for young people have potential effects on social order. Cuts to public transport have serious implications for the workforce and people in isolated rural communities.\nI hope you’ll agree with me that there’s a point where cuts can no longer be the solution to balancing the books. Personally I think we’re already well beyond that line in the sand.\nSo I’m confused by your own position on government policy, given that you continue to publicly affirm that you share Mr Cameron’s blind faith in the blunt instrument of austerity as the answer to all our problems.\nYou’ve also made much of the statistic that 2% of the county’s population consumes 50% of the finances. I’m sure the old, the sick and infirm are a great drain on our public services, but in a modern society surely those people should expect to be looked after by those of us who are better able to do so.\nDo you feel perhaps that this 2% should be prepared to support the more lavish spending plans of our government in other spheres? The wasting of hundreds of billions to allow us to play our part in a thermonuclear Armageddon maybe. Or vanity transport projects that will allow people to get from London to Birmingham 15 minutes faster, when Oxfordshire County Council has just voted to cut local bus subsidies in the county.\nShould Oxfordshire pensioners be made fearful of putting their heating on this winter but be comforted as they shiver in the dark that they are ‘doing their bit’? All this while the government you support hands over £5.9bn to private oil and gas companies – a figure well over a thousand times greater than the cuts we are being asked to make – and slashes support for local renewable energy projects, meaning we will miss EU emissions reductions obligations and become the only G7 country to increase spending on fossil fuels.\nI really feel that you have to come down on one side of the fence or the other here. You can’t continue to support the cuts in public whilst apparently opposing them in private. As leader of the county council, the people of Oxfordshire deserve an unequivocal statement of your aims and allegiances.\nYou will no doubt be aware that Mr Cameron’s intervention in Oxford has now prompted requests from over 100 other councils to have a similar direct consultation with him over budget pressures. He also faces accusations of ministerial impropriety over his intervention with you.\nSo perhaps now would be a good time for hard-pressed council leaders such as yourself to make a firmer stand. You could set an example and refuse to pass what you have already told the PM is an impossible budget to balance in any morally defensible way. I know such actions come with potential repercussions, but if other council leaders followed your lead, how many mutinies could Westminster really handle? This could be your place in history calling!\nAlternatively you could join the drive for the abolition or raising of the now outdated 2% referendum threshold on council tax increases. As you hinted at in your letter to Mr Cameron, selling the family silver can only plug the gaps for so long. If we want well funded local services, we should all be prepared to pay ‘our bit’ for them. Polls carried out by the Oxfordshire Green Party, The Oxford Mail and at your own consultation events have shown that people would be prepared to pay more council tax if they saw the money going to essential services.\nOf course this would require the government to square the circle of increasingly expensive public services without any rise in taxation. But if they truly believe in localism, councils should surely be free to set their own local levy, unhindered by ideological thresholds dictated by central doctrine.\nI think the people of Oxfordshire would welcome your further engagement with the PM on their behalf and with local activists on these matters. I personally look forward to your thoughts on how best to capitalise on what has now become a national talking point, and how we can use this new focus in the best interests of Oxfordshire residents and other similarly concerned groups across the country.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_potholes/content_24.html": "I wrote this post back in 2023 and not much has changed since.\nAs we approach another County Council election (probably the last), the Conservatives are declaring a “pothole emergency” presumably reflecting the climate emergency declarations of a few years ago. But it didn’t seem to be that much of an emergency in 2019 when they were in control of the County Council. Back then they were even worse and had been getting that way for decades.\nThe truth is that no council, regardless of political control, ever receives enough funding to fix the roads properly. The reason is that it would cost BILLIONS to do it really well and no government has ever committed to that. Our roads have been allowed to get worse year on year because no government wants to commit to the costs of fixing them properly. Why would they when local councils can take the brunt of the criticisms for them?\nNo council wants to see potholes. They are a very visible problem that nearly everyone experiences and every councillor and council officer would like to see gone. Of course we’d all like to have the unlimited funding that would be required to fix them, but it’s just not there at the moment. That, coupled with fact that we’re all driving much heavier vehicles than the roads were designed for (plus the increase in HGV traffic) means our roads take a hammering 24 hours a day. Add in the weather extremes we see now and it’s little wonder they break up.\nBut it’s not a recent problem. The Tories may say they will fix it, but they didn’t seem to be able to do so in 2019 when Oxfordshire was ranked 5th worse in the country for the number of potholes as can be seen from the attached article in my post from 2023.\nSo let’s get serious about this issue and stop using it as the proverbial political football every time an election rolls around. Potholes are always going to be with us until central government takes proper responsibility for maintaining our road network, rather than insisting on us building even more roads that we won’t be given the money to maintain. The more roads we build, the bigger and more costly the problem will get. Until governments make that connection, there’s not going to be a long-term solution.\nWe all also need to take personal responsibility for the way our roads are treated. High torque acceleration from traffic lights, on corners or near traffic calming areas such as speed humps will simply tear the road surface up. Our roads are not indestructible, certainly not when we’re all driving heavier cars with 4 wheel drive or more and more of us are buying things online that need to be delivered by heavier vans and trucks. Climate change also plays a part as heavier rainfall and sudden cold snaps play havoc with road surfaces.\nYes our roads need to be properly attended to, but until there’s a national political consensus on that, along with an ongoing commitment to proper funding from national governments, potholes will always be with us to a lesser or greater degree, and any political party that tells you different is just avoiding the holes in their own arguments.\nI’ve done my best to get potholes fixed in my division over the past 4 years but it is like playing a game of of whack-a-mole. You get one fixed and another 2 pop up somewhere else. Whilst I agree there needs to be better quality control on the standard of repairs, simply filling the holes will never solve the problem as any hole is always going to be a point of weakness in the future. In reality there are many roads in the county that need to be completely re-laid, but if the money is spent on that, it’s not there to fix areas elsewhere.\nIt’s a juggling act that will be made better over the next 2 years as OCC have committed nearly £39m to a 2 year road improvement programme. That will help matters (and they have been getting better over the past 4 years despite what the Tories might say in their leaflets), But that sort of funding is still small beer compared to what we need to spend, and that need is getting bigger every year.\nWhat I think is really needed is a pothole summit where councils, residents, motoring organisations, haulage and delivery companies, civil engineers and of course, national government can come together to work on a solution. All the time we simply blame each other every time there’s an election, there’s never going to be the long term solution that we desperately need.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_local-elections/content_59.html": "Tomorrow you have the chance to vote in one of the most historic elections in this country for many years.\nThis is going to be the last County Council election before both County and district Councils are abolished under plans being pushed forward by national government. Elections after this one are most likely to be associated with the new Unitary Authority which will be formed in Oxfordshire, although currently exactly what form that will take is unclear.\nThe option preferred by the Greens is one of 2 unitaries formed from Cherwell District, West Oxfordshire District and The City Councils with a second one formed around South Oxon and the Vale plus West Berkshire. We feel that would keep decision making as local as possible as well as ensuring that councillors don’t become too remote from the people they represent. The County Council Cabinet recently voted to push forward their preferred option of one huge council across the whole of the County, while the City Council are proposing they form their own Unitary Council by absorbing areas around them such as Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke. I would certainly strongly oppose that, as, I believe, would most of the residents in those areas!\nThe outcome of all these options could largely be driven by those people elected to the County Council tomorrow, so not only is it important to vote because it may be your last opportunity, it’s also doubly important that you get a councillor who is going to represent your views on what your future council may look like.\nOf course my advice is to vote Green at least in areas where you already have a Green Councillor such as the two new Divisions in Kidlington which make up nearly 80% of the area I currently represent on the County Council. As I can’t be in 2 places at once I have decided to stand in the new East Division because I am involved in several ongoing issues there, Not least the proposed football stadium and the huge Oxford North development. But my fellow Green Councillor Fiona Mawson is standing in the other part, now called Kidlington West even though 2 thirds of it comprises Yarnton and Begbroke. As the only candidate in this election that actually lives in that new division, I’m hopeful that she will get a good reception from voters.\nto show Green and Conservative representation\nCurrently the whole of the Kidlington East area is represented by me as the County Councillor and by me, Fiona and Linda Ward as District councillors. I’d like to think we’ve done a good job of representing the everyone there, we all certainly work hard to achieve that, so I hope I will receive your support in the East whilst Fiona is elected to replace me in the West.\nIt’s a rather complicated scenario , especially given that the whole set up is likely to change in 2 or 3 years so neither of us are likely to see out a full term as County Councillors, but in the meantime it’s important that both areas keep consistent Green representation so that work I and Fiona have started on things like ensuring development proposals are beneficial to the area can continue into the next few years, along with our input into the re-shaping of local government over the next 2 years.\nHowever you vote (and I hope it will be Green) do make sure you vote. It may be the only chance you get to make a decision that affects you and your local community for the next few years.\nIf you need any further information from me or Fiona please let us know. We have knocked on a lot of doors over the past few months, so if we missed you we’d be happy to talk.",

Claiming, as they always do, that they have put ‘record’ levels of funding into education (as they also claim for health and so many other important services). But the devil is in the detail, with funding per pupil actually falling as class sizes increase.\nRegardless of claims to the contrary in their cobbled-together, un-costed manifesto, there are more cuts to come. But you don’t have to take my word for it, just look at the information available on the schools cuts website\nThese bare facts come from the people who know what’s happening to our schools. The teachers at the sharp end of the Conservative agenda.

Begbroke and Yarnton and plonk 4400 houses in the middle of an area with overloaded roads and infrastructure. A plan that would see the three communities amalgamated into one sprawling conurbation, created not to serve local affordable housing needs, but to supposedly provide housing for workers in the city, even though most of the jobs are based in the east.\nYou can read the full response here\nAs everyone involved knows the oft-touted claims that this will include so-called ‘affordable’ housing is laughable. Valuable green belt land will become ten times more valuable once it becomes ripe for development and the landowners and luxury house builders will stand to make a fortune.\nI along with several others were allowed a five minute representation to the councillors in the chamber, some of whom it was later reported couldn’t even be bothered to listen to those who had come to plead their case. One was even photographed using a mobile phone during the speeches!\nSeeing the lack of connectedness demonstrated by the predominately Conservative council enraged me more than I imagined it would. If you watch the video footage from the planning meeting a few weeks ago you can hear me heckling quite loudly throughout some of speeches from Barry Wood and Colin Clarke.\nNormally I wouldn’t do something like that. They deserve their time to speak just as I and the other campaigners had. But being the last to have their say (as Cllr Wood ensured he would be) they were able to simply brush aside the very salient points raised by protesters and other councillors.\nTory councillor after Tory councillor stood up and gave no logical reason why these plans should be forced through in the face of what everyone recognised was an historic level of opposition from the people in the district they represent.\nOver 1500 responses were given to the plans, nearly all of them objecting to this wanton and unnecessary destruction of our precious green belt. Yet the council seemed oblivious to them, to the cogent arguments put forward by speakers and even to the legal opinions that were presented by the two main campaigning groups.\nThe cavalier attitude of Barry Wood, who I’d previously challenged for seeming to pre-judge the outcome of the consultation, was amply demonstrated when he and his fellow councillors abdicated their responsibility to the people of Cherwell and threw their objections at the feet of the planning inspector.\nHis closing argument was that it was the inspector who would make the final decision not them, even though they were elected to represent us. As I suspected months ago, the council had already made its mind up, and the consultation was simply a box ticking exercise. The fate of our green spaces, our wildlife habitats, our clean air and the distinctiveness of our communities has been thrown into the lap of an outside agency because the Tories on the council didn’t have the guts or the inclination to properly consider the alternatives.\nSo I hope you’ll forgive me some heckling out of pure frustration at the lack of professionalism and respect for democracy being shown by these people.\nThat’s why I want to win this election. I want a guaranteed voice in that chamber so that I can represent the views of the people in Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke – an area that is so remote from that chamber, way up at the other end of the district that people like Barry Wood and Colin Clarke feel it’s safe to throw us all under the bus for the sake of expediency.\nIt’s also why the Green Party in Kidlington is working with the Liberal Democrats in this election to elect me in Kidlington East and Alaric Rose in Kidlington West. You can see our joint statement about that here.\nI hope you’ll give me and Alaric a chance to be a strong voice for you after May 3rd.\nYou can see the full video of the planning meeting (including the heckling) on the Cherwell District Council Website.

In my opinion, this has been slipped into the review under false pretences, given that this has nothing to do with housing need in Oxford. As a result there’s mounting local criticism of the university’s ambitions to commandeer at least 1000 of the houses intended to meet Oxford’s needs for its own use as part of a new campus at Begbroke and Yarnton.\nChair of the Cherwell Development Watch Alliance, Giles Lewis, spoke in favour of the motion at the packed meeting and read out emails between the council and the university, obtained under and FOI request, that suggested plans to allow the university to expand in the area were already being supported as long ago as 2016.\nThe Labour group on the council then introduced an amendment which blocked any re-consideration of housing need numbers, even though this might mean more houses that were needed would be built on green belt.\nI pointed out that just to offset the amount of carbon produced in building the unaffordable and unneeded houses in the first place would take 572,000 trees over 10 years, or 200 per house, rather than the 1 tree per building that Cllr Wood had suggested during his address on the climate change emergency motion.\nIt’s clear that neither Labour nor the Conservatives are prepared to take the difficult decisions that are needed to combat the climate emergency. Labour were far more concerned not to be seen to be challenging inflated housing need figures proposed by their colleagues on the city council, whist the Conservatives simply want to be facilitators for large wealthy landowners in the area including the university. The location of the housing clearly has more to do with the university’s ambitions than it does with genuine housing allocation priorities. Either way it ends up with unnecessary and unaffordable housing being built that locals will have no access to on the green spaces at the heart of their community. This is a stitch-up perpetrated on the people of south Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Gosford!\nLibdem Councillor and spokesperson for the Progressive Oxfordshire group, Katherine Tyson said “These plans will simply expand the city’s appalling air quality into our rural community. At one point Labour councillor and vice-chairperson of the council Hannah Banfield seemed to suggest that, as Banbury residents had accepted bad air quality as a result of housing development in their area, the people of south Cherwell should just do the same. The argument that one ward coming to peace with poisoning their residents and children doesn’t mean that another ward should also poison their constituents. That’s not good enough for Cherwell residents. It beggars belief that such a comment could be made from a Labour councillor just after we had voted in favour of a climate change emergency motion”\nThe motion to pause the local review pending the outcome of the examination of the city council local plan and to separately consult on the university’s plans in Begbroke and Yarnton was successfully amended by the Labour group to an undertaking to review the allocation sites for the 4400 houses. It was carried by Labour with Conservatives abstaining on the vote. The subsequent motion was defeated by 16 votes to 23.",

We should encourage the production of better quality small scale meat and dairy which would lead to a ‘less but better’ approach to consumption of those foods.

He now does consultancy work for schools that are suffering under the same system he battled through. Essentially the privatisation of our education system that does little to help students and puts a lot of money into the pockets of Academy shareholders.\nThe future of our children should not be for sale to the highest bidder, and we should not be seeing a situation where parents have to raise hundreds of pounds to subsidise books or pay for bus passes so their children can actually get to school. Again, I remember free bus passes for school-children, but that seems like a long-lost utopia now.\nWe need an education system that provides opportunity to everyone. Schools that cater for all levels of ability and aspiration. The chance for everyone who wants to move on to further and higher education to do so without saddling themselves with a lifetime of debt.\nWe also need to value our teachers and educators, paying them a decent salary and ensuring they have fair conditions to work in. Like doctors and nurses they are taken far too much for granted and expected to cope with appalling stress simply because they are dedicated people.\nThe Conservative’s promises of extra funding don’t come close to addressing the problems that have been stored up over the past 10 years. Their so-called ‘extra’ spending amounts to nothing more than setting the clock back to the point before they imposed austerity on us all.\nSee the Green Party Manifesto by clicking here. Go to page 55 to see our comprehensive range of proposals and policies about revitalising our education system and bringing schools into the 21sct century, whilst unlocking the potential of students and teachers at all levels.\nA proper education for the next generation should be a priority for all of us. Without that what kind of world are we building for our children and ourselves?",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2015_11_18_an-open-letter-to-ian-hudspeth-leader-of-oxfordshire-county-council-about-proposed-budget-cuts/content_341.html": "Dear Mr Hudspeth\nI was the Green Party Parliamentary Candidate for Banbury in May. I’ve met you a couple of times, the most recent being after the public meeting held in Banbury Town Hall as part of Oxfordshire County Council’s consultation process on the proposed additional £50m cuts to local services.\nSo it was with great interest that I read your correspondence with David Cameron, splashed across national headlines last week, which painted a clear picture of a Prime Minister with only a tenuous grasp on the realities of the demands he has made on local authorities such as Oxfordshire, where he also happens to be an MP.\nAt the meeting we briefly touched on the magnitude of the savings being demanded in the context of our national finances. I made the case that with a national debt of £1.56 trillion – nearly half of which was added by our Conservative Chancellor during the tenure of the last government – a deficit of £83bn and annual interest payments of around £43bn, saving £50m from local authority spending was the equivalent of trying to pay your mortgage off by skipping breakfast once a year.\nWhilst these cuts will have virtually zero impact on the debt left to future generations, they will have a huge effect on those who depend on the front line services being withdrawn. In particular on adult social care facilities and the children’s centres you plan to close which were amongst Mr Cameron’s principal concerns.\nYour reply to me was that we all had to “do our bit”. Well it seems from your response to the PM that ‘our bit’ has already been well and truly done.\nAs a local politician expected to deliver on these impossible polices, I’m sure you know that they are economically illiterate. Cuts to social care will impact on the health service as a whole. Cuts to support for young people have potential effects on social order. Cuts to public transport have serious implications for the workforce and people in isolated rural communities.\nI hope you’ll agree with me that there’s a point where cuts can no longer be the solution to balancing the books. Personally I think we’re already well beyond that line in the sand.\nSo I’m confused by your own position on government policy, given that you continue to publicly affirm that you share Mr Cameron’s blind faith in the blunt instrument of austerity as the answer to all our problems.\nYou’ve also made much of the statistic that 2% of the county’s population consumes 50% of the finances. I’m sure the old, the sick and infirm are a great drain on our public services, but in a modern society surely those people should expect to be looked after by those of us who are better able to do so.\nDo you feel perhaps that this 2% should be prepared to support the more lavish spending plans of our government in other spheres? The wasting of hundreds of billions to allow us to play our part in a thermonuclear Armageddon maybe. Or vanity transport projects that will allow people to get from London to Birmingham 15 minutes faster, when Oxfordshire County Council has just voted to cut local bus subsidies in the county.\nShould Oxfordshire pensioners be made fearful of putting their heating on this winter but be comforted as they shiver in the dark that they are ‘doing their bit’? All this while the government you support hands over £5.9bn to private oil and gas companies – a figure well over a thousand times greater than the cuts we are being asked to make – and slashes support for local renewable energy projects, meaning we will miss EU emissions reductions obligations and become the only G7 country to increase spending on fossil fuels.\nI really feel that you have to come down on one side of the fence or the other here. You can’t continue to support the cuts in public whilst apparently opposing them in private. As leader of the county council, the people of Oxfordshire deserve an unequivocal statement of your aims and allegiances.\nYou will no doubt be aware that Mr Cameron’s intervention in Oxford has now prompted requests from over 100 other councils to have a similar direct consultation with him over budget pressures. He also faces accusations of ministerial impropriety over his intervention with you.\nSo perhaps now would be a good time for hard-pressed council leaders such as yourself to make a firmer stand. You could set an example and refuse to pass what you have already told the PM is an impossible budget to balance in any morally defensible way. I know such actions come with potential repercussions, but if other council leaders followed your lead, how many mutinies could Westminster really handle? This could be your place in history calling!\nAlternatively you could join the drive for the abolition or raising of the now outdated 2% referendum threshold on council tax increases. As you hinted at in your letter to Mr Cameron, selling the family silver can only plug the gaps for so long. If we want well funded local services, we should all be prepared to pay ‘our bit’ for them. Polls carried out by the Oxfordshire Green Party, The Oxford Mail and at your own consultation events have shown that people would be prepared to pay more council tax if they saw the money going to essential services.\nOf course this would require the government to square the circle of increasingly expensive public services without any rise in taxation. But if they truly believe in localism, councils should surely be free to set their own local levy, unhindered by ideological thresholds dictated by central doctrine.\nI think the people of Oxfordshire would welcome your further engagement with the PM on their behalf and with local activists on these matters. I personally look forward to your thoughts on how best to capitalise on what has now become a national talking point, and how we can use this new focus in the best interests of Oxfordshire residents and other similarly concerned groups across the country.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_europe/content_52.html": "So ends my third and final candidacy for the Banbury constituency.\nIn a way I’ve come full circle in that my result this time was almost identical to my first one in 2015. I was only 79 votes short of that figure this time with a final result of 2607 votes, giving me 4.1% of the vote share.\nIn 2015, I received 4.6% with only a slightly higher number of votes, but the turnout was lower then. Sadly this left me about 500 votes short of keeping my deposit this time, which means the Green Party loses £500, but we did our best.\nOn a personal level I’m fairly happy with that result. It was more than double the last time I stood and represented a 2.2% increase in my vote share. That’s the best increase of all the Green Party candidates in Oxfordshire, so that’s nice to have. You have to look for the positives in these things!\nUnfortunately though, positives on a national level are thin on the ground. With a massive swing to the Tories representing such a shift in our national political landscape, I’m far more concerned about that than I am about my own result. This is something I’m still processing at the moment as I’m sure many others are. I have to say I’ve avoided news coverage of the election today as it is just too painful! Maybe sleep deprivation has played a big part in that as well!\nWhere we go from here is difficult to say. I think it’s fairly certain that Brexit will now happen, which I think we will mostly live to regret. The debate around the referendum has become so polarised now that I’m not sure anyone really knows how we got here. It’s become an argument about ‘honouring’ a vote that many people no longer really know the point of. From most of the coverage I’ve seen it’s become about who ‘won’ and who ‘lost’. It should never have been boiled down to such a simplistic argument. Especially as I think most of us will eventually be the losers from Brexit.\nThe “Get Brexit done” slogan is also an absurd reduction of the true impact of one of the most seismic shifts in our fortunes since the second world war. I still don’t think it’s something we should be treating so lightly. With so much new information available to us now compared to 2016, we should have had an opportunity to think again. Just ‘getting it over with’ really isn’t a logical motivation for carrying on with something that I think will be hugely damaging to this country and our economy. Especially as the poor and the disadvantaged will end up feeling the most pain, which makes it doubly frustrating when so many news reports seem to suggest it’s those very people who voted Tory in this election.\nThose of us on the remain side obviously haven’t made a strong enough case to those who seem so eager to jump into the abyss. Boris Johnson’s lies will, I believe, show themselves to be exactly that when we finally push the button on Brexit. Sadly it will be too late then to say I told you so to all those who think this will be a positive move.\nThe climate debate was for me equally as important as Brexit and bound up in the same argument. This also applies to the other burning issues in the UK at the moment, including the NHS and public services. I believe we will spend the next 10 years wasting parliamentary time dealing with the intricacies of extricating ourselves from the EU and negotiating disadvantageous deals with countries like the USA, when we should be dealing with the existential threat of climate change and the collapse of our health services.\nThe other issue exposed by the result is the desperate need for electoral reform. Westminster has still been carved up by the two main parties who need so few votes to get a seat in the big house. Whereas parties like the Greens with over 800,000 votes nationally only get on MP. That really doesn’t make sense and certainly explains why so many people think that voting is a pointless exercise. Moreover we need to have greater co-operation between parties to achieve electoral reform. I hope that the one positive that might come out of Labour’s terrible results might be that they will finally be open to talking to other parties about co-operating towards that end.\nBut I will do what I can to help deal with the worst damage that Brexit and climate change will inevitably do to our society both locally and globally, even though I fear that, with at least another 5 years of majority Conservative government ahead of us, that’s going to be a very difficult task.\nIt’s not one that I will shirk from though, and I will use my position as a local councillor to bring as much influence as I can to bear on what will no doubt be many more Tory excesses and attacks on the weakest in our society. With a Tory dominated District council in Cherwell it’s always an uphill struggle to ‘move the dial’ but that’s not a reason to give up and I won’t be doing that.\nFinally, an enormous thank you everyone who helped in my campaign and to everyone who contacted my directly, and through social media, to give me encouragement and support, and of course thank you for giving me your precious vote. I can assure you that I value it enormously and it was not wasted.\nFor reasons I’ve explained in another post, no vote you believe in is ever wasted, and in terms of the Green Party it will help us carry on campaigning and, most importantly now, hold the national and local government to account on the environment and climate change.\nThe fight continues!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_hospital-closures/content_203.html": "We were told the last election was all about Education – Education – Education. This one should be NHS – NHS – NHS.\nThe road to privatisation of the NHS has been a long one and began under the Conservatives in 1992 with the Private Finance Initiative. It’s a neat trick that enables huge amounts of debt to be moved off the national balance sheet whilst still expanding operational infrastructure.\nNew Labour saw it as something too good to be true, as it allowed them to build new hospitals, without borrowing more money or raising taxes. But like most things that seem too good to be true, it was. By the end of their tenure Labour had saddled the NHS with £80Bn in repayments on total capital assets worth around £11Bn, and we’re still paying for it now.\nThen along came the Conservatives again who just love to privatise things. Every time they’ve been in government they’ve privatised something. The trains, electricity, gas, BT, the post office – which they practically gave away.\nBut the Tories have a problem when it comes to the NHS. They can’t flat out privatise it, because that’s politically toxic.\nSo in 2012 – The year that Danny Boyle showed us in his spectacular Olympic opening ceremony what a glorious thing the NHS is – the Conservatives brought in the Health and Social Care Bill.\nA bill that many people didn’t even notice passing through parliament. But a bill that arguably affects all of us more than any other legislation in our lifetime. A bill based on the premise that the NHS was a poorly performing institution that needed reform and another £3Bn top down reorganisation that we’d been promised before the election wouldn’t happen. A bill that ignored the core values of the NHS and characterised it’s staff as a problem to be dealt with rather than it’s greatest asset. A bill that achieved the Tory Nirvana of laying the NHS open to private contractors, furthering their ideology that the state should not be responsible for providing public services.\nIt effectively legislated against free universal comprehensive healthcare and flung the door to privatisation wide open. And private health firms are falling over themselves to come inside.\nJeremy Hunt has just announced £780Million worth of private contracts to 11 firms, many of which have a chequered history. Many of them are also donors to the Tory Party. There are also plans in Staffordshire to privatise cancer care in a £700M contract and ‘End of life care’ worth another £500M\nIn a leaked confidential document it’s proposed that these contractors will be :\n“Given ‘discretion’ to design services they would like to deliver, slash spend per patient and propose the payment structures most beneficial to themselves”.\nIn that one clause we get a glimpse of how private companies will pervert the ethos of the NHS to their own end.\nFirst the add on services will be an extra cost. Then any new treatments, drugs or therapies will be extra\nIn effect we’ll end up with a RyanAir NHS – Your operation will be free, but they’ll charge you £500 for the bed and another fifty for using the toilet.\nThe government consistently claims the NHS budget is protected but in reality, it’s being forced to make cuts dressed up as efficiency savings of £15bn – £20bn by the end of this year. No wonder we’re losing services. And across the country, A&Es, maternity and other services are being closed, with thousands of jobs lost. Competitive tendering also fragments healthcare. Where patients are sent miles to access different care resources around the country based on contractor costs.\nI’m standing as Parliamentary candidate for the Green Party in Banbury, where people are rightfully worried about that fragmentation and the future of their beloved Horton General Hospital. Labour have already tried to close it once, and more recently the coalition began a reduction in the range of services offered there, with the removal of emergency abdominal surgery facilities. This has resulted in some patients being forced to make a 3 or 4 hour, 50 mile round trip to services at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Not only is this extremely inconvenient, it also potentially impairs patient outcome as additional stress is added to their situation.\nBanbury has a long history of returning Conservative MPs, but this time every voter in the constituency has to ask themselves the question – do I still want to have access to a fully free and fully funded NHS in 5 years time?\nIf the answer is yes you have to remember that, no matter how much you might like the Conservative candidate this time (and I’ll admit I like her too), a vote for Victoria Prentis will just make another Tory led government more of a reality. No matter how much she says she’ll fight for the Horton, she’ll be forced to follow her party’s privatisation agenda. Even if she votes against the whip she’ll be a lone voice in a government she helped to put into power.\nI want to see an end to all privatisation of the NHS and I believe the NHS should be brought back entirely into public ownership.\nThe Green Party supports the NHS re-instatement bill, we’d negotiate an exit from PFI and repeal the Health and Social Care Act. We’d also fight TTIP which could have a huge impact on the NHS. We believe that NHS staff deserve a fair deal and that they should be supported and valued rather than treated as a problem to be dealt with\nAneurin Bevan was once asked how long he thought the NHS would survive. He replied: “As long as there are folk left with the faith to fight for it.”\nEvery party is pledging to invest more money into the NHS but the Green Party won’t just invest cash, we’ll also invest our faith. We all have to show that faith now or by the end of the next parliament Danny Boyle’s proud Olympic love letter to our wonderful NHS could become it’s epitaph.",

Begbroke and Yarnton and plonk 4400 houses in the middle of an area with overloaded roads and infrastructure. A plan that would see the three communities amalgamated into one sprawling conurbation, created not to serve local affordable housing needs, but to supposedly provide housing for workers in the city, even though most of the jobs are based in the east.\nYou can read the full response here\nAs everyone involved knows the oft-touted claims that this will include so-called ‘affordable’ housing is laughable. Valuable green belt land will become ten times more valuable once it becomes ripe for development and the landowners and luxury house builders will stand to make a fortune.\nI along with several others were allowed a five minute representation to the councillors in the chamber, some of whom it was later reported couldn’t even be bothered to listen to those who had come to plead their case. One was even photographed using a mobile phone during the speeches!\nSeeing the lack of connectedness demonstrated by the predominately Conservative council enraged me more than I imagined it would. If you watch the video footage from the planning meeting a few weeks ago you can hear me heckling quite loudly throughout some of speeches from Barry Wood and Colin Clarke.\nNormally I wouldn’t do something like that. They deserve their time to speak just as I and the other campaigners had. But being the last to have their say (as Cllr Wood ensured he would be) they were able to simply brush aside the very salient points raised by protesters and other councillors.\nTory councillor after Tory councillor stood up and gave no logical reason why these plans should be forced through in the face of what everyone recognised was an historic level of opposition from the people in the district they represent.\nOver 1500 responses were given to the plans, nearly all of them objecting to this wanton and unnecessary destruction of our precious green belt. Yet the council seemed oblivious to them, to the cogent arguments put forward by speakers and even to the legal opinions that were presented by the two main campaigning groups.\nThe cavalier attitude of Barry Wood, who I’d previously challenged for seeming to pre-judge the outcome of the consultation, was amply demonstrated when he and his fellow councillors abdicated their responsibility to the people of Cherwell and threw their objections at the feet of the planning inspector.\nHis closing argument was that it was the inspector who would make the final decision not them, even though they were elected to represent us. As I suspected months ago, the council had already made its mind up, and the consultation was simply a box ticking exercise. The fate of our green spaces, our wildlife habitats, our clean air and the distinctiveness of our communities has been thrown into the lap of an outside agency because the Tories on the council didn’t have the guts or the inclination to properly consider the alternatives.\nSo I hope you’ll forgive me some heckling out of pure frustration at the lack of professionalism and respect for democracy being shown by these people.\nThat’s why I want to win this election. I want a guaranteed voice in that chamber so that I can represent the views of the people in Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke – an area that is so remote from that chamber, way up at the other end of the district that people like Barry Wood and Colin Clarke feel it’s safe to throw us all under the bus for the sake of expediency.\nIt’s also why the Green Party in Kidlington is working with the Liberal Democrats in this election to elect me in Kidlington East and Alaric Rose in Kidlington West.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_author_ianmiddleton99_page_8/content_439.html": "At the full Cherwell District Council meeting in February I brought a motion calling for a more joined up approach to flooding response in our area and across Oxfordshire which was passed unanimously by members of the council.\nThe motion called for areas that are at risk of flooding to establish a ‘flood resilient community’, including the formation of local flood response groups and forums for residents to feedback information on current and potential flooding risks,\nTo support these groups I suggested the setting up of local flood response stores to provide locally available flood alleviation equipment. I had hoped that there would be funding for this, but there was some push back on this from the County Council due to shortage of money. I still don’t think that’s good enough and will be pursuing this more fully in the future.\nThe motion also said that updated surveys and maintenance programs, with maps of drainage and flood defences and associated repair responsibilities should be published regularly to help local groups and response agencies to maintain and monitor them.\nFinally I called on risk management agencies across the county to set up a cooperative task force, including the provision of a centralised contact point which can trigger an immediate, proportionate response to all emergency flooding events. It is envisaged that all local councils and other agencies would play a part in this.\nFlooding in Yarnton\nI was very glad we managed to debate this motion, even though it only just made it before the new 11pm guillotine imposed by the Conservatives in the recent constitutional review. If it hadn’t been discussed at this meeting, it would have been another 5 months before it would have been heard and obviously we could be facing many more flood incidents before then.\nAs a councillor, I’ve been trying to help local residents deal with flooding in both my Parish and District council wards. It’s become apparent that there is no central co-ordination and no single contact point that can be called on to manage flooding at all levels. Smaller floods are often given a low priority by the relevant agencies and even the new guidance issued by the County and District councils doesn’t provide a timely response to these incidents.\nCherwell District Council recently resumed responsibility for flood defence in the region and as we also work closely with the county council we are in a unique position to take some leadership on this issue and improve responses to these distressing and costly incidents. This is even more important in areas like Yarnton and Begbroke which have been flooded recently and where the council has recently identified areas for development as part of the local plan review.\nCovering areas in tarmac and concrete is only going to increase the likelihood of flooding and we need to ensure that suitable and long lasting flood alleviation measures are included along with responsibility for maintenance.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_climate-change-emergency/content_272.html": "At last week’s full council meeting of Cherwell District Council, councillors unanimously passed a climate change emergency motion calling on leader Barry Wood to report back to the council in six months on progress made on several environmental objectives for Cherwell.\nAs Cherwell’s only Green councillor I supported the motion with some reservations about the council’s true commitment to the difficult decisions that will need to be taken if the district is going to become truly carbon neutral by 2030.\nAs if to prove that point the council then went on to debate my motion calling for a rethink on plans to build on green belt in south Cherwell.\nThe motion, seconded by Libdem councillor Conrad Copeland, asked for a temporary pause to allow for new evidence to be taken into account that casts doubt on the number of houses needed to support Oxford’s unmet need – the justification for Cherwell’s partial review of its local plan.\nI also raised concerns about the amount of expansion being tacitly agreed to for the Begbroke Science Park that also encompasses large areas of Yarnton. In my opinion, this has been slipped into the review under false pretences, given that this has nothing to do with housing need in Oxford. As a result there’s mounting local criticism of the university’s ambitions to commandeer at least 1000 of the houses intended to meet Oxford’s needs for its own use as part of a new campus at Begbroke and Yarnton.\nChair of the Cherwell Development Watch Alliance, Giles Lewis, spoke in favour of the motion at the packed meeting and read out emails between the council and the university, obtained under and FOI request, that suggested plans to allow the university to expand in the area were already being supported as long ago as 2016.\nThe Labour group on the council then introduced an amendment which blocked any re-consideration of housing need numbers, even though this might mean more houses that were needed would be built on green belt.\nI pointed out that just to offset the amount of carbon produced in building the unaffordable and unneeded houses in the first place would take 572,000 trees over 10 years, or 200 per house, rather than the 1 tree per building that Cllr Wood had suggested during his address on the climate change emergency motion.\nIt’s clear that neither Labour nor the Conservatives are prepared to take the difficult decisions that are needed to combat the climate emergency. Labour were far more concerned not to be seen to be challenging inflated housing need figures proposed by their colleagues on the city council, whist the Conservatives simply want to be facilitators for large wealthy landowners in the area including the university. The location of the housing clearly has more to do with the university’s ambitions than it does with genuine housing allocation priorities. Either way it ends up with unnecessary and unaffordable housing being built that locals will have no access to on the green spaces at the heart of their community. This is a stitch-up perpetrated on the people of south Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Gosford!\nLibdem Councillor and spokesperson for the Progressive Oxfordshire group, Katherine Tyson said “These plans will simply expand the city’s appalling air quality into our rural community. At one point Labour councillor and vice-chairperson of the council Hannah Banfield seemed to suggest that, as Banbury residents had accepted bad air quality as a result of housing development in their area, the people of south Cherwell should just do the same. The argument that one ward coming to peace with poisoning their residents and children doesn’t mean that another ward should also poison their constituents. That’s not good enough for Cherwell residents. It beggars belief that such a comment could be made from a Labour councillor just after we had voted in favour of a climate change emergency motion”\nThe motion to pause the local review pending the outcome of the examination of the city council local plan and to separately consult on the university’s plans in Begbroke and Yarnton was successfully amended by the Labour group to an undertaking to review the allocation sites for the 4400 houses. It was carried by Labour with Conservatives abstaining on the vote. The subsequent motion was defeated by 16 votes to 23.",

The Banbury Phone Box Library is one such brilliant piece of local engagement which is now garnering international attention as BT looks towards chopping it off at the knees.\nThe red phone box is almost as iconic as the red bus as a national symbol of Britain around the world. You’d think if you were company who owns and operates these highly visible pieces of cultural capital you’d be only too pleased to see them being involved in well supported local campaigns that add value to a service that is perhaps not as loved as it once was.\nIn that context it seems daft to me that BT are hell bent on annoying small and large communities across the country by removing public call boxes where they’re valued for numerous reasons other than a quick natter on the phone. It’s even more self-defeating that they’re erasing some of the very symbols of Britishness that have helped them build a world class multi-national company.\nIt has to be said that the Town Council in Banbury share some of the potential blame if the box is removed, as they are refusing to adopt it (something that BT now allow for the princely sum of £1), if BT go ahead with plans to decommission the phone service in the box. Previously they struck a deal with BT to adopt the box and save the library and a local steel fabrication firm offered to fix permanent shelves in the box to house the books to assuage BT’s prior objections to the library service on health and safety grounds, as they believed the current shelving arrangements could be dangerous.\nBT now claims that it is uneconomic for them to continue to run the service anyway, even though I understand thousands of calls were made from it last year.\nThe under-story seems to be that BT want out of the call box game at any cost, and most of that cost will be borne by local communities using the boxes for a number of vital social services or simply to make a call when other options are not available to them.\nBanbury Town Council now say that they’re not prepared to adopt the box if it is then decommissioned by BT. Whilst I support taking a stance against the loss of the phone service, I think it would be a sad loss to the community of the box were to be removed as a result of the Town Council refusing to adopt the box itself.\nMoreover, If BT are claiming the box is loss making, I think it would be useful for them to provide the figures backing that up. It would at least give us an idea of the likely shortfall which could perhaps be covered in some other way.\nIt’s also crazy that BT are missing this as an opportunity for some very positive PR. It has to be said that they’re not universally loved as a company, so something like this, that is fairly minimal in cost terms, would seem to be a great way for them to connect with the community.\nGoing forward perhaps the government needs to bring in a legal requirement on telecoms companies like this to provide a certain number of public call points in an area. Just because most of us carry mobiles now, doesn’t mean that sometimes they might not fail at a vital time, or have been forgotten when they’re most needed. I know BT used to be obliged to seek permission from local or parish councils in order to remove a box, but it sounds like that requirement has now been watered down. In very rural areas mobile phone reception is also notoriously patchy. In those areas call boxes provide a vital service for emergency calls.\nIn terms of usage statistics, it might also be interesting to track the number of calls made against the minimum price of a call in a phone box, which I understand is now 60p. Perhaps BT need to be reminded of the law of supply and demand.\nIf you’re on Twitter you can follow and support the campaign to save the Banbury Phone Box Library by following the hashtag #SaveOurPhoneboxLibrary",

But as the County and District Councillor for the area that Stratfield Brake sits within, I think the County Cabinet’s agreement to enter into negotiations with OUFC was premature, given that there were still so many unanswered questions a year on from the initial approaches from the club to the council.\nOf course we all want to help the club find a new home, but if we’re talking about using public assets to do that, we need transparency about what they’ve done to help themselves. For example, we still don’t have evidence that they’ve have explored all legal remedies to stay where they are.\nIt also appeared from the club’s own long-awaited report that they hadn’t even started looking at other alternative sites until October last year, after claiming at the beginning of 2022 that they had already explored all other options.\nAfter waiting 8 months for the full report on the club’s plans, it took a further 2 months for it to be circulated to stakeholders in a heavily edited form which doesn’t suggest that they are willing to be as transparent with local residents and stakeholders as they have claimed in the past.\nKidlington Parish Council (KPC) had been waiting for most of last year for the report from the club showing their detailed plans for the main Stratfield Brake site (which they are leaseholders of) so that they could be put out to local consultation. They could not take a decision on relinquishing their lease until they had consulted with the local residents who they represent.\nThe club has tried to blame the council for delays in making a decision on the initial very broad proposals but that was simply not the case. KPC wanted to make a decision on an informed basis and had been working towards a genuine local consultation, but to facilitate that they needed details of what the club were proposing. Thus any delay in the decision by the council are entirely the fault of the football club. Instead of engaging properly with KPC to help them hold a local consultation, they have gone around them by moving their plans to the site known as the Triangle which KPC has no direct control over.\nAs a result, I made a plea to the cabinet to include an amendment to the proposals to enter into negotiations with the club that would also commit the council to a full local consultation on the proposals before any final decision was made which should include the option to accept or reject the proposals. This wasn’t even responded to.\nAs the local county councillor I was disappointed that my call to the County Cabinet for a full local consultation didn’t seem to be endorsed. That would at least have given local residents some comfort that their views, both for and against the proposals, would be properly taken into account.\nThere was a reference to future engagement with stakeholders but it’s not clear who would undertake this and if it would be at a point where the local community would have a chance to say yes or no to the plans once they know what they are. With so many questions still left unanswered, we need a definite assurance that such a consultation will be part of the final decision process, otherwise we may find ourselves overtaken by circumstances as plans progress and positions become embedded”.\nWhilst I’m pleased to see the council took note of local concerns raised in last year’s country-wide engagement exercise, what is being proposed now is a rather different prospect and doesn’t completely deal with local views about having yet another significant development sited on some of Kidlington’s dwindling green spaces.\nIf we’re going to condone building on the green belt we need to ensure there is quantifiable local support for that. There are a range of views, as we saw at the meeting, and I want to make sure I’m fully representing the balance of local opinion, but until we ask the whole community we don’t know what that is.\nMy position as the local councillor for the area is that I have to support the majority view of the residents that will be affected by this development whatever they are. I don’t understand why there is a resistance from both the club and their fans as well as the council to asking local people directly what they think of this idea. There may be opposition, but there may equally be majority support for the plans. If so we can proceed on that basis knowing that the club would be welcomed by the village. Surely that would be a better outcome for all concerned, especially OUFC’s owners who I assume wouldn’t want to impose themselves on to a community that would resent them being there.\nI will continue to advocate for a full local consultation both internally within the council and with other local representatives, particularly the local MP Layla Moran.",

Areas near the kerbside are heavily damaged making for an uncomfortable and dangerous ride for cyclists and other road users. Yet repeated requests to the council and reports on Fix My Street have gone unheeded.\nNow, in the wake of increased cycling as a result of the pandemic, cycle lane symbols have appeared on this road on top of the cracks and potholes, with no attempt to repair the long-standing degradation of the road surface.\nOther roads, such as the Bicester Road, have had painted cycle lanes on the main carriageway for some time, but there are also poorly maintained and often blocked by parked cars meaning cyclists have to face oncoming traffic to navigate them. This is particularly bad given that this road has a local school and is also subject to an air quality management area.\nBut I was gobsmacked when I saw the cycling symbol on Yarnton Road. This is a road that I regularly cycle down and it’s a real bone shaker. It’s no exaggeration to say that you have to hang on for dear life as you bounce along the road near the curbs, dodging potholes and cracks. It’s especially dangerous at night.\nThe road forms part of a national cycling route, but you’d never know it to look at the surface of the carriageway. It’s certainly not for the faint-hearted! I couldn’t believe they just slapped a cycle symbol on the road without any attention to its terrible condition.\nIt takes more than a pot of paint and a stencil to create a cycle path. The road surface has to be fit for riders if they are to be encouraged to use it. Even motorists complain about the state of this road. How does the council expect cyclists to cope as they rattle across these severely damaged and uneven surfaces? This is just pure tokenism!\nIt just goes to show how little the council knows or cares about the plight of cyclists in the county. If they really want to encourage more sustainable transport, especially post COVID, they have to take cyclists needs into proper account when carrying out road maintenance rather than literally just painting over the cracks!\nWe need more Green councillors on the county council to take these sorts of issue seriously and deliver real improvements for cyclists, pedestrians and other road users, rather than these half-hearted token gestures from a council devoid of real leadership and direction.",

So busy I’ve not been able to properly thank everyone who supported and voted for me on May 6th.\nAs the count was delayed until the 9th May and went on until late in the evening, it wasn’t until the 10th that it began to sink in that I’d actually won, beating a long standing councillor who had become something of a fixture in the area.\nIt was a fantastic election for the Greens across the country with us winning nearly 100 new seats. Some of the notable highlights were :\n- Greens in first place across Bristol West and Sheffield Central constituencies\n- Gained representation on 18 councils, bringing the total tally of councils with Green representation to 141.\n- Gained 99 seats – now 445 councillors across England and Wales\n- Won 24 seats on Bristol City Council – now joint largest party with Labour.\nAnd of course in Oxford we won many new seats with an extra seat gained on the city council and 2 new seats on the county council, myself included! After we retained our original seat on the county with Dr Pete Sudbury, that gives us 3 seats along with Robin Bennett who is also the deputy leader of South Oxfordshire District Council. I’m looking forward to working with both of them.\nThe out-turn of all this in Oxfordshire is that the Conservatives have been pushed into being the opposition party on the county for the first time ever! While they are currently showing as having 22 seats on the council, they actually only have 21 as an extra seat was gained due to a mistake made at the count that will be corrected in the high court in the next few weeks. There’s also some exciting news in the pipeline about what that means for the next administration of the council that I can’t reveal at the moment. But look out on Monday evening for an important announcement!\nMeanwhile, the Green surge continues, and thanks to you I am part of that! So a huge thank you goes out to everyone who worked on my campaign, donated money to it and of course to the people who voted for me. I will do my best to not let you down. I will be starting work on the council in the next week or so, after all the dust has settled and I am properly plugged into the systems there. The first part of that is the council AGM which will be held on Tuesday in Banbury.\nIn the meantime, please feel free to contact me with any issues you want me to look at. My first priority is going to be looking at what we can do about the state of the roads in this area. I’ve already been contacted by several people who have raised this with me and I know from my own experience that this is a very important local issue. I hope I can hit the ground running and make some visible progress on this soon.\nIt’s going to be an exciting few years with huge changes afoot in Oxfordshire and you’re all part of that, so thank you all again!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_banbury_page_2/content_346.html": "As I said in the recent election debate on the BBC, in my opinion they shouldn’t.\nThere are many reasons it’s a bad idea, both from a business perspective and as part of local spending priorities.\nI’ve worked in retail nearly all my life. I built and ran a national chain of jewellery stores across the country and traded in several shopping centres, including some of the most prestigious in the country such as Bluewater in Kent and the new Bullring Centre in Birmingham. I write a regular column for Retail week Magazine and comment regularly in the national press on retail issues as well as offering consultancy services. One of my main focusses is independent retail and commercial property. So I know a little bit about what I’m talking about.\nCherwell District Council (CDC) leader Barry Wood claims that buying the Castle Quay Shopping Centre in Banbury is a good deal for the people of Cherwell. This decision was also backed by the Labour group on the council and their leader Sean Woodcock has assured me there’s a good business case for doing it. Unfortunately neither of them have been able to show it to me so far.\nTheir belief is that buying a commercial property like a shopping centre is a good idea as property will always rise in value. This may be the case for domestic property and some kinds of commercial premises, but not always with retail space.\nA Good Investment?\nThe argument for buying the scheme seems to be that if they hadn’t, the centre would have shut down. It has many long term empty units and is generally struggling to compete in an ever crowded marketplace. The council’s decision a few years ago to allow a new shopping park to open on the outskirts of Banbury haven’t helped its plight.\nIt’s extremely unlikely though that it would have closed down. Much more likely that it would have been offloaded by its pension investment owners to another investment company with more experience of running a shopping centre than some local councillors.\nMoreover, if the argument is that the centre was about to collapse, that doesn’t exactly make it an attractive investment for public money does it?\nThere have been some shopping centre failures in the past, but they are few and far between. But when they do go, they tend to go completely. That means an almost total loss for anyone unlucky enough to be the owner at the time. There will be some residual value in the land, but that’s unlikely to reflect the full price paid for the whole development.\nThere have been a growing number of retail failures in recent years with 650 collapses so far this year alone, and we’re not even half way through yet! Some of them very high profile and heavily leveraged operations. Others are busy negotiating partial closures and rent reductions with their landlords. Others are moving more into the online arena and abandoning physical retail space almost altogether.\nNone of this bodes well for an under-let, under-invested and down at heel shopping centre in a struggling town in North Oxfordshire.\nSo essentially CDC are gambling with public money against the odds. And it doesn’t end there.\nOther Costs\nAccording to Barry Wood the scheme is turning a profit at the moment, but as I’ve said previously, I’ve not seen evidence of that. I have seen a large number of long term voids in the centre, and with the potential for these to increase in number I fear the profitability may be marginal or likely to decline.\nThere will also be ongoing running costs for the centre and presumably additional investment to do whatever it is with the place that they feel will revitalise it. Again details on that are sketchy, but I think there’s some talk about dividing the larger units into smaller ones to attract independent retailers. Whilst I support that idea to some extent there are a lot of things to consider about that course of action.\nFirstly the cost of doing the work, which may include major re-modelling of the units due to, amongst other things, fire regulations. I’ve seen at least one shopping centre management come unstuck with similar plans due to rules on access to fire exit routes.\nHelping Smaller Retailers?\nSecondly smaller independents usually don’t have a huge budget for shopfitting, so there will be additional cost in partially fitting out the units, including new shopfronts etc to attract smaller operators and to ensure that their stores fit in with a modern shopping centre scheme.\nBusiness Rates\nThirdly there’s the loss of business rates on the empty units that are there now, and will most likely be there for a while. Considering the current climate in retail there’s also a good chance that voids could increase. At the moment the landlords will be paying rates on those premises even though they’re empty and a good deal of that money goes to CDC. With the council now being the landlords, they’re going to be paying the rates to themselves, effectively wiping out that income.\nDevaluation of the Asset\nFinally there’s the issue of valuation. Shopping developments are broadly valued on their rental potential. This is why landlords will leave units empty rather than let them out at a reduced rent. If the council’s plan is to lower the rent for smaller or other retailers, that will have a knock on effect on the value of those units and then on others when rent reviews come around. Other tenants now paying a higher rent will also push for a reduction when their leases come up for renewal or rent reviews are due or maybe even before.\nThe net effect of this would be to push down rents, not only in the centre but across the town, reducing loan to asset values across the board. In broad terms I’d welcome that. I’ve long argued that retail property values are hugely inflated. But in terms of the Council’s investment exposure in Castle Quay it’s a potentially dangerous situation, not only leading to a potential devaluation of the asset, but also any loans secured on it being partially called in.\nThere may be some balancing in terms of appreciation on the total asset value, but in the current climate and in a falling retail market, there a very good chance that the overall value of the scheme will fall relative to the amount the council has sunk into it, both as an initial investment and any further day to day expenditure.\nAll of this appears to have passed Cherwell Councillors and the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives by. They obviously have a very patchy understanding of how retail property works and the implications and pitfalls they are letting us all as council tax payers in for.\nMoreover there’s the question of if so much money should be focussed in the north of the district while ignoring other areas. Mr Wood commented in the Radio debate on Wednesday that he recognised that there were empty units in Pioneer Square in Bicester and that it was difficult to get them filled. Yet this doesn’t seem to have concerned him over the purchase of Castle Quay. Indeed, having set the precedent in Banbury I asked him during the debate if the council intended to buy Pioneer Square as well. He didn’t reply.\nOther Options\nA more sensible and prudent approach to the problems in both areas would be to work with the landlords rather than bailing them out with public money. Leave them with the risk whilst introducing local initiatives that help smaller retailers get a foothold and would also support the centre.\nThese could include rates reductions, which Barry Wood dismissed out of hand when I challenged him on it during the election debate. Neither he nor Sean Woodcock appeared to know that it has been within the gift of local councils to reduce rates on specific properties at their discretion for several years now.\nIf they wanted to provide smaller, more affordable space for independent retailers, they could lease units from the centres on a medium to long term basis, probably negotiating favourable terms with the landlords as a council will have a very good covenant. These could then be divided up (if required) and then sublet on flexible terms on reduced rents to retailers, although this would have to be agreed beforehand with the landlord for the same reasons discussed above concerning rental levels and valuations.\nThis would achieve the same aim of revitalising schemes both in Banbury and Bicester and would not involve the council in risking large amounts of public money. It would also mean that the bulk of the £60m they are now tying up in one area could be spread across the district.\nThis is the kind of strategic thinking we need, rather that the amateurish speculation of a council who seems to want to play at being shopkeepers with our money. This is why we need a more diverse representation on the council and councillors like me who will challenge these misguided moves before millions of pounds of desperately needed council funds are put at risk.",

I had hoped that there would be funding for this, but there was some push back on this from the County Council due to shortage of money. I still don’t think that’s good enough and will be pursuing this more fully in the future.\nThe motion also said that updated surveys and maintenance programs, with maps of drainage and flood defences and associated repair responsibilities should be published regularly to help local groups and response agencies to maintain and monitor them.\nFinally I called on risk management agencies across the county to set up a cooperative task force, including the provision of a centralised contact point which can trigger an immediate, proportionate response to all emergency flooding events. It is envisaged that all local councils and other agencies would play a part in this.\nFlooding in Yarnton\nI was very glad we managed to debate this motion, even though it only just made it before the new 11pm guillotine imposed by the Conservatives in the recent constitutional review. If it hadn’t been discussed at this meeting, it would have been another 5 months before it would have been heard and obviously we could be facing many more flood incidents before then.\nAs a councillor, I’ve been trying to help local residents deal with flooding in both my Parish and District council wards. It’s become apparent that there is no central co-ordination and no single contact point that can be called on to manage flooding at all levels. Smaller floods are often given a low priority by the relevant agencies and even the new guidance issued by the County and District councils doesn’t provide a timely response to these incidents.\nCherwell District Council recently resumed responsibility for flood defence in the region and as we also work closely with the county council we are in a unique position to take some leadership on this issue and improve responses to these distressing and costly incidents. This is even more important in areas like Yarnton and Begbroke which have been flooded recently and where the council has recently identified areas for development as part of the local plan review.\nCovering areas in tarmac and concrete is only going to increase the likelihood of flooding and we need to ensure that suitable and long lasting flood alleviation measures are included along with responsibility for maintenance.",

I eventually decided I should probably put my principles where my mouth was, and at least try to do something constructive about some of the things I’ve been banging on about for years. Since then I’ve stood for Parliament 3 times and been elected to the District Council, the County Council and 3 Parish Councils which has been hard but rewarding work.\nI’ve never really been much of a joiner, and before joining the Greens hadn’t really been involved in any sort of political activity since I left the young socialists in 1973, just after our treasurer was found to have run off with most of our funds – Maybe that’s where my distrust of politics started.\nEven so I’ve voted Green for a number of years, mainly because I could no longer bring myself to vote for any of the usual suspect parties, and not voting has never been an option for me.\nI saw the Green Party back then as the only one that at least cared about some of the things that were closest to my heart. As most people usually do, I saw the party as principally concerned with the environment and the biosphere.\nBut I came to realise that it was a party that was also trying to tackle many of the social justice issues that are only being paid lip service by the traditional parties. In short, it made more sense than all the others.\nI eventually joined the Party in 2012 after meeting our then Mayor, Elise Benjamin, who also happened to be a Green, during a period when I felt the need to nail my colours to some kind of political mast.\nMy love of the outdoors, my concerns over human and animal rights and a long held belief that the human race only has a few more generations left to run if we carry on treating the planet and each other as we are, seemed to suggest that those colours were most likely to be green.\nAs a businessperson, a long time retailer, and now a retail commentator, analyst and journalist, one of the most difficult things for me to reconcile is my involvement in the promotion of consumerism. That’s at odds with my more recent conviction that we can’t continue to squander the world’s finite resources on wants, whilst ignoring the needs of most of the planet’s population. It’s still a work in progress for me, but I think the answer probably lies with balancing these two factors whilst mixing in a healthy portion of social entrepreneurism.\nLike it or loathe it, the world needs businesses to keep what we like to call civilisation running. And if those enterprises remember that they need to put back into society at least as much as they took out, we might have the makings of a sustainable economic culture. I’m grossly over-simplifying of course, but I won’t bore you with the details now. But I hope that my entrepreneurial background might help inform some of the key policy issues surrounding our relationship with businesses, large and small.\nI’m a vocal advocate of social enterprise, and believe that there are many big businesses out there that can be made to take a more ethical stance if we create the right conditions to encourage it. I certainly think that if The Green Party is to obtain any significant level of power on a national level, we have to be prepared to work with business, but not be a slave to it.\nAnd we do need to achieve power at the Westminster level if we’re going to halt the inequities of the current government and their attacks on the NHS, the poor, the disabled and the disadvantaged and of course combat the real and imminent dangers of climate collapse.\nIf you have any issues you’d like me to take on, or something you feel I should be aware of, please contact me using the links on this website. I’d also encourage everyone to follow me on Twitter and on Facebook, if you do that sort of thing.\nI look forward to meeting and interacting with as many of you as possible, and hopefully persuading those that need it that the Green Party offers a genuine and workable alternative to the status quo in Oxfordshire and the country as a whole.

Greens come from all backgrounds and bring a wealth of experience to the job. Many run their own businesses or have done so in the past, so realise the pressures that are put on to small and medium sized enterprises. I co-founded and ran a large retail operation with branches all over the country, so I have a good insight into the problems now facing our post-Covid high streets.\nMany other councillors have come from academia or the various public sectors or just from the same background as the people they represent. I was born to a working family in East London and grew up in South East London/Kent where I attended a secondary modern school in the 70s.\nBut the one thing that has driven us all to take on the job of a councillor is a desire to make the world a better place for everyone and a willingness to fully represent and work for the people who have put their faith in us by giving us their vote.\nThe Green Party doesn’t operate a party whip. We always remember we are there to represent the people who voted for us, and we will always put people before party.\nAs a District Councillor, I’ve seen first hand how local government can work against the interests of our communities rather than for them.\nParty dogma is the main reason for this with councillors being fiercely whipped, especially by the Conservative leadership. This has resulted in some frankly bizarre outcomes with residents and council tax payers bearing the brunt.\nThe Green Party doesn’t operate a party whip. We always remember we are there to represent the people who voted for us, and we will always put people before party. Green councillors are free to vote how they see fit, which has resulted in far better outcomes for residents.\nFor example it only took one Green County Councillor, working across party lines, to secure 20MPH powers for local councils as part of the ’20 is plenty’ initiative. Of course other parties now claim credit for that great achievement, but we don’t mind, as long as our communities benefit.\nBut it’s on climate change that Greens really lead the way. While we’ve welcomed other parties into the climate awareness fold, they often still don’t get it. They don’t see environmentalism as literally a global issue, preferring to compartmentalise and focus only on their own operations.\nOf course that’s important, but in the midst of an emergency we have to tackle the problem at all levels, not just those that conveniently and comfortably coincide with other priorities such as exponential growth.\nFor all these reasons and many more, voting Green brings positive change for our communities and our planet. Change that’s needed now, before it’s too late.",

This is even more important in areas like Yarnton and Begbroke which have been flooded recently and where the council has recently identified areas for development as part of the local plan review.\nCovering areas in tarmac and concrete is only going to increase the likelihood of flooding and we need to ensure that suitable and long lasting flood alleviation measures are included along with responsibility for maintenance.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_cycle-paths/content_253.html": "I went for a wander around Kidlington and Yarnton to check out the state of the roads. So many people have told me this is one of their major concerns in the area. Cyclists in particular are worried about poor maintenance of cycle paths and the spaces on roads that they have to use.\nLast year I highlighted the County Council’s cynical actions in painting a cycle path marking over the top of an appalling road surface that was actually dangerous for cyclists to use. I said then that they were quite literally painting over the cracks in their road maintenance responsibilities.\nThings haven’t improved in the meantime and I thought it was about time some of these appalling road surfaces were documented for posterity. Also I’m hoping that my video can be used to shame the council into finally dealing with damaged roads in our areas that have remained untouched for years. You can watch it for yourself here\nMany of our local roads and walkways haven’t been properly repaired for years. County Councillors need to be lobbying for more funds to keep our roads in a decent state of repair and focusing on making proper cycling infrastructure more plentiful across the county.\nIf we al wake up to a new County Council next week I hope one of the first things they set about doing is getting a grip on this worsening situation. I know that if I’m one of those councillors I will certainly be calling for this as soon as possible.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_author_ianmiddleton99_page_25/content_494.html": "After what seems like centuries of wrangling, planning applications, withdrawn projects, hand shaking and head banging, Oxford is finally set to join other cities with a giant shiny shopping centre nobody really needs any more.\nHaving experienced the damage that these behemoths can do to small local retailers, myself included, this is a moment I and many others have dreaded.\nThe council of course has applied a heavy spin on the whole project, whilst ushering the developers and large multi-nationals into the city with wide-eyed certainty that a new shopping centre will solve all the problems we now have.\nWe know at least one of those problems – that of affordable housing in the city centre – won’t even be dented by this grandiose project. In a move that is frankly baffling from a socialist led council, planners have dashed all hopes that the accommodation element designed into the revamped centre would be for social housing or affordable homes. Whilst Green councillors opposed this move, others apparently felt that poorer people won’t be able to keep the new apartments up to the standards they expect to be demanded.\nSo no comfortable inner-city pied-à-terres for the ordinary folk of Oxford then. Which is a shame considering Oxford City Council provided virtually nothing for that sector last year, despite claims that this was a priority policy.\nJobs are not the only thing to consider\nJudging by the analyses carried out over the past 10 years it looks highly likely that the new Westgate extension in Oxford will have a significant impact on other retail destinations both in the immediate vicinity and county wide.\nThe council has claimed that 3400 jobs will be created by the opening of the new centre, which seems like a rather optimistic number to me. Even if one accepts that figure, previous analyses have suggested that the number of jobs created will be far outweighed by those that will be destroyed elsewhere in the city and the surrounding areas.\nIt’s very easy to focus just on the number of jobs created, but when similar centres have opened there have been many casualties in other areas. This doesn’t even take into account the damage that’s likely to be done to trade during the building and infrastructure works and the impact of additional competition for small retailers that attracting large multi-nationals into the area will provide.\nIn an era where many retail chains are looking to reduce their portfolios, the time for this centre has been and gone. There’s already plenty of retail space in Oxford city centre, some of it lying vacant even now. Until the council addresses the systemic issues with people visiting the city, such as parking, local transport and city centre management, a revamped shopping centre isn’t going to add that much prosperity to a town encircled by much better alternatives.\nThe new shopping centre will likely have some novelty value for a few months, but once the realities of trading in Oxford begin to bite, I doubt it’ll be anything more than another usual-suspect clone-town brand zoo.\nYears of disruption\nAccording to a recent article in the Oxford Mail, a scrutinising committee of city centre councillors are due to meet to discuss ways of keeping businesses alive during the hugely disruptive infrastructure works needed for the new extension.\nSo Oxford City Council wait until AFTER the works have begun to think about how to mitigate the problems that will inevitably be caused by the works?\nAnother great example of the forethought and careful planning we’ve come to expect from our wonderful city council!\nI was at a meeting with both the city and county council leaders over a year ago where I highlighted the potential damage that will be done by the infrastructure works required for the Westgate extension. Having already experienced the same in Bristol a few years before, it was clear to me and many others that the likely upheaval required for the Westgate works were going to do more damage than they were likely to be worth in the current climate.\nSeems like it all fell on deaf ears. As usual.\nEmpty shops\nMy business in Cornmarket Street closed it’s doors for the last time after 20 years last year. Despite numerous pronouncements in the press that the city council was eager to support local businesses, we got zip-all support, even after asking on several occasions. Indeed, at one point their planning department were very close to scuppering the only deal we could achieve to sell the store. Had they not done a last minute U-turn there would have been one more empty and un-lettable shop in the city centre.\nCouncillors are also now apparently worried about the growing number of empty shops in the city, despite previous claims that there were queues of businesses eager to take space. Perhaps news has started to filter out that retailing in Oxford is not what it once was?\nIn that context one has to wonder who is going to populate the new cathedral of consumption when it is finally completed, and for those that do take up residence, what kind of trading environment will they find? With 40% of retail leases across the country coming up for renewal at the end of this year, it really does beg the question about how much space will be required when the Westgate centre is completed in 2017. Moreover what will the rest of the city look like once all the remaining viable stores have de-camped into the waiting warmth of a lovely new mall?\nWith council plans to push up the cost of parking YET AGAIN and the negative impact of roadworks, and the city centre looking like a building site, it’s likely most consumers will continue to go elsewhere to shop, surrounded as we are by much more attractive and easily reached locations around the city and the county. And once again, experience tells me that once people find better alternatives, they’re unlikely to return, other than for a quick nose around the new development.\nA committee composed of councillors with absolutely no idea how businesses in Oxford operate, setting out to ‘examine’ how to deal with these issues now, is tantamount to closing the door after the horse has bolted, lived out it’s natural life and ended up in a dog food tin. This project as has been in the planning stages for so many years it’s truly staggering that the implications are only being discussed now.\nOxford is of course known as the city of ‘dreaming spires’. It seems that in terms of strategic planning, many of our councillors have also been asleep on the job.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_general-election/content_58.html": "So the day is finally here. The chance to vote to end 14 years of Tory misrule and see change. But is it really?\nTwo parties are saying they would provide change, but only one is offering REAL change and REAL hope – The Green Party.\nThe Labour Party slogan ‘Change’ is so reductive and self fulfilling it’s almost worthless as an electoral ambition. Will Labour provide change? Well yes, if they’re elected as the majority government we will see a change by definition. Where there was once Rishi Sunak, there will be Keir Starmer. A clear change of leader and administration, but is that all we want? Will we see REAL change? I rather doubt it.\nLabour’s manifesto suggests otherwise with so many policies seemingly just a continuation of what we have with the Tories. Things like the Bedroom Tax, The Two Child Benefit cap, a continuation of the oil and gas drilling licences granted by the Conservatives, including the highly questionable Rosebank. None of that will change and neither will things like private provision in the NHS or a really progressive tax regime.\nSo what real change will we see with Labour, or any of the other parties for that matter? It looks like the only thing that will be changing will be the climate!\nEven the Liberal Democrats haven’t really committed to change on important things like tax reform or tuition fees which of course they were instrumental in bringing in. Their candidate in Bicester & Woodstock is a well meaning guy, but he was also an adviser to the coalition government during the first period of austerity, as was the Conservative candidate, so not much change for the better there!\nCan I win in Bicester and Woodstock? That depends on you, the voters. It’s a circular argument that Greens can’t win so we don’t get votes, but if we don’t get votes we can’t win. But even if I don’t win my purpose is still to raise more awareness of the Green Party and our values. A party I’ve supported for 12 years and voted for for even longer, back when they were even more unlikely to be elected. Since then there’s been a huge surge in support for Greens, something I’ve seen first hand after being elected to 5 different councils as a Green and re-elected to one of those since.\nIf the Green Party didn’t exist and people hadn’t voted for them, do you think the other parties would have taken any notice of climate change or other Green issues? I very much doubt it and that’s even more obvious now that parties like Labour and the Conservatives are backing away from their climate change commitments because to stick by them is electorally inconvenient.\nSo the Greens have brought about real change over the past decade and will continue to push for more in the coming years, especially as we are looking set to at least triple our representation in Westminster. Change on things like the NHS, social care, social security, justice, equal rights, animal welfare, nature recovery, climate change and so much more.\nI’d of course love to be one of those parliamentarians helping to make those changes, as our new MPs will do through careful lobbying and internal pressure on whomever is in power by the end of this week. But I know that’s unlikely. But every vote for me and every other Green candidate still counts. It counts as part of the message the whole country needs to send to Westminster, even more so as the ruling party is likely to have a majority so large that they probably won’t be in the mood to listen to anyone else.\nBut I have faith that Greens will always find a way to move the needle and work for positive change. And I’ll continue to do that whatever happens in the polls on Thursday. I’m content to play a role, no matter how small in helping to make the future a brighter place for the next generation. Your vote can help me and every other Green candidate to do that, so I hope you’ll give that thought some serious consideration when you mark that cross on the ballot sheet.\nThe polls suggest that the outcome to this election is a foregone conclusion. Labour will comfortably win a huge majority and in Bicester & Woodstock the Lib Dems will romp home. If nothing else people will vote for them just to stop them sending any more leaflets! So you can safely vote Green, knowing it’s extremely unlikely to change that outcome.\nSo more than ever in this election you can vote with your heart to make real change happen. Change that means more than a different name on the House of Commons letterhead. Otherwise we’ll be right back here in 5 or 10 years time, probably with the Conservatives promising the change that we never really seem to get.\nAs someone else said during this election “If you want change you have to vote for it”. If you want REAL change you have to vote Green!",

But we’re used to tall orders. In the face of what seems like a deliberate policy of starving us of media attention in favour of far more ratings grabbing pint-swilling politico-celebs like Nigel Farage, we’re still garnering support from credible commentators and respected political analysts for both our economic and social justice proposals.\nFormer Citibank financial trader Gary Stevenson and host of the You Tube Channel Gary’s Economics has analysed the Green Party manifesto and classified it as the most credible and honest in real terms. In a recent video he confirmed that he would be voting Green because we are the only party to be offering a radical and workable alternative to the proposals from every other party.\nTrade Unionist and former General Secretary of the Labour Party Jennie Formby has also announced on Twitter that she would be voting Green in this election along with numerous other high profile political and cultural leaders such as George Monbiot. It’s also reported that more and more young people are turning to the Greens as a real alternative to the ping-pong politics of the past 50 years.\nAs a moderate Green myself I’ve always seen the Greens as a true alternative vote, neither left or right. The Green Party officially rejects the traditional left–right political spectrum, describing it as “something of an anachronism” and that perfectly fits with my view on the world.\nI’m standing as the Parliamentary Candidate for Bicester and Woodstock mainly because it’s my home constituency and the place I’ve made my home for 32 years. But above all that, it’s a place I’ve seen change drastically in that time with even more drastic changes in the pipeline. From the massive development plans in and around Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Bicester with large areas of greenbelt being decimated by ill-conceived local plans to proposals to armour plate 3500 acres of green fields and farmland for hugely unpopular solar farm project in the west. I’m concerned about what these things will do to the place I’ve called home for nearly half my life.\nThere’s obviously going to be a lot more to say on this election in the remaining 2 weeks, much of which I’ve not said so far due to dealing with my new responsibilities on Cherwell District Council after being appointed to the executive on the same night that the General Election was announced (great timing Rishi!). But I’ll be breaking my silence over the next 2 weeks.\nIn the meantime, doors are being knocked, leaflets are being delivered and pollsters are polling. There’s been a huge amount of speculation about who can win in this constituency and I’m not going to add to that with my own obviously biased opinions. But with a newly drawn boundary, every voter has the historic opportunity to vote in a brand new Westminster constituency for the first time where we could all buck the trends and help me and the Greens to show that any prediction in an unknown and untested area could be drastically inaccurate.\nCan I win? Who knows? Am I serious about my candidacy? Absolutely! But then as anyone who knows me and knows my work as a local councillor and activist would tell you, I never do things by half measures. We all know that the Tories are finished, at least for the immediate future. We don’t need to vote tactically on a local basis in this election because after 14 years of chaos the country has finally woken up and are about to consign the current administration to the political skip.\nThat gives every voter in this area new opportunities and new possibilities. You can vote with your heart and for what you believe in. If that’s a better future for you and your family, a fully funded NHS and social care system, public utilities returned to responsible public control (particular water and energy), a better standard of living for all, raising millions out of poverty and protecting climate and nature, voting Green really is the only alternative. Even if I don’t win the seat, a vote for me that would contribute to a large swing to the Greens nationally will strengthen our hand in influencing national politics for the better. It will also put money into the party coffers through Short Money to help us continue the fight for a better, fairer, greener world for you and you family and their families to come.\nI’ll do my best over the next couple of weeks to make my case for your precious vote in this election and I hope you will seriously consider giving me that vote on July 4th. You should shortly be receiving leaflets from me explaining my priorities. You can also browse this website which is being updated with local issues that I think will be important in the upcoming election. I will also be adding new topics in the next few days. If you want hear me speak in the meantime, I was interviewed by Byline Times recently and was able to cover many topics that I think will be important to voters in this election. You can see that here.\nThere are also a number of hustings that you can attend to ask questions of me and the other candidates. These are :\n7.30pm – 24th June – Kidlington Methodist Church (forum on poverty)\n7.30pm – 25th June – St. Mary Magdelene Church, Park St, Woodstock\n7pm – 26th June – St Edburg Church Bicester\n6.30pm – 1st July – CPRE Country side and Environment hustings at Yarnton Village Hall\nI look forward to seeing as many people at those events as possible. If anyone would like to extend other invitations I am more than happy to come along. If any other events come up I will post them here and on my social media channels.\nRemember – this is the election where YOU get to vote FOR what YOU believe in, rather than AGAINST what you don’t.\nIf you’d like to get involved in my campaign please drop me a line at ian.middleton@greenoxford.com\nYou could also contribute to my joint fundraiser to help me and my 2 fellow North and West Oxfordshire candidates reach more voters in this campaign.

As a result he bears some of the blame for a Conservative majority borne on the backs of the large number of older voters who didn’t see the 2 minutes it took to mark an X on a ballot sheet as so desperately uncool.\nThis time we have Ricky Gervais leaping into the fray with this tweet :\n“OK. I’m not telling you how to vote, but this is a fact. The only vote that will keep Theresa May out is a vote for @jeremycorbyn. Cheers”\nWhilst not quite so devoid of acumen as Brand’s ill-conceived advice, Ricky’s more well meaning call to action could be equally as dangerous.\nEssentially he IS telling his fans how to vote, and his less politically astute followers may not realise the pitfalls of such a binary choice.\nThe reality is that in many constituencies a vote for Corybn will not keep Theresa May out. The real fact is that it may do the exact opposite.\nSadly, even after repeated calls from other parties to enter into an ad-hoc alliance, Labour has resolutely refused to stand aside in any constituency. Whereas, for example, The Green Party has done so now in well over 30 seats.\nIn many of those seats the Libdems have a much better chance of winning than Labour. In some others the Greens or the SNP could have it in the bag. Voting Labour could then very well help the Tories by splitting the opposition.\nBy selling the idea that a vote for Labour is a vote against the Tories, no matter where you are, The Labour party and many of its supporters could be handing another victory to the Conservatives.\nI’m not usually an advocate of tactical voting, but needs must when the devil drives, and I see the devil behind the eyes of the Conservatives. But tactical voting has to be just that. It doesn’t simply mean voting Labour as the only alternative.\nUnder our broken electoral system the only place votes really count are in marginal constituencies. Until we get electoral reform and a system of proportional representation, that won’t change. And let’s not forget that Labour supports our first past the post system just as much as the Tories do.\nBut even in a safe seat your vote can make a real difference. In 2015 UKIP gave the Conservatives a real run for their money. Even though they only won one seat in Parliament they put the Tories on notice that they were there, close behind, snapping at their heels.\nThe result was the delivery of a referendum on EU membership and the subsequent lurch to the right that followed in the footsteps of Theresa May. The Conservative manifesto, such as it is, represents one of the most extreme right outlooks for the UK for many generations. It makes Margaret Thatcher’s vision look like a tie-dyed, rose tinted call to action for the love generation. It has even been compared to the BNP’s warped ideological ramblings from the 1980s, and not without cause.\nThis can be directly traced to UKIP’s influence and its validation of ideals that make a hard line, right wing agenda more palatable to people who wouldn’t dream of dancing to the tune of more overtly hard right parties.\nLikewise the nomination and election of Jeremy Corbyn can, to a large extent, be laid at the feet of the Green Party. There can’t be many Greens who haven’t noticed just how many of our clothes have recently been stolen by Corbyn’s party. And many of us are happy to be standing here in our underwear, glad that so many of our policies have been subsumed into the Labour manifesto. The sincerest form of flattery and all that.\nBut it has to be remembered that the rise of Green membership and our increasing success in both national and local elections is arguably a major driving force behind Labour’s newly rediscovered left wing credentials and a strong Green vote will help them keep that focus.\nVoting for parties that may not be mainstream, and may not have a chance of winning is not a wasted vote. Even less so in constituencies where the seat is safer than a Roy Chubby Brown joke at a UKIP convention. A vote for the party that more closely reflects your views has a demonstrable impact on those do so to a lesser extent.\nIn the case of Labour, voting for them in constituencies they can’t win may not just prevent other parties from doing so, it also reinforces the status quo of a de facto two party state and removes Labour’s incentive to join an alliance or support electoral reform if, as is still being predicted, they don’t have a majority on June 9th.\nEven if Labour were to win, there’s a very good chance that Corbyn could be unseated early on in his reign, by a parliamentary party who still don’t wholeheartedly support him. Without the threat of other left wing alternatives looking over their shoulders, it’s entirely possible that Labour will drift back to the same Tory-lite, neoliberalism that they were so conformable with last time.\nSo unless you have a realistic opportunity of a tactical vote in your constituency, just voting for the ‘other guy’ (or gal) won’t send any sort of message other than a validation of entrenched positions.\nIf you’re not going to see real change this time around. If your vote is only going to be lost in a sea of others who voted forlornly for the a close second, or the next best thing, use it to support those who will affect real change in the longer term by holding toes to the fire in the meantime.",

Elections after this one are most likely to be associated with the new Unitary Authority which will be formed in Oxfordshire, although currently exactly what form that will take is unclear.\nThe option preferred by the Greens is one of 2 unitaries formed from Cherwell District, West Oxfordshire District and The City Councils with a second one formed around South Oxon and the Vale plus West Berkshire. We feel that would keep decision making as local as possible as well as ensuring that councillors don’t become too remote from the people they represent. The County Council Cabinet recently voted to push forward their preferred option of one huge council across the whole of the County, while the City Council are proposing they form their own Unitary Council by absorbing areas around them such as Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke. I would certainly strongly oppose that, as, I believe, would most of the residents in those areas!\nThe outcome of all these options could largely be driven by those people elected to the County Council tomorrow, so not only is it important to vote because it may be your last opportunity, it’s also doubly important that you get a councillor who is going to represent your views on what your future council may look like.\nOf course my advice is to vote Green at least in areas where you already have a Green Councillor such as the two new Divisions in Kidlington which make up nearly 80% of the area I currently represent on the County Council. As I can’t be in 2 places at once I have decided to stand in the new East Division because I am involved in several ongoing issues there, Not least the proposed football stadium and the huge Oxford North development. But my fellow Green Councillor Fiona Mawson is standing in the other part, now called Kidlington West even though 2 thirds of it comprises Yarnton and Begbroke. As the only candidate in this election that actually lives in that new division, I’m hopeful that she will get a good reception from voters.\nto show Green and Conservative representation\nCurrently the whole of the Kidlington East area is represented by me as the County Councillor and by me, Fiona and Linda Ward as District councillors. I’d like to think we’ve done a good job of representing the everyone there, we all certainly work hard to achieve that, so I hope I will receive your support in the East whilst Fiona is elected to replace me in the West.\nIt’s a rather complicated scenario , especially given that the whole set up is likely to change in 2 or 3 years so neither of us are likely to see out a full term as County Councillors, but in the meantime it’s important that both areas keep consistent Green representation so that work I and Fiona have started on things like ensuring development proposals are beneficial to the area can continue into the next few years, along with our input into the re-shaping of local government over the next 2 years.\nHowever you vote (and I hope it will be Green) do make sure you vote.

Claiming, as they always do, that they have put ‘record’ levels of funding into education (as they also claim for health and so many other important services). But the devil is in the detail, with funding per pupil actually falling as class sizes increase.\nRegardless of claims to the contrary in their cobbled-together, un-costed manifesto, there are more cuts to come. But you don’t have to take my word for it, just look at the information available on the schools cuts website\nThese bare facts come from the people who know what’s happening to our schools. The teachers at the sharp end of the Conservative agenda. While these backward looking politicians wax lyrical about the good old grammar school days, our schools are being run into the ground and sold off to private companies to asset strip for a quick buck or two.\nThis needs to stop now. Education is too important to be undersold, under-funded, undermined and treated as an optional extra in one of the richest economies in the world.\nRead what The Green Party would do about education in government and then read below what you can expect from another 5 years of Tory rule.

The river itself is not insubstantial, being deep enough in some areas to swim in, although these days you’d be brave to risk it given the level of E coli and other nasties lurking in its once crystal clear depths.\nI spoke to brilliant local councillor Genny Early about the history of the river that she’s lived near for the past 30 years and the tale was not a happy one. Where once you could look out from the local footbridge at fish swimming amongst the river weeds and watch local dogs play happily in the waters, we now have a soupy grey clag, virtually devoid of life and reputedly toxic to everyone including our canine companions.\nThe cause is toxic dumping from up to 9 different local sewage works, given effective carte blanche by the Conservative government to use this river, and others in the area, as an open sewer to enable companies like Thames Water to pay out record dividends to investors whilst doing next to nothing to fix inadequate infrastructure.\nThis is the starkest example of how privatisation has failed us all with greedy and cynical corporations grabbing every opportunity to make obscene amounts of money by (in this case) quite literally shitting on local communities.\nI made a video with Genny showing just how bad things have got in this area, in sickening contrast to the beautiful local landscape. You can watch it by clicking here.\nWe simply can’t allow this situation to continue and only the Greens have the real solution to take privatised utilities back into public control where they belong. Water is quite literally an essential for life on this planet. If we’ve reached the point where that is simply a commodity to be bartered between corporations on the open market we really have reached the bottom of a very murky barrel.\nGreens would take water and other essential public utilities and services back into public control as the only way to deal with this obscene failure of duty to keep our waterways and rivers clean and accessible for wildlife and recreation. Other parties are suggesting half way houses of fines and extra taxation. None of that will work in an industry that simply doesn’t care any more.\nWe need radical solutions to these unprecedented outcomes and only the Green Party has a vision bold enough to deliver those.",

They used the City Council’s claims of ‘unmet housing need’ as an excuse to facilitate investment and development opportunities for the university and other large landowners.\nWe begged the council to take a step back from their plans in view of the fact that the City hadn’t published a local plan proving their ‘unmet need’ This would have been a perfect justification, but they refused. So outrageously revisionist to claim it was all Labour’s fault!\nBut this statement in the Oxford Times from the City Council’s Labour leader Susan Brown does place their cards firmly on the table. She would rather continue to focus on economic and business development than provide affordable accommodation for their own needs.\nThere are multiple sites within the boundaries of the city that could be used for medium to high density housing to solve at least the immediate problems for housing the the city centre and in East Oxford. At least 4 of those site are slated for development, predominantly for business use.\nIt’s plain that the council has repeatedly and recklessly pursued economic development instead of housing under the leadership of Bob Price and the new Labour leader intends for this to continue.\nNow their new leader has made it clear that her intention (and presumably Labour’s) is to push that envelope even further. Increase business development in the city (even though unemployment there is virtually zero) and press district councils to plough up their green spaces and destroy natural habitat to build houses to fulfil their needs.\nPresumably Ms Brown is also happy to see the city export it’s obscenely high levels of pollution and appalling air quality into the green areas around her ever expanding empire like some post-apocalyptic behemoth, consuming everyone and everything in its path.\nThat’s not a vision of sustainability or quality of life I see as particularly attractive for anyone.\nYes we need to build houses, but they need to be the right houses in the right places. If Oxford city want to deal with their own housing crisis (assuming that is proven in their own yet to be completed local plan) then the right place for housing is within their own confines. At least it is before the expect other areas to cover their backsides!\nIt was good to see Labour members on Cherwell District Council supporting campaigners in defending our precious green belt, but they really do need to have a word with their colleagues on the city council and get them to set their own house in order, literally!",

Not in terms of respect for his work, but more in quiet admiration for how he has managed to stay in a post that he is so singly unsuited to for so long.\nFrom the early days of being caught on tape plotting his dastardly revenge on Rupert Murdoch, through to the incompetent and catastrophic underselling of Royal Mail to city investors based on his quaint belief in the ‘gentlemen’s agreement’, this man has shown that he is about as qualified to be a Minister of State as he is to be an international gymnast.\nI once had a great deal of respect for Dr Vince. I remember he was even touted before the last election as being a candidate for Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the improbable event of the LibDems winning outright. Yet since he took on his government position he’s demonstrated his complete lack of influence and grasp in almost every issue he’s been involved with.\nHe has, throughout his tenure, made scary noises about what he’d do to the banks if they didn’t straighten up and fly right. Yet whenever they are found up to the armpits in the cookie jar, he fades quietly into the scenery like a withering wallflower, only to appear some time after the fact, sliding his glasses down his nose, staring myopically at the camera trying to look like he knows what he’s supposed to be talking about.\nEach time he promises to get tough next time, like the pub orator boasting about what he’ll do to anyone who crosses him, just as long as he never has to follow up his words with actions. And by the same token he does very little, if anything, to back up his chest puffing and table thumping.\nI’m sure on a personal level he’s a lovely chap. He looks, after all, like everyone’s favourite cuddly uncle. But in terms of his day job, he has all the business acumen of a used teabag, the bark of a housefly, and the bite of a tortoise with gingivitis. In the face of an upcoming election, he really should be considering his retirement options.\nThe only reason I can think of that he is still in post now is because these qualities are exactly what his Conservative masters want in a minister for business. Someone who’ll make all the right noises, but ultimately stay out of their way and let them get on with filling their boots and those of their big corporate chums.\nWhile people like this are in the positions they are, it’s little wonder that we’ve seen no genuine bank reform since the crash. No prosecutions of bankers, who to any fair-minded person have been guilty of, at the very least, dishonesty and in all probability of fraud and deception, if not plain old daylight robbery.\nUntil we have a government who seriously wants to take these guys on, we’ll be living in an economic groundhog day, enjoying the odd bits of prosperity, in between stumping up yet more of our own cash to prop up the lavish lifestyles of city wide boys.\nIn the meantime I guess small businesses will need to think of alternative sources of funding for their next venture. People who are more honest and reliable than most of the banks. The Triads or the Mafia perhaps. I hear they have some very tempting offers you can’t refuse.",

He is also standing for a seat on Kidlington Parish Council in Exeter Ward.\nIn Kidlington West the Liberal Democrats will be standing candidates in two seats, including the one vacated by Alaric Rose who moved away from the area recently.\nNeither party will be standing candidates against each other in the district council elections and will be endorsing each other’s respective campaigns. All three candidates have pledged to work to forward the aims of both parties if some or all of them are elected.\nThey are campaigning for :\n- A stronger and more effective opposition to the Conservatives’ unhealthily large majority on Cherwell District Council;\n- Continued opposition to Cherwell DC’s plan to build 4,400 houses on the Green Belt in Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke to meet Oxford City’s housing needs.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_politics_page_12/content_450.html": "We were told the last election was all about Education – Education – Education. This one should be NHS – NHS – NHS.\nThe road to privatisation of the NHS has been a long one and began under the Conservatives in 1992 with the Private Finance Initiative. It’s a neat trick that enables huge amounts of debt to be moved off the national balance sheet whilst still expanding operational infrastructure.\nNew Labour saw it as something too good to be true, as it allowed them to build new hospitals, without borrowing more money or raising taxes. But like most things that seem too good to be true, it was. By the end of their tenure Labour had saddled the NHS with £80Bn in repayments on total capital assets worth around £11Bn, and we’re still paying for it now.\nThen along came the Conservatives again who just love to privatise things. Every time they’ve been in government they’ve privatised something. The trains, electricity, gas, BT, the post office – which they practically gave away.\nBut the Tories have a problem when it comes to the NHS. They can’t flat out privatise it, because that’s politically toxic.\nSo in 2012 – The year that Danny Boyle showed us in his spectacular Olympic opening ceremony what a glorious thing the NHS is – the Conservatives brought in the Health and Social Care Bill.\nA bill that many people didn’t even notice passing through parliament. But a bill that arguably affects all of us more than any other legislation in our lifetime. A bill based on the premise that the NHS was a poorly performing institution that needed reform and another £3Bn top down reorganisation that we’d been promised before the election wouldn’t happen. A bill that ignored the core values of the NHS and characterised it’s staff as a problem to be dealt with rather than it’s greatest asset. A bill that achieved the Tory Nirvana of laying the NHS open to private contractors, furthering their ideology that the state should not be responsible for providing public services.\nIt effectively legislated against free universal comprehensive healthcare and flung the door to privatisation wide open. And private health firms are falling over themselves to come inside.\nJeremy Hunt has just announced £780Million worth of private contracts to 11 firms, many of which have a chequered history. Many of them are also donors to the Tory Party. There are also plans in Staffordshire to privatise cancer care in a £700M contract and ‘End of life care’ worth another £500M\nIn a leaked confidential document it’s proposed that these contractors will be :\n“Given ‘discretion’ to design services they would like to deliver, slash spend per patient and propose the payment structures most beneficial to themselves”.\nIn that one clause we get a glimpse of how private companies will pervert the ethos of the NHS to their own end.\nFirst the add on services will be an extra cost. Then any new treatments, drugs or therapies will be extra\nIn effect we’ll end up with a RyanAir NHS – Your operation will be free, but they’ll charge you £500 for the bed and another fifty for using the toilet.\nThe government consistently claims the NHS budget is protected but in reality, it’s being forced to make cuts dressed up as efficiency savings of £15bn – £20bn by the end of this year. No wonder we’re losing services. And across the country, A&Es, maternity and other services are being closed, with thousands of jobs lost. Competitive tendering also fragments healthcare. Where patients are sent miles to access different care resources around the country based on contractor costs.\nI’m standing as Parliamentary candidate for the Green Party in Banbury, where people are rightfully worried about that fragmentation and the future of their beloved Horton General Hospital. Labour have already tried to close it once, and more recently the coalition began a reduction in the range of services offered there, with the removal of emergency abdominal surgery facilities. This has resulted in some patients being forced to make a 3 or 4 hour, 50 mile round trip to services at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Not only is this extremely inconvenient, it also potentially impairs patient outcome as additional stress is added to their situation.\nBanbury has a long history of returning Conservative MPs, but this time every voter in the constituency has to ask themselves the question – do I still want to have access to a fully free and fully funded NHS in 5 years time?\nIf the answer is yes you have to remember that, no matter how much you might like the Conservative candidate this time (and I’ll admit I like her too), a vote for Victoria Prentis will just make another Tory led government more of a reality. No matter how much she says she’ll fight for the Horton, she’ll be forced to follow her party’s privatisation agenda. Even if she votes against the whip she’ll be a lone voice in a government she helped to put into power.\nI want to see an end to all privatisation of the NHS and I believe the NHS should be brought back entirely into public ownership.\nThe Green Party supports the NHS re-instatement bill, we’d negotiate an exit from PFI and repeal the Health and Social Care Act. We’d also fight TTIP which could have a huge impact on the NHS. We believe that NHS staff deserve a fair deal and that they should be supported and valued rather than treated as a problem to be dealt with\nAneurin Bevan was once asked how long he thought the NHS would survive. He replied: “As long as there are folk left with the faith to fight for it.”\nEvery party is pledging to invest more money into the NHS but the Green Party won’t just invest cash, we’ll also invest our faith. We all have to show that faith now or by the end of the next parliament Danny Boyle’s proud Olympic love letter to our wonderful NHS could become it’s epitaph.",

These questions are strikingly familiar to anyone who was at the Public Inquiry into Cherwell District Council’s Local Plan Review earlier this year.\nAt the hearing, local campaigners called on Cherwell to delay any further work on the plan to build 4400 houses on prime Green Belt in Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke until the true figures of housing need in Oxford were known.\nCherwell’s local plan review is predicated on a perceived obligation to help meet Oxford City’s housing need. Campaigners against the plans have repeatedly argued that Oxford’s need cannot be quantified until their local plan has been agreed, approved and published. Something the City Council has been slow to progress.\nInstead, District councils have relied on guesswork and a ‘working assumption’ from the Oxfordshire Growth Board (OGB) based on figures in the 2014 Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA). A report that itself has been highly criticised since its publication.\nIn response, the City Council commissioned an update to the SHMA. This demonstrated that the original figures were over-estimates, a conclusion backed by follow up analysis from an independent planning consultant presented to the Cherwell hearing. Both the city and district councils, including Cherwell, have sought to ignore the implications of these reports, but the inconsistencies have not escaped the planning inspector. These include:\n- The fact that figures being used to underpin assumptions of need are now over 8 years old\n- That the 2018 SHMA points to a significantly lower housing need than that shown in the 2014 version and that these figures have not been incorporated into the City’s plan.\n- Inconsistencies in estimated housing capacities in the City’s plan and the ‘Growth Deal’ proposals\n- Suggestions of prescriptive planning policies that preclude development in numerous key areas\n- Concerns over double counting of homeless numbers where new households are ignored\n- Inappropriate market ‘uplifts’ producing around a 30% over-estimate of housing need\nIan Middleton, Cherwell District Council’s new Green councillor said\n“The inspector’s comments are a clear vindication of the position taken by groups opposed to Cherwell’s plans to devastate green spaces in South Cherwell on the basis of an assumed need that has been significantly inflated.\nDuring the public inquiry, Cherwell resolutely refused to listen to calls from myself and MP Layla Moran to delay their plans until the City’s need had been properly established. It’s now clear we were right and the need to suspend Cherwell’s local plan review, regardless of their planning inspector’s verdict, is even more urgent.\nThe assumptions on housing need used by the OGB have now been undermined by 2 independent studies, and a planning inspector. How much more evidence does the council need to admit that their proposals in Kidlington, Begbroke and Yarnton are misguided and woefully unsound?\nIt would be hugely irresponsible for a council to impose such sweeping and irreversible damage on local communities when they know that the data underpinning those plans is at best questionable and at worse completely wrong”\nThe planning inspector is expected to publish his response to the Cherwell Local plan review in the next few weeks.\nYou can see the full text of the planning inspector’s comments and questions on the city council plan here https://www.oxford.gov.uk/downloads/file/6397/ic1_-_inspectors_initial_questions_and_comments_to_occ",

The Banbury Phone Box Library is one such brilliant piece of local engagement which is now garnering international attention as BT looks towards chopping it off at the knees.\nThe red phone box is almost as iconic as the red bus as a national symbol of Britain around the world. You’d think if you were company who owns and operates these highly visible pieces of cultural capital you’d be only too pleased to see them being involved in well supported local campaigns that add value to a service that is perhaps not as loved as it once was.\nIn that context it seems daft to me that BT are hell bent on annoying small and large communities across the country by removing public call boxes where they’re valued for numerous reasons other than a quick natter on the phone. It’s even more self-defeating that they’re erasing some of the very symbols of Britishness that have helped them build a world class multi-national company.\nIt has to be said that the Town Council in Banbury share some of the potential blame if the box is removed, as they are refusing to adopt it (something that BT now allow for the princely sum of £1), if BT go ahead with plans to decommission the phone service in the box. Previously they struck a deal with BT to adopt the box and save the library and a local steel fabrication firm offered to fix permanent shelves in the box to house the books to assuage BT’s prior objections to the library service on health and safety grounds, as they believed the current shelving arrangements could be dangerous.\nBT now claims that it is uneconomic for them to continue to run the service anyway, even though I understand thousands of calls were made from it last year.\nThe under-story seems to be that BT want out of the call box game at any cost, and most of that cost will be borne by local communities using the boxes for a number of vital social services or simply to make a call when other options are not available to them.\nBanbury Town Council now say that they’re not prepared to adopt the box if it is then decommissioned by BT. Whilst I support taking a stance against the loss of the phone service, I think it would be a sad loss to the community of the box were to be removed as a result of the Town Council refusing to adopt the box itself.\nMoreover, If BT are claiming the box is loss making, I think it would be useful for them to provide the figures backing that up. It would at least give us an idea of the likely shortfall which could perhaps be covered in some other way.\nIt’s also crazy that BT are missing this as an opportunity for some very positive PR. It has to be said that they’re not universally loved as a company, so something like this, that is fairly minimal in cost terms, would seem to be a great way for them to connect with the community.\nGoing forward perhaps the government needs to bring in a legal requirement on telecoms companies like this to provide a certain number of public call points in an area. Just because most of us carry mobiles now, doesn’t mean that sometimes they might not fail at a vital time, or have been forgotten when they’re most needed. I know BT used to be obliged to seek permission from local or parish councils in order to remove a box, but it sounds like that requirement has now been watered down. In very rural areas mobile phone reception is also notoriously patchy. In those areas call boxes provide a vital service for emergency calls.\nIn terms of usage statistics, it might also be interesting to track the number of calls made against the minimum price of a call in a phone box, which I understand is now 60p. Perhaps BT need to be reminded of the law of supply and demand.\nIf you’re on Twitter you can follow and support the campaign to save the Banbury Phone Box Library by following the hashtag #SaveOurPhoneboxLibrary\nThe K 8 model telephone box is a very important part of the British identity and would love to see more of these models saved and refurbded in to an operational unit again instead of becoming green houses in back gardens.\nLikeLike\nThey are a real icon.

A tactical vote is where you vote for a party you may not agree entirely with, because they have a chance of beating the party you totally disagree with.\nSadly in Banbury there is no tactical vote, It’s very unlikely that the 100 year long Conservative majority can be overturned by any of the opposition parties.\nSo vote for what you believe in and for the party that has always represented your views. If you’re a Labour supporter, vote Labour. A Green, vote Green. Libdem, vote Libdem.

I had hoped that there would be funding for this, but there was some push back on this from the County Council due to shortage of money. I still don’t think that’s good enough and will be pursuing this more fully in the future.\nThe motion also said that updated surveys and maintenance programs, with maps of drainage and flood defences and associated repair responsibilities should be published regularly to help local groups and response agencies to maintain and monitor them.\nFinally I called on risk management agencies across the county to set up a cooperative task force, including the provision of a centralised contact point which can trigger an immediate, proportionate response to all emergency flooding events.

If it hadn’t been discussed at this meeting, it would have been another 5 months before it would have been heard and obviously we could be facing many more flood incidents before then.\nAs a councillor, I’ve been trying to help local residents deal with flooding in both my Parish and District council wards. It’s become apparent that there is no central co-ordination and no single contact point that can be called on to manage flooding at all levels. Smaller floods are often given a low priority by the relevant agencies and even the new guidance issued by the County and District councils doesn’t provide a timely response to these incidents.\nCherwell District Council recently resumed responsibility for flood defence in the region and as we also work closely with the county council we are in a unique position to take some leadership on this issue and improve responses to these distressing and costly incidents. This is even more important in areas like Yarnton and Begbroke which have been flooded recently and where the council has recently identified areas for development as part of the local plan review.\nCovering areas in tarmac and concrete is only going to increase the likelihood of flooding and we need to ensure that suitable and long lasting flood alleviation measures are included along with responsibility for maintenance.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_kdw/content_259.html": "I’ve stood in every local election since I joined the Green Party in 2012, but this one feels more special.\nHaving been involved in the recent campaign to try to persuade the District Council to think again about it’s review of the local plan, I feel I really have something extra to fight for in this election.\nI wrote a detailed response to the council plans to tear up large swathes of the green belt between Kidlington. Begbroke and Yarnton and plonk 4400 houses in the middle of an area with overloaded roads and infrastructure. A plan that would see the three communities amalgamated into one sprawling conurbation, created not to serve local affordable housing needs, but to supposedly provide housing for workers in the city, even though most of the jobs are based in the east.\nYou can read the full response here\nAs everyone involved knows the oft-touted claims that this will include so-called ‘affordable’ housing is laughable. Valuable green belt land will become ten times more valuable once it becomes ripe for development and the landowners and luxury house builders will stand to make a fortune.\nI along with several others were allowed a five minute representation to the councillors in the chamber, some of whom it was later reported couldn’t even be bothered to listen to those who had come to plead their case. One was even photographed using a mobile phone during the speeches!\nSeeing the lack of connectedness demonstrated by the predominately Conservative council enraged me more than I imagined it would. If you watch the video footage from the planning meeting a few weeks ago you can hear me heckling quite loudly throughout some of speeches from Barry Wood and Colin Clarke.\nNormally I wouldn’t do something like that. They deserve their time to speak just as I and the other campaigners had. But being the last to have their say (as Cllr Wood ensured he would be) they were able to simply brush aside the very salient points raised by protesters and other councillors.\nTory councillor after Tory councillor stood up and gave no logical reason why these plans should be forced through in the face of what everyone recognised was an historic level of opposition from the people in the district they represent.\nOver 1500 responses were given to the plans, nearly all of them objecting to this wanton and unnecessary destruction of our precious green belt. Yet the council seemed oblivious to them, to the cogent arguments put forward by speakers and even to the legal opinions that were presented by the two main campaigning groups.\nThe cavalier attitude of Barry Wood, who I’d previously challenged for seeming to pre-judge the outcome of the consultation, was amply demonstrated when he and his fellow councillors abdicated their responsibility to the people of Cherwell and threw their objections at the feet of the planning inspector.\nHis closing argument was that it was the inspector who would make the final decision not them, even though they were elected to represent us. As I suspected months ago, the council had already made its mind up, and the consultation was simply a box ticking exercise. The fate of our green spaces, our wildlife habitats, our clean air and the distinctiveness of our communities has been thrown into the lap of an outside agency because the Tories on the council didn’t have the guts or the inclination to properly consider the alternatives.\nSo I hope you’ll forgive me some heckling out of pure frustration at the lack of professionalism and respect for democracy being shown by these people.\nThat’s why I want to win this election. I want a guaranteed voice in that chamber so that I can represent the views of the people in Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke – an area that is so remote from that chamber, way up at the other end of the district that people like Barry Wood and Colin Clarke feel it’s safe to throw us all under the bus for the sake of expediency.\nIt’s also why the Green Party in Kidlington is working with the Liberal Democrats in this election to elect me in Kidlington East and Alaric Rose in Kidlington West. You can see our joint statement about that here.\nI hope you’ll give me and Alaric a chance to be a strong voice for you after May 3rd.\nYou can see the full video of the planning meeting (including the heckling) on the Cherwell District Council Website. You can see my speech to the chamber here.",

I thought it was worth covering a few of the comments made by the Conservative representative in more detail.\nThe programme featured a running topic on the amount of back rent owed to several councils in Oxfordshire and you can hear it here. This is not a problem unique to this county as so many councils now rely on commercial investment to make ends meet since central government no longer provide enough funding for even the basic services that we all rely on.\nThis problem is exacerbated by the fact that legislation requires local authorities to balance their budgets every year and prevents them from borrowing to cover any shortfalls. This leaves them in the position of trying to operate like private investors without having the same financial flexibility.\nWith many local authorities now heavily invested in commercial property they have all faced a huge shortfall in income from rents that have not been paid throughout the pandemic. To add insult to this injury, even though the Chancellor said he would provide “whatever it takes” to help local government, central government has excluded losses from commercial investments from it’s support payments to councils.\nThe need to balance the books each year results in councils being left with only 2 options when they have a shortfall in rents. Either they increase council tax (which can only be done up to certain limits without a costly referendum) or they cut services.\nthat’s going to be a pretty expensive chicken dinner for the residents of Cherwell!\nThis is what Cherwell District Council did in 2021 when they reported losses in the region of £1.6m against the Castle Quay shopping centre in Banbury. With similar losses predicted for the next financial year, this is likely to put the same pressures on the budget for the following year which will inevitably mean yet more cuts, along with additional charges like we’ve seen this year for things like garden waste collections.\nCommercial landlords would usually carry these sorts of shortfalls over a period of years, often borrowing to cover the gaps, and recover as much of the rent as they could over that time with deferral agreements with tenants. Ultimately some of the losses may have to be written off. But as explained above, councils can’t do this. So as long as these shortfalls are on the books, more cuts or tax increases are the only way to deal with the problem each year.\nIt was clear though from the interview Cllr Ilott really didn’t understand any of the mechanics of this, which is quite staggering considering his role on the council. When he was asked if he thought there should be a change in legislation that would allow councils to deal with these problems, he said he didn’t think so. Instead he chose to make childish personal comments about me and avoided answering the interviewer’s questions about how the council will recover these losses.\nit’s clear that they have no real vision for how to revitalise the development other than the idea that making it bigger will somehow make it better.\nHe did make mention of ‘working with tenants’ which of course is a good plan. As a retail consultant myself I’d always advocate such a move, but due to the limitations imposed on councils, this can only be done on a year by year basis. Any outstanding debts at the end of each year will need to be accounted for and action taken on increased taxation or services cuts.\nCllr Illot suggested that we look at things “in the round” and I agree we should do that. Unfortunately, time restraints on the programme prevented me from laying out the full details, but I’m happy to do so here :\n- Losses in the last financial year attributable to Castle Quay – £1.6m\n- Losses predicted in the next financial year due to Castle Quay – approx £1.6m\n- Rent owed to Cherwell District Council at this point – nearly £2m\n- Loss in value of Castle Quay shopping centre since the council took full ownership – over £30m (it’s now worth less than half what they paid for it 4 years ago)\n- Additional investment being ploughed into expanding the centre – £73m (underwritten by council tax payers)\n- Interest on the loans to finance all this (so far) – £2m+ per year\n- Cuts required to the entire council budget this year – £4.4m\nYes some of this can be blamed on the pandemic, but retail was already on the decline when the council took the frankly bizarre decision to buy the scheme, especially as it’s clear that they have no real vision for how to revitalise the development other than the idea that making it bigger will somehow make it better. That and Cllr Ilott’s head in the sand optimism seems to be the main strategy from our Conservative councillors.\nI don’t see that as good value for the council tax payers of Cherwell. Judging by Cllr Illott’s flippancy and lack of concern he seems to regard massive financial losses along with the associated financial impact on resident’s pockets as fine as long as he can get some chicken.\nI’d say that taking all that into account that’s going to be a pretty expensive chicken dinner for the residents of Cherwell!\nAnd let’s not forget that all this money is going into one town in Cherwell – Banbury. Meanwhile Bicester town centre’s retail area is being hollowed out due to the council’s planning decisions elsewhere, and the whole of the district – every single tax payer – is footing the bill for all this incompetence. As is often the case with Cherwell Council , the south of the district is left to fend for itself and pick up the tab. If I were a cynical soul I might suggest that this is because the majority of support for the councillors who agreed to this whole adventure comes from the north of the district.\nBut I think we should all be able to rely on decent fiscal management from our local councillors, no matter where we live. Sadly it seems clear to me that we can’t expect this as long as the Conservatives are in charge.\nIt’s about time the Tories got a proper grip on council finances and stopped playing chicken with all our money!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2014_12_02_nick-clegg-announces-bicester-to-become-a-new-100m-13000-home-garden-city/content_185.html": "The government announced plans today for a new ‘Garden City’ to be built on ex-MOD land on the outskirts of Bicester in Oxfordshire. The proposals will be backed by £100M of government funds and will include ‘sustainable’ transport infrastructure, green spaces and new local amenities.\nOn the face of it this could be a boost for Bicester, but I suspect the devil will be in the details.\nMuch of the announcement seems to cover projects that are already in planning or underway. The new railway station for example. There’s also some confusion over if this is to be a re-imagining of the much vaunted eco-village or an entirely new project.\nIt is encouraging however to see that the project is to be built on a brown field site.\nConfusingly, the definition of a ‘garden city’ is being left to the developer’s imaginations with the government saying it doesn’t want to “impose any definition of what garden cities are”. This could likely mean we’ll end up with another estate full of either ‘luxury homes’ that ordinary people can’t afford, or shoe-boxes crammed together to generate maximum profit. That would probably mean any aspirations to provide gardens and green space will go right out the window.\nIf Nick Clegg really wants this to be development different from all the other clone estates thrown up around the country, I’m afraid he’s going to have to nail his colours to some sort of mast and properly define his intentions. But that might prove more difficult than a glib press release full of utopian imagery.\nThere would also need to be a clear vision that the people living in this new ‘city’ will be contributing to the local economy and society as well as working in it. With a train station on the doorstep, such a development could easily become a dormitory for London commuters or a sink hole of buy-to-let properties.\nAffordability will be the key. If these homes are intended for people on middle and lower incomes, then I’d support the idea. But I suspect such values won’t be compatible with what Nick Clegg sees as a ‘garden city’.\nPersonally I’d like to see more genuine thinking along these lines, subject to the above caveats. But ultimately this may all just come to nothing.\nSo many of these big legacy projects either evaporate into the ether once they’ve generated enough headlines, or turn into something very different once the realities of cost, demand and political will begin to bite.\nThere’s a veritable tsunami of these grandiose announcements coming out from government at the moment though. Like the spurious claims for new spending on road infrastructures announced earlier this week, many of them are just old or existing projects being re-launched as new spend to give the impression of a go-ahead administration full of exciting possibilities for the future.\nAnyone would think there was an election round the corner!\nIan, I think you need to be clear that what Nick Clegg announced and what is happening are two entirely different things.\nWhat is actually happening is not a new “Garden City” or “Garden Town”. It is an announcement that the 10,000 new houses to be built in Bicester over the next 17 years will be supported by government money to fund infrastructure development and to act as seed corn for developers. In addition there will be a further 3,000 houses built from 2031 onwards (site to be determined).\nIt seems clear that the Tories have looked at their plans and realised that no developer is willing or capable of taking the eco-town development forward without significant financial assistance to pay for the inevitable Section 106 agreement requirements that the development would require. i.e. any developer would have to stump up the cost, up front, of the inevitable new schools, sewers, gas, electric, telecoms, sewage works, police station, post office, ambulance, fire service, doctors, dentists, hospitals, parks and play equipment, bus services, cycle paths, roads etc. that will be needed when you build housing on this scale.\n80% of the new housing will (and some of it has already started) be built on green field sites such as Bicester NW, Kingsmere and Langford. This is hardly “brownfield” development. Only 1,800 of the 13,000 houses will be on brownfield land, at the Bicester Depot at Graven Hill.\nThe infrastructure developments will include an additional motorway junction south of Junction 9 on the M40 with presumably a new access road to Bicester, possibly to cut off the corner and join the A41 to the motorway by bypassing Bicester. They are also likely to be including the cost of extending or renewing the sewage farm, because Thames Water has already announced that it will be running at full capacity once Kinsgmere phases 1 and 2 and the “eco town” Exemplar are completed.\nThere are also comments that say this will bring 21,500 new jobs to Bicester, although nothing about what sort of jobs or where they will be. Already we have planning applications in for a massive load of distribution warehouses as part of the “eco” development.\nIt’s hard to see how anything of Nick Clegg’s news can in any way be considered as good news for anyone who cares about the environment.\nWhat we actually had today was a load of political guff with no real environmental credentials, to mask the fact that a vast amount of taxpayer money will be needed to build 13,000 new houses in the wrong part of the country for people who don’t need them where they are.\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nThanks for providing more background Brian.\nI agree that there’s a lot more to this than meets the eye which is why I qualified my initial comments by saying ‘on the face of it’.\nI’ve been receiving more information all day about how the full deal breaks down and discussing some of the proposals with planners.\nThe fact that of the 13,000 houses, only 3000 will be new builds over and above schemes already under way is now fully apparent, and in that context, Mr Clegg has been caught trying to drag the wool over everyone’s eyes. I also wasn’t aware that some of these will be built on greenfield sites.\nMy comments above were made as an initial reaction to the announcement this morning when I was trying to look on the positive side for the people of Bicester.\nI am, of course, naturally sceptical of announcements like these made by the current administration, especially when they come so close to an election and as a prelude to the chancellors Autumn statement, when most people expect the longer term news on the economy to be less than encouraging.\nBut rather than looking for the downsides, I was trying to resist my natural suspicions and take the main theme of the announcement on face value.\nI suppose, based on past experience, I should have been less charitable!\nRest assured I’ll be working up a more detailed analysis of this announcement and the others we’ve heard on government spending this week, including those on flood defences. I’ll be publishing this on my website and hopefully in the wider public arena, and your comments will be very helpful as part of this process.\nThanks again for taking the time to respond to me.\nIan\nLikeLike",

Areas near the kerbside are heavily damaged making for an uncomfortable and dangerous ride for cyclists and other road users. Yet repeated requests to the council and reports on Fix My Street have gone unheeded.\nNow, in the wake of increased cycling as a result of the pandemic, cycle lane symbols have appeared on this road on top of the cracks and potholes, with no attempt to repair the long-standing degradation of the road surface.\nOther roads, such as the Bicester Road, have had painted cycle lanes on the main carriageway for some time, but there are also poorly maintained and often blocked by parked cars meaning cyclists have to face oncoming traffic to navigate them. This is particularly bad given that this road has a local school and is also subject to an air quality management area.\nBut I was gobsmacked when I saw the cycling symbol on Yarnton Road. This is a road that I regularly cycle down and it’s a real bone shaker. It’s no exaggeration to say that you have to hang on for dear life as you bounce along the road near the curbs, dodging potholes and cracks. It’s especially dangerous at night.\nThe road forms part of a national cycling route, but you’d never know it to look at the surface of the carriageway. It’s certainly not for the faint-hearted! I couldn’t believe they just slapped a cycle symbol on the road without any attention to its terrible condition.\nIt takes more than a pot of paint and a stencil to create a cycle path. The road surface has to be fit for riders if they are to be encouraged to use it. Even motorists complain about the state of this road. How does the council expect cyclists to cope as they rattle across these severely damaged and uneven surfaces? This is just pure tokenism!\nIt just goes to show how little the council knows or cares about the plight of cyclists in the county. If they really want to encourage more sustainable transport, especially post COVID, they have to take cyclists needs into proper account when carrying out road maintenance rather than literally just painting over the cracks!\nWe need more Green councillors on the county council to take these sorts of issue seriously and deliver real improvements for cyclists, pedestrians and other road users, rather than these half-hearted token gestures from a council devoid of real leadership and direction.",

I believe it is one of the most serious threats we have ever faced. Yet it’s a threat that many people haven’t even heard of.\nThis proposed agreement has implications on a national and global level, particularly the Investor-State Dispute Settlements clause which allows corporations and private companies to take legal action against governments if they pass laws that are regarded as restricting their ability to make profits.\nThis strikes directly at the heart of our democracy, whilst effectively handing over sovereignty of all signature countries to the whim Amongst other things, TTIP also has the potential to force this country to accept genetically modified organisms into our food supply.\nIt loosens banking regulations (as the more stringent US banking laws could be subject to the lighter laws in the UK) and it could threaten jobs as more companies will be able to base their operations in the USA where labour law, employee protection and health and safety are less strictly applied.\nTTIP could also have very serious implication for the NHS in terms of the penetration of public services by private companies. Indeed TTIP could very easily be used to prevent any future moves to stop the creeping privatisation of the NHS as this may be regarded as restrictive by corporations wanting a piece of the action.\nWhilst the Conservatives, Labour and the Libdems have all stated an ambition to ensure the NHS is excluded from TTIP, we have seen no guarantees on this from any quarter.\nMoreover the extremely secretive nature of the treaty and the way it is being negotiated on our behalf behind firmly closed doors, leads me to distrust the ability or even the will of some of our representatives to ensure such exclusions will be applied.\nThe fact that both Labour and the Conservatives have self evidently displayed an ambition to see large parts of the health service and social care hived off to private companies, amid a culture of marketisation and capitulation to private providers, leaves me with very little confidence in a positive outcome for our cherished NHS.\nThe Green Party is firmly committed to blocking TTIP where we are able to, and our MEPs have already expressed deep concern about what appears to be an unavoidable quiescence to this agreement.\nYou might like to read this article by Molly Scott Cato MEP, who was recently allowed into the inner sanctum where the treaty is being drafted. Although as you will see she was sworn to secrecy and was subject to extreme measures to prevent her from recording and/or reporting what she saw. This alone sounds some very loud alarm bells with me! http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/04/secrets-ttip-corporations-not-citizens-transatlantic-trade-deal\nIf I were to be elected, I would most fervently resist the inclusion of the UK within the TTIP treaty and I would also demand that the secret negotiations now being held in Brussels should be openly and frankly reported.\nHonest and open government is our only guarantee that those trusted to look after our interests do so diligently and effectively.",

You can find and comment on the original here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/eu-referendum-immigration_b_9322718.html\nSo here it is. After years of campaigning and complaining, manoeuvring and cajoling, half-truths and good old fashioned British pig-headedness, the moaning masses of middle England have finally got their referendum.\nI say ‘their’ referendum because this isn’t being staged at great expense for those of us who want to stay part of Europe. It’s not even for those who don’t really give a toss either way.\nIt’s certainly not for those more outward looking souls, who appreciate the many advantages of being a member of the European club. The easy movement between states (yes that does apply to us as well as all those annoying refugees and migrants) and the free transport of goods. Funding for urban and industrial renewal. Numerous environmental improvements to beaches, rivers and the countryside, including controls on things like GMOs. Human rights, animal rights, consumer rights. Cheaper phone charges and easier and cheaper travel and currency exchange. Social welfare protection and labour rights, and a panoply of other advantages that most people take for granted and will miss when they’re gone.\nNo, it’s a referendum for misguided and ill-informed little-Englanders, draped in Union flags, firm in the belief of two world wars and one world cup and certain the word ‘Great’ attached to Britain means something other than the first letter on a sticker they slap on the back of their booze cruise charabang, just to remind those envious foreigners that they were unlucky enough to be born on inferior soil.\nBut moreover, it’s a referendum for politicians who have been looking at continental Europe down the wrong end of the telescope for so long now, they just don’t realise how small this country has become on the world stage. A myopic concern about how much money we pay to Europe and a studied ignorance of the huge returns our EU membership generates.\nMost people who focus on our payment to Brussels like to remind us what else we could do with that money. Yet with a growing national debt, and stubbornly high deficit, any such savings would likely fall into the same black hole as most of the rest of our national finances. Either that or it would go towards servicing the country’s circa £50bn annual interest payments, paid in large part to European banks anyway.\nIt’s not 1975. The geo-political landscape has changed around us since the last time we decided if we wanted to be a part of Europe. Yes, back in the swinging 70s it was the ‘Common Market’, but by necessity and common interest it’s become more than that. Those advocating some kind of return to a simple trading relationship are ignoring both the reality of our reduced place in the world and the promiscuity of world markets.\nNeither is it 1938, even though Cameron’s Chamberlain moment was equally as hollow. Just like his pre-war counterpart, the agreement he reached in Brussels was peripheral and disposable, focussing as it did on the false polemic of immigration and border control.\nIt was a pantomime, with Donald Tusk and Angela Merkel as the ugly sisters to Cameron’s Cinderella. Shouts of “they’re behind you” were evident from the likes of UKIP and Front National pointing to the ‘hordes’ or ‘swarms’ or ‘bunches’ of ‘migrants’, ‘refugees’ or ‘immigrants’, depending on which description David Cameron and the BBC have alighted on this week.\nI totally agree that EU democratic and regulatory processes are in desperate need of reform, but these weren’t the points that Cameron argued. Driven by domestic pressures, piled on by a widening xenophobic rhetoric, he was pushed into a rushed and ill-conceived round of negotiations that resulted in him metaphorically claiming ‘peace in our time’ outside Number 10. It was a performance put on to give him a platform to launch the referendum that we all knew was coming, and the critic’s reviews weren’t great.\nSadly for him, us, and the rest of Europe, this was a missed opportunity that could have sparked a trans-national debate about the real future of the EU and brought about radical changes to shape it into something more even-handed and responsive to the needs of all member states.\nBut instead, Cameron wasted what could have been his real place in history for the sake of a thumbs up from the likes of Farage, Gove and Galloway whilst gaining little tangible return for the UK, save for some token restrictions on benefit payments to migrants who rarely claim them anyway.\nIn fact it’s recently been revealed that the UK government has no idea how much immigration costs us, nor how much migrants contribute to our economy. But let’s not let a little thing like lack of facts get in the way of a nicely staked out scapegoat.\nAnd while we’re on the subject of discrimination, we mustn’t forget those hard-pressed city bankers quaking in their handmade brogues, terrified that they may be penalised for being outside the Eurozone. That of course, amid the posturing about immigration, was the main concern for Cameron and his paymasters. Essentially he was in Brussels to fight for the right to discriminate against the poor whilst protecting the interests of the obscenely rich, although of course that wasn’t so eagerly reported.\nAnd there we have it. The crux of all this political, psychological and media-spun mendacity – Corporate interest. Insular businesses seeking to rid themselves of the European interference and regulation that keeps all the rest of us safer and better looked after. The refugee and migrant crises couldn’t have come at a better time for these vested interests to galvanise public opinion in favour of an out vote.\nOn this flimsiest of pretexts, and on evidence largely pulled out UKIP’s collective backside, we’re potentially going to launch ourselves into one of the biggest national disasters for several generations. The ‘Brexit’ silo mentality that is about as relevant in today’s globally connected society as statutes recorded on vellum.\nOne of the greatest achievements and advantages of the EU is freedom of movement between states. It’s a harbinger of a future globalised socio-economic system where borders and statehood will be irrelevant. One where the term ‘economic-migrant’ will no longer be a thinly veiled insult, just as it wasn’t when we and other nations economically migrated across the globe centuries ago, annexing and occupying entire countries as we went. In that context, and in view of the Tories much vaunted ‘on your bike’ ethos, I find it perplexing that we now seem to regard our attraction as place of opportunity as a bad thing.\nAnd while we’re on that subject, if I were a British migrant living on the continent I’d be feeling distinctly uncomfortable right now. Especially those who have lived there for longer than 15 years and are inexplicably denied the right to vote in a referendum that may well decide their future.\nThose whistling tunes in the dark about independent trade agreements with Europe and other global partners will soon find that our status as the 5th richest nation in the world is built on foundations largely stamped with a CE logo. Already Sterling has plummeted on the news that Boris is heading for the lifeboats.\nMuch of our apparent wealth is generated by the financial sector and supported by our membership of the EU. Who will want to trade with us as a small individual nation with a growing national debt and a dwindling economic base? No wonder the city was such a key part of Cameron’s negotiations.\nThe finance sector is pretty much all we have left. We don’t have anything else to trade. China and the USA know this and have already warned us that a UK outside the EU will be of much less interest to them. The US in particular sees our connection with Europe as a valuable conduit into EU financial markets.\nUncoupling ourselves from the EU will be a long, painful and essentially irreversible process. We won’t wake up one day and see bluebirds over the white cliffs and a land of milk and honey for all. It will take years of debate, legal dispute and the unpicking of labyrinthine systems of regulation woven into our own statutory frameworks. A drawn out and retrograde process, during which I believe we’ll slowly come to see the folly of our ways.\nAnd once we’ve closed our borders and thumbed our noses at one of the biggest trading blocs on the planet, it will be too late to realise that we’re now more of a Pekinese than a bulldog. An isle not so much sceptred as septic, poisoned by our own arrogance and bigotry, left entirely at the mercy of a broken political system where wealth goes one way, and protection is only there for those who can afford it.\nAs Britain shrivels into, at best, a tawdry tax haven in perpetual serfdom to a rich elite, we’ll come to the sad realisation that we’ve been sold a Jerusalem built on false promises and false flags. I wonder if border controls and apocryphal straight bananas will seem quite so important then.",

The Banbury Phone Box Library is one such brilliant piece of local engagement which is now garnering international attention as BT looks towards chopping it off at the knees.\nThe red phone box is almost as iconic as the red bus as a national symbol of Britain around the world. You’d think if you were company who owns and operates these highly visible pieces of cultural capital you’d be only too pleased to see them being involved in well supported local campaigns that add value to a service that is perhaps not as loved as it once was.\nIn that context it seems daft to me that BT are hell bent on annoying small and large communities across the country by removing public call boxes where they’re valued for numerous reasons other than a quick natter on the phone. It’s even more self-defeating that they’re erasing some of the very symbols of Britishness that have helped them build a world class multi-national company.\nIt has to be said that the Town Council in Banbury share some of the potential blame if the box is removed, as they are refusing to adopt it (something that BT now allow for the princely sum of £1), if BT go ahead with plans to decommission the phone service in the box. Previously they struck a deal with BT to adopt the box and save the library and a local steel fabrication firm offered to fix permanent shelves in the box to house the books to assuage BT’s prior objections to the library service on health and safety grounds, as they believed the current shelving arrangements could be dangerous.\nBT now claims that it is uneconomic for them to continue to run the service anyway, even though I understand thousands of calls were made from it last year.\nThe under-story seems to be that BT want out of the call box game at any cost, and most of that cost will be borne by local communities using the boxes for a number of vital social services or simply to make a call when other options are not available to them.\nBanbury Town Council now say that they’re not prepared to adopt the box if it is then decommissioned by BT. Whilst I support taking a stance against the loss of the phone service, I think it would be a sad loss to the community of the box were to be removed as a result of the Town Council refusing to adopt the box itself.\nMoreover, If BT are claiming the box is loss making, I think it would be useful for them to provide the figures backing that up. It would at least give us an idea of the likely shortfall which could perhaps be covered in some other way.\nIt’s also crazy that BT are missing this as an opportunity for some very positive PR. It has to be said that they’re not universally loved as a company, so something like this, that is fairly minimal in cost terms, would seem to be a great way for them to connect with the community.\nGoing forward perhaps the government needs to bring in a legal requirement on telecoms companies like this to provide a certain number of public call points in an area. Just because most of us carry mobiles now, doesn’t mean that sometimes they might not fail at a vital time, or have been forgotten when they’re most needed. I know BT used to be obliged to seek permission from local or parish councils in order to remove a box, but it sounds like that requirement has now been watered down. In very rural areas mobile phone reception is also notoriously patchy. In those areas call boxes provide a vital service for emergency calls.\nIn terms of usage statistics, it might also be interesting to track the number of calls made against the minimum price of a call in a phone box, which I understand is now 60p. Perhaps BT need to be reminded of the law of supply and demand.\nIf you’re on Twitter you can follow and support the campaign to save the Banbury Phone Box Library by following the hashtag #SaveOurPhoneboxLibrary",

But we’re used to tall orders. In the face of what seems like a deliberate policy of starving us of media attention in favour of far more ratings grabbing pint-swilling politico-celebs like Nigel Farage, we’re still garnering support from credible commentators and respected political analysts for both our economic and social justice proposals.\nFormer Citibank financial trader Gary Stevenson and host of the You Tube Channel Gary’s Economics has analysed the Green Party manifesto and classified it as the most credible and honest in real terms. In a recent video he confirmed that he would be voting Green because we are the only party to be offering a radical and workable alternative to the proposals from every other party.\nTrade Unionist and former General Secretary of the Labour Party Jennie Formby has also announced on Twitter that she would be voting Green in this election along with numerous other high profile political and cultural leaders such as George Monbiot. It’s also reported that more and more young people are turning to the Greens as a real alternative to the ping-pong politics of the past 50 years.\nAs a moderate Green myself I’ve always seen the Greens as a true alternative vote, neither left or right. The Green Party officially rejects the traditional left–right political spectrum, describing it as “something of an anachronism” and that perfectly fits with my view on the world.\nI’m standing as the Parliamentary Candidate for Bicester and Woodstock mainly because it’s my home constituency and the place I’ve made my home for 32 years. But above all that, it’s a place I’ve seen change drastically in that time with even more drastic changes in the pipeline. From the massive development plans in and around Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Bicester with large areas of greenbelt being decimated by ill-conceived local plans to proposals to armour plate 3500 acres of green fields and farmland for hugely unpopular solar farm project in the west. I’m concerned about what these things will do to the place I’ve called home for nearly half my life.\nThere’s obviously going to be a lot more to say on this election in the remaining 2 weeks, much of which I’ve not said so far due to dealing with my new responsibilities on Cherwell District Council after being appointed to the executive on the same night that the General Election was announced (great timing Rishi!). But I’ll be breaking my silence over the next 2 weeks.\nIn the meantime, doors are being knocked, leaflets are being delivered and pollsters are polling. There’s been a huge amount of speculation about who can win in this constituency and I’m not going to add to that with my own obviously biased opinions. But with a newly drawn boundary, every voter has the historic opportunity to vote in a brand new Westminster constituency for the first time where we could all buck the trends and help me and the Greens to show that any prediction in an unknown and untested area could be drastically inaccurate.\nCan I win? Who knows? Am I serious about my candidacy? Absolutely! But then as anyone who knows me and knows my work as a local councillor and activist would tell you, I never do things by half measures. We all know that the Tories are finished, at least for the immediate future. We don’t need to vote tactically on a local basis in this election because after 14 years of chaos the country has finally woken up and are about to consign the current administration to the political skip.\nThat gives every voter in this area new opportunities and new possibilities. You can vote with your heart and for what you believe in. If that’s a better future for you and your family, a fully funded NHS and social care system, public utilities returned to responsible public control (particular water and energy), a better standard of living for all, raising millions out of poverty and protecting climate and nature, voting Green really is the only alternative. Even if I don’t win the seat, a vote for me that would contribute to a large swing to the Greens nationally will strengthen our hand in influencing national politics for the better. It will also put money into the party coffers through Short Money to help us continue the fight for a better, fairer, greener world for you and you family and their families to come.\nI’ll do my best over the next couple of weeks to make my case for your precious vote in this election and I hope you will seriously consider giving me that vote on July 4th. You should shortly be receiving leaflets from me explaining my priorities. You can also browse this website which is being updated with local issues that I think will be important in the upcoming election. I will also be adding new topics in the next few days.

Lots to say on this, but as always happens with these things, a 10-minute interview gets condensed into a 10-second comment!\nOn the way back we passed several signs on field gates warning about how the area is under threat from the Oxford to Cambridge Expressway. As someone who’s been involved in the campaign to stop this ridiculous and unnecessary development I thought I’d add a few more comments by way of a video and also expand a bit on what the Green Party would do to protect our vital green spaces.\nThis is something I’ve been involved with for a number of years now, right across the county, trying to combat the epidemic of projects that want to destroy these areas in the name of profit and greed.\nYes we need housing, but it has to be the right housing in the right places. Building on green belt will never be viable in terms of affordable housing as the land is so expensive. Developers build in a set level of profitability, usually a staggering 20%! That means that removing protection from green spaces like these just increases the number of high value, unaffordable houses being built.\nNot only that, concreting over green spaces means they can no longer lock up the carbon that we need to reduce in our environment, and they also increase the likelihood of flooding as they can no longer absorb the increased level of rain we’re getting as the climate patterns shift.\nThe Conservatives back all these projects because they are there to help wealthy landowners, developers and investors make a fat profit out of our rural heritage. As your MP I would resist all these projects, just as I now resist them as a District and Parish Councillor.\nGreens CAN WIN\nAs we’ve just seen in Wallingford, where another Green councillor has just been elected to the county council, Greens CAN WIN and we WILL WIN if people get out and give us their vote. Even if I don’t win in Banbury, a significant increase in the Green vote there will send a strong message to government that we demand change. An increased Green vote will be a visible signal of that, whereas another ‘heroic defeat’ for the other parties will get lost in the usual fog of post-election reporting.\nNow more than ever we need a strong Green voice, for the environment, for our future and for our children’s future. Please vote Green on December 12th.",

They want to ensure that any houses that are built should be genuinely affordable and aimed at local need;\n- Strong opposition to the Conservative’s plans for an Oxford to Cambridge Expressway especially with regard to it’s environmental and air quality impacts;\n- An end to Conservative cuts to local services and their failure to maintain local roads, cycle paths and pavements, schools and health facilities.\nGreen candidate for Kidlington East, Ian Middleton, said: “At a local level our two parties still agree on most key issues and we hope to build on the successes of last year’s campaign for both of us.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_shop-local/content_141.html": "As a businessperson, a long time retailer, and now a retail commentator and journalist, one of the most difficult things for me to reconcile is my involvement in the promotion of consumerism.\nThat’s at odds with my more recent conviction that we can’t continue to squander the world’s finite resources on WANTS, whilst ignoring the NEEDS of most of the planet’s population.\nThe Green Party might be seen by some as an anti-capitalist movement. We are however a broad church with many facets. I was encouraged to become a candidate BECAUSE of my business experience rather than in spite of it, and I saw that as an encouraging aspect.\nI’ve run large companies, and I now run a small one. I’m probably something of a gamekeeper turned poacher. But I’ve seen both sides of this debate and come to realise that the idea of continual economic growth is indeed a myth. And one we have to stop believing before we run out of road.\nI was at the launch of a new book by Naomi Klein a few months ago. She makes some interesting points about the connections between environmental issues and the global economy. The basic tenet is that when resources and commodities are monetised on the kinds of scale they are now, the result is economic and environmental catastrophe. And we’re just getting a taste of that.\nThe direct impacts are of course climate change, which if you ascribe to that view, is starting to bring with it the kinds of drastic changes in weather patterns that we’ve seen in recent years.\nThese are all things we’re having to come to terms with now and they’re all traceable to global economic activity. They affect all our lives, not just personally, but in broader human and economic terms.\nI’m a vocal advocate of social enterprise, and believe that there are many big businesses out there that can be made to take a more ethical and responsible stance if we create the right conditions to encourage it. And happily for me there is already a growing movement within the more enlightened areas of the business world towards ethical business and sustainable capitalism.\nThat might sound like some thing of an oxymoron, but in many sectors of business now there’s a realisation dawning that if we continue to squeeze the pips of the economy, we’ll eventually run out of juice.\nAmidst calls from some people for a revolution against rampant capitalism, I see the future as more of an evolution towards a business ethos that views social justice and connection with local and national communities as an asset, rather than an inconvenience. I’m certainly not anti-capitalist, but I am anti-unfettered capitalism. I agree that the market should be allowed to decide some things. But I believe the state has the job of holding us all to account for our actions and tempering the excesses of marketisation to prevent it working against the common good.\nAnd it’s not just us greeny types taking up this mantra. Many key economists and business commentators are now having similar epiphanies about how business and consumption needs to be managed in a sustainable, responsible and accountable way, if we’re all going to avoid a backlash against the kinds of excesses and irresponsible business practices that became prevalent over the past 20 or 30 years.\nEssentially businesses need to grow up and take responsibility for the societies we’ve helped to create.\nI’ve recently become very interested in something now being called the circular economy, where consumption itself is fed back into the creation of new resources and products. This doesn’t just encompass recycling, but also upcycling and renewable energy as part of the manufacturing process, along with emergent technologies, social media, and the fourth economy, comprising enterprises that not only make a profit for business owners, but also put something back into the social economy.\nThat might all sound a bit hippy and tree-huggy, but it’s something that’s being taken very seriously now by many key figures in the business world. Most notably Bill Gates and Richard Branson. And with good reason.\nIf you can make money with clean conscience, look after your employees, business partners, suppliers, and most importantly the planet AND enjoy what you’re doing, what’s not to like?\nYou also get to sleep pretty well at night too\nSo I hope I can convince you that there is scope within a Green World for enterprise and innovation. Without the need for a constantly growing economy and an ever greater consumption of the worlds finite resources.\nWith the potential for over a million green jobs out there, and an ethical economy that has only scratched the surface of an emerging market, there are plenty of opportunities for business leaders and entrepreneurs in a future Green and pleasant land.",

Not in terms of respect for his work, but more in quiet admiration for how he has managed to stay in a post that he is so singly unsuited to for so long.\nFrom the early days of being caught on tape plotting his dastardly revenge on Rupert Murdoch, through to the incompetent and catastrophic underselling of Royal Mail to city investors based on his quaint belief in the ‘gentlemen’s agreement’, this man has shown that he is about as qualified to be a Minister of State as he is to be an international gymnast.\nI once had a great deal of respect for Dr Vince. I remember he was even touted before the last election as being a candidate for Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the improbable event of the LibDems winning outright. Yet since he took on his government position he’s demonstrated his complete lack of influence and grasp in almost every issue he’s been involved with.\nHe has, throughout his tenure, made scary noises about what he’d do to the banks if they didn’t straighten up and fly right. Yet whenever they are found up to the armpits in the cookie jar, he fades quietly into the scenery like a withering wallflower, only to appear some time after the fact, sliding his glasses down his nose, staring myopically at the camera trying to look like he knows what he’s supposed to be talking about.\nEach time he promises to get tough next time, like the pub orator boasting about what he’ll do to anyone who crosses him, just as long as he never has to follow up his words with actions. And by the same token he does very little, if anything, to back up his chest puffing and table thumping.\nI’m sure on a personal level he’s a lovely chap. He looks, after all, like everyone’s favourite cuddly uncle. But in terms of his day job, he has all the business acumen of a used teabag, the bark of a housefly, and the bite of a tortoise with gingivitis. In the face of an upcoming election, he really should be considering his retirement options.\nThe only reason I can think of that he is still in post now is because these qualities are exactly what his Conservative masters want in a minister for business. Someone who’ll make all the right noises, but ultimately stay out of their way and let them get on with filling their boots and those of their big corporate chums.\nWhile people like this are in the positions they are, it’s little wonder that we’ve seen no genuine bank reform since the crash. No prosecutions of bankers, who to any fair-minded person have been guilty of, at the very least, dishonesty and in all probability of fraud and deception, if not plain old daylight robbery.\nUntil we have a government who seriously wants to take these guys on, we’ll be living in an economic groundhog day, enjoying the odd bits of prosperity, in between stumping up yet more of our own cash to prop up the lavish lifestyles of city wide boys.\nIn the meantime I guess small businesses will need to think of alternative sources of funding for their next venture. People who are more honest and reliable than most of the banks. The Triads or the Mafia perhaps. I hear they have some very tempting offers you can’t refuse.",

Apart from that being a little bit of personal history for me, it was also the start of a change that would unfold across the county over the next 3 years with Greens playing their part in the removal of Conservative control in every major local authority in Oxfordshire.\nIn 2019, Green colleagues in South Oxfordshire, along with the Lib Dems virtually swept the board, taking control of the District Council from a huge Conservative majority with 5 Greens being elected. Another Green was elected on the Vale of the White Horse Council. Then in 2021 Greens, Lib Dems and Labour took control of the County Council in a three way alliance with the Lib Dems and Greens forming a separate group which I now have the honour of being deputy leader of. Finally in 2022 we took joint control of West Oxfordshire District Council with the Lib Dems and Labour as well as gaining a further seat on CDC.\nThat left CDC as the only remaining Conservative controlled council albeit with a drastically reduced majority of only 2. The group that I and 2 Lib Dems formed in 2019 grew to 12 members by the end of the last municipal year meaning that from 2022 we became the official opposition with me as deputy leader of that group.\nThat’s a huge turnaround in only a few short years which feels even shorter given that for one of those years the elections were cancelled.\nNow with Cherwell as the last remaining bastion of Conservatism in the county, the prize is for the taking. As long as all the currently sitting opposition councillors hang on to their seats (which includes me) in the forthcoming elections, we have a good chance of taking control of CDC. We really need 4 extra seats to be flipped from the Conservatives and the way the country feels about them at the moment that is a very real possibility.\nGreens hope to take one more seat in Bicester where we’ve come a close second 2 years in a row, with the Lib Dems hopefully gaining 2 more. In Banbury there’s a chance that Labour will also gain an extra seat which would then give a 4 way Green/Lib Dem/Labour/Independent alliance a majority. Even if we only gain 2-3 seats the council will fall into no overall control which gives us much more leverage to ensure that areas like Kidlington get a better slice of the district pie.\nFor far too long Kidlington has been the poor relation in Cherwell with the majority of funding and investment going to Banbury – where the council has so far sunk £130M into a failing shopping centre – and Bicester – where they plan to spend £4.25M on upgrading a car park in an events space that no one really seems to want.\nThis year we have an opportunity to see real change and real progress in areas like Kidlington as well as the rest of the district. I hope voters will take that opportunity and we can finally have a clean sweep across the county leaving progressive, forward thinking authorities looking out for the best interests of current residents and those yet to come.\nThis year, more than ever in Cherwell, every vote will count. I won in 2019 with only 72 votes to spare, although last year Fiona Mawson won with a far more convincing majority of over 250. I hope I can emulate here but we can’t afford to be complacent. Everyone needs to use their vote to support the candidate most likely to win against the Toru candidate. In Kidlington East that’s me and I hope I can count on local support.\nLet’s not lose this chance to break the Tory stranglehold and make a better future for everyone. Make sure your vote really counts on May 4th!",

We have very ambitious plans and yes they will require a huge investment, both in terms of finance and resources.\nBut the existential threat to all of us from climate collapse demands urgent and ambitious action. We have 10 years to deal with these issues before we could be at a tipping point. If that happens, whatever we do won’t be enough https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/09/tipping-points-could-exacerbate-climate-crisis-scientists-fear\nWe have to push forward boldly now to make up for all those years when we did nothing. Where we simply paid lip service to green issues and ticked the environmentalism box without really meaning it.\nIt’s about more than encouraging solar panels and electric cars. We’re calling for a radical and fundamental re-alignment of our economy and society so that everything we do from now has climate action at its heart.\nI believe this is the only way we can ensure that future generations actually have a future.\nIf you want to protect that future for yourself, your children and their children, a vote for the Greens will send a strong message to government that we are serious about these issues.\nEven if you don’t think the Greens can win, a large swing to the Green Party will make the other parties sit up and take notice, like they have already done on so many other issues the Green party have campaigned on for decades.\nA Green vote can really make a difference, and we need to start seeing that difference in everything we do.\nIf not now, when?",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_public-ownership/content_158.html": "For me this has always been an absolute red line in terms of how our society is organised. I’ve never been opposed to the free market, even though in my experience in business the free bit is usually very far from free.\nBut there are certain services that society needs to function, and our economy is also dependent on. These are broadly health, education, social care, welfare, transport, police, fire services, the military and local infrastructure. I may have missed something but you get the gist.\nOver the past 10 years we know that these have all been the subject of cuts, and we’ve all seen the results. Not only has this left us impoverished as a nation, it’s also applied serious downward pressure on our productivity and our economy.\nIt’s analogous to the way that businesses are run when they start to get into trouble. First you cut the things you don’t really need, then the things you think you can do without but would like to have, then you cut they think you do need but try to work around, then things you actually need to operate like stock and equipment and then finally you realise you’ve removed your ability to actually do anything productive.\nWe’re pretty much at the end of that process now, and we need to fix it.\nAdditionally, we know that many of the things that were cut didn’t need to be cut. The Tories are never one to let a good crisis go to waste and used the financial crash as an excuse to decimate social services and welfare, dismantle the NHS and remove many of the support services for those in the greatest need.\nThis was driven more by ideology and the Tories obsession with reducing the deficit at all costs, even though this had very little discernible effect on the national debt. When productivity and the economy stall, you end up with less money coming into the coffers and you have to borrow more. That’s where we are now.\nThere should be a real end to the culture of austerity and public service cuts. We’re one of the richest nations in the world, with everyone paying their fair share we should be able to care for and protect all our citizens and keep the infrastructure we all rely on well maintained and working properly.\nThe cost of train fares for example is absolutely ludicrous at the moment and are some of the highest in Europe with some of the worst services being provided. This gives lie to the idea that privatisation makes things more efficient. That said, I know that nationalised services gained a bad reputation back in the old days, but I think that was more an issue of management culture. There’s no reason why things can’t be run completely in the public sector by staff and management who are properly motivated.\nOverall though there are vital services keep our economy moving, and they should be properly supported by government. I’d like to see all of them eventually brought back fully into public ownership and run collectively for the good of the people who rely on them on a zero-sum gain basis. If private businesses can make a profit out of these services now, there’s no reason why they can’t be revenue generating for society or provided at a reduced, subsidised cost where appropriate. It may even be possible to provide some of them for free! Hopefully much freer than the so-called free market!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_the-nhs/content_79.html": "The government’s management of the NHS has been disastrous. The cost of its increasing bureaucracy introduced in the ‘80’s runs into billions of pounds including fragmenting county health authorities’ only to establish them again recently. These changes, opposed by all the professional and union bodies, have been rushed through, ignoring all the results of “consultation”.\nThe process of privatisation was started by the Conservatives in the 90’s and then taken up with gusto by Labour culminating in an orgy of PFI deals where private companies were paid billions of public money in what amounts to a sale and lease back scheme that was a spectacularly bad deal for the tax payer, leaving us with assets worth around £11Bn that we’re paying back around £80Bn on for the next 20 years.\nWhen they regained power the Conservatives introduced the Health and Social Care Act in 2012 which effectively removed the government’s duty to provide a free, comprehensive health service and legislated that all services should be open to private tender. This threw the door to privatisation of the NHS wide open. We’re now faced with the prospect of yet anther re-organisation which, under the Conservatives, can only mean more misery for patients and workers alike.\nThe Conservatives have overseen contracts to private health providers worth billions. You only have to look at the amount of cronyism we have seen during the pandemic for proof of that. Many people argue that having private contractors within the NHS is not a problem. But no private company operates on a charitable basis. They are in it for profit, and if those services were being provided from within the NHS (as they used to be) that profit wouldn’t exist. The money would instead go towards providing more and better services.\nMany of these contracts have gone to companies with a chequered past in terms of performance, including Circle Health who walked away from the only privately run NHS hospital because there wasn’t enough profit in it. It also has to be noted that many of the firms being offered contracts are significant donors to the Conservative Party. Virgin are also now heavily involved with the NHS and Conservative health ministers regularly visit the USA to talk to health providers there.\nBoris Johnson of course claimed that there will be no post-Brexit sell-off of the NHS to American health companies, but he would say that wouldn’t he? The NHS is one of the last public service institutions in this country, employing millions of people and potentially worth billions to private investors. As we’ve seen in the USA, there’s plenty of money in misery and people are prepared to sell everything they have to be without pain or maybe live a few years longer.\nNow the UK has left the EU, there will be even more incentive for the government to sell portions of the health service to private US firms as we will be so desperate for foreign trade. It’s well known that these US firms are keen to get their hands on the NHS as one of the last remaining publicly owned assets, but they will only be interested in the lucrative areas. Indeed the current head of NHS England Simon Stevens used to work for one of the largest private health providers in the USA.\nThe Green Party is the only party to propose decentralised healthcare responsibility devolved to local government, with national guidelines ensuring minimum service levels preventing post code lotteries.\nGreen MP Caroline Lucas has been instrumental in bringing in the NHS reinstatement bill which seeks to end all privatisation and will bring the NHS fully back into public ownership.\nWe would re-negotiate PFI deals and end them early where we can, the reduce costs to the NHS and take back public assets being held by private companies.\nWe will always fight to keep the health service free, abolish prescription charges, re-introduce free eye tests and NHS dentistry treatment for all, and ensure NHS chiropody is widely available.\nWe are also calling for a radical overhaul and full funding for social care so that it is available to all. We should not be forcing our older population to plunder their life savings simply to have a safe place to live. This is especially important for future generations who may not have healthy pension pots and savings to call on in their later years.",

Elections after this one are most likely to be associated with the new Unitary Authority which will be formed in Oxfordshire, although currently exactly what form that will take is unclear.\nThe option preferred by the Greens is one of 2 unitaries formed from Cherwell District, West Oxfordshire District and The City Councils with a second one formed around South Oxon and the Vale plus West Berkshire. We feel that would keep decision making as local as possible as well as ensuring that councillors don’t become too remote from the people they represent. The County Council Cabinet recently voted to push forward their preferred option of one huge council across the whole of the County, while the City Council are proposing they form their own Unitary Council by absorbing areas around them such as Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke. I would certainly strongly oppose that, as, I believe, would most of the residents in those areas!\nThe outcome of all these options could largely be driven by those people elected to the County Council tomorrow, so not only is it important to vote because it may be your last opportunity, it’s also doubly important that you get a councillor who is going to represent your views on what your future council may look like.\nOf course my advice is to vote Green at least in areas where you already have a Green Councillor such as the two new Divisions in Kidlington which make up nearly 80% of the area I currently represent on the County Council. As I can’t be in 2 places at once I have decided to stand in the new East Division because I am involved in several ongoing issues there, Not least the proposed football stadium and the huge Oxford North development. But my fellow Green Councillor Fiona Mawson is standing in the other part, now called Kidlington West even though 2 thirds of it comprises Yarnton and Begbroke. As the only candidate in this election that actually lives in that new division, I’m hopeful that she will get a good reception from voters.\nto show Green and Conservative representation\nCurrently the whole of the Kidlington East area is represented by me as the County Councillor and by me, Fiona and Linda Ward as District councillors. I’d like to think we’ve done a good job of representing the everyone there, we all certainly work hard to achieve that, so I hope I will receive your support in the East whilst Fiona is elected to replace me in the West.\nIt’s a rather complicated scenario , especially given that the whole set up is likely to change in 2 or 3 years so neither of us are likely to see out a full term as County Councillors, but in the meantime it’s important that both areas keep consistent Green representation so that work I and Fiona have started on things like ensuring development proposals are beneficial to the area can continue into the next few years, along with our input into the re-shaping of local government over the next 2 years.\nHowever you vote (and I hope it will be Green) do make sure you vote. It may be the only chance you get to make a decision that affects you and your local community for the next few years.\nIf you need any further information from me or Fiona please let us know. We have knocked on a lot of doors over the past few months, so if we missed you we’d be happy to talk.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_page_2/content_12.html": "I’ve been involved in retail for as long as I can remember. From my first proper job as a Saturday boy in a menswear store in Lewisham through my days as a market trader in Camden Lock and Greenwich to being co-founder of a national high street chain that started with a small store in Oxford selling silver jewellery. and grew into a national chain trading in 6 of country’s major retail locations, including London’s prestigious Covent Garden.\nIn that time I saw almost as many ups as I did downs. I’ve half jokingly said that I spent 20 years building the business and then another 10 trying extricating it from the failing high street. Like so many other retailers who entered the high street during the boom years in the early 1990s, I fell foul of the simultaneous boom in commercial property development. So many new malls were opened in the 90s and early 2000s it was difficult to keep up and I opened stores in some of the most iconic examples such as the New Bullring in Birmingham and Bluewater in Kent.\nThe other boom at the time was in business rates, which along with rents skyrocketed through that period as institutional landlords, mostly backed by large pension funds, cashed in on the retail bubble ploughing millions into new shiny malls based on the emerging US model. It was great while it lasted and we all became caught up in the heady days of seemingly limitless opportunities. But we soon discovered there were limits.\nThe Financial crash in 2008 gave us all a pretty sharp reality check and things soon started to become far less buoyant and rents that had been agreed on the back of rude profit margins started to look far less tenable as turnovers started to fall.\nThere soon followed a series of frantic rounds of renegotiation with landlords who themselves were facing the prospect of huge hole in their new developments as retailers started to fall over with alarming regularity. In many cases we were able to come to mutual agreements to keep us trading at the shopping malls looking full, but the one thing that couldn’t be re-negotiated were business rates. Set as they were, by the central valuation office, and administered by local authorities, they were completely devoid of any chance of concession unless you had an understanding council. In my experience their understanding was rather limited, and after 5 years as a local councillor myself I now understand more about why that was.\nSo we were all caught in a perfect storm that only a few managed to emerge from. My business was one of the luckier ones as I managed to negotiate deals that gave us breathing space. But I could see the writing on the wall and it was telling me to get out of the high street and decamp to the internet where so many of our competitors were lurking. Thereby hangs another very long story.\nBut suffice to say I have an intimate understanding of the plight of the high street, in fact much more intimate than I would prefer. For that reason one of my personal priorities as a fresh faced new MP would be to push for a new system of business rates or local high street taxation. Other things like rent controls and use classes would also be high on the agenda, but none of this will be an easy fix for an industry in the doldrums after so many years in decline. But I know from my own experience that smaller independents are both the lifeblood of local high streets whilst also being the most vulnerable.\nIn terms of the dreaded business rates, I think I could take elements from the land tax approach of the Green party and add in some aspect of a local purchase tax as seen in the USA. Such a tax would be far more progressive and have more respect for the ability of businesses to pay such an additional tax. That would give a far greater connection between the local community, local authorities and the retailers themselves. If all retailers did well then they would all reap the benefits.\nSpeaking to local councillors and retailers about business rates reform\nI don’t really have the answer to full business rates reform, but I’ve been campaigning for a better system for over 10 years. I would advocate a situation where we involved existing high street retailers in the process of finding a solution. There have been past attempts at doing this, but very few, if any, involved small independent retailers. I think that was a mistake.\nThe Labour Party have boldly announced that they would scrap the current business rates system, but they haven’t said what they would replace it with. I’ve been here before many times, and both Labour and the Tories have frequently promised reform but never delivered on that. One of the biggest reason is that business rates are a virtually guaranteed income for government bringing in over £13bn a year. Even if the premises are empty, the landlord cops for the bill so it’s a win-win for Westminster. So any new system is likely to be just as iniquitous and damaging, especially to smaller operators.\nI think there is a way of developing a system of local high street taxation that could benefit all sides of the equation, including the consumer. Just scrapping the business rates system with no plan for what would replace it is not a solution, yet its the current proposal from the part that is most likely to form the next government in a few weeks. If I was in Westminster I’d hope to be able to provide a far better insight into the problems on the high street and how to engage with the people who face those problems every day.\nI’d like to see genuine consultation with high street stakeholders, including landlords and local councils, about the best way forwards. As a long term retailer, having moved from being a small business, through a larger expansion and back to being a ‘born again independent’, I’d like to be involved in that process. But I guess it remains to be seen what the outcome is on July 4th.\nI’ve just published a video I made during a recent visit to Bicester with some thoughts on how we can work towards a better system of high street business taxation and help to repair our broken high streets and you can watch that by clicking here.\nIf you’re a retailer or just someone who enjoys browsing physical shops, I’d suggest you vote for someone like me who has the experience to make that a viable possibility again. Retail is at the heart of every village, town and city and needs political support to make it vibrant again. Many politicians claim to have the answer but few of them have been on the inside of the industry. I think that needs to change. I’d like to change it.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_author_ianmiddleton99_page_9/content_447.html": "Cherwell District Council announced it’s budget last week detailing £4.4m in cuts and extra charges that it will be imposing on the residents of Cherwell as well as an increase in council tax.\nDuring the budget debate I raised my concerns that around a third of these cuts and charges were as a result of losses incurred over the past two years in Banbury\nIn a nutshell the centre is predicted to make a loss of around £1.6m in the 21/22 financial year after having made a similar loss in 20/21. On a broader scale, taking into account some small gains in the first 2 years the council owned the development, it will have racked up losses in the region of £2.5m by the end of the next financial year if the current predictions are correct. To close the gap left by that hole in the budget there have been additional service cuts with around a third of those in the forthcoming budget directly attributable to pressures from Castle Quay.\nYou may have seen some of this in the press this week in Oxford Mail and the Banbury Guardian\nI was also interviewed by BBC Radio Oxford, although my section was recorded and heavily edited, after which Cllr Tony Ilot ,the Lead Member for Financial Management & Governance on Cherwell District Council, was invited on the show live to respond. If we’d been on at the same time I might have pointed out that as the councillor responsible for this development it would have been more encouraging had he bothered to do his homework before coming on. At one point he seemed uncertain about how much the losses amounted to (he guessed at £1.3m and the interviewer had to correct him that it was £1.6m) and he also claimed that the £1.6m was a cumulative loss since the council took ownership. It’s not, it’s just the predicted loss for the forthcoming year on top of a similar one for the last year. You’d think the Lead Member for Financial Management & Governance might have been a little more cognisant of the situation given the scale of problem, but this lack of concern over important details is a familiar theme with Cherwell’s Conservatives.\nCllr Ilot also seemed quite laid back about the fact that the centre is now worth less than half what was paid for item having lost a whopping £30m in value. They are also currently spending even more than the original purchase price for the shopping centre on the canal side extension which, as a retail analyst myself, I think they are going to struggle to make a return on.\nYou can listen to the interview in full here\nThe council’s line on this has been that the losses at CQ have not directly resulted in an increase in the council tax. As that increase was already in the pipeline anyway that’s probably fair to say, but it also fair to say that if this white elephant wasn’t providing such a huge financial drag on the council’s resources, we may not have needed to increase the tax and we certainly wouldn’t have need many of the cuts in services.\nIt will be interesting to see how much support we get for the high street in Kidlington and the Exeter Close project in the light of all this. Certainly something we can point them to if they start penny-pinching on our project to support the eye-watering amounts of public money that’s being poured into one scheme in the far north of the district that we’re all footing the bill for.",

But we’re used to tall orders. In the face of what seems like a deliberate policy of starving us of media attention in favour of far more ratings grabbing pint-swilling politico-celebs like Nigel Farage, we’re still garnering support from credible commentators and respected political analysts for both our economic and social justice proposals.\nFormer Citibank financial trader Gary Stevenson and host of the You Tube Channel Gary’s Economics has analysed the Green Party manifesto and classified it as the most credible and honest in real terms. In a recent video he confirmed that he would be voting Green because we are the only party to be offering a radical and workable alternative to the proposals from every other party.\nTrade Unionist and former General Secretary of the Labour Party Jennie Formby has also announced on Twitter that she would be voting Green in this election along with numerous other high profile political and cultural leaders such as George Monbiot. It’s also reported that more and more young people are turning to the Greens as a real alternative to the ping-pong politics of the past 50 years.\nAs a moderate Green myself I’ve always seen the Greens as a true alternative vote, neither left or right. The Green Party officially rejects the traditional left–right political spectrum, describing it as “something of an anachronism” and that perfectly fits with my view on the world.\nI’m standing as the Parliamentary Candidate for Bicester and Woodstock mainly because it’s my home constituency and the place I’ve made my home for 32 years. But above all that, it’s a place I’ve seen change drastically in that time with even more drastic changes in the pipeline. From the massive development plans in and around Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Bicester with large areas of greenbelt being decimated by ill-conceived local plans to proposals to armour plate 3500 acres of green fields and farmland for hugely unpopular solar farm project in the west. I’m concerned about what these things will do to the place I’ve called home for nearly half my life.\nThere’s obviously going to be a lot more to say on this election in the remaining 2 weeks, much of which I’ve not said so far due to dealing with my new responsibilities on Cherwell District Council after being appointed to the executive on the same night that the General Election was announced (great timing Rishi!). But I’ll be breaking my silence over the next 2 weeks.\nIn the meantime, doors are being knocked, leaflets are being delivered and pollsters are polling. There’s been a huge amount of speculation about who can win in this constituency and I’m not going to add to that with my own obviously biased opinions. But with a newly drawn boundary, every voter has the historic opportunity to vote in a brand new Westminster constituency for the first time where we could all buck the trends and help me and the Greens to show that any prediction in an unknown and untested area could be drastically inaccurate.\nCan I win? Who knows? Am I serious about my candidacy? Absolutely! But then as anyone who knows me and knows my work as a local councillor and activist would tell you, I never do things by half measures. We all know that the Tories are finished, at least for the immediate future. We don’t need to vote tactically on a local basis in this election because after 14 years of chaos the country has finally woken up and are about to consign the current administration to the political skip.\nThat gives every voter in this area new opportunities and new possibilities. You can vote with your heart and for what you believe in. If that’s a better future for you and your family, a fully funded NHS and social care system, public utilities returned to responsible public control (particular water and energy), a better standard of living for all, raising millions out of poverty and protecting climate and nature, voting Green really is the only alternative. Even if I don’t win the seat, a vote for me that would contribute to a large swing to the Greens nationally will strengthen our hand in influencing national politics for the better. It will also put money into the party coffers through Short Money to help us continue the fight for a better, fairer, greener world for you and you family and their families to come.\nI’ll do my best over the next couple of weeks to make my case for your precious vote in this election and I hope you will seriously consider giving me that vote on July 4th. You should shortly be receiving leaflets from me explaining my priorities. You can also browse this website which is being updated with local issues that I think will be important in the upcoming election. I will also be adding new topics in the next few days. If you want hear me speak in the meantime, I was interviewed by Byline Times recently and was able to cover many topics that I think will be important to voters in this election. You can see that here.\nThere are also a number of hustings that you can attend to ask questions of me and the other candidates. These are :\n7.30pm – 24th June – Kidlington Methodist Church (forum on poverty)\n7.30pm – 25th June – St. Mary Magdelene Church, Park St, Woodstock\n7pm – 26th June – St Edburg Church Bicester\n6.30pm – 1st July – CPRE Country side and Environment hustings at Yarnton Village Hall\nI look forward to seeing as many people at those events as possible. If anyone would like to extend other invitations I am more than happy to come along. If any other events come up I will post them here and on my social media channels.\nRemember – this is the election where YOU get to vote FOR what YOU believe in, rather than AGAINST what you don’t.\nIf you’d like to get involved in my campaign please drop me a line at ian.middleton@greenoxford.com\nYou could also contribute to my joint fundraiser to help me and my 2 fellow North and West Oxfordshire candidates reach more voters in this campaign.

Everyone knew there was a safety net if they fell on hard times or became unable to work or look after themselves. These days that’s not so certain.\nWhilst it’s imperative to control welfare budgets, instigating arbitrary caps without dealing with the underlying causes of poverty is irrational, as is the imposition of benefits sanctions on people who have no other form of income.\nThe Green Party looks to explore the concept of a non-means tested national income, paid to everyone in place of our current benefits and basic tax allowances regimes, as a fairer way to ensure we all have enough money to live on whatever our circumstances.\nNot only would this be simpler to understand and easier to administer, it would act as a springboard rather than a cushion, lifting people out of the poverty trap where it makes more sense to live on handouts than move into paid employment.\nIt may seem a radical move, but in the face of a further squeeze on public finances, it could prove a more equitable solution than piling yet more pressure on to some of the most",

I made the case that with a national debt of £1.56 trillion – nearly half of which was added by our Conservative Chancellor during the tenure of the last government – a deficit of £83bn and annual interest payments of around £43bn, saving £50m from local authority spending was the equivalent of trying to pay your mortgage off by skipping breakfast once a year.\nWhilst these cuts will have virtually zero impact on the debt left to future generations, they will have a huge effect on those who depend on the front line services being withdrawn.

You can’t continue to support the cuts in public whilst apparently opposing them in private. As leader of the county council, the people of Oxfordshire deserve an unequivocal statement of your aims and allegiances.\nYou will no doubt be aware that Mr Cameron’s intervention in Oxford has now prompted requests from over 100 other councils to have a similar direct consultation with him over budget pressures. He also faces accusations of ministerial impropriety over his intervention with you.\nSo perhaps now would be a good time for hard-pressed council leaders such as yourself to make a firmer stand. You could set an example and refuse to pass what you have already told the PM is an impossible budget to balance in any morally defensible way.

If we want well funded local services, we should all be prepared to pay ‘our bit’ for them. Polls carried out by the Oxfordshire Green Party, The Oxford Mail and at your own consultation events have shown that people would be prepared to pay more council tax if they saw the money going to essential services.\nOf course this would require the government to square the circle of increasingly expensive public services without any rise in taxation.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2019_11_27_lets-get-brexit-done-away-with/content_102.html": "We should have a second referendum on Brexit with a properly informed and unbiased debate on all the issues surrounding our relationship with the EU.\nThis has to happen immediately after the election to allow parliament to get back to dealing with the serious challenges facing this country. We don’t need to get brexit done, we need to be done with it, one way or the other, and the only way to decide that is with a vote.\nThe Green Party is now the ONLY party offering this option as a main policy pledge.\nLabour would renegotiate a deal with Europe which we have to assume they would back in any confirmatory referendum (assuming they honour their pledge to give us one). That defines them as a leave backing party. Jeremy Corbyn’s claim that he would be neutral in that campaign shows a continuation of the lack of direction that Labour has had since this whole thing began. If they’re going to back Remain, then why negotiate another deal (assuming that’s even possible), they should be honest with the electorate and get off the fence!\nThe Libdems are standing on a platform of revoke without a second vote, which I regard as deeply undemocratic. We got ourselves into this position democratically, and we have to get out of it the same way. We can’t simply treat the first vote as if it didn’t happen. the claim that an electoral victory that would put them into government goes against their own argument (and the Green Party’s) that our electoral system is broken. Unless they had more than 50% of the electorate voting them into power, that would not be a mandate for a revoking Article 50. As most governments of recent years have been elected on less that 30%, they would not be able to claim they were taking the majority of the country with them.\nAs for the Tories, we know they would throw us off the cliff-edge with or without a deal, without a second thought, let alone a second referendum! Just so that Boris Johnson could claim that he’d “got Brexit done”. Even if that means the majority of the country that now appears to want to remain would get ‘done over’!\nDemocracy did not stop in 2016. We’ve seen over the past three and a half years that the easy Brexit we were told we would get after the referendum has proved anything but. Not only does this suggest that people may have changed their minds, it also means that the demographic of the country has changed and that new population, who will have to deal with the outcome of Brexit, should now get a say. Either way, we know a lot more now about the reality of Brexit than any of us did back in 2016. Surely we should all be able to re-assess our decisions based on this new information.\nMost polls now say the majority would vote to remain in the EU. I don’t know if that’s true, or if that’s how a second vote would pan out. But I think we should find out.\nI also think those who say the ‘will of the people’ is still to leave shouldn’t be scared to find out. If they’re right, the result of the vote will be the same. If they’re worried that it might not be, that suggests they know that the will of the people has changed, and they simply want to ignore that. That’s not democracy. That’s ignoring the will of the people!\nMy personal position is that a second vote should be binding (the first one wasn’t) and after that, the decision is final. If that decision is to leave, I will no longer challenge it. I would instead switch my focus to working towards mitigating the worst of the damage that I think will inevitably be done to the social and economic fabric of this country.\nLeaving the EU by any means will result in at least a decade of economic hardship for everyone, with the poorest in our society suffering the most.\nParliamentary time will be used up on dealing with the fallout from the severing of our membership of the EU rather than tackling urgent business, such as crumbling public services and climate change.\nBusinesses will suffer and investment will fall (except in the case of US drugs companies seeking to buy our NHS!).\nWe must not condemn our citizens to this fate without a fully informed confirmatory vote.",

As a result he bears some of the blame for a Conservative majority borne on the backs of the large number of older voters who didn’t see the 2 minutes it took to mark an X on a ballot sheet as so desperately uncool.\nThis time we have Ricky Gervais leaping into the fray with this tweet :\n“OK. I’m not telling you how to vote, but this is a fact. The only vote that will keep Theresa May out is a vote for @jeremycorbyn. Cheers”\nWhilst not quite so devoid of acumen as Brand’s ill-conceived advice, Ricky’s more well meaning call to action could be equally as dangerous.\nEssentially he IS telling his fans how to vote, and his less politically astute followers may not realise the pitfalls of such a binary choice.\nThe reality is that in many constituencies a vote for Corybn will not keep Theresa May out. The real fact is that it may do the exact opposite.\nSadly, even after repeated calls from other parties to enter into an ad-hoc alliance, Labour has resolutely refused to stand aside in any constituency. Whereas, for example, The Green Party has done so now in well over 30 seats.\nIn many of those seats the Libdems have a much better chance of winning than Labour. In some others the Greens or the SNP could have it in the bag. Voting Labour could then very well help the Tories by splitting the opposition.\nBy selling the idea that a vote for Labour is a vote against the Tories, no matter where you are, The Labour party and many of its supporters could be handing another victory to the Conservatives.\nI’m not usually an advocate of tactical voting, but needs must when the devil drives, and I see the devil behind the eyes of the Conservatives. But tactical voting has to be just that. It doesn’t simply mean voting Labour as the only alternative.\nUnder our broken electoral system the only place votes really count are in marginal constituencies. Until we get electoral reform and a system of proportional representation, that won’t change. And let’s not forget that Labour supports our first past the post system just as much as the Tories do.\nBut even in a safe seat your vote can make a real difference. In 2015 UKIP gave the Conservatives a real run for their money. Even though they only won one seat in Parliament they put the Tories on notice that they were there, close behind, snapping at their heels.\nThe result was the delivery of a referendum on EU membership and the subsequent lurch to the right that followed in the footsteps of Theresa May. The Conservative manifesto, such as it is, represents one of the most extreme right outlooks for the UK for many generations. It makes Margaret Thatcher’s vision look like a tie-dyed, rose tinted call to action for the love generation. It has even been compared to the BNP’s warped ideological ramblings from the 1980s, and not without cause.\nThis can be directly traced to UKIP’s influence and its validation of ideals that make a hard line, right wing agenda more palatable to people who wouldn’t dream of dancing to the tune of more overtly hard right parties.\nLikewise the nomination and election of Jeremy Corbyn can, to a large extent, be laid at the feet of the Green Party. There can’t be many Greens who haven’t noticed just how many of our clothes have recently been stolen by Corbyn’s party. And many of us are happy to be standing here in our underwear, glad that so many of our policies have been subsumed into the Labour manifesto. The sincerest form of flattery and all that.\nBut it has to be remembered that the rise of Green membership and our increasing success in both national and local elections is arguably a major driving force behind Labour’s newly rediscovered left wing credentials and a strong Green vote will help them keep that focus.\nVoting for parties that may not be mainstream, and may not have a chance of winning is not a wasted vote. Even less so in constituencies where the seat is safer than a Roy Chubby Brown joke at a UKIP convention. A vote for the party that more closely reflects your views has a demonstrable impact on those do so to a lesser extent.\nIn the case of Labour, voting for them in constituencies they can’t win may not just prevent other parties from doing so, it also reinforces the status quo of a de facto two party state and removes Labour’s incentive to join an alliance or support electoral reform if, as is still being predicted, they don’t have a majority on June 9th.\nEven if Labour were to win, there’s a very good chance that Corbyn could be unseated early on in his reign, by a parliamentary party who still don’t wholeheartedly support him. Without the threat of other left wing alternatives looking over their shoulders, it’s entirely possible that Labour will drift back to the same Tory-lite, neoliberalism that they were so conformable with last time.\nSo unless you have a realistic opportunity of a tactical vote in your constituency, just voting for the ‘other guy’ (or gal) won’t send any sort of message other than a validation of entrenched positions.\nIf you’re not going to see real change this time around. If your vote is only going to be lost in a sea of others who voted forlornly for the a close second, or the next best thing, use it to support those who will affect real change in the longer term by holding toes to the fire in the meantime.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_bicester_page_2/content_321.html": "As I said in the recent election debate on the BBC, in my opinion they shouldn’t.\nThere are many reasons it’s a bad idea, both from a business perspective and as part of local spending priorities.\nI’ve worked in retail nearly all my life. I built and ran a national chain of jewellery stores across the country and traded in several shopping centres, including some of the most prestigious in the country such as Bluewater in Kent and the new Bullring Centre in Birmingham. I write a regular column for Retail week Magazine and comment regularly in the national press on retail issues as well as offering consultancy services. One of my main focusses is independent retail and commercial property. So I know a little bit about what I’m talking about.\nCherwell District Council (CDC) leader Barry Wood claims that buying the Castle Quay Shopping Centre in Banbury is a good deal for the people of Cherwell. This decision was also backed by the Labour group on the council and their leader Sean Woodcock has assured me there’s a good business case for doing it. Unfortunately neither of them have been able to show it to me so far.\nTheir belief is that buying a commercial property like a shopping centre is a good idea as property will always rise in value. This may be the case for domestic property and some kinds of commercial premises, but not always with retail space.\nA Good Investment?\nThe argument for buying the scheme seems to be that if they hadn’t, the centre would have shut down. It has many long term empty units and is generally struggling to compete in an ever crowded marketplace. The council’s decision a few years ago to allow a new shopping park to open on the outskirts of Banbury haven’t helped its plight.\nIt’s extremely unlikely though that it would have closed down. Much more likely that it would have been offloaded by its pension investment owners to another investment company with more experience of running a shopping centre than some local councillors.\nMoreover, if the argument is that the centre was about to collapse, that doesn’t exactly make it an attractive investment for public money does it?\nThere have been some shopping centre failures in the past, but they are few and far between. But when they do go, they tend to go completely. That means an almost total loss for anyone unlucky enough to be the owner at the time. There will be some residual value in the land, but that’s unlikely to reflect the full price paid for the whole development.\nThere have been a growing number of retail failures in recent years with 650 collapses so far this year alone, and we’re not even half way through yet! Some of them very high profile and heavily leveraged operations. Others are busy negotiating partial closures and rent reductions with their landlords. Others are moving more into the online arena and abandoning physical retail space almost altogether.\nNone of this bodes well for an under-let, under-invested and down at heel shopping centre in a struggling town in North Oxfordshire.\nSo essentially CDC are gambling with public money against the odds. And it doesn’t end there.\nOther Costs\nAccording to Barry Wood the scheme is turning a profit at the moment, but as I’ve said previously, I’ve not seen evidence of that. I have seen a large number of long term voids in the centre, and with the potential for these to increase in number I fear the profitability may be marginal or likely to decline.\nThere will also be ongoing running costs for the centre and presumably additional investment to do whatever it is with the place that they feel will revitalise it. Again details on that are sketchy, but I think there’s some talk about dividing the larger units into smaller ones to attract independent retailers. Whilst I support that idea to some extent there are a lot of things to consider about that course of action.\nFirstly the cost of doing the work, which may include major re-modelling of the units due to, amongst other things, fire regulations. I’ve seen at least one shopping centre management come unstuck with similar plans due to rules on access to fire exit routes.\nHelping Smaller Retailers?\nSecondly smaller independents usually don’t have a huge budget for shopfitting, so there will be additional cost in partially fitting out the units, including new shopfronts etc to attract smaller operators and to ensure that their stores fit in with a modern shopping centre scheme.\nBusiness Rates\nThirdly there’s the loss of business rates on the empty units that are there now, and will most likely be there for a while. Considering the current climate in retail there’s also a good chance that voids could increase. At the moment the landlords will be paying rates on those premises even though they’re empty and a good deal of that money goes to CDC. With the council now being the landlords, they’re going to be paying the rates to themselves, effectively wiping out that income.\nDevaluation of the Asset\nFinally there’s the issue of valuation. Shopping developments are broadly valued on their rental potential. This is why landlords will leave units empty rather than let them out at a reduced rent. If the council’s plan is to lower the rent for smaller or other retailers, that will have a knock on effect on the value of those units and then on others when rent reviews come around. Other tenants now paying a higher rent will also push for a reduction when their leases come up for renewal or rent reviews are due or maybe even before.\nThe net effect of this would be to push down rents, not only in the centre but across the town, reducing loan to asset values across the board. In broad terms I’d welcome that. I’ve long argued that retail property values are hugely inflated. But in terms of the Council’s investment exposure in Castle Quay it’s a potentially dangerous situation, not only leading to a potential devaluation of the asset, but also any loans secured on it being partially called in.\nThere may be some balancing in terms of appreciation on the total asset value, but in the current climate and in a falling retail market, there a very good chance that the overall value of the scheme will fall relative to the amount the council has sunk into it, both as an initial investment and any further day to day expenditure.\nAll of this appears to have passed Cherwell Councillors and the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives by. They obviously have a very patchy understanding of how retail property works and the implications and pitfalls they are letting us all as council tax payers in for.\nMoreover there’s the question of if so much money should be focussed in the north of the district while ignoring other areas. Mr Wood commented in the Radio debate on Wednesday that he recognised that there were empty units in Pioneer Square in Bicester and that it was difficult to get them filled. Yet this doesn’t seem to have concerned him over the purchase of Castle Quay. Indeed, having set the precedent in Banbury I asked him during the debate if the council intended to buy Pioneer Square as well. He didn’t reply.\nOther Options\nA more sensible and prudent approach to the problems in both areas would be to work with the landlords rather than bailing them out with public money. Leave them with the risk whilst introducing local initiatives that help smaller retailers get a foothold and would also support the centre.\nThese could include rates reductions, which Barry Wood dismissed out of hand when I challenged him on it during the election debate. Neither he nor Sean Woodcock appeared to know that it has been within the gift of local councils to reduce rates on specific properties at their discretion for several years now.\nIf they wanted to provide smaller, more affordable space for independent retailers, they could lease units from the centres on a medium to long term basis, probably negotiating favourable terms with the landlords as a council will have a very good covenant. These could then be divided up (if required) and then sublet on flexible terms on reduced rents to retailers, although this would have to be agreed beforehand with the landlord for the same reasons discussed above concerning rental levels and valuations.\nThis would achieve the same aim of revitalising schemes both in Banbury and Bicester and would not involve the council in risking large amounts of public money. It would also mean that the bulk of the £60m they are now tying up in one area could be spread across the district.\nThis is the kind of strategic thinking we need, rather that the amateurish speculation of a council who seems to want to play at being shopkeepers with our money. This is why we need a more diverse representation on the council and councillors like me who will challenge these misguided moves before millions of pounds of desperately needed council funds are put at risk.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2015_11/content_132.html": "Dear Mr Hudspeth\nI was the Green Party Parliamentary Candidate for Banbury in May. I’ve met you a couple of times, the most recent being after the public meeting held in Banbury Town Hall as part of Oxfordshire County Council’s consultation process on the proposed additional £50m cuts to local services.\nSo it was with great interest that I read your correspondence with David Cameron, splashed across national headlines last week, which painted a clear picture of a Prime Minister with only a tenuous grasp on the realities of the demands he has made on local authorities such as Oxfordshire, where he also happens to be an MP.\nAt the meeting we briefly touched on the magnitude of the savings being demanded in the context of our national finances. I made the case that with a national debt of £1.56 trillion – nearly half of which was added by our Conservative Chancellor during the tenure of the last government – a deficit of £83bn and annual interest payments of around £43bn, saving £50m from local authority spending was the equivalent of trying to pay your mortgage off by skipping breakfast once a year.\nWhilst these cuts will have virtually zero impact on the debt left to future generations, they will have a huge effect on those who depend on the front line services being withdrawn. In particular on adult social care facilities and the children’s centres you plan to close which were amongst Mr Cameron’s principal concerns.\nYour reply to me was that we all had to “do our bit”. Well it seems from your response to the PM that ‘our bit’ has already been well and truly done.\nAs a local politician expected to deliver on these impossible polices, I’m sure you know that they are economically illiterate. Cuts to social care will impact on the health service as a whole. Cuts to support for young people have potential effects on social order. Cuts to public transport have serious implications for the workforce and people in isolated rural communities.\nI hope you’ll agree with me that there’s a point where cuts can no longer be the solution to balancing the books. Personally I think we’re already well beyond that line in the sand.\nSo I’m confused by your own position on government policy, given that you continue to publicly affirm that you share Mr Cameron’s blind faith in the blunt instrument of austerity as the answer to all our problems.\nYou’ve also made much of the statistic that 2% of the county’s population consumes 50% of the finances. I’m sure the old, the sick and infirm are a great drain on our public services, but in a modern society surely those people should expect to be looked after by those of us who are better able to do so.\nDo you feel perhaps that this 2% should be prepared to support the more lavish spending plans of our government in other spheres? The wasting of hundreds of billions to allow us to play our part in a thermonuclear Armageddon maybe. Or vanity transport projects that will allow people to get from London to Birmingham 15 minutes faster, when Oxfordshire County Council has just voted to cut local bus subsidies in the county.\nShould Oxfordshire pensioners be made fearful of putting their heating on this winter but be comforted as they shiver in the dark that they are ‘doing their bit’? All this while the government you support hands over £5.9bn to private oil and gas companies – a figure well over a thousand times greater than the cuts we are being asked to make – and slashes support for local renewable energy projects, meaning we will miss EU emissions reductions obligations and become the only G7 country to increase spending on fossil fuels.\nI really feel that you have to come down on one side of the fence or the other here. You can’t continue to support the cuts in public whilst apparently opposing them in private. As leader of the county council, the people of Oxfordshire deserve an unequivocal statement of your aims and allegiances.\nYou will no doubt be aware that Mr Cameron’s intervention in Oxford has now prompted requests from over 100 other councils to have a similar direct consultation with him over budget pressures. He also faces accusations of ministerial impropriety over his intervention with you.\nSo perhaps now would be a good time for hard-pressed council leaders such as yourself to make a firmer stand. You could set an example and refuse to pass what you have already told the PM is an impossible budget to balance in any morally defensible way. I know such actions come with potential repercussions, but if other council leaders followed your lead, how many mutinies could Westminster really handle? This could be your place in history calling!\nAlternatively you could join the drive for the abolition or raising of the now outdated 2% referendum threshold on council tax increases. As you hinted at in your letter to Mr Cameron, selling the family silver can only plug the gaps for so long. If we want well funded local services, we should all be prepared to pay ‘our bit’ for them. Polls carried out by the Oxfordshire Green Party, The Oxford Mail and at your own consultation events have shown that people would be prepared to pay more council tax if they saw the money going to essential services.\nOf course this would require the government to square the circle of increasingly expensive public services without any rise in taxation. But if they truly believe in localism, councils should surely be free to set their own local levy, unhindered by ideological thresholds dictated by central doctrine.\nI think the people of Oxfordshire would welcome your further engagement with the PM on their behalf and with local activists on these matters. I personally look forward to your thoughts on how best to capitalise on what has now become a national talking point, and how we can use this new focus in the best interests of Oxfordshire residents and other similarly concerned groups across the country.",

In fact I didn’t really expect to be doing this all again. For someone who isn’t a natural politician, I thought in 2015 that once in a lifetime was enough.\nBut we did it all again and I have to say I enjoyed most of it as much as I did last time.\nI will admit though that the come-down from this campaign has been much harder given that I failed to build on the vote achieved last time. In fact it was reduced, mainly by virtue of people believing they were voting for Jeremy Corbyn.\nI do have to say, as I said numerous times during the campaign, Labour had no hopes of winning in this constituency. The Labour candidate is also no supporter of Corbyn. In fact I support him more than he does!\nSo those previously loyal Green voters who switched this time to Labour really did nothing to help towards a Labour victory in Westminster and have arguably done some damage to the Greens.\nThe number of votes cast in a general election does count for each party. Not just in electoral terms but also in terms of how much government money is given to that party to continue to be part of the democratic process, something known as ‘short money’. We also have the deposits in each constituency, which at £500 a time is money that a party like the Greens, who don’t have large corporate backers, can ill afford to lose.\nOver the whole country the Green vote fell by roughly 50% and that was certainly the case in Banbury. As a result there may well be a lot less chances to vote Green next time we have an election, especially if that’s any time soon. Much of the funds generated in this election will go towards leaflets, deposits and other expenses. The reduction in ‘short money’ will be something of a blow too.\nSo your vote and your support for the Greens really matters, whether we win or not. Labour won’t face the loss of their deposits and, with hundreds of MP in Parliament and now hundreds of thousands of members, they won’t be short of funds either.\nPlease remember that next time you think about abandoning the party you say you otherwise support. We’re only here because of that support, and when it’s removed we quickly lose the ability to give you the choice to vote Green in the future.\nEvery one of those 1250 people who took the trouble to support a party they truly believe in and give me their precious vote yesterday has my personal thanks.\nI am of course disappointed that there weren’t more, especially as there were over twice that number just two years ago when our policies were just are relevant as they are now.\nThe dash to Labour was perhaps understandable in the context of Jeremy Corbyn’s popular appeal, but in a constituency like Banbury and vote for any of the progressive parties would have sent a message of hope and defiance just as effectively as one for Labour.\nSadly, in solidly safe seats like Banbury it’s very unlikely that one party will ever loosen the stranglehold being applied by The Conservatives, so we have to work together as the Greens have done in other constituencies.\nWhilst I congratulate Sean for achieving an impressive increase on his vote share, he was still some 12000 votes away from a win. All the time Labour and the Conservatives continue to reject the electoral reform proposed by Greens and the Libdems we’re very unlikely to see individual votes changing the outcome of elections like these.\nI’m very pleased on a national level to see The Conservatives on ever more shaky ground and I hope all the other opposition parties in Westminster will work together to thwart what will probably be a severe and extreme right coalition between the Tories and the DUP. I think we see now that this election was less about the good of the country and more about Theresa May clinging on to power at any cost.\nAs always, it was truly depressing to see the Conservative vote increase in number in a constituency that should be acutely aware of the damage they are likely to wreak on public services, the NHS and in particular the Horton Hospital which is now very likely to be completely downgraded or closed if the Conservatives maintain power.\nThanks to everyone who worked on my campaign and to the other candidates for a clean and well fought fight. I hope going forward, progressive parties in Banbury may work more closely together to achieve real social change and electoral reform, that way we can ensure every voice and every vote counts in the future.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_general-election_page_2/content_113.html": "I love a bit of comedy as much as the next person, but I do sometimes wish comedians would stay out of politics.\nIn 2015 Russell Brand advised young people not to vote as part of his personal philosophy of half-baked revolution. As a result he bears some of the blame for a Conservative majority borne on the backs of the large number of older voters who didn’t see the 2 minutes it took to mark an X on a ballot sheet as so desperately uncool.\nThis time we have Ricky Gervais leaping into the fray with this tweet :\n“OK. I’m not telling you how to vote, but this is a fact. The only vote that will keep Theresa May out is a vote for @jeremycorbyn. Cheers”\nWhilst not quite so devoid of acumen as Brand’s ill-conceived advice, Ricky’s more well meaning call to action could be equally as dangerous.\nEssentially he IS telling his fans how to vote, and his less politically astute followers may not realise the pitfalls of such a binary choice.\nThe reality is that in many constituencies a vote for Corybn will not keep Theresa May out. The real fact is that it may do the exact opposite.\nSadly, even after repeated calls from other parties to enter into an ad-hoc alliance, Labour has resolutely refused to stand aside in any constituency. Whereas, for example, The Green Party has done so now in well over 30 seats.\nIn many of those seats the Libdems have a much better chance of winning than Labour. In some others the Greens or the SNP could have it in the bag. Voting Labour could then very well help the Tories by splitting the opposition.\nBy selling the idea that a vote for Labour is a vote against the Tories, no matter where you are, The Labour party and many of its supporters could be handing another victory to the Conservatives.\nI’m not usually an advocate of tactical voting, but needs must when the devil drives, and I see the devil behind the eyes of the Conservatives. But tactical voting has to be just that. It doesn’t simply mean voting Labour as the only alternative.\nUnder our broken electoral system the only place votes really count are in marginal constituencies. Until we get electoral reform and a system of proportional representation, that won’t change. And let’s not forget that Labour supports our first past the post system just as much as the Tories do.\nBut even in a safe seat your vote can make a real difference. In 2015 UKIP gave the Conservatives a real run for their money. Even though they only won one seat in Parliament they put the Tories on notice that they were there, close behind, snapping at their heels.\nThe result was the delivery of a referendum on EU membership and the subsequent lurch to the right that followed in the footsteps of Theresa May. The Conservative manifesto, such as it is, represents one of the most extreme right outlooks for the UK for many generations. It makes Margaret Thatcher’s vision look like a tie-dyed, rose tinted call to action for the love generation. It has even been compared to the BNP’s warped ideological ramblings from the 1980s, and not without cause.\nThis can be directly traced to UKIP’s influence and its validation of ideals that make a hard line, right wing agenda more palatable to people who wouldn’t dream of dancing to the tune of more overtly hard right parties.\nLikewise the nomination and election of Jeremy Corbyn can, to a large extent, be laid at the feet of the Green Party. There can’t be many Greens who haven’t noticed just how many of our clothes have recently been stolen by Corbyn’s party. And many of us are happy to be standing here in our underwear, glad that so many of our policies have been subsumed into the Labour manifesto. The sincerest form of flattery and all that.\nBut it has to be remembered that the rise of Green membership and our increasing success in both national and local elections is arguably a major driving force behind Labour’s newly rediscovered left wing credentials and a strong Green vote will help them keep that focus.\nVoting for parties that may not be mainstream, and may not have a chance of winning is not a wasted vote. Even less so in constituencies where the seat is safer than a Roy Chubby Brown joke at a UKIP convention. A vote for the party that more closely reflects your views has a demonstrable impact on those do so to a lesser extent.\nIn the case of Labour, voting for them in constituencies they can’t win may not just prevent other parties from doing so, it also reinforces the status quo of a de facto two party state and removes Labour’s incentive to join an alliance or support electoral reform if, as is still being predicted, they don’t have a majority on June 9th.\nEven if Labour were to win, there’s a very good chance that Corbyn could be unseated early on in his reign, by a parliamentary party who still don’t wholeheartedly support him. Without the threat of other left wing alternatives looking over their shoulders, it’s entirely possible that Labour will drift back to the same Tory-lite, neoliberalism that they were so conformable with last time.\nSo unless you have a realistic opportunity of a tactical vote in your constituency, just voting for the ‘other guy’ (or gal) won’t send any sort of message other than a validation of entrenched positions.\nIf you’re not going to see real change this time around. If your vote is only going to be lost in a sea of others who voted forlornly for the a close second, or the next best thing, use it to support those who will affect real change in the longer term by holding toes to the fire in the meantime.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_page_23/content_472.html": "As a businessperson, a long time retailer, and now a retail commentator and journalist, one of the most difficult things for me to reconcile is my involvement in the promotion of consumerism.\nThat’s at odds with my more recent conviction that we can’t continue to squander the world’s finite resources on WANTS, whilst ignoring the NEEDS of most of the planet’s population.\nThe Green Party might be seen by some as an anti-capitalist movement. We are however a broad church with many facets. I was encouraged to become a candidate BECAUSE of my business experience rather than in spite of it, and I saw that as an encouraging aspect.\nI’ve run large companies, and I now run a small one. I’m probably something of a gamekeeper turned poacher. But I’ve seen both sides of this debate and come to realise that the idea of continual economic growth is indeed a myth. And one we have to stop believing before we run out of road.\nI was at the launch of a new book by Naomi Klein a few months ago. She makes some interesting points about the connections between environmental issues and the global economy. The basic tenet is that when resources and commodities are monetised on the kinds of scale they are now, the result is economic and environmental catastrophe. And we’re just getting a taste of that.\nThe direct impacts are of course climate change, which if you ascribe to that view, is starting to bring with it the kinds of drastic changes in weather patterns that we’ve seen in recent years.\nThese are all things we’re having to come to terms with now and they’re all traceable to global economic activity. They affect all our lives, not just personally, but in broader human and economic terms.\nI’m a vocal advocate of social enterprise, and believe that there are many big businesses out there that can be made to take a more ethical and responsible stance if we create the right conditions to encourage it. And happily for me there is already a growing movement within the more enlightened areas of the business world towards ethical business and sustainable capitalism.\nThat might sound like some thing of an oxymoron, but in many sectors of business now there’s a realisation dawning that if we continue to squeeze the pips of the economy, we’ll eventually run out of juice.\nAmidst calls from some people for a revolution against rampant capitalism, I see the future as more of an evolution towards a business ethos that views social justice and connection with local and national communities as an asset, rather than an inconvenience. I’m certainly not anti-capitalist, but I am anti-unfettered capitalism. I agree that the market should be allowed to decide some things. But I believe the state has the job of holding us all to account for our actions and tempering the excesses of marketisation to prevent it working against the common good.\nAnd it’s not just us greeny types taking up this mantra. Many key economists and business commentators are now having similar epiphanies about how business and consumption needs to be managed in a sustainable, responsible and accountable way, if we’re all going to avoid a backlash against the kinds of excesses and irresponsible business practices that became prevalent over the past 20 or 30 years.\nEssentially businesses need to grow up and take responsibility for the societies we’ve helped to create.\nI’ve recently become very interested in something now being called the circular economy, where consumption itself is fed back into the creation of new resources and products. This doesn’t just encompass recycling, but also upcycling and renewable energy as part of the manufacturing process, along with emergent technologies, social media, and the fourth economy, comprising enterprises that not only make a profit for business owners, but also put something back into the social economy.\nThat might all sound a bit hippy and tree-huggy, but it’s something that’s being taken very seriously now by many key figures in the business world. Most notably Bill Gates and Richard Branson. And with good reason.\nIf you can make money with clean conscience, look after your employees, business partners, suppliers, and most importantly the planet AND enjoy what you’re doing, what’s not to like?\nYou also get to sleep pretty well at night too\nSo I hope I can convince you that there is scope within a Green World for enterprise and innovation. Without the need for a constantly growing economy and an ever greater consumption of the worlds finite resources.\nWith the potential for over a million green jobs out there, and an ethical economy that has only scratched the surface of an emerging market, there are plenty of opportunities for business leaders and entrepreneurs in a future Green and pleasant land.",

The Tories still have a 12000 vote majority after Labour’s strongest performance in 2017. Even if you added together all the non-Tory votes in the 2017 election (including UKIP) the next nearest party (Labour) would still have been 8000 votes short of winning.\nSo you’re free to vote for what you believe in, in Banbury.\nThe first question I’ll answer with 10 reasons why voting Green is not a wasted vote\n1. The national vote share for the Greens will send a message to whomever is in government that we want to see real commitment to climate change issues.\n2. A big swing to the Greens will really shake up the other parties and make them realise this is serious!\n3. Greens have already influenced the national political landscape. Jeremy Corbyn wouldn’t be the leader of Labour if the Greens hadn’t pushed them to be more radical after the 2015 election.\n4. A big Green swing will get a lot of publicity making the point even more strongly. Just another second place for the next nearest party will get virtually no media coverage.\n5. Votes for the Greens help them get funding in the form of Short Money. In Banbury that money is worth several thousand pounds. Remember we don’t take funding from big businesses or institutions like the other parties do.\n6. Greens call ill-afford to lose the £500 deposit in any constituency. They only need to get 5% of the vote to do that. We got 4.6% in 2015 in Banbury. We only needed another 225 votes, so every vote counted.\n7. The number of votes any party gets in a GE determines how much coverage they get on national media, particularly for platforms like the BBC and ITV.\n8. We have been winning seats in Oxfordshire. We doubled our number of MEPs and gained 10 times as many council seats, with joint control of one District Council. More Green votes in all elections mean more people get into the habit of voting Green and we get more Green representatives in government.\n9. Voting Green gives encouragement to your local branch to make the effort each time to put up a candidate so you will always have the chance to vote Green.\n10. If you really care about the environment and the future for generations to come, you’ll be able to tell your children and grandchildren with a clear conscience that you voted for them in years to come. Voting with your heart is never a wasted vote!\nI hope this helps anyone who might be undecided about how they can vote in Banbury. And remember, if you’re a Green at heart, this is the time to vote with your heart. For the planet, for your children and for our future.\nIf not now, then when?",

Emergency measures call for committed and ambitious actions, not vague aspirations and get-out clauses. The climate takes no prisoners. It doesn’t care what we think is possible, it only responds to what is needed. We need to move faster and be more ambitious in our climate change mitigation measures and take into account the impact of all council policies on climate change\nMy amendment was supported by Labour and Independent members, but was blocked by the Conservatives (as usual).\nAs if to prove the point, in a later debate on the main modifications to the local plan partial review, campaigners from North Oxford Golf Club pleaded with the council to protect their 103-year-old club grounds from proposed development. This would include the destruction of a large number of trees. The Council’s proposals also call for the release of yet more green belt land and the virtual erasure of the previously sacrosanct ‘Kidlington Gap’.\nLabour and Libdem councillors opposed the motion along with me for the Greens. The proposals were agreed with all but one Conservative voting them through.\nYet again we see Cherwell’s Conservatives talking the talk on climate change, but when it comes to positive action they default to business as usual\nIt makes no sense to anyone other than Cherwell’s Tories to propose a measure to increase tree numbers in the district in one motion and then vote in the very same meeting to destroy hundreds of mature trees in the face of massive opposition from local residents and environmental campaigners.\nIt’s clear from this, and from the lack of any solid progress on the climate emergency proposals 6 months on from passing them, that Cherwell’s Conservatives simply want to box-tick the climate change issue, whilst pursuing broader policies on unnecessary growth that will be hugely damaging to the environment.",

This one should be NHS – NHS – NHS.\nThe road to privatisation of the NHS has been a long one and began under the Conservatives in 1992 with the Private Finance Initiative. It’s a neat trick that enables huge amounts of debt to be moved off the national balance sheet whilst still expanding operational infrastructure.\nNew Labour saw it as something too good to be true, as it allowed them to build new hospitals, without borrowing more money or raising taxes. But like most things that seem too good to be true, it was. By the end of their tenure Labour had saddled the NHS with £80Bn in repayments on total capital assets worth around £11Bn, and we’re still paying for it now.\nThen along came the Conservatives again who just love to privatise things. Every time they’ve been in government they’ve privatised something. The trains, electricity, gas, BT, the post office – which they practically gave away.\nBut the Tories have a problem when it comes to the NHS. They can’t flat out privatise it, because that’s politically toxic.\nSo in 2012 – The year that Danny Boyle showed us in his spectacular Olympic opening ceremony what a glorious thing the NHS is – the Conservatives brought in the Health and Social Care Bill.\nA bill that many people didn’t even notice passing through parliament. But a bill that arguably affects all of us more than any other legislation in our lifetime. A bill based on the premise that the NHS was a poorly performing institution that needed reform and another £3Bn top down reorganisation that we’d been promised before the election wouldn’t happen. A bill that ignored the core values of the NHS and characterised it’s staff as a problem to be dealt with rather than it’s greatest asset. A bill that achieved the Tory Nirvana of laying the NHS open to private contractors, furthering their ideology that the state should not be responsible for providing public services.\nIt effectively legislated against free universal comprehensive healthcare and flung the door to privatisation wide open. And private health firms are falling over themselves to come inside.\nJeremy Hunt has just announced £780Million worth of private contracts to 11 firms, many of which have a chequered history. Many of them are also donors to the Tory Party. There are also plans in Staffordshire to privatise cancer care in a £700M contract and ‘End of life care’ worth another £500M\nIn a leaked confidential document it’s proposed that these contractors will be :\n“Given ‘discretion’ to design services they would like to deliver, slash spend per patient and propose the payment structures most beneficial to themselves”.\nIn that one clause we get a glimpse of how private companies will pervert the ethos of the NHS to their own end.\nFirst the add on services will be an extra cost. Then any new treatments, drugs or therapies will be extra\nIn effect we’ll end up with a RyanAir NHS – Your operation will be free, but they’ll charge you £500 for the bed and another fifty for using the toilet.\nThe government consistently claims the NHS budget is protected but in reality, it’s being forced to make cuts dressed up as efficiency savings of £15bn – £20bn by the end of this year. No wonder we’re losing services. And across the country, A&Es, maternity and other services are being closed, with thousands of jobs lost. Competitive tendering also fragments healthcare. Where patients are sent miles to access different care resources around the country based on contractor costs.\nI’m standing as Parliamentary candidate for the Green Party in Banbury, where people are rightfully worried about that fragmentation and the future of their beloved Horton General Hospital. Labour have already tried to close it once, and more recently the coalition began a reduction in the range of services offered there, with the removal of emergency abdominal surgery facilities. This has resulted in some patients being forced to make a 3 or 4 hour, 50 mile round trip to services at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Not only is this extremely inconvenient, it also potentially impairs patient outcome as additional stress is added to their situation.\nBanbury has a long history of returning Conservative MPs, but this time every voter in the constituency has to ask themselves the question – do I still want to have access to a fully free and fully funded NHS in 5 years time?\nIf the answer is yes you have to remember that, no matter how much you might like the Conservative candidate this time (and I’ll admit I like her too), a vote for Victoria Prentis will just make another Tory led government more of a reality. No matter how much she says she’ll fight for the Horton, she’ll be forced to follow her party’s privatisation agenda. Even if she votes against the whip she’ll be a lone voice in a government she helped to put into power.\nI want to see an end to all privatisation of the NHS and I believe the NHS should be brought back entirely into public ownership.\nThe Green Party supports the NHS re-instatement bill, we’d negotiate an exit from PFI and repeal the Health and Social Care Act. We’d also fight TTIP which could have a huge impact on the NHS. We believe that NHS staff deserve a fair deal and that they should be supported and valued rather than treated as a problem to be dealt with\nAneurin Bevan was once asked how long he thought the NHS would survive. He replied: “As long as there are folk left with the faith to fight for it.”\nEvery party is pledging to invest more money into the NHS but the Green Party won’t just invest cash, we’ll also invest our faith. We all have to show that faith now or by the end of the next parliament Danny Boyle’s proud Olympic love letter to our wonderful NHS could become it’s epitaph.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_author_ianmiddleton99_page_22/content_488.html": "The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is a EU/USA treaty being negotiated in secret on our behalf. I believe it is one of the most serious threats we have ever faced. Yet it’s a threat that many people haven’t even heard of.\nThis proposed agreement has implications on a national and global level, particularly the Investor-State Dispute Settlements clause which allows corporations and private companies to take legal action against governments if they pass laws that are regarded as restricting their ability to make profits.\nThis strikes directly at the heart of our democracy, whilst effectively handing over sovereignty of all signature countries to the whim Amongst other things, TTIP also has the potential to force this country to accept genetically modified organisms into our food supply.\nIt loosens banking regulations (as the more stringent US banking laws could be subject to the lighter laws in the UK) and it could threaten jobs as more companies will be able to base their operations in the USA where labour law, employee protection and health and safety are less strictly applied.\nTTIP could also have very serious implication for the NHS in terms of the penetration of public services by private companies. Indeed TTIP could very easily be used to prevent any future moves to stop the creeping privatisation of the NHS as this may be regarded as restrictive by corporations wanting a piece of the action.\nWhilst the Conservatives, Labour and the Libdems have all stated an ambition to ensure the NHS is excluded from TTIP, we have seen no guarantees on this from any quarter.\nMoreover the extremely secretive nature of the treaty and the way it is being negotiated on our behalf behind firmly closed doors, leads me to distrust the ability or even the will of some of our representatives to ensure such exclusions will be applied.\nThe fact that both Labour and the Conservatives have self evidently displayed an ambition to see large parts of the health service and social care hived off to private companies, amid a culture of marketisation and capitulation to private providers, leaves me with very little confidence in a positive outcome for our cherished NHS.\nThe Green Party is firmly committed to blocking TTIP where we are able to, and our MEPs have already expressed deep concern about what appears to be an unavoidable quiescence to this agreement.\nYou might like to read this article by Molly Scott Cato MEP, who was recently allowed into the inner sanctum where the treaty is being drafted. Although as you will see she was sworn to secrecy and was subject to extreme measures to prevent her from recording and/or reporting what she saw. This alone sounds some very loud alarm bells with me! http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/04/secrets-ttip-corporations-not-citizens-transatlantic-trade-deal\nIf I were to be elected, I would most fervently resist the inclusion of the UK within the TTIP treaty and I would also demand that the secret negotiations now being held in Brussels should be openly and frankly reported.\nHonest and open government is our only guarantee that those trusted to look after our interests do so diligently and effectively.",

They’ve lost faith in democracy and I don’t blame them when the same party always wins!\nBut in this election there is the chance for change. I can win this vote in the county elections, as I did in 2019 in the district elections, and Fiona Mawson can win in the district again giving, us 2 Green councillors in the area. But we need everyone to get out there and make their mark.\nI’ve lived in Yarnton for 28 years (along with Fiona) and seen how uninterested our local councils are about what happens to our local villages. There’s no better example of this than the concreting over of our green belt, forced on us by the Conservative led District Council.\nTory councillors will tell you they tried to stop it, but they didn’t speak up at the Public Inquiry because they’re not allowed to defy their party leadership. As your Green councillor, we will work for you. Greens don’t answer to a party whip and we always put people before politics.\nI’ve been opposing the council’s development plans for 4 years and I intend to carry on fighting. Our legal challenge will be heard in June and I hope we’ll win. But whatever happens, we’ll need strong local councillors to look out for our interests on planning applications to ensure that developers deliver on infrastructure , flooding protection and health and education provision.\nBut we need everyone to get out and vote to make that happen. If people don’t vote the status quo usually wins. In Oxfordshire that usually means the Tories, but in recent years things have started to change. In 2019 the Greens went from 2 councillors in Oxfordshire to 12. That has really made a difference across the county and that’s palpable in areas like Kidlington where all of a sudden we’re seeing more investment.\nLabour voters might consider voting Green as the best way of removing the Tory stranglehold on our local government and helping to realise some of our shared social justice aims.\nIf you usually vote for another party, you can vote tactically this time, lending your vote to me and Fiona temporarily just for this election. Libdems should vote Green on this occasion as we’re working together as we have done for the past 3 years now. Labour voters might consider voting Green as the best way of removing the Tory stranglehold on our local government and helping to realise some of our shared social justice aims.\nVoting Conservative, or not voting at all, just sends a message to the ruling groups on both the County and the District that we’re all fine with what they’re doing to our areas. They won’t care if you don’t vote, especially if they don’t think you’d vote for them.\nNot voting is not a protest, it’s the epitome of an empty gesture and plays into the hands of the parties that always win. If you really want to protest then get out there and make your mark, and if possible do it for a party that has a chance of upsetting the applecart.\nIf you usually vote for another party, you can vote tactically this time\nIn Kidlington that’s the Green Party. We made the Conservatives sit up and take notice when we won in 2019 and if we do it again this year (twice!) they can’t fail to get the message that their own actions in these areas have consequences. And what’s more you get active, responsive and engaged councillors into the bargain. Just read a few of the endorsements from local residents for me below.\nPlease don’t waste your vote on Thursday. Use it, and use it to make a difference. Vote Green and see the difference your vote can really make!\nSome of the kind comments I’ve been able to include in my election addresses during this campaign :\n“I have never voted Green before but I have no hesitation in voting for Ian Middleton for our vacant County Council seat. He stands up for our Green Belt and our environment, and for ensuring that we have a future.”\nDavid Brown, Yarnton Resident\n“Ian delivered for the larder for months, sometimes taking 2-3 routes to make sure our community had food and other essentials during the first lockdown. Thereafter Ian was an ardent supporter of community interests and helped advise and establish the larder”\nEmily Connally, Founder of The Cherwell Larder\n“Ian has been fighting against Cherwell’s proposals to build on green belt land in Begbroke and Yarnton since they were first announced. He’s used every opportunity to oppose them and has always looked out for residents. I believe he would make an excellent county councillor and I would trust him to represent my best interests as a resident in the most effective way.”\nKK, Spring Hill resident\n“Ian has been a huge help to us, and really seems to care about issues impacting residents. Very accessible and always willing to lend advice and support.”\nN Donoghue, Kidlington resident\n“Ian has provided valuable help to the residents in our Close by getting involved and by providing ongoing support. It is reassuring to know that when needed, he is approachable and really does take an active interest in his local community”\nG Bishop, Kidlington resident\n“I first met Ian when he was delivering food to my area during lockdown. He didn’t tell me he was a councillor until weeks later. He’s the sort of councillor we need more of. Someone who cares about our community and isn’t out for himself. He’s always thinking of others and works to make our lives more liveable.”\nSteve Norton, Brandon Close",

It seems like elections are almost a weekly occurrence now. Brenda of Bristol must furious!\nJoking aside, I must admit I was surprised to find myself thrown into another election so soon after winning 3 local council seats in May.\nBut it seems that our strong and stable government can’t manage to hang on for any longer than a coupe of years at most these days, even with the so-called fixed- term Parliament Act!\nThis just goes to show how desperately we need electoral reform in this country, a system by which more than one party can contribute to the process of government and more than one set of opinions can be taken into account.\nIt seems that, far from our first past the post system giving us a government of unity and decisiveness, when it comes to the most monumental political upheaval in a generation, we simply can’t agree on anything!\nIn those circumstances we have to go back to the country and hope that the numbers stack up differently afterwards. Somehow I suspect they won’t. While we cling to our broken 2 party state, we will just see-saw backwards and forwards between opposing positions.\nOn the key issue of Brexit, Labour are still offering a confused position, saying they would re-negotiate the deal with the EU and then put it to the people. That’s a great in principle, but in practice it means Labour will presumably be rooting for their new deal in any subsequent vote. That, by any sensible definition, makes them a party of leave.\nThe Libdems simply want to ignore the 2016 vote and treat Brexit like it never happened. Whilst that’s an attractive prospect for those of us who would rather remain, it’s not a way to resolve the political schism in our country at the moment.\nThe 2016 result was hardly decisive as it showed a split right down the middle of the argument. We could probably have run the vote again the following day and got a different result!\nThe only way to properly heal this country is with a second referendum as soon as possible after the election. No more deals being negotiated, no more simply pushing the Brexit button out of expediency (as the Tories would have us do), but a properly informed, final say on the direction this country will take and what is in the best interests of everyone.\nPersonally, if that second vote still comes out as leave I’m done on the subject of Brexit. I’m quite happy to let the chips fall where they may and shift my focus to trying to prepare the country for what I think will be the most damaging decade in history since the last war.\nBut to those who say we shouldn’t have a second vote, I’d point to the fact that we’re now having our third national vote since 2015! If ‘the will of the people’ really was the main driving force in our democracy, we’d keep the government we voted for in 2015, regardless of the wishes of the government at the time. But we haven’t.\nSo if we can have 3 general elections in 4 years, why not a confirmatory vote on something that was decided by a small minority three and a half years ago, when we didn’t know what we know now? Something that could impact on all our futures and those of generations to come. Why is that to be decided on just one vote?\nI really don’t know why anyone should object to the idea of a People’s Vote. If the will of the people hasn’t changed, the result will be the same. The only reason I can see that the Brexit contingent would object to another vote, is that they think they will lose it.\nIn which case they know in their heart of hearts that the mood of the country has changed. They know that the vote in 2016 was probably a fluke, and they’re terrified of the genuine will of the people being followed now. they simply want to railroad us all into the abyss before anyone realised what’s happening. That’s no way to run a country!\nSo let’s get on with this election and I hope vote in some more Green MPs who can influence Westminster enough to resolve the national insanity we seem to have thrown ourselves into over Brexit.\nWe don’t need to get Brexit done.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_rural-issues/content_37.html": "A number of fundamental questions about Oxford City Council’s submission of its local plan have been raised by the planning inspector in his initial questions and comments. These questions are strikingly familiar to anyone who was at the Public Inquiry into Cherwell District Council’s Local Plan Review earlier this year.\nAt the hearing, local campaigners called on Cherwell to delay any further work on the plan to build 4400 houses on prime Green Belt in Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke until the true figures of housing need in Oxford were known.\nCherwell’s local plan review is predicated on a perceived obligation to help meet Oxford City’s housing need. Campaigners against the plans have repeatedly argued that Oxford’s need cannot be quantified until their local plan has been agreed, approved and published. Something the City Council has been slow to progress.\nInstead, District councils have relied on guesswork and a ‘working assumption’ from the Oxfordshire Growth Board (OGB) based on figures in the 2014 Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA). A report that itself has been highly criticised since its publication.\nIn response, the City Council commissioned an update to the SHMA. This demonstrated that the original figures were over-estimates, a conclusion backed by follow up analysis from an independent planning consultant presented to the Cherwell hearing. Both the city and district councils, including Cherwell, have sought to ignore the implications of these reports, but the inconsistencies have not escaped the planning inspector. These include:\n- The fact that figures being used to underpin assumptions of need are now over 8 years old\n- That the 2018 SHMA points to a significantly lower housing need than that shown in the 2014 version and that these figures have not been incorporated into the City’s plan.\n- Inconsistencies in estimated housing capacities in the City’s plan and the ‘Growth Deal’ proposals\n- Suggestions of prescriptive planning policies that preclude development in numerous key areas\n- Concerns over double counting of homeless numbers where new households are ignored\n- Inappropriate market ‘uplifts’ producing around a 30% over-estimate of housing need\nIan Middleton, Cherwell District Council’s new Green councillor said\n“The inspector’s comments are a clear vindication of the position taken by groups opposed to Cherwell’s plans to devastate green spaces in South Cherwell on the basis of an assumed need that has been significantly inflated.\nDuring the public inquiry, Cherwell resolutely refused to listen to calls from myself and MP Layla Moran to delay their plans until the City’s need had been properly established. It’s now clear we were right and the need to suspend Cherwell’s local plan review, regardless of their planning inspector’s verdict, is even more urgent.\nThe assumptions on housing need used by the OGB have now been undermined by 2 independent studies, and a planning inspector. How much more evidence does the council need to admit that their proposals in Kidlington, Begbroke and Yarnton are misguided and woefully unsound?\nIt would be hugely irresponsible for a council to impose such sweeping and irreversible damage on local communities when they know that the data underpinning those plans is at best questionable and at worse completely wrong”\nThe planning inspector is expected to publish his response to the Cherwell Local plan review in the next few weeks.\nYou can see the full text of the planning inspector’s comments and questions on the city council plan here https://www.oxford.gov.uk/downloads/file/6397/ic1_-_inspectors_initial_questions_and_comments_to_occ",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_teachers/content_120.html": "I’ve been surprised throughout this election at the lack of questioning during hustings and interviews about education.\nWith cuts being felt right across the county, we really should be more focused on this issue that we are. I was tweeted tonight by a parent led group campaigning against cuts in school funding in Oxfordshire asking if I realised just how bad the situation was.\nAt this point I’m the only candidate to reply. But maybe the others will catch up later.\nBut playing catch-up seems to be the way for our education system, with a report coming out only a few days ago on the dire state of repair of some school buildings. As someone who went to school in the 70s, I find it shocking that we should have let our education system become so under-valued in such a short period of time.\nMy best friend from back in those days keeps in touch with me, and he has just retired as a senior head teacher. He now does consultancy work for schools that are suffering under the same system he battled through. Essentially the privatisation of our education system that does little to help students and puts a lot of money into the pockets of Academy shareholders.\nThe future of our children should not be for sale to the highest bidder, and we should not be seeing a situation where parents have to raise hundreds of pounds to subsidise books or pay for bus passes so their children can actually get to school. Again, I remember free bus passes for school-children, but that seems like a long-lost utopia now.\nWe need an education system that provides opportunity to everyone. Schools that cater for all levels of ability and aspiration. The chance for everyone who wants to move on to further and higher education to do so without saddling themselves with a lifetime of debt.\nWe also need to value our teachers and educators, paying them a decent salary and ensuring they have fair conditions to work in. Like doctors and nurses they are taken far too much for granted and expected to cope with appalling stress simply because they are dedicated people.\nThe Conservative’s promises of extra funding don’t come close to addressing the problems that have been stored up over the past 10 years. Their so-called ‘extra’ spending amounts to nothing more than setting the clock back to the point before they imposed austerity on us all.\nSee the Green Party Manifesto by clicking here. Go to page 55 to see our comprehensive range of proposals and policies about revitalising our education system and bringing schools into the 21sct century, whilst unlocking the potential of students and teachers at all levels.\nA proper education for the next generation should be a priority for all of us.

But we’re used to tall orders. In the face of what seems like a deliberate policy of starving us of media attention in favour of far more ratings grabbing pint-swilling politico-celebs like Nigel Farage, we’re still garnering support from credible commentators and respected political analysts for both our economic and social justice proposals.\nFormer Citibank financial trader Gary Stevenson and host of the You Tube Channel Gary’s Economics has analysed the Green Party manifesto and classified it as the most credible and honest in real terms. In a recent video he confirmed that he would be voting Green because we are the only party to be offering a radical and workable alternative to the proposals from every other party.\nTrade Unionist and former General Secretary of the Labour Party Jennie Formby has also announced on Twitter that she would be voting Green in this election along with numerous other high profile political and cultural leaders such as George Monbiot. It’s also reported that more and more young people are turning to the Greens as a real alternative to the ping-pong politics of the past 50 years.\nAs a moderate Green myself I’ve always seen the Greens as a true alternative vote, neither left or right. The Green Party officially rejects the traditional left–right political spectrum, describing it as “something of an anachronism” and that perfectly fits with my view on the world.\nI’m standing as the Parliamentary Candidate for Bicester and Woodstock mainly because it’s my home constituency and the place I’ve made my home for 32 years. But above all that, it’s a place I’ve seen change drastically in that time with even more drastic changes in the pipeline. From the massive development plans in and around Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Bicester with large areas of greenbelt being decimated by ill-conceived local plans to proposals to armour plate 3500 acres of green fields and farmland for hugely unpopular solar farm project in the west. I’m concerned about what these things will do to the place I’ve called home for nearly half my life.\nThere’s obviously going to be a lot more to say on this election in the remaining 2 weeks, much of which I’ve not said so far due to dealing with my new responsibilities on Cherwell District Council after being appointed to the executive on the same night that the General Election was announced (great timing Rishi!). But I’ll be breaking my silence over the next 2 weeks.\nIn the meantime, doors are being knocked, leaflets are being delivered and pollsters are polling. There’s been a huge amount of speculation about who can win in this constituency and I’m not going to add to that with my own obviously biased opinions. But with a newly drawn boundary, every voter has the historic opportunity to vote in a brand new Westminster constituency for the first time where we could all buck the trends and help me and the Greens to show that any prediction in an unknown and untested area could be drastically inaccurate.\nCan I win? Who knows? Am I serious about my candidacy? Absolutely! But then as anyone who knows me and knows my work as a local councillor and activist would tell you, I never do things by half measures. We all know that the Tories are finished, at least for the immediate future. We don’t need to vote tactically on a local basis in this election because after 14 years of chaos the country has finally woken up and are about to consign the current administration to the political skip.\nThat gives every voter in this area new opportunities and new possibilities. You can vote with your heart and for what you believe in. If that’s a better future for you and your family, a fully funded NHS and social care system, public utilities returned to responsible public control (particular water and energy), a better standard of living for all, raising millions out of poverty and protecting climate and nature, voting Green really is the only alternative. Even if I don’t win the seat, a vote for me that would contribute to a large swing to the Greens nationally will strengthen our hand in influencing national politics for the better. It will also put money into the party coffers through Short Money to help us continue the fight for a better, fairer, greener world for you and you family and their families to come.\nI’ll do my best over the next couple of weeks to make my case for your precious vote in this election and I hope you will seriously consider giving me that vote on July 4th. You should shortly be receiving leaflets from me explaining my priorities. You can also browse this website which is being updated with local issues that I think will be important in the upcoming election. I will also be adding new topics in the next few days. If you want hear me speak in the meantime, I was interviewed by Byline Times recently and was able to cover many topics that I think will be important to voters in this election. You can see that here.\nThere are also a number of hustings that you can attend to ask questions of me and the other candidates. These are :\n7.30pm – 24th June – Kidlington Methodist Church (forum on poverty)\n7.30pm – 25th June – St. Mary Magdelene Church, Park St, Woodstock\n7pm – 26th June – St Edburg Church Bicester\n6.30pm – 1st July – CPRE Country side and Environment hustings at Yarnton Village Hall\nI look forward to seeing as many people at those events as possible. If anyone would like to extend other invitations I am more than happy to come along. If any other events come up I will post them here and on my social media channels.\nRemember – this is the election where YOU get to vote FOR what YOU believe in, rather than AGAINST what you don’t.\nIf you’d like to get involved in my campaign please drop me a line at ian.middleton@greenoxford.com\nYou could also contribute to my joint fundraiser to help me and my 2 fellow North and West Oxfordshire candidates reach more voters in this campaign.

Housing is needed for homes and not investment.\nI spent years fighting against Cherwell District Council’s proposals to remove green belt protection from huge areas around Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Gosford to build houses to fulfil an inflated need that has been proposed by the city council. Not only are these houses not needed, they will not be affordable or even available to the people of south Cherwell. They are simply an investment vehicle for Oxford University to make a huge amount of money, whilst realising their ambitions to turn our rural area into yet another university campus around the Begbroke Science Park.\nWe now face other proposals to build on our green spaces for everything from football stadiums to solar farms. I believe that local opinion should be listened to about if we want these things in our community and continue to push for better and more genuine consultation on future planning issues.\nI will always work to protect the Green belt.

The only reason I can see that the Brexit contingent would object to another vote, is that they think they will lose it.\nIn which case they know in their heart of hearts that the mood of the country has changed. They know that the vote in 2016 was probably a fluke, and they’re terrified of the genuine will of the people being followed now. they simply want to railroad us all into the abyss before anyone realised what’s happening. That’s no way to run a country!\nSo let’s get on with this election and I hope vote in some more Green MPs who can influence Westminster enough to resolve the national insanity we seem to have thrown ourselves into over Brexit.\nWe don’t need to get Brexit done. We need to do away with it once and for all!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_author_ianmiddleton99_page_4/content_421.html": "OK, I’ll agree, the state of our roads in Oxfordshire is shocking.\nAs I journey around the district on my bike and by car I can see the number of cracks, holes and ravines as much as any other other road user and the situation is unacceptable.\nBut our roads didn’t get into this state in just the last 2 years!\nThe Conservatives have been grandstanding in this election about potholes and blaming the Lib Dem/Labour/Green coalition on the County Council for the situation. But it’s no worse now than it was under the last Conservative controlled administration. In fact it’s probably a bit better in terms of how responsive our road management team are.\nI appreciate that seeing so many potholes is frustrating. I’m reporting them every day and they have become more numerous recently after the changeable weather. Crews are out every day fixing them but it’s a battle to try to get the worst ones prioritised and everyone understandably wants to see those in their area fixed first. But the problem with repairing them is not lack of willingness by the council, it’s lack of money/resources.\nNot a new problem\nDuring the last year of the Tory run administration on OCC a story was run in the Oxford Mail which reported that an insurance company had ranked Oxfordshire fifth worst for the number of potholes reported between 2015 and 2018. Figures showed 93,112 potholes were reported during that period amounting to 19.6 potholes per km of road.\nThe figures, from The Insurance Emporium, showed other areas worse than Oxfordshire include East Riding of Yorkshire, Northamptonshire, Edinburgh and in top spot Devon as the worst for potholes. From personal experience I’d add our sister county Buckinghamshire to that list having driven though there recently, their roads make ours look like billiard tables!\nBut the current state of the roads is something that has been building up for years due to lack of investment by successive governments. I’m not even going to blame the Conservatives for it (as they are trying to do to us now) except to say that, as a Conservative administration themselves, they could probably have leant on the government a bit more to stump up some extra cash for repairs instead of borrowing their way out of the problem and saddling us with yet more debt that taxpayers will carry for years. Even then they still didn’t sort the problem out, because quite frankly it’s not sortable without massive investment.\nOxfordshire’s highways need about £45m a year just to stop them getting any worse. The council get less than a third of that from government and another third from local taxation. Some of the remaining third is covered by borrowing that was taken out by the previous administration that will run out in 2025 (although we’ll be paying millions in interest for many years to come). No one really knows where the funding will come from to cover that when that happens. A good chunk of that funding also goes on bridge repairs, and as many of you will have noticed, our bridges are also falling apart as well and if we have a catastrophic bridge failure the result could be a lot more serious than a puncture!\nOur existing roads, are essentially worn out due to lack of proper maintenance for decades. The main cause of this is lack of central government funding made worse by the austerity measures during the last 10 years. It would now cost billions across the county to bring them all up to a decent standard and that doesn’t include pathways.\nIn the meantime the government forces local authorities to build more roads through “growth schemes” tied to essential housing that they won’t provide enough funding to maintain in the future. So the deficit continues to widen.\nPlaying politics\nLets stop playing politics over potholes. Every party blames the other for the state of the roads , but ultimately it’s a matter of investment. We all hate potholes and we all know they shouldn’t be there, but it’s daft to suggest that not fixing them is a deliberate choice for any controlling administration. If we had the spare money, don’t you think we’d spend it just to get the problem off our desks? And before people jump on the usual “if you didn’t spend it on this or that, you could fix X number of potholes” remember that government is all about making those decisions. A few £100K here or there is never going to fix the problems we have with road maintenance now we need billions if we’re going to sort this mess out.\nAs an administration we are absolutely focussed on doing the best with what we have on pothole repairs. The response time on repairs is now much better, but I accept there’s still room for improvement, particularly in terms of the longevity of some of the repairs. But we are going to need serious cash if we’re going to meet residents’ expectations and any politician who tells you otherwise is just using this issue as a campaigning tool. The only ways to get those funds is an increase in council tax, a reduction in other vital services or a very significant injection of funding from the government – and I don’t mean the paltry £3m or so that they recently announced for Oxfordshire coincidentally just before the local elections!\nSo if you really want to see a longer term systemic improvement you need to lobby the government to properly support local authorities. While you’re at it, you could mention a similar situation with health and social care, especially as they’ve just cut promised funding for carers in half!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2021_02/content_254.html": "Cherwell District Council announced it’s budget last week detailing £4.4m in cuts and extra charges that it will be imposing on the residents of Cherwell as well as an increase in council tax.\nDuring the budget debate I raised my concerns that around a third of these cuts and charges were as a result of losses incurred over the past two years in Banbury\nIn a nutshell the centre is predicted to make a loss of around £1.6m in the 21/22 financial year after having made a similar loss in 20/21. On a broader scale, taking into account some small gains in the first 2 years the council owned the development, it will have racked up losses in the region of £2.5m by the end of the next financial year if the current predictions are correct. To close the gap left by that hole in the budget there have been additional service cuts with around a third of those in the forthcoming budget directly attributable to pressures from Castle Quay.\nYou may have seen some of this in the press this week in Oxford Mail and the Banbury Guardian\nI was also interviewed by BBC Radio Oxford, although my section was recorded and heavily edited, after which Cllr Tony Ilot ,the Lead Member for Financial Management & Governance on Cherwell District Council, was invited on the show live to respond. If we’d been on at the same time I might have pointed out that as the councillor responsible for this development it would have been more encouraging had he bothered to do his homework before coming on. At one point he seemed uncertain about how much the losses amounted to (he guessed at £1.3m and the interviewer had to correct him that it was £1.6m) and he also claimed that the £1.6m was a cumulative loss since the council took ownership. It’s not, it’s just the predicted loss for the forthcoming year on top of a similar one for the last year. You’d think the Lead Member for Financial Management & Governance might have been a little more cognisant of the situation given the scale of problem, but this lack of concern over important details is a familiar theme with Cherwell’s Conservatives.\nCllr Ilot also seemed quite laid back about the fact that the centre is now worth less than half what was paid for item having lost a whopping £30m in value. They are also currently spending even more than the original purchase price for the shopping centre on the canal side extension which, as a retail analyst myself, I think they are going to struggle to make a return on.\nYou can listen to the interview in full here\nThe council’s line on this has been that the losses at CQ have not directly resulted in an increase in the council tax. As that increase was already in the pipeline anyway that’s probably fair to say, but it also fair to say that if this white elephant wasn’t providing such a huge financial drag on the council’s resources, we may not have needed to increase the tax and we certainly wouldn’t have need many of the cuts in services.\nIt will be interesting to see how much support we get for the high street in Kidlington and the Exeter Close project in the light of all this. Certainly something we can point them to if they start penny-pinching on our project to support the eye-watering amounts of public money that’s being poured into one scheme in the far north of the district that we’re all footing the bill for.",

Increased development on surrounding areas has also exacerbated the problem, and with huge amounts of additional houses planned for the green fields around villages in South Cherwell, there are now serious concerns amongst residents about what the future holds.\nRun-off from areas like Spring Hill are sources of flood water which now regularly hit the villages of Yarnton and Begbroke below. These are areas due to be built on as part of Cherwell’s recently adopted partial plan review (site PR9).\nI’m regularly being contacted, both as a district and parish councillor, by residents watching flood water approaching their homes, yet there are very few options open to me to help them.\nThese incidents often occur out of office hours. As a district councillor I have an emergency response number to call, but the last time I used that when I was trying to help residents facing flooding in Garden City Kidlington, I was told I should call the police and ask them to deal with it. When I did so, the police operator seemed bemused that I was given that advice\nOther agencies such as the fire service are quite understandably reluctant to tie up vital fire and rescue resources unless property has actually been inundated. This is quite a distressing situation to have to explain to residents who are trying to prevent that from happening in the first place.\nThames water are usually difficult to reach and often do very little when they are finally contacted. I hear regular complaints about blocked drains and flood channels as well as pumping stations either not working at all or being unable to cope with the level of flood water. Again, the only emergency contact I have for Thames Water is the same number that any member of the public can call\nThe county council will deliver sandbags, but usually by that point the situation has reached crisis level and residents have to hope that they will hold back water which may already be at their thresholds\nThis just isn’t good enough. We need to stop treating these incidents as one-off events and put together a credible, structured, multi-agency response that can swing into action when councillors and other local agencies need it. It’s very frustrating as a local councillor not being able to help when residents expect you to have levers to pull that just aren’t available to us\nAdvancing climate change means that we will now have to live with the escalating threat of flooding on a year-round basis. Increased development on what are now relatively permeable green spaces, such as Spring Hill in Begbroke will only make matters worse.\nThis is not a criticism of individual agencies. There just seems to be no credible protocol about what can and should be done and who should be doing it. We need a central control point that can co-ordinate a response to all levels of flooding whenever and wherever it happens, as well as a local flood task force to ensure flood defences are mapped and regularly maintained.\nAdvancing climate change means that we will now have to live with the escalating threat of flooding on a year-round basis. Increased development on what are now relatively permeable green spaces, such as Spring Hill in Begbroke will only make matters worse.\nSite promoters promise that they will put flood defences in place, but with the frequency and intensity of flooding increasing every year, most defences will eventually be overwhelmed. Developers are also usually more concerned with ensuring new properties don’t flood, with less consideration for the impact of new developments on existing residents. Areas that may in the past have been flood free will soon find themselves in the firing line with little hope of holding those responsible to account.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_budget-cuts/content_290.html": "Many people will have heard the absurd comments from Cherwell’s lead councillor for Financial Management and Governance, Tony Ilott, on BBC Oxford breakfast radio on Tuesday. I thought it was worth covering a few of the comments made by the Conservative representative in more detail.\nThe programme featured a running topic on the amount of back rent owed to several councils in Oxfordshire and you can hear it here. This is not a problem unique to this county as so many councils now rely on commercial investment to make ends meet since central government no longer provide enough funding for even the basic services that we all rely on.\nThis problem is exacerbated by the fact that legislation requires local authorities to balance their budgets every year and prevents them from borrowing to cover any shortfalls. This leaves them in the position of trying to operate like private investors without having the same financial flexibility.\nWith many local authorities now heavily invested in commercial property they have all faced a huge shortfall in income from rents that have not been paid throughout the pandemic. To add insult to this injury, even though the Chancellor said he would provide “whatever it takes” to help local government, central government has excluded losses from commercial investments from it’s support payments to councils.\nThe need to balance the books each year results in councils being left with only 2 options when they have a shortfall in rents. Either they increase council tax (which can only be done up to certain limits without a costly referendum) or they cut services.\nthat’s going to be a pretty expensive chicken dinner for the residents of Cherwell!\nThis is what Cherwell District Council did in 2021 when they reported losses in the region of £1.6m against the Castle Quay shopping centre in Banbury. With similar losses predicted for the next financial year, this is likely to put the same pressures on the budget for the following year which will inevitably mean yet more cuts, along with additional charges like we’ve seen this year for things like garden waste collections.\nCommercial landlords would usually carry these sorts of shortfalls over a period of years, often borrowing to cover the gaps, and recover as much of the rent as they could over that time with deferral agreements with tenants. Ultimately some of the losses may have to be written off. But as explained above, councils can’t do this. So as long as these shortfalls are on the books, more cuts or tax increases are the only way to deal with the problem each year.\nIt was clear though from the interview Cllr Ilott really didn’t understand any of the mechanics of this, which is quite staggering considering his role on the council. When he was asked if he thought there should be a change in legislation that would allow councils to deal with these problems, he said he didn’t think so. Instead he chose to make childish personal comments about me and avoided answering the interviewer’s questions about how the council will recover these losses.\nit’s clear that they have no real vision for how to revitalise the development other than the idea that making it bigger will somehow make it better.\nHe did make mention of ‘working with tenants’ which of course is a good plan. As a retail consultant myself I’d always advocate such a move, but due to the limitations imposed on councils, this can only be done on a year by year basis. Any outstanding debts at the end of each year will need to be accounted for and action taken on increased taxation or services cuts.\nCllr Illot suggested that we look at things “in the round” and I agree we should do that. Unfortunately, time restraints on the programme prevented me from laying out the full details, but I’m happy to do so here :\n- Losses in the last financial year attributable to Castle Quay – £1.6m\n- Losses predicted in the next financial year due to Castle Quay – approx £1.6m\n- Rent owed to Cherwell District Council at this point – nearly £2m\n- Loss in value of Castle Quay shopping centre since the council took full ownership – over £30m (it’s now worth less than half what they paid for it 4 years ago)\n- Additional investment being ploughed into expanding the centre – £73m (underwritten by council tax payers)\n- Interest on the loans to finance all this (so far) – £2m+ per year\n- Cuts required to the entire council budget this year – £4.4m\nYes some of this can be blamed on the pandemic, but retail was already on the decline when the council took the frankly bizarre decision to buy the scheme, especially as it’s clear that they have no real vision for how to revitalise the development other than the idea that making it bigger will somehow make it better. That and Cllr Ilott’s head in the sand optimism seems to be the main strategy from our Conservative councillors.\nI don’t see that as good value for the council tax payers of Cherwell. Judging by Cllr Illott’s flippancy and lack of concern he seems to regard massive financial losses along with the associated financial impact on resident’s pockets as fine as long as he can get some chicken.\nI’d say that taking all that into account that’s going to be a pretty expensive chicken dinner for the residents of Cherwell!\nAnd let’s not forget that all this money is going into one town in Cherwell – Banbury. Meanwhile Bicester town centre’s retail area is being hollowed out due to the council’s planning decisions elsewhere, and the whole of the district – every single tax payer – is footing the bill for all this incompetence. As is often the case with Cherwell Council , the south of the district is left to fend for itself and pick up the tab. If I were a cynical soul I might suggest that this is because the majority of support for the councillors who agreed to this whole adventure comes from the north of the district.\nBut I think we should all be able to rely on decent fiscal management from our local councillors, no matter where we live. Sadly it seems clear to me that we can’t expect this as long as the Conservatives are in charge.\nIt’s about time the Tories got a proper grip on council finances and stopped playing chicken with all our money!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_green-spaces/content_202.html": "I’ve spoken to hundreds of people during this short election campaign and probably the most important issue on most people’s minds right now is the threat to our local green belt.\nI made a video about it last week which has received quite a bit of attention since it was released. You can watch it here.\nOf course in Yarnton, Begbroke and Gosford (where I’m standing to become the new local County Councillor) it’s in the forefront of everyone’s minds because, if it goes ahead, we’ll be the ones living in the middle of a building site for possibly the next 10 years. We’ll also see our small rural communities destroyed and replaced with a single medium sized town, one that will probably also double up as a university campus for the Begbroke Science Park.\nBut even in Kidlington, (which comprises a large part of the County division) it’s going to have a huge impact. There may not be as many houses built in the area, but the additional strain on our local resources, such as health services, education and leisure facilities will be very detrimental. We’ll also see a noticeable reduction in air quality which is likely to have health impacts on the most vulnerable, as well as increased risks of flooding. The A44 will probably become a car park during busy times, giving us all the chance to sit and admire the 4 storey apartment blocks that will tower over the edge of the dual carriageway.\nThere’s also a good chance that Kidlington will finally lose the argument about hanging on to it’s status as a village. In 10 years time, when the population has possibly tripled, there’s likely to be a much greater push to establish the whole area as a suburb of a Greater Oxford City. Not a prospect I, or anyone else in the area, relishes but something we may have little choice over.\nI for one won’t stop fighting for that until the last blade of grass has fallen under the bulldozer’s tracks.\nAll this might be acceptable to a greater degree if these houses were going to provide affordable accommodation for local families, many of whom are crammed into a single house with perhaps 3 generations under one roof. But these aren’t for the likes of them. These will be expensive luxury executive houses built for investment purposes, with the so-called ‘affordable’ houses reserved for people in Oxford City. The District Council saw to that when they handed control of those houses over to the City Council in a closed meeting at the beginning of the first lockdown. None of these houses will be within reach of local residents.\nA lot of people have told me that all this is inevitable and that the 4400 houses are a ‘done deal’. Well that isn’t the case until we know the outcome of the legal challenge being brought to the high court next month. Until that’s over we have no idea if these proposals will stand up or collapse. There have been reports in other areas recently where challenges have been upheld, and if we get the same result Cherwell District Council will have to think again. In those circumstances we’ll need as much support on the District Council as possible which is why I’m supporting Fiona Mawson to become our second Green Party Councillor on CDC.\nBut even if we fail to stop these devastating plans though the courts, we can at least do our best to limit some of that devastation by having engaged and active councillors at all levels of local government. On the County Council fighting for infrastructure and other important considerations like flood protection, and of course at District and Parish level scrutinising the individual planning proposals themselves. We also have to be vigilant in opposing ‘infilling’ which may become more of an issue as the amount of development space in the area is snapped up by the bigger developers.\nSo I hope I and Fiona can count on the support of our local residents in the elections on Thursday. We’ve seen how our current crop of Conservative councillors have let us down on these issues, and let’s not forget that this whole idea was the brainchild of the Conservatives on Cherwell District Council in the first place, in cahoots with Oxford University, the City Council, the Oxfordshire Growth Board and the Local Enterprise Partnership. After Thursday we may have more leverage to defend our small rural communities against these faceless, unelected and anti-democratic quangos and take back control of our green heritage.\nI for one won’t stop fighting for that until the last blade of grass has fallen under the bulldozer’s tracks. I hope you’ll all support me as your Green Councillor in that long battle.",

That and Cllr Ilott’s head in the sand optimism seems to be the main strategy from our Conservative councillors.\nI don’t see that as good value for the council tax payers of Cherwell. Judging by Cllr Illott’s flippancy and lack of concern he seems to regard massive financial losses along with the associated financial impact on resident’s pockets as fine as long as he can get some chicken.\nI’d say that taking all that into account that’s going to be a pretty expensive chicken dinner for the residents of Cherwell!\nAnd let’s not forget that all this money is going into one town in Cherwell – Banbury. Meanwhile Bicester town centre’s retail area is being hollowed out due to the council’s planning decisions elsewhere, and the whole of the district – every single tax payer – is footing the bill for all this incompetence. As is often the case with Cherwell Council , the south of the district is left to fend for itself and pick up the tab. If I were a cynical soul I might suggest that this is because the majority of support for the councillors who agreed to this whole adventure comes from the north of the district.\nBut I think we should all be able to rely on decent fiscal management from our local councillors, no matter where we live. Sadly it seems clear to me that we can’t expect this as long as the Conservatives are in charge.\nIt’s about time the Tories got a proper grip on council finances and stopped playing chicken with all our money!",

But as the County and District Councillor for the area that Stratfield Brake sits within, I think the County Cabinet’s agreement to enter into negotiations with OUFC was premature, given that there were still so many unanswered questions a year on from the initial approaches from the club to the council.\nOf course we all want to help the club find a new home, but if we’re talking about using public assets to do that, we need transparency about what they’ve done to help themselves. For example, we still don’t have evidence that they’ve have explored all legal remedies to stay where they are.\nIt also appeared from the club’s own long-awaited report that they hadn’t even started looking at other alternative sites until October last year, after claiming at the beginning of 2022 that they had already explored all other options.\nAfter waiting 8 months for the full report on the club’s plans, it took a further 2 months for it to be circulated to stakeholders in a heavily edited form which doesn’t suggest that they are willing to be as transparent with local residents and stakeholders as they have claimed in the past.\nKidlington Parish Council (KPC) had been waiting for most of last year for the report from the club showing their detailed plans for the main Stratfield Brake site (which they are leaseholders of) so that they could be put out to local consultation. They could not take a decision on relinquishing their lease until they had consulted with the local residents who they represent.\nThe club has tried to blame the council for delays in making a decision on the initial very broad proposals but that was simply not the case. KPC wanted to make a decision on an informed basis and had been working towards a genuine local consultation, but to facilitate that they needed details of what the club were proposing. Thus any delay in the decision by the council are entirely the fault of the football club. Instead of engaging properly with KPC to help them hold a local consultation, they have gone around them by moving their plans to the site known as the Triangle which KPC has no direct control over.\nAs a result, I made a plea to the cabinet to include an amendment to the proposals to enter into negotiations with the club that would also commit the council to a full local consultation on the proposals before any final decision was made which should include the option to accept or reject the proposals. This wasn’t even responded to.\nAs the local county councillor I was disappointed that my call to the County Cabinet for a full local consultation didn’t seem to be endorsed. That would at least have given local residents some comfort that their views, both for and against the proposals, would be properly taken into account.\nThere was a reference to future engagement with stakeholders but it’s not clear who would undertake this and if it would be at a point where the local community would have a chance to say yes or no to the plans once they know what they are. With so many questions still left unanswered, we need a definite assurance that such a consultation will be part of the final decision process, otherwise we may find ourselves overtaken by circumstances as plans progress and positions become embedded”.\nWhilst I’m pleased to see the council took note of local concerns raised in last year’s country-wide engagement exercise, what is being proposed now is a rather different prospect and doesn’t completely deal with local views about having yet another significant development sited on some of Kidlington’s dwindling green spaces.\nIf we’re going to condone building on the green belt we need to ensure there is quantifiable local support for that. There are a range of views, as we saw at the meeting, and I want to make sure I’m fully representing the balance of local opinion, but until we ask the whole community we don’t know what that is.\nMy position as the local councillor for the area is that I have to support the majority view of the residents that will be affected by this development whatever they are. I don’t understand why there is a resistance from both the club and their fans as well as the council to asking local people directly what they think of this idea. There may be opposition, but there may equally be majority support for the plans. If so we can proceed on that basis knowing that the club would be welcomed by the village. Surely that would be a better outcome for all concerned, especially OUFC’s owners who I assume wouldn’t want to impose themselves on to a community that would resent them being there.\nI will continue to advocate for a full local consultation both internally within the council and with other local representatives, particularly the local MP Layla Moran.",

I think it speaks for itself, although after it was published I thought I should have pointed out that none of the the politicians I refer to in the studio on election night were Greens. As usual we weren’t invited to the BBC party. There were however representatives from Labour, Conservative, Libdems and UKIP. Given that the Greens had a reasonably good showing in the last General Election in Rochester (for a ‘marginal’ party) I’d have thought we’d have been worth a mention at least. But apparently not.\nAnyway I hope this serves as a good first post on my website/blog and you can see the original article here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/westminster-politics_b_6199214.html?utm_hp_ref=tw.\nFeel free to comment below or on the original article on the Huffington Post site.\nI recently became a parliamentary candidate for the Green Party. After years of railing against politicians, the irony, and perhaps the hypocrisy, of becoming one myself has not been lost on me.\nThen again, there were the constant jibes about my complaining a lot but doing nothing positive to make a change. So when my local party group asked me to stand, I said I’d give it a go. And here I am. Feel free to point the finger.\nOne of the first things I’ve noticed about the underbelly of politics is just how strategic it is. Target wards, target seats, candidates standing in constituencies where they don’t live for the sake of political expediency. None of this is new, or unusual, or even un-democratic, but it does take some getting used to.\nBut watching the BBC election special on the Rochester and Strood by-election, you could be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the political world has turned into some kind of wife swapping party from the mid 70s. It seems these days that political manoeuvring between the ruling parties has moved beyond juggling their own family jewels, and has been reduced to chucking their keys into the fruit bowl with anyone who fancies a quick fumble with their majority.\nFirstly we had UKIP’s Deputy Chairperson Suzanne Evans being interviewed about where her party would go after the predicted win in Rochester. This consisted of a serious of nods and winks about who might and might not leap out of their own party bed and sneak into theirs when the neighbours weren’t looking. A sort of Carry-On Westminster, but with less laughs.\nShe then went on to explain, with barely concealed glee, that her fondest ambition was to seduce someone from Labour to join in their little tryst. Nigel is apparently talking to a couple of MPs but she couldn’t reveal more. She did everything but tap the side of her nose, elbow Andrew Neil in the ribs and give a little Babs Windsor giggle.\nThen we had an analysis from a political expert explaining how UKIP’s performance in the by-election would determine how other sitting MPs would behave in the run up to next years general election. His premise was that if UKIP did well in Rochester, many other career politicians would be considering their position in the next few months. The expectation is apparently that if they think UKIP is a better bet for them to hold on to their seat (ooh matron!), then they would switch allegiances in order to do so.\nNow you’ll have to excuse me. I’m quite new to this game. But when one joins a party isn’t there something about ideology written into the contract? Or am I now being ridiculously naive?\nJudging by the behaviour of at least two recent pantheons of British democracy I suppose I am. It seems that standing on a platform with a bunch of like minded individuals in the hope of doing something good for the country isn’t what it’s about any more.\nNo, apparently it’s more about hanging on to the House Of Commons parking place, the expense account, and access to the House of Commons bar, rather than the boring stuff like philosophical conviction. Some back-benchers are evidently more interested in maintaining a comfortable position for themselves, rather than for their constituents. Yet, in true British carry-on style, they still keep getting elected.\nAs a newcomer to this world, I saw with fresh eyes last night these four sombre suited politicians sitting uneasily with each other, smugly carving up the political cake amongst themselves. Like children at birthday party trying to decide who gets the last portion of jelly and ice cream, the polemic was about anything other than the issues that this country and the planet really face.\nIain Duncan Smith spent a good deal of his time justifying a particularly vituperative campaign poster that portrayed the idea of voting for Mark Reckless as on a par with seeking Pol Pot as a spiritual adviser. Reckless used to be an investment banker, he didn’t live in the area, he’d only moved there to take a safe seat. All very salient points for the local electorate, but ones that seemed exquisitely irrelevant when he was the Conservative MP only a few months ago.\nMeanwhile UKIP expounded their claim that they listened to the people, and were offering an alternative to the status quo of careerist politicians who’d never done a days honest labour in their lives. Odd then that their success last night, and in Clacton a few weeks ago, relied on exactly the reverse of those ideals by welcoming with open arms two MPs firmly rooted in the rotten political establishment they claimed to despise.\nOn the point of principle I am in total agreement with them. The current political establishment has reduced democracy to the level of swapping football cards in the playground. But it’s a tawdry game of top trumps that they have just as much of a hand in as all the other entrenched Westminster parties.\nIf this is the future of politics in this country, I’m glad to be a member of a party that currently stands as an exemplar of how it is still possible to operate democratically without playing these cynical games. We may now have one less MP than UKIP, but at least ours is there on merit, rather than because she swapped her rosette for a more appealing colour.\nAnd Caroline Lucas has just won MP of the year, which is something that gives me hope. Even so, she’s now the focus of a campaign to unseat her by the Labour party in Brighton, because, and despite of the fact, that Labour and the Greens share many of the same aims.\nMoreover, if all these people care about is hanging on to their positions at all costs, what really is the point? And if the electorate is so fickle that they can’t see through this charade, maybe we deserve the graceless, flagitious mess they all seem to be making of the world.\nOne apocryphal anecdote from Rochester I heard today was that someone had voted UKIP because the sitting Tory MP hadn’t done enough for the local area. If that’s true, it’s an indictment of the great British voter more demoralising than anything supposedly implied by hanging a flag out of the window of your mock-Georgian semi.\nBut as an accidental politician I have to hope that it isn’t true, or at least typical. I have to trust that people in the UK will see past all the identikit politicos, the vested interests and the horse trading of their democratic heritage, and vote for real change and genuine representation in the next government.\nI am ever the optimist.",

This is not a problem unique to this county as so many councils now rely on commercial investment to make ends meet since central government no longer provide enough funding for even the basic services that we all rely on.\nThis problem is exacerbated by the fact that legislation requires local authorities to balance their budgets every year and prevents them from borrowing to cover any shortfalls.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_business/content_152.html": "I’ve been involved in retail for as long as I can remember. From my first proper job as a Saturday boy in a menswear store in Lewisham through my days as a market trader in Camden Lock and Greenwich to being co-founder of a national high street chain that started with a small store in Oxford selling silver jewellery. and grew into a national chain trading in 6 of country’s major retail locations, including London’s prestigious Covent Garden.\nIn that time I saw almost as many ups as I did downs. I’ve half jokingly said that I spent 20 years building the business and then another 10 trying extricating it from the failing high street. Like so many other retailers who entered the high street during the boom years in the early 1990s, I fell foul of the simultaneous boom in commercial property development. So many new malls were opened in the 90s and early 2000s it was difficult to keep up and I opened stores in some of the most iconic examples such as the New Bullring in Birmingham and Bluewater in Kent.\nThe other boom at the time was in business rates, which along with rents skyrocketed through that period as institutional landlords, mostly backed by large pension funds, cashed in on the retail bubble ploughing millions into new shiny malls based on the emerging US model. It was great while it lasted and we all became caught up in the heady days of seemingly limitless opportunities. But we soon discovered there were limits.\nThe Financial crash in 2008 gave us all a pretty sharp reality check and things soon started to become far less buoyant and rents that had been agreed on the back of rude profit margins started to look far less tenable as turnovers started to fall.\nThere soon followed a series of frantic rounds of renegotiation with landlords who themselves were facing the prospect of huge hole in their new developments as retailers started to fall over with alarming regularity. In many cases we were able to come to mutual agreements to keep us trading at the shopping malls looking full, but the one thing that couldn’t be re-negotiated were business rates. Set as they were, by the central valuation office, and administered by local authorities, they were completely devoid of any chance of concession unless you had an understanding council. In my experience their understanding was rather limited, and after 5 years as a local councillor myself I now understand more about why that was.\nSo we were all caught in a perfect storm that only a few managed to emerge from. My business was one of the luckier ones as I managed to negotiate deals that gave us breathing space. But I could see the writing on the wall and it was telling me to get out of the high street and decamp to the internet where so many of our competitors were lurking. Thereby hangs another very long story.\nBut suffice to say I have an intimate understanding of the plight of the high street, in fact much more intimate than I would prefer. For that reason one of my personal priorities as a fresh faced new MP would be to push for a new system of business rates or local high street taxation. Other things like rent controls and use classes would also be high on the agenda, but none of this will be an easy fix for an industry in the doldrums after so many years in decline. But I know from my own experience that smaller independents are both the lifeblood of local high streets whilst also being the most vulnerable.\nIn terms of the dreaded business rates, I think I could take elements from the land tax approach of the Green party and add in some aspect of a local purchase tax as seen in the USA. Such a tax would be far more progressive and have more respect for the ability of businesses to pay such an additional tax. That would give a far greater connection between the local community, local authorities and the retailers themselves. If all retailers did well then they would all reap the benefits.\nSpeaking to local councillors and retailers about business rates reform\nI don’t really have the answer to full business rates reform, but I’ve been campaigning for a better system for over 10 years. I would advocate a situation where we involved existing high street retailers in the process of finding a solution. There have been past attempts at doing this, but very few, if any, involved small independent retailers. I think that was a mistake.\nThe Labour Party have boldly announced that they would scrap the current business rates system, but they haven’t said what they would replace it with. I’ve been here before many times, and both Labour and the Tories have frequently promised reform but never delivered on that. One of the biggest reason is that business rates are a virtually guaranteed income for government bringing in over £13bn a year. Even if the premises are empty, the landlord cops for the bill so it’s a win-win for Westminster. So any new system is likely to be just as iniquitous and damaging, especially to smaller operators.\nI think there is a way of developing a system of local high street taxation that could benefit all sides of the equation, including the consumer. Just scrapping the business rates system with no plan for what would replace it is not a solution, yet its the current proposal from the part that is most likely to form the next government in a few weeks. If I was in Westminster I’d hope to be able to provide a far better insight into the problems on the high street and how to engage with the people who face those problems every day.\nI’d like to see genuine consultation with high street stakeholders, including landlords and local councils, about the best way forwards. As a long term retailer, having moved from being a small business, through a larger expansion and back to being a ‘born again independent’, I’d like to be involved in that process. But I guess it remains to be seen what the outcome is on July 4th.\nI’ve just published a video I made during a recent visit to Bicester with some thoughts on how we can work towards a better system of high street business taxation and help to repair our broken high streets and you can watch that by clicking here.\nIf you’re a retailer or just someone who enjoys browsing physical shops, I’d suggest you vote for someone like me who has the experience to make that a viable possibility again. Retail is at the heart of every village, town and city and needs political support to make it vibrant again. Many politicians claim to have the answer but few of them have been on the inside of the industry. I think that needs to change. I’d like to change it.",

In my opinion, this has been slipped into the review under false pretences, given that this has nothing to do with housing need in Oxford. As a result there’s mounting local criticism of the university’s ambitions to commandeer at least 1000 of the houses intended to meet Oxford’s needs for its own use as part of a new campus at Begbroke and Yarnton.\nChair of the Cherwell Development Watch Alliance, Giles Lewis, spoke in favour of the motion at the packed meeting and read out emails between the council and the university, obtained under and FOI request, that suggested plans to allow the university to expand in the area were already being supported as long ago as 2016.\nThe Labour group on the council then introduced an amendment which blocked any re-consideration of housing need numbers, even though this might mean more houses that were needed would be built on green belt.\nI pointed out that just to offset the amount of carbon produced in building the unaffordable and unneeded houses in the first place would take 572,000 trees over 10 years, or 200 per house, rather than the 1 tree per building that Cllr Wood had suggested during his address on the climate change emergency motion.\nIt’s clear that neither Labour nor the Conservatives are prepared to take the difficult decisions that are needed to combat the climate emergency. Labour were far more concerned not to be seen to be challenging inflated housing need figures proposed by their colleagues on the city council, whist the Conservatives simply want to be facilitators for large wealthy landowners in the area including the university. The location of the housing clearly has more to do with the university’s ambitions than it does with genuine housing allocation priorities. Either way it ends up with unnecessary and unaffordable housing being built that locals will have no access to on the green spaces at the heart of their community. This is a stitch-up perpetrated on the people of south Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Gosford!\nLibdem Councillor and spokesperson for the Progressive Oxfordshire group, Katherine Tyson said “These plans will simply expand the city’s appalling air quality into our rural community. At one point Labour councillor and vice-chairperson of the council Hannah Banfield seemed to suggest that, as Banbury residents had accepted bad air quality as a result of housing development in their area, the people of south Cherwell should just do the same. The argument that one ward coming to peace with poisoning their residents and children doesn’t mean that another ward should also poison their constituents. That’s not good enough for Cherwell residents. It beggars belief that such a comment could be made from a Labour councillor just after we had voted in favour of a climate change emergency motion”\nThe motion to pause the local review pending the outcome of the examination of the city council local plan and to separately consult on the university’s plans in Begbroke and Yarnton was successfully amended by the Labour group to an undertaking to review the allocation sites for the 4400 houses. It was carried by Labour with Conservatives abstaining on the vote. The subsequent motion was defeated by 16 votes to 23.",

Unfortunately, time restraints on the programme prevented me from laying out the full details, but I’m happy to do so here :\n- Losses in the last financial year attributable to Castle Quay – £1.6m\n- Losses predicted in the next financial year due to Castle Quay – approx £1.6m\n- Rent owed to Cherwell District Council at this point – nearly £2m\n- Loss in value of Castle Quay shopping centre since the council took full ownership – over £30m (it’s now worth less than half what they paid for it 4 years ago)\n- Additional investment being ploughed into expanding the centre – £73m (underwritten by council tax payers)\n- Interest on the loans to finance all this (so far) – £2m+ per year\n- Cuts required to the entire council budget this year – £4.4m\nYes some of this can be blamed on the pandemic, but retail was already on the decline when the council took the frankly bizarre decision to buy the scheme, especially as it’s clear that they have no real vision for how to revitalise the development other than the idea that making it bigger will somehow make it better. That and Cllr Ilott’s head in the sand optimism seems to be the main strategy from our Conservative councillors.\nI don’t see that as good value for the council tax payers of Cherwell. Judging by Cllr Illott’s flippancy and lack of concern he seems to regard massive financial losses along with the associated financial impact on resident’s pockets as fine as long as he can get some chicken.\nI’d say that taking all that into account that’s going to be a pretty expensive chicken dinner for the residents of Cherwell!\nAnd let’s not forget that all this money is going into one town in Cherwell – Banbury. Meanwhile Bicester town centre’s retail area is being hollowed out due to the council’s planning decisions elsewhere, and the whole of the district – every single tax payer – is footing the bill for all this incompetence. As is often the case with Cherwell Council , the south of the district is left to fend for itself and pick up the tab. If I were a cynical soul I might suggest that this is because the majority of support for the councillors who agreed to this whole adventure comes from the north of the district.\nBut I think we should all be able to rely on decent fiscal management from our local councillors, no matter where we live. Sadly it seems clear to me that we can’t expect this as long as the Conservatives are in charge.\nIt’s about time the Tories got a proper grip on council finances and stopped playing chicken with all our money!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_ukip/content_136.html": "This is a piece I wrote for Huffington Post earlier this week. I think it speaks for itself, although after it was published I thought I should have pointed out that none of the the politicians I refer to in the studio on election night were Greens. As usual we weren’t invited to the BBC party. There were however representatives from Labour, Conservative, Libdems and UKIP. Given that the Greens had a reasonably good showing in the last General Election in Rochester (for a ‘marginal’ party) I’d have thought we’d have been worth a mention at least. But apparently not.\nAnyway I hope this serves as a good first post on my website/blog and you can see the original article here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/westminster-politics_b_6199214.html?utm_hp_ref=tw.\nFeel free to comment below or on the original article on the Huffington Post site.\nI recently became a parliamentary candidate for the Green Party. After years of railing against politicians, the irony, and perhaps the hypocrisy, of becoming one myself has not been lost on me.\nThen again, there were the constant jibes about my complaining a lot but doing nothing positive to make a change. So when my local party group asked me to stand, I said I’d give it a go. And here I am. Feel free to point the finger.\nOne of the first things I’ve noticed about the underbelly of politics is just how strategic it is. Target wards, target seats, candidates standing in constituencies where they don’t live for the sake of political expediency. None of this is new, or unusual, or even un-democratic, but it does take some getting used to.\nBut watching the BBC election special on the Rochester and Strood by-election, you could be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the political world has turned into some kind of wife swapping party from the mid 70s. It seems these days that political manoeuvring between the ruling parties has moved beyond juggling their own family jewels, and has been reduced to chucking their keys into the fruit bowl with anyone who fancies a quick fumble with their majority.\nFirstly we had UKIP’s Deputy Chairperson Suzanne Evans being interviewed about where her party would go after the predicted win in Rochester. This consisted of a serious of nods and winks about who might and might not leap out of their own party bed and sneak into theirs when the neighbours weren’t looking. A sort of Carry-On Westminster, but with less laughs.\nShe then went on to explain, with barely concealed glee, that her fondest ambition was to seduce someone from Labour to join in their little tryst. Nigel is apparently talking to a couple of MPs but she couldn’t reveal more. She did everything but tap the side of her nose, elbow Andrew Neil in the ribs and give a little Babs Windsor giggle.\nThen we had an analysis from a political expert explaining how UKIP’s performance in the by-election would determine how other sitting MPs would behave in the run up to next years general election. His premise was that if UKIP did well in Rochester, many other career politicians would be considering their position in the next few months. The expectation is apparently that if they think UKIP is a better bet for them to hold on to their seat (ooh matron!), then they would switch allegiances in order to do so.\nNow you’ll have to excuse me. I’m quite new to this game. But when one joins a party isn’t there something about ideology written into the contract? Or am I now being ridiculously naive?\nJudging by the behaviour of at least two recent pantheons of British democracy I suppose I am. It seems that standing on a platform with a bunch of like minded individuals in the hope of doing something good for the country isn’t what it’s about any more.\nNo, apparently it’s more about hanging on to the House Of Commons parking place, the expense account, and access to the House of Commons bar, rather than the boring stuff like philosophical conviction. Some back-benchers are evidently more interested in maintaining a comfortable position for themselves, rather than for their constituents. Yet, in true British carry-on style, they still keep getting elected.\nAs a newcomer to this world, I saw with fresh eyes last night these four sombre suited politicians sitting uneasily with each other, smugly carving up the political cake amongst themselves. Like children at birthday party trying to decide who gets the last portion of jelly and ice cream, the polemic was about anything other than the issues that this country and the planet really face.\nIain Duncan Smith spent a good deal of his time justifying a particularly vituperative campaign poster that portrayed the idea of voting for Mark Reckless as on a par with seeking Pol Pot as a spiritual adviser. Reckless used to be an investment banker, he didn’t live in the area, he’d only moved there to take a safe seat. All very salient points for the local electorate, but ones that seemed exquisitely irrelevant when he was the Conservative MP only a few months ago.\nMeanwhile UKIP expounded their claim that they listened to the people, and were offering an alternative to the status quo of careerist politicians who’d never done a days honest labour in their lives. Odd then that their success last night, and in Clacton a few weeks ago, relied on exactly the reverse of those ideals by welcoming with open arms two MPs firmly rooted in the rotten political establishment they claimed to despise.\nOn the point of principle I am in total agreement with them. The current political establishment has reduced democracy to the level of swapping football cards in the playground. But it’s a tawdry game of top trumps that they have just as much of a hand in as all the other entrenched Westminster parties.\nIf this is the future of politics in this country, I’m glad to be a member of a party that currently stands as an exemplar of how it is still possible to operate democratically without playing these cynical games. We may now have one less MP than UKIP, but at least ours is there on merit, rather than because she swapped her rosette for a more appealing colour.\nAnd Caroline Lucas has just won MP of the year, which is something that gives me hope. Even so, she’s now the focus of a campaign to unseat her by the Labour party in Brighton, because, and despite of the fact, that Labour and the Greens share many of the same aims.\nMoreover, if all these people care about is hanging on to their positions at all costs, what really is the point? And if the electorate is so fickle that they can’t see through this charade, maybe we deserve the graceless, flagitious mess they all seem to be making of the world.\nOne apocryphal anecdote from Rochester I heard today was that someone had voted UKIP because the sitting Tory MP hadn’t done enough for the local area. If that’s true, it’s an indictment of the great British voter more demoralising than anything supposedly implied by hanging a flag out of the window of your mock-Georgian semi.\nBut as an accidental politician I have to hope that it isn’t true, or at least typical. I have to trust that people in the UK will see past all the identikit politicos, the vested interests and the horse trading of their democratic heritage, and vote for real change and genuine representation in the next government.\nI am ever the optimist.",

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_page_3/content_194.html": "So in the words of Dolly Parton – Here I come again!\nNo sooner had we got past the District Council elections than we were thrown into a General Election that I and most other pundits had assumed would be held in October or even November.\nTheories as to why we’ve been dragged into the whole merry-go-round again at this premature juncture range from speculation about the likely state of the economy and the reduction in inflation, which no political party can realistically take credit for (although the Tories are trying), to the idea that Rishi and his Tory mates needed to get their CVs in for some cushy consultancy gigs before the end of the year.\nThe other likely reason of course is that there was a chance that a vote of no confidence could be called in Mr Sunak and he wanted to leave the political sphere (as he is likely to do) on the high of being the actual PM, if only in terms of his name badge.\nWhatever the reason, here we are having been given only a short 6 weeks to make our case to the electorate, which for parties like the Greens, without the financial and operational reserves of some of the other parties is something of a tall order. But we’re used to tall orders. In the face of what seems like a deliberate policy of starving us of media attention in favour of far more ratings grabbing pint-swilling politico-celebs like Nigel Farage, we’re still garnering support from credible commentators and respected political analysts for both our economic and social justice proposals.\nFormer Citibank financial trader Gary Stevenson and host of the You Tube Channel Gary’s Economics has analysed the Green Party manifesto and classified it as the most credible and honest in real terms. In a recent video he confirmed that he would be voting Green because we are the only party to be offering a radical and workable alternative to the proposals from every other party.\nTrade Unionist and former General Secretary of the Labour Party Jennie Formby has also announced on Twitter that she would be voting Green in this election along with numerous other high profile political and cultural leaders such as George Monbiot. It’s also reported that more and more young people are turning to the Greens as a real alternative to the ping-pong politics of the past 50 years.\nAs a moderate Green myself I’ve always seen the Greens as a true alternative vote, neither left or right. The Green Party officially rejects the traditional left–right political spectrum, describing it as “something of an anachronism” and that perfectly fits with my view on the world.\nI’m standing as the Parliamentary Candidate for Bicester and Woodstock mainly because it’s my home constituency and the place I’ve made my home for 32 years. But above all that, it’s a place I’ve seen change drastically in that time with even more drastic changes in the pipeline. From the massive development plans in and around Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Bicester with large areas of greenbelt being decimated by ill-conceived local plans to proposals to armour plate 3500 acres of green fields and farmland for hugely unpopular solar farm project in the west. I’m concerned about what these things will do to the place I’ve called home for nearly half my life.\nThere’s obviously going to be a lot more to say on this election in the remaining 2 weeks, much of which I’ve not said so far due to dealing with my new responsibilities on Cherwell District Council after being appointed to the executive on the same night that the General Election was announced (great timing Rishi!). But I’ll be breaking my silence over the next 2 weeks.\nIn the meantime, doors are being knocked, leaflets are being delivered and pollsters are polling. There’s been a huge amount of speculation about who can win in this constituency and I’m not going to add to that with my own obviously biased opinions. But with a newly drawn boundary, every voter has the historic opportunity to vote in a brand new Westminster constituency for the first time where we could all buck the trends and help me and the Greens to show that any prediction in an unknown and untested area could be drastically inaccurate.\nCan I win? Who knows? Am I serious about my candidacy? Absolutely! But then as anyone who knows me and knows my work as a local councillor and activist would tell you, I never do things by half measures. We all know that the Tories are finished, at least for the immediate future. We don’t need to vote tactically on a local basis in this election because after 14 years of chaos the country has finally woken up and are about to consign the current administration to the political skip.\nThat gives every voter in this area new opportunities and new possibilities. You can vote with your heart and for what you believe in. If that’s a better future for you and your family, a fully funded NHS and social care system, public utilities returned to responsible public control (particular water and energy), a better standard of living for all, raising millions out of poverty and protecting climate and nature, voting Green really is the only alternative. Even if I don’t win the seat, a vote for me that would contribute to a large swing to the Greens nationally will strengthen our hand in influencing national politics for the better. It will also put money into the party coffers through Short Money to help us continue the fight for a better, fairer, greener world for you and you family and their families to come.\nI’ll do my best over the next couple of weeks to make my case for your precious vote in this election and I hope you will seriously consider giving me that vote on July 4th. You should shortly be receiving leaflets from me explaining my priorities. You can also browse this website which is being updated with local issues that I think will be important in the upcoming election. I will also be adding new topics in the next few days. If you want hear me speak in the meantime, I was interviewed by Byline Times recently and was able to cover many topics that I think will be important to voters in this election. You can see that here.\nThere are also a number of hustings that you can attend to ask questions of me and the other candidates. These are :\n7.30pm – 24th June – Kidlington Methodist Church (forum on poverty)\n7.30pm – 25th June – St. Mary Magdelene Church, Park St, Woodstock\n7pm – 26th June – St Edburg Church Bicester\n6.30pm – 1st July – CPRE Country side and Environment hustings at Yarnton Village Hall\nI look forward to seeing as many people at those events as possible. If anyone would like to extend other invitations I am more than happy to come along. If any other events come up I will post them here and on my social media channels.\nRemember – this is the election where YOU get to vote FOR what YOU believe in, rather than AGAINST what you don’t.\nIf you’d like to get involved in my campaign please drop me a line at ian.middleton@greenoxford.com\nYou could also contribute to my joint fundraiser to help me and my 2 fellow North and West Oxfordshire candidates reach more voters in this campaign.

The Green Party believes this is unfair, so we’d ensure that the NHS and care services are fully equipped to deal with our ageing population, with free personal and nursing care for all older people.\nWith such things as a potential dementia time bomb in the making, care for the elderly should concern us all, not just for ourselves, but for the generations that come after us.\nThe Green Party would provide everyone with a non-means tested citizens pension. This would be paid to all pensioners regardless of contribution record, so no pensioner will live in poverty.\nWe would also provide free social care for all into their older age which would be incorporated into the NHS",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2014_12_page_2/content_96.html": "The government announced plans today for a new ‘Garden City’ to be built on ex-MOD land on the outskirts of Bicester in Oxfordshire. The proposals will be backed by £100M of government funds and will include ‘sustainable’ transport infrastructure, green spaces and new local amenities.\nOn the face of it this could be a boost for Bicester, but I suspect the devil will be in the details.\nMuch of the announcement seems to cover projects that are already in planning or underway. The new railway station for example. There’s also some confusion over if this is to be a re-imagining of the much vaunted eco-village or an entirely new project.\nIt is encouraging however to see that the project is to be built on a brown field site.\nConfusingly, the definition of a ‘garden city’ is being left to the developer’s imaginations with the government saying it doesn’t want to “impose any definition of what garden cities are”. This could likely mean we’ll end up with another estate full of either ‘luxury homes’ that ordinary people can’t afford, or shoe-boxes crammed together to generate maximum profit. That would probably mean any aspirations to provide gardens and green space will go right out the window.\nIf Nick Clegg really wants this to be development different from all the other clone estates thrown up around the country, I’m afraid he’s going to have to nail his colours to some sort of mast and properly define his intentions. But that might prove more difficult than a glib press release full of utopian imagery.\nThere would also need to be a clear vision that the people living in this new ‘city’ will be contributing to the local economy and society as well as working in it. With a train station on the doorstep, such a development could easily become a dormitory for London commuters or a sink hole of buy-to-let properties.\nAffordability will be the key. If these homes are intended for people on middle and lower incomes, then I’d support the idea. But I suspect such values won’t be compatible with what Nick Clegg sees as a ‘garden city’.\nPersonally I’d like to see more genuine thinking along these lines, subject to the above caveats. But ultimately this may all just come to nothing.\nSo many of these big legacy projects either evaporate into the ether once they’ve generated enough headlines, or turn into something very different once the realities of cost, demand and political will begin to bite.\nThere’s a veritable tsunami of these grandiose announcements coming out from government at the moment though. Like the spurious claims for new spending on road infrastructures announced earlier this week, many of them are just old or existing projects being re-launched as new spend to give the impression of a go-ahead administration full of exciting possibilities for the future.\nAnyone would think there was an election round the corner!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_liberal-democrats/content_219.html": "Another election fought and another campaign behind us n Cherwell\nIt was very solid result for the Greens in Kidlington East with a convincing second place well above Labour and a tripling of our 2016 vote. Moreover a spectacular win for my electoral partner, Libdem candidate Alaric Rose in Kidlington West who nearly doubled the Libdem vote and completely wiped the floor with the Conservatives!\nIt would have been great to have won my seat as well, but with such a short campaign it was hard to get the message out to enough people. Ultimately it was a total validation for both of us of our decision to work together for the common good.\nSlightly galling that the Carmen Griffiths kept her seat as I understand she was hardly seen on the campaign trail. She wasn’t at the count, didn’t make an appearance on polling day (to my knowledge) and instead sat back and let local Tory cult figures like Maurice Billington do all the campaigning for her.\nJudging by her attendance record at council meetings this seems to be a pattern of behaviour for a pretty lacklustre councillor. I think many of the voters in the ward didn’t actually know which blue candidate they were voting for and seemed oblivious to the fact that there were more dedicated candidates on offer who would much more effectively represent them in Cherwell.\nPerhaps when Carmen and her remaining Tory colleagues fail to turn up at other key planning meetings and the green belt is concreted over, bringing with it traffic chaos, pollution, and the collapse of local infrastructure, all those that trooped into the polling station to dutifully put a cross in the Tory box, regardless of the candidate, will realise their mistake. It might be a bit late then though.\nOne other stark reality from the results is that if Labour had endorsed me (as we suggested) and we had endorsed them in one of the North Oxfordshire wards (as we offered) we would both have easily won our seats, meaning a new Labour, Green and Libdem seat on the council and 3 Tory losses instead of 1. Just imagine what sort of message that would have sent out! Especially on important and urgent local issues like the building on green belt in the area.\nLabour really need to wake up to the reality of fractured left politics in this country and work with other parties like the Greens and the Libdems. We need to stop living in the past and embrace the future. There’s more that unites us than divides us and if we’re going to stop yet another Conservative government in 2022 we must start building alliances. If anyone from Labour wants to talk, I’m all ears.\nIn the meantime I intend to go on being a thorn in the side of Cherwell’s complacent Tory leadership and will be working closely with Alaric as part of our pre-election co-operative agreement. I may not be able to vote on council matters, but I can certainly speak up in the council chamber and outside in the media. I’ll be fighting hard on local green belt and conservation issues and keeping a wary eye on the attendance record of my Tory opponent. The Greens will be fighting the elections in the ward once again next year and I hope that will again be in partnership with the Liberal Democrats.\nFinally a big thank you to everyone who voted for me and to the dedicated people who helped us pull together such a professional campaign in such a short time. the Greens made historic gains across the country yesterday and I think it’s a credit to all our members that we can do this stuff on such a small budgets and with small teams. Just think what we could do in government!\nStay tuned and follow this website/blog for updates on what I and the Green Party will be doing between now and the next elections.\nVoteGreen#2019",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2023_04_30_tory-posturing-on-potholes-is-full-of-holes/content_3.html": "OK, I’ll agree, the state of our roads in Oxfordshire is shocking.\nAs I journey around the district on my bike and by car I can see the number of cracks, holes and ravines as much as any other other road user and the situation is unacceptable.\nBut our roads didn’t get into this state in just the last 2 years!\nThe Conservatives have been grandstanding in this election about potholes and blaming the Lib Dem/Labour/Green coalition on the County Council for the situation. But it’s no worse now than it was under the last Conservative controlled administration. In fact it’s probably a bit better in terms of how responsive our road management team are.\nI appreciate that seeing so many potholes is frustrating. I’m reporting them every day and they have become more numerous recently after the changeable weather. Crews are out every day fixing them but it’s a battle to try to get the worst ones prioritised and everyone understandably wants to see those in their area fixed first. But the problem with repairing them is not lack of willingness by the council, it’s lack of money/resources.\nNot a new problem\nDuring the last year of the Tory run administration on OCC a story was run in the Oxford Mail which reported that an insurance company had ranked Oxfordshire fifth worst for the number of potholes reported between 2015 and 2018. Figures showed 93,112 potholes were reported during that period amounting to 19.6 potholes per km of road.\nThe figures, from The Insurance Emporium, showed other areas worse than Oxfordshire include East Riding of Yorkshire, Northamptonshire, Edinburgh and in top spot Devon as the worst for potholes. From personal experience I’d add our sister county Buckinghamshire to that list having driven though there recently, their roads make ours look like billiard tables!\nBut the current state of the roads is something that has been building up for years due to lack of investment by successive governments. I’m not even going to blame the Conservatives for it (as they are trying to do to us now) except to say that, as a Conservative administration themselves, they could probably have leant on the government a bit more to stump up some extra cash for repairs instead of borrowing their way out of the problem and saddling us with yet more debt that taxpayers will carry for years. Even then they still didn’t sort the problem out, because quite frankly it’s not sortable without massive investment.\nOxfordshire’s highways need about £45m a year just to stop them getting any worse. The council get less than a third of that from government and another third from local taxation. Some of the remaining third is covered by borrowing that was taken out by the previous administration that will run out in 2025 (although we’ll be paying millions in interest for many years to come). No one really knows where the funding will come from to cover that when that happens. A good chunk of that funding also goes on bridge repairs, and as many of you will have noticed, our bridges are also falling apart as well and if we have a catastrophic bridge failure the result could be a lot more serious than a puncture!\nOur existing roads, are essentially worn out due to lack of proper maintenance for decades. The main cause of this is lack of central government funding made worse by the austerity measures during the last 10 years. It would now cost billions across the county to bring them all up to a decent standard and that doesn’t include pathways.\nIn the meantime the government forces local authorities to build more roads through “growth schemes” tied to essential housing that they won’t provide enough funding to maintain in the future. So the deficit continues to widen.\nPlaying politics\nLets stop playing politics over potholes. Every party blames the other for the state of the roads , but ultimately it’s a matter of investment. We all hate potholes and we all know they shouldn’t be there, but it’s daft to suggest that not fixing them is a deliberate choice for any controlling administration. If we had the spare money, don’t you think we’d spend it just to get the problem off our desks? And before people jump on the usual “if you didn’t spend it on this or that, you could fix X number of potholes” remember that government is all about making those decisions. A few £100K here or there is never going to fix the problems we have with road maintenance now we need billions if we’re going to sort this mess out.\nAs an administration we are absolutely focussed on doing the best with what we have on pothole repairs. The response time on repairs is now much better, but I accept there’s still room for improvement, particularly in terms of the longevity of some of the repairs. But we are going to need serious cash if we’re going to meet residents’ expectations and any politician who tells you otherwise is just using this issue as a campaigning tool. The only ways to get those funds is an increase in council tax, a reduction in other vital services or a very significant injection of funding from the government – and I don’t mean the paltry £3m or so that they recently announced for Oxfordshire coincidentally just before the local elections!\nSo if you really want to see a longer term systemic improvement you need to lobby the government to properly support local authorities. While you’re at it, you could mention a similar situation with health and social care, especially as they’ve just cut promised funding for carers in half!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_libraries/content_183.html": "Who’d have thought that a small but effective local community initiative in an Oxfordshire town would attract such global attention? The Banbury Phone Box Library is one such brilliant piece of local engagement which is now garnering international attention as BT looks towards chopping it off at the knees.\nThe red phone box is almost as iconic as the red bus as a national symbol of Britain around the world. You’d think if you were company who owns and operates these highly visible pieces of cultural capital you’d be only too pleased to see them being involved in well supported local campaigns that add value to a service that is perhaps not as loved as it once was.\nIn that context it seems daft to me that BT are hell bent on annoying small and large communities across the country by removing public call boxes where they’re valued for numerous reasons other than a quick natter on the phone. It’s even more self-defeating that they’re erasing some of the very symbols of Britishness that have helped them build a world class multi-national company.\nIt has to be said that the Town Council in Banbury share some of the potential blame if the box is removed, as they are refusing to adopt it (something that BT now allow for the princely sum of £1), if BT go ahead with plans to decommission the phone service in the box. Previously they struck a deal with BT to adopt the box and save the library and a local steel fabrication firm offered to fix permanent shelves in the box to house the books to assuage BT’s prior objections to the library service on health and safety grounds, as they believed the current shelving arrangements could be dangerous.\nBT now claims that it is uneconomic for them to continue to run the service anyway, even though I understand thousands of calls were made from it last year.\nThe under-story seems to be that BT want out of the call box game at any cost, and most of that cost will be borne by local communities using the boxes for a number of vital social services or simply to make a call when other options are not available to them.\nBanbury Town Council now say that they’re not prepared to adopt the box if it is then decommissioned by BT. Whilst I support taking a stance against the loss of the phone service, I think it would be a sad loss to the community of the box were to be removed as a result of the Town Council refusing to adopt the box itself.\nMoreover, If BT are claiming the box is loss making, I think it would be useful for them to provide the figures backing that up. It would at least give us an idea of the likely shortfall which could perhaps be covered in some other way.\nIt’s also crazy that BT are missing this as an opportunity for some very positive PR. It has to be said that they’re not universally loved as a company, so something like this, that is fairly minimal in cost terms, would seem to be a great way for them to connect with the community.\nGoing forward perhaps the government needs to bring in a legal requirement on telecoms companies like this to provide a certain number of public call points in an area. Just because most of us carry mobiles now, doesn’t mean that sometimes they might not fail at a vital time, or have been forgotten when they’re most needed. I know BT used to be obliged to seek permission from local or parish councils in order to remove a box, but it sounds like that requirement has now been watered down. In very rural areas mobile phone reception is also notoriously patchy. In those areas call boxes provide a vital service for emergency calls.\nIn terms of usage statistics, it might also be interesting to track the number of calls made against the minimum price of a call in a phone box, which I understand is now 60p. Perhaps BT need to be reminded of the law of supply and demand.\nIf you’re on Twitter you can follow and support the campaign to save the Banbury Phone Box Library by following the hashtag #SaveOurPhoneboxLibrary",

But is it really?\nTwo parties are saying they would provide change, but only one is offering REAL change and REAL hope – The Green Party.\nThe Labour Party slogan ‘Change’ is so reductive and self fulfilling it’s almost worthless as an electoral ambition. Will Labour provide change? Well yes, if they’re elected as the majority government we will see a change by definition. Where there was once Rishi Sunak, there will be Keir Starmer. A clear change of leader and administration, but is that all we want? Will we see REAL change? I rather doubt it.\nLabour’s manifesto suggests otherwise with so many policies seemingly just a continuation of what we have with the Tories. Things like the Bedroom Tax, The Two Child Benefit cap, a continuation of the oil and gas drilling licences granted by the Conservatives, including the highly questionable Rosebank. None of that will change and neither will things like private provision in the NHS or a really progressive tax regime.\nSo what real change will we see with Labour, or any of the other parties for that matter? It looks like the only thing that will be changing will be the climate!\nEven the Liberal Democrats haven’t really committed to change on important things like tax reform or tuition fees which of course they were instrumental in bringing in. Their candidate in Bicester & Woodstock is a well meaning guy, but he was also an adviser to the coalition government during the first period of austerity, as was the Conservative candidate, so not much change for the better there!\nCan I win in Bicester and Woodstock? That depends on you, the voters. It’s a circular argument that Greens can’t win so we don’t get votes, but if we don’t get votes we can’t win. But even if I don’t win my purpose is still to raise more awareness of the Green Party and our values. A party I’ve supported for 12 years and voted for for even longer, back when they were even more unlikely to be elected. Since then there’s been a huge surge in support for Greens, something I’ve seen first hand after being elected to 5 different councils as a Green and re-elected to one of those since.\nIf the Green Party didn’t exist and people hadn’t voted for them, do you think the other parties would have taken any notice of climate change or other Green issues? I very much doubt it and that’s even more obvious now that parties like Labour and the Conservatives are backing away from their climate change commitments because to stick by them is electorally inconvenient.\nSo the Greens have brought about real change over the past decade and will continue to push for more in the coming years, especially as we are looking set to at least triple our representation in Westminster. Change on things like the NHS, social care, social security, justice, equal rights, animal welfare, nature recovery, climate change and so much more.\nI’d of course love to be one of those parliamentarians helping to make those changes, as our new MPs will do through careful lobbying and internal pressure on whomever is in power by the end of this week. But I know that’s unlikely. But every vote for me and every other Green candidate still counts. It counts as part of the message the whole country needs to send to Westminster, even more so as the ruling party is likely to have a majority so large that they probably won’t be in the mood to listen to anyone else.\nBut I have faith that Greens will always find a way to move the needle and work for positive change. And I’ll continue to do that whatever happens in the polls on Thursday. I’m content to play a role, no matter how small in helping to make the future a brighter place for the next generation. Your vote can help me and every other Green candidate to do that, so I hope you’ll give that thought some serious consideration when you mark that cross on the ballot sheet.\nThe polls suggest that the outcome to this election is a foregone conclusion. Labour will comfortably win a huge majority and in Bicester & Woodstock the Lib Dems will romp home. If nothing else people will vote for them just to stop them sending any more leaflets! So you can safely vote Green, knowing it’s extremely unlikely to change that outcome.\nSo more than ever in this election you can vote with your heart to make real change happen. Change that means more than a different name on the House of Commons letterhead. Otherwise we’ll be right back here in 5 or 10 years time, probably with the Conservatives promising the change that we never really seem to get.\nAs someone else said during this election “If you want change you have to vote for it”. If you want REAL change you have to vote Green!",

Brenda of Bristol must furious!\nJoking aside, I must admit I was surprised to find myself thrown into another election so soon after winning 3 local council seats in May.\nBut it seems that our strong and stable government can’t manage to hang on for any longer than a coupe of years at most these days, even with the so-called fixed- term Parliament Act!\nThis just goes to show how desperately we need electoral reform in this country, a system by which more than one party can contribute to the process of government and more than one set of opinions can be taken into account.\nIt seems that, far from our first past the post system giving us a government of unity and decisiveness, when it comes to the most monumental political upheaval in a generation, we simply can’t agree on anything!\nIn those circumstances we have to go back to the country and hope that the numbers stack up differently afterwards. Somehow I suspect they won’t. While we cling to our broken 2 party state, we will just see-saw backwards and forwards between opposing positions.\nOn the key issue of Brexit, Labour are still offering a confused position, saying they would re-negotiate the deal with the EU and then put it to the people. That’s a great in principle, but in practice it means Labour will presumably be rooting for their new deal in any subsequent vote. That, by any sensible definition, makes them a party of leave.\nThe Libdems simply want to ignore the 2016 vote and treat Brexit like it never happened. Whilst that’s an attractive prospect for those of us who would rather remain, it’s not a way to resolve the political schism in our country at the moment.\nThe 2016 result was hardly decisive as it showed a split right down the middle of the argument. We could probably have run the vote again the following day and got a different result!\nThe only way to properly heal this country is with a second referendum as soon as possible after the election. No more deals being negotiated, no more simply pushing the Brexit button out of expediency (as the Tories would have us do), but a properly informed, final say on the direction this country will take and what is in the best interests of everyone.\nPersonally, if that second vote still comes out as leave I’m done on the subject of Brexit. I’m quite happy to let the chips fall where they may and shift my focus to trying to prepare the country for what I think will be the most damaging decade in history since the last war.\nBut to those who say we shouldn’t have a second vote, I’d point to the fact that we’re now having our third national vote since 2015! If ‘the will of the people’ really was the main driving force in our democracy, we’d keep the government we voted for in 2015, regardless of the wishes of the government at the time. But we haven’t.\nSo if we can have 3 general elections in 4 years, why not a confirmatory vote on something that was decided by a small minority three and a half years ago, when we didn’t know what we know now? Something that could impact on all our futures and those of generations to come. Why is that to be decided on just one vote?\nI really don’t know why anyone should object to the idea of a People’s Vote. If the will of the people hasn’t changed, the result will be the same. The only reason I can see that the Brexit contingent would object to another vote, is that they think they will lose it.\nIn which case they know in their heart of hearts that the mood of the country has changed. They know that the vote in 2016 was probably a fluke, and they’re terrified of the genuine will of the people being followed now. they simply want to railroad us all into the abyss before anyone realised what’s happening. That’s no way to run a country!\nSo let’s get on with this election and I hope vote in some more Green MPs who can influence Westminster enough to resolve the national insanity we seem to have thrown ourselves into over Brexit.\nWe don’t need to get Brexit done. We need to do away with it once and for all!",

In my opinion, this has been slipped into the review under false pretences, given that this has nothing to do with housing need in Oxford. As a result there’s mounting local criticism of the university’s ambitions to commandeer at least 1000 of the houses intended to meet Oxford’s needs for its own use as part of a new campus at Begbroke and Yarnton.\nChair of the Cherwell Development Watch Alliance, Giles Lewis, spoke in favour of the motion at the packed meeting and read out emails between the council and the university, obtained under and FOI request, that suggested plans to allow the university to expand in the area were already being supported as long ago as 2016.\nThe Labour group on the council then introduced an amendment which blocked any re-consideration of housing need numbers, even though this might mean more houses that were needed would be built on green belt.\nI pointed out that just to offset the amount of carbon produced in building the unaffordable and unneeded houses in the first place would take 572,000 trees over 10 years, or 200 per house, rather than the 1 tree per building that Cllr Wood had suggested during his address on the climate change emergency motion.\nIt’s clear that neither Labour nor the Conservatives are prepared to take the difficult decisions that are needed to combat the climate emergency. Labour were far more concerned not to be seen to be challenging inflated housing need figures proposed by their colleagues on the city council, whist the Conservatives simply want to be facilitators for large wealthy landowners in the area including the university. The location of the housing clearly has more to do with the university’s ambitions than it does with genuine housing allocation priorities. Either way it ends up with unnecessary and unaffordable housing being built that locals will have no access to on the green spaces at the heart of their community. This is a stitch-up perpetrated on the people of south Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Gosford!\nLibdem Councillor and spokesperson for the Progressive Oxfordshire group, Katherine Tyson said “These plans will simply expand the city’s appalling air quality into our rural community. At one point Labour councillor and vice-chairperson of the council Hannah Banfield seemed to suggest that, as Banbury residents had accepted bad air quality as a result of housing development in their area, the people of south Cherwell should just do the same. The argument that one ward coming to peace with poisoning their residents and children doesn’t mean that another ward should also poison their constituents. That’s not good enough for Cherwell residents. It beggars belief that such a comment could be made from a Labour councillor just after we had voted in favour of a climate change emergency motion”\nThe motion to pause the local review pending the outcome of the examination of the city council local plan and to separately consult on the university’s plans in Begbroke and Yarnton was successfully amended by the Labour group to an undertaking to review the allocation sites for the 4400 houses. It was carried by Labour with Conservatives abstaining on the vote. The subsequent motion was defeated by 16 votes to 23.",

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_page_19/content_458.html": "I love a bit of comedy as much as the next person, but I do sometimes wish comedians would stay out of politics.\nIn 2015 Russell Brand advised young people not to vote as part of his personal philosophy of half-baked revolution. As a result he bears some of the blame for a Conservative majority borne on the backs of the large number of older voters who didn’t see the 2 minutes it took to mark an X on a ballot sheet as so desperately uncool.\nThis time we have Ricky Gervais leaping into the fray with this tweet :\n“OK. I’m not telling you how to vote, but this is a fact. The only vote that will keep Theresa May out is a vote for @jeremycorbyn. Cheers”\nWhilst not quite so devoid of acumen as Brand’s ill-conceived advice, Ricky’s more well meaning call to action could be equally as dangerous.\nEssentially he IS telling his fans how to vote, and his less politically astute followers may not realise the pitfalls of such a binary choice.\nThe reality is that in many constituencies a vote for Corybn will not keep Theresa May out. The real fact is that it may do the exact opposite.\nSadly, even after repeated calls from other parties to enter into an ad-hoc alliance, Labour has resolutely refused to stand aside in any constituency. Whereas, for example, The Green Party has done so now in well over 30 seats.\nIn many of those seats the Libdems have a much better chance of winning than Labour. In some others the Greens or the SNP could have it in the bag. Voting Labour could then very well help the Tories by splitting the opposition.\nBy selling the idea that a vote for Labour is a vote against the Tories, no matter where you are, The Labour party and many of its supporters could be handing another victory to the Conservatives.\nI’m not usually an advocate of tactical voting, but needs must when the devil drives, and I see the devil behind the eyes of the Conservatives. But tactical voting has to be just that. It doesn’t simply mean voting Labour as the only alternative.\nUnder our broken electoral system the only place votes really count are in marginal constituencies. Until we get electoral reform and a system of proportional representation, that won’t change. And let’s not forget that Labour supports our first past the post system just as much as the Tories do.\nBut even in a safe seat your vote can make a real difference. In 2015 UKIP gave the Conservatives a real run for their money. Even though they only won one seat in Parliament they put the Tories on notice that they were there, close behind, snapping at their heels.\nThe result was the delivery of a referendum on EU membership and the subsequent lurch to the right that followed in the footsteps of Theresa May. The Conservative manifesto, such as it is, represents one of the most extreme right outlooks for the UK for many generations. It makes Margaret Thatcher’s vision look like a tie-dyed, rose tinted call to action for the love generation. It has even been compared to the BNP’s warped ideological ramblings from the 1980s, and not without cause.\nThis can be directly traced to UKIP’s influence and its validation of ideals that make a hard line, right wing agenda more palatable to people who wouldn’t dream of dancing to the tune of more overtly hard right parties.\nLikewise the nomination and election of Jeremy Corbyn can, to a large extent, be laid at the feet of the Green Party. There can’t be many Greens who haven’t noticed just how many of our clothes have recently been stolen by Corbyn’s party. And many of us are happy to be standing here in our underwear, glad that so many of our policies have been subsumed into the Labour manifesto. The sincerest form of flattery and all that.\nBut it has to be remembered that the rise of Green membership and our increasing success in both national and local elections is arguably a major driving force behind Labour’s newly rediscovered left wing credentials and a strong Green vote will help them keep that focus.\nVoting for parties that may not be mainstream, and may not have a chance of winning is not a wasted vote. Even less so in constituencies where the seat is safer than a Roy Chubby Brown joke at a UKIP convention. A vote for the party that more closely reflects your views has a demonstrable impact on those do so to a lesser extent.\nIn the case of Labour, voting for them in constituencies they can’t win may not just prevent other parties from doing so, it also reinforces the status quo of a de facto two party state and removes Labour’s incentive to join an alliance or support electoral reform if, as is still being predicted, they don’t have a majority on June 9th.\nEven if Labour were to win, there’s a very good chance that Corbyn could be unseated early on in his reign, by a parliamentary party who still don’t wholeheartedly support him. Without the threat of other left wing alternatives looking over their shoulders, it’s entirely possible that Labour will drift back to the same Tory-lite, neoliberalism that they were so conformable with last time.\nSo unless you have a realistic opportunity of a tactical vote in your constituency, just voting for the ‘other guy’ (or gal) won’t send any sort of message other than a validation of entrenched positions.\nIf you’re not going to see real change this time around. If your vote is only going to be lost in a sea of others who voted forlornly for the a close second, or the next best thing, use it to support those who will affect real change in the longer term by holding toes to the fire in the meantime.",

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_the-nhs/content_293.html": "We were told the last election was all about Education – Education – Education. This one should be NHS – NHS – NHS.\nThe road to privatisation of the NHS has been a long one and began under the Conservatives in 1992 with the Private Finance Initiative. It’s a neat trick that enables huge amounts of debt to be moved off the national balance sheet whilst still expanding operational infrastructure.\nNew Labour saw it as something too good to be true, as it allowed them to build new hospitals, without borrowing more money or raising taxes. But like most things that seem too good to be true, it was. By the end of their tenure Labour had saddled the NHS with £80Bn in repayments on total capital assets worth around £11Bn, and we’re still paying for it now.\nThen along came the Conservatives again who just love to privatise things. Every time they’ve been in government they’ve privatised something. The trains, electricity, gas, BT, the post office – which they practically gave away.\nBut the Tories have a problem when it comes to the NHS. They can’t flat out privatise it, because that’s politically toxic.\nSo in 2012 – The year that Danny Boyle showed us in his spectacular Olympic opening ceremony what a glorious thing the NHS is – the Conservatives brought in the Health and Social Care Bill.\nA bill that many people didn’t even notice passing through parliament. But a bill that arguably affects all of us more than any other legislation in our lifetime. A bill based on the premise that the NHS was a poorly performing institution that needed reform and another £3Bn top down reorganisation that we’d been promised before the election wouldn’t happen. A bill that ignored the core values of the NHS and characterised it’s staff as a problem to be dealt with rather than it’s greatest asset. A bill that achieved the Tory Nirvana of laying the NHS open to private contractors, furthering their ideology that the state should not be responsible for providing public services.\nIt effectively legislated against free universal comprehensive healthcare and flung the door to privatisation wide open. And private health firms are falling over themselves to come inside.\nJeremy Hunt has just announced £780Million worth of private contracts to 11 firms, many of which have a chequered history. Many of them are also donors to the Tory Party. There are also plans in Staffordshire to privatise cancer care in a £700M contract and ‘End of life care’ worth another £500M\nIn a leaked confidential document it’s proposed that these contractors will be :\n“Given ‘discretion’ to design services they would like to deliver, slash spend per patient and propose the payment structures most beneficial to themselves”.\nIn that one clause we get a glimpse of how private companies will pervert the ethos of the NHS to their own end.\nFirst the add on services will be an extra cost. Then any new treatments, drugs or therapies will be extra\nIn effect we’ll end up with a RyanAir NHS – Your operation will be free, but they’ll charge you £500 for the bed and another fifty for using the toilet.\nThe government consistently claims the NHS budget is protected but in reality, it’s being forced to make cuts dressed up as efficiency savings of £15bn – £20bn by the end of this year. No wonder we’re losing services. And across the country, A&Es, maternity and other services are being closed, with thousands of jobs lost. Competitive tendering also fragments healthcare. Where patients are sent miles to access different care resources around the country based on contractor costs.\nI’m standing as Parliamentary candidate for the Green Party in Banbury, where people are rightfully worried about that fragmentation and the future of their beloved Horton General Hospital. Labour have already tried to close it once, and more recently the coalition began a reduction in the range of services offered there, with the removal of emergency abdominal surgery facilities. This has resulted in some patients being forced to make a 3 or 4 hour, 50 mile round trip to services at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Not only is this extremely inconvenient, it also potentially impairs patient outcome as additional stress is added to their situation.\nBanbury has a long history of returning Conservative MPs, but this time every voter in the constituency has to ask themselves the question – do I still want to have access to a fully free and fully funded NHS in 5 years time?\nIf the answer is yes you have to remember that, no matter how much you might like the Conservative candidate this time (and I’ll admit I like her too), a vote for Victoria Prentis will just make another Tory led government more of a reality. No matter how much she says she’ll fight for the Horton, she’ll be forced to follow her party’s privatisation agenda. Even if she votes against the whip she’ll be a lone voice in a government she helped to put into power.\nI want to see an end to all privatisation of the NHS and I believe the NHS should be brought back entirely into public ownership.\nThe Green Party supports the NHS re-instatement bill, we’d negotiate an exit from PFI and repeal the Health and Social Care Act. We’d also fight TTIP which could have a huge impact on the NHS. We believe that NHS staff deserve a fair deal and that they should be supported and valued rather than treated as a problem to be dealt with\nAneurin Bevan was once asked how long he thought the NHS would survive. He replied: “As long as there are folk left with the faith to fight for it.”\nEvery party is pledging to invest more money into the NHS but the Green Party won’t just invest cash, we’ll also invest our faith. We all have to show that faith now or by the end of the next parliament Danny Boyle’s proud Olympic love letter to our wonderful NHS could become it’s epitaph.",

High rents, intransigent investment landlords, escalating rates bills and spiralling costs.\nSuccessive governments have promised lease reform and root and branch reforms of the business rates system. Yet all we’ve had are celebrities turning the livelihoods and dreams of small retailers into a TV series.\nI’ve long wanted to see proper investment in our high streets to turn them back into the vibrant social hubs they once were. Not just investment in terms of cash, but also in commitment from government to put the interests of our high streets and town centres first. However, since the pandemic and other pressures on the economy we need to look for a new model for physical retail in an age dominated by online and experiential offers.\nBanbury Town Centre and it’s small traders are working hard to revitalise the area and they deserve the support of local and national government. In the market square we’ve seen a once thriving community of stall-holders squeezed into an ever diminishing space with little or no consultation.\nMeanwhile in Bicester, the town is struggling to deal with yet more expansion of the behemoth that Bicester village has become.\nIn Kidlington we have an opportunity to create a thriving local high street, but that is currently proving difficult for all the traditional reasons associated with overheads pressures.\nWe need to see proper, workable plans to support town centres and less capitulation to large developers building mall after mall outside towns. Equally we need to see councils invest more in small shops and less on large shopping centres and precincts. We also need to halt the unfettered and largely manipulated commercial property market where landlords often leave properties empty rather than accept a realistic rent for them.\nMoreover, we need a realistic, transparent review of business rates that reflects the reality of life on the high street today and takes into account the fluctuations in trade from year to year. It’s staggering that years after the pandemic we still don’t have that, although there’s likely to be a reduction in business rates as a result of undated valuations.\nI know the retail industry inside out. Indeed a write on it for the national trade magazine Retail Week and speak on retail on a national and international basis.\nI will always fight for independent retailers and our high streets to make sure that we still have town centres to be proud of.

You can find and comment on the original here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/eu-referendum-immigration_b_9322718.html\nSo here it is. After years of campaigning and complaining, manoeuvring and cajoling, half-truths and good old fashioned British pig-headedness, the moaning masses of middle England have finally got their referendum.\nI say ‘their’ referendum because this isn’t being staged at great expense for those of us who want to stay part of Europe. It’s not even for those who don’t really give a toss either way.\nIt’s certainly not for those more outward looking souls, who appreciate the many advantages of being a member of the European club. The easy movement between states (yes that does apply to us as well as all those annoying refugees and migrants) and the free transport of goods. Funding for urban and industrial renewal. Numerous environmental improvements to beaches, rivers and the countryside, including controls on things like GMOs. Human rights, animal rights, consumer rights. Cheaper phone charges and easier and cheaper travel and currency exchange. Social welfare protection and labour rights, and a panoply of other advantages that most people take for granted and will miss when they’re gone.\nNo, it’s a referendum for misguided and ill-informed little-Englanders, draped in Union flags, firm in the belief of two world wars and one world cup and certain the word ‘Great’ attached to Britain means something other than the first letter on a sticker they slap on the back of their booze cruise charabang, just to remind those envious foreigners that they were unlucky enough to be born on inferior soil.\nBut moreover, it’s a referendum for politicians who have been looking at continental Europe down the wrong end of the telescope for so long now, they just don’t realise how small this country has become on the world stage. A myopic concern about how much money we pay to Europe and a studied ignorance of the huge returns our EU membership generates.\nMost people who focus on our payment to Brussels like to remind us what else we could do with that money. Yet with a growing national debt, and stubbornly high deficit, any such savings would likely fall into the same black hole as most of the rest of our national finances. Either that or it would go towards servicing the country’s circa £50bn annual interest payments, paid in large part to European banks anyway.\nIt’s not 1975. The geo-political landscape has changed around us since the last time we decided if we wanted to be a part of Europe. Yes, back in the swinging 70s it was the ‘Common Market’, but by necessity and common interest it’s become more than that. Those advocating some kind of return to a simple trading relationship are ignoring both the reality of our reduced place in the world and the promiscuity of world markets.\nNeither is it 1938, even though Cameron’s Chamberlain moment was equally as hollow. Just like his pre-war counterpart, the agreement he reached in Brussels was peripheral and disposable, focussing as it did on the false polemic of immigration and border control.\nIt was a pantomime, with Donald Tusk and Angela Merkel as the ugly sisters to Cameron’s Cinderella. Shouts of “they’re behind you” were evident from the likes of UKIP and Front National pointing to the ‘hordes’ or ‘swarms’ or ‘bunches’ of ‘migrants’, ‘refugees’ or ‘immigrants’, depending on which description David Cameron and the BBC have alighted on this week.\nI totally agree that EU democratic and regulatory processes are in desperate need of reform, but these weren’t the points that Cameron argued. Driven by domestic pressures, piled on by a widening xenophobic rhetoric, he was pushed into a rushed and ill-conceived round of negotiations that resulted in him metaphorically claiming ‘peace in our time’ outside Number 10. It was a performance put on to give him a platform to launch the referendum that we all knew was coming, and the critic’s reviews weren’t great.\nSadly for him, us, and the rest of Europe, this was a missed opportunity that could have sparked a trans-national debate about the real future of the EU and brought about radical changes to shape it into something more even-handed and responsive to the needs of all member states.\nBut instead, Cameron wasted what could have been his real place in history for the sake of a thumbs up from the likes of Farage, Gove and Galloway whilst gaining little tangible return for the UK, save for some token restrictions on benefit payments to migrants who rarely claim them anyway.\nIn fact it’s recently been revealed that the UK government has no idea how much immigration costs us, nor how much migrants contribute to our economy. But let’s not let a little thing like lack of facts get in the way of a nicely staked out scapegoat.\nAnd while we’re on the subject of discrimination, we mustn’t forget those hard-pressed city bankers quaking in their handmade brogues, terrified that they may be penalised for being outside the Eurozone. That of course, amid the posturing about immigration, was the main concern for Cameron and his paymasters. Essentially he was in Brussels to fight for the right to discriminate against the poor whilst protecting the interests of the obscenely rich, although of course that wasn’t so eagerly reported.\nAnd there we have it. The crux of all this political, psychological and media-spun mendacity – Corporate interest. Insular businesses seeking to rid themselves of the European interference and regulation that keeps all the rest of us safer and better looked after. The refugee and migrant crises couldn’t have come at a better time for these vested interests to galvanise public opinion in favour of an out vote.\nOn this flimsiest of pretexts, and on evidence largely pulled out UKIP’s collective backside, we’re potentially going to launch ourselves into one of the biggest national disasters for several generations. The ‘Brexit’ silo mentality that is about as relevant in today’s globally connected society as statutes recorded on vellum.\nOne of the greatest achievements and advantages of the EU is freedom of movement between states. It’s a harbinger of a future globalised socio-economic system where borders and statehood will be irrelevant. One where the term ‘economic-migrant’ will no longer be a thinly veiled insult, just as it wasn’t when we and other nations economically migrated across the globe centuries ago, annexing and occupying entire countries as we went. In that context, and in view of the Tories much vaunted ‘on your bike’ ethos, I find it perplexing that we now seem to regard our attraction as place of opportunity as a bad thing.\nAnd while we’re on that subject, if I were a British migrant living on the continent I’d be feeling distinctly uncomfortable right now. Especially those who have lived there for longer than 15 years and are inexplicably denied the right to vote in a referendum that may well decide their future.\nThose whistling tunes in the dark about independent trade agreements with Europe and other global partners will soon find that our status as the 5th richest nation in the world is built on foundations largely stamped with a CE logo. Already Sterling has plummeted on the news that Boris is heading for the lifeboats.\nMuch of our apparent wealth is generated by the financial sector and supported by our membership of the EU. Who will want to trade with us as a small individual nation with a growing national debt and a dwindling economic base? No wonder the city was such a key part of Cameron’s negotiations.\nThe finance sector is pretty much all we have left. We don’t have anything else to trade. China and the USA know this and have already warned us that a UK outside the EU will be of much less interest to them. The US in particular sees our connection with Europe as a valuable conduit into EU financial markets.\nUncoupling ourselves from the EU will be a long, painful and essentially irreversible process. We won’t wake up one day and see bluebirds over the white cliffs and a land of milk and honey for all. It will take years of debate, legal dispute and the unpicking of labyrinthine systems of regulation woven into our own statutory frameworks. A drawn out and retrograde process, during which I believe we’ll slowly come to see the folly of our ways.\nAnd once we’ve closed our borders and thumbed our noses at one of the biggest trading blocs on the planet, it will be too late to realise that we’re now more of a Pekinese than a bulldog. An isle not so much sceptred as septic, poisoned by our own arrogance and bigotry, left entirely at the mercy of a broken political system where wealth goes one way, and protection is only there for those who can afford it.\nAs Britain shrivels into, at best, a tawdry tax haven in perpetual serfdom to a rich elite, we’ll come to the sad realisation that we’ve been sold a Jerusalem built on false promises and false flags. I wonder if border controls and apocryphal straight bananas will seem quite so important then.",

We have very ambitious plans and yes they will require a huge investment, both in terms of finance and resources.\nBut the existential threat to all of us from climate collapse demands urgent and ambitious action. We have 10 years to deal with these issues before we could be at a tipping point. If that happens, whatever we do won’t be enough https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/09/tipping-points-could-exacerbate-climate-crisis-scientists-fear\nWe have to push forward boldly now to make up for all those years when we did nothing. Where we simply paid lip service to green issues and ticked the environmentalism box without really meaning it.\nIt’s about more than encouraging solar panels and electric cars. We’re calling for a radical and fundamental re-alignment of our economy and society so that everything we do from now has climate action at its heart.\nI believe this is the only way we can ensure that future generations actually have a future.\nIf you want to protect that future for yourself, your children and their children, a vote for the Greens will send a strong message to government that we are serious about these issues.\nEven if you don’t think the Greens can win, a large swing to the Green Party will make the other parties sit up and take notice, like they have already done on so many other issues the Green party have campaigned on for decades.\nA Green vote can really make a difference, and we need to start seeing that difference in everything we do.\nIf not now, when?\nAre you for or against the Botley West Solar Farm? It is an important criteria for many in the local elections\nLikeLike\nI’m not in favour of it. I think there are other options. Not least a change in government planning legislation to allow local planning authorities to insist that Solar is included as part of all major developments. I of course support the idea that we need to invest in more renewable energy, but I think BWSF is too big and in too sensitive an area, particularly as much of the area is also going to be subject to a lot of other development in the near future.\nLikeLike\nThank you Ian, I appreciate your response and totally agree with you.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2020_02/content_53.html": "During Monday’s full council meeting, Cherwell District Council voted unanimously to support a motion calling on the doubling of tree cover in the district by 2045.\nI introduced an amendment to the motion calling on the council to be more ambitious in its proposals and to achieve the doubling of tree numbers by 2030 in line with the council’s declaration of a climate emergency.\nSpeaking during the debate, I disagreed with Conservative claims that the 2045 target was the only one that was achievable and that the council should only aim to double tree cover “as far as possible”.\nWe have declared a climate change emergency. Emergency measures call for committed and ambitious actions, not vague aspirations and get-out clauses. The climate takes no prisoners. It doesn’t care what we think is possible, it only responds to what is needed. We need to move faster and be more ambitious in our climate change mitigation measures and take into account the impact of all council policies on climate change\nMy amendment was supported by Labour and Independent members, but was blocked by the Conservatives (as usual).\nAs if to prove the point, in a later debate on the main modifications to the local plan partial review, campaigners from North Oxford Golf Club pleaded with the council to protect their 103-year-old club grounds from proposed development. This would include the destruction of a large number of trees. The Council’s proposals also call for the release of yet more green belt land and the virtual erasure of the previously sacrosanct ‘Kidlington Gap’.\nLabour and Libdem councillors opposed the motion along with me for the Greens. The proposals were agreed with all but one Conservative voting them through.\nYet again we see Cherwell’s Conservatives talking the talk on climate change, but when it comes to positive action they default to business as usual\nIt makes no sense to anyone other than Cherwell’s Tories to propose a measure to increase tree numbers in the district in one motion and then vote in the very same meeting to destroy hundreds of mature trees in the face of massive opposition from local residents and environmental campaigners.\nIt’s clear from this, and from the lack of any solid progress on the climate emergency proposals 6 months on from passing them, that Cherwell’s Conservatives simply want to box-tick the climate change issue, whilst pursuing broader policies on unnecessary growth that will be hugely damaging to the environment.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_expressway/content_246.html": "Spent the early morning yesterday in Otmoor being interviewed by the BBC about our policies on farming, food standards and stewardship of the land. Lots to say on this, but as always happens with these things, a 10-minute interview gets condensed into a 10-second comment!\nOn the way back we passed several signs on field gates warning about how the area is under threat from the Oxford to Cambridge Expressway. As someone who’s been involved in the campaign to stop this ridiculous and unnecessary development I thought I’d add a few more comments by way of a video and also expand a bit on what the Green Party would do to protect our vital green spaces.\nThis is something I’ve been involved with for a number of years now, right across the county, trying to combat the epidemic of projects that want to destroy these areas in the name of profit and greed.\nYes we need housing, but it has to be the right housing in the right places. Building on green belt will never be viable in terms of affordable housing as the land is so expensive. Developers build in a set level of profitability, usually a staggering 20%! That means that removing protection from green spaces like these just increases the number of high value, unaffordable houses being built.\nNot only that, concreting over green spaces means they can no longer lock up the carbon that we need to reduce in our environment, and they also increase the likelihood of flooding as they can no longer absorb the increased level of rain we’re getting as the climate patterns shift.\nThe Conservatives back all these projects because they are there to help wealthy landowners, developers and investors make a fat profit out of our rural heritage. As your MP I would resist all these projects, just as I now resist them as a District and Parish Councillor.\nGreens CAN WIN\nAs we’ve just seen in Wallingford, where another Green councillor has just been elected to the county council, Greens CAN WIN and we WILL WIN if people get out and give us their vote. Even if I don’t win in Banbury, a significant increase in the Green vote there will send a strong message to government that we demand change. An increased Green vote will be a visible signal of that, whereas another ‘heroic defeat’ for the other parties will get lost in the usual fog of post-election reporting.\nNow more than ever we need a strong Green voice, for the environment, for our future and for our children’s future. Please vote Green on December 12th.",

In my opinion, this has been slipped into the review under false pretences, given that this has nothing to do with housing need in Oxford. As a result there’s mounting local criticism of the university’s ambitions to commandeer at least 1000 of the houses intended to meet Oxford’s needs for its own use as part of a new campus at Begbroke and Yarnton.\nChair of the Cherwell Development Watch Alliance, Giles Lewis, spoke in favour of the motion at the packed meeting and read out emails between the council and the university, obtained under and FOI request, that suggested plans to allow the university to expand in the area were already being supported as long ago as 2016.\nThe Labour group on the council then introduced an amendment which blocked any re-consideration of housing need numbers, even though this might mean more houses that were needed would be built on green belt.\nI pointed out that just to offset the amount of carbon produced in building the unaffordable and unneeded houses in the first place would take 572,000 trees over 10 years, or 200 per house, rather than the 1 tree per building that Cllr Wood had suggested during his address on the climate change emergency motion.\nIt’s clear that neither Labour nor the Conservatives are prepared to take the difficult decisions that are needed to combat the climate emergency. Labour were far more concerned not to be seen to be challenging inflated housing need figures proposed by their colleagues on the city council, whist the Conservatives simply want to be facilitators for large wealthy landowners in the area including the university. The location of the housing clearly has more to do with the university’s ambitions than it does with genuine housing allocation priorities. Either way it ends up with unnecessary and unaffordable housing being built that locals will have no access to on the green spaces at the heart of their community. This is a stitch-up perpetrated on the people of south Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Gosford!\nLibdem Councillor and spokesperson for the Progressive Oxfordshire group, Katherine Tyson said “These plans will simply expand the city’s appalling air quality into our rural community. At one point Labour councillor and vice-chairperson of the council Hannah Banfield seemed to suggest that, as Banbury residents had accepted bad air quality as a result of housing development in their area, the people of south Cherwell should just do the same. The argument that one ward coming to peace with poisoning their residents and children doesn’t mean that another ward should also poison their constituents. That’s not good enough for Cherwell residents. It beggars belief that such a comment could be made from a Labour councillor just after we had voted in favour of a climate change emergency motion”\nThe motion to pause the local review pending the outcome of the examination of the city council local plan and to separately consult on the university’s plans in Begbroke and Yarnton was successfully amended by the Labour group to an undertaking to review the allocation sites for the 4400 houses. It was carried by Labour with Conservatives abstaining on the vote. The subsequent motion was defeated by 16 votes to 23.",

Elections after this one are most likely to be associated with the new Unitary Authority which will be formed in Oxfordshire, although currently exactly what form that will take is unclear.\nThe option preferred by the Greens is one of 2 unitaries formed from Cherwell District, West Oxfordshire District and The City Councils with a second one formed around South Oxon and the Vale plus West Berkshire. We feel that would keep decision making as local as possible as well as ensuring that councillors don’t become too remote from the people they represent. The County Council Cabinet recently voted to push forward their preferred option of one huge council across the whole of the County, while the City Council are proposing they form their own Unitary Council by absorbing areas around them such as Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke. I would certainly strongly oppose that, as, I believe, would most of the residents in those areas!\nThe outcome of all these options could largely be driven by those people elected to the County Council tomorrow, so not only is it important to vote because it may be your last opportunity, it’s also doubly important that you get a councillor who is going to represent your views on what your future council may look like.\nOf course my advice is to vote Green at least in areas where you already have a Green Councillor such as the two new Divisions in Kidlington which make up nearly 80% of the area I currently represent on the County Council. As I can’t be in 2 places at once I have decided to stand in the new East Division because I am involved in several ongoing issues there, Not least the proposed football stadium and the huge Oxford North development. But my fellow Green Councillor Fiona Mawson is standing in the other part, now called Kidlington West even though 2 thirds of it comprises Yarnton and Begbroke. As the only candidate in this election that actually lives in that new division, I’m hopeful that she will get a good reception from voters.\nto show Green and Conservative representation\nCurrently the whole of the Kidlington East area is represented by me as the County Councillor and by me, Fiona and Linda Ward as District councillors. I’d like to think we’ve done a good job of representing the everyone there, we all certainly work hard to achieve that, so I hope I will receive your support in the East whilst Fiona is elected to replace me in the West.\nIt’s a rather complicated scenario , especially given that the whole set up is likely to change in 2 or 3 years so neither of us are likely to see out a full term as County Councillors, but in the meantime it’s important that both areas keep consistent Green representation so that work I and Fiona have started on things like ensuring development proposals are beneficial to the area can continue into the next few years, along with our input into the re-shaping of local government over the next 2 years.\nHowever you vote (and I hope it will be Green) do make sure you vote. It may be the only chance you get to make a decision that affects you and your local community for the next few years.\nIf you need any further information from me or Fiona please let us know. We have knocked on a lot of doors over the past few months, so if we missed you we’d be happy to talk.",

The refugee and migrant crises couldn’t have come at a better time for these vested interests to galvanise public opinion in favour of an out vote.\nOn this flimsiest of pretexts, and on evidence largely pulled out UKIP’s collective backside, we’re potentially going to launch ourselves into one of the biggest national disasters for several generations. The ‘Brexit’ silo mentality that is about as relevant in today’s globally connected society as statutes recorded on vellum.\nOne of the greatest achievements and advantages of the EU is freedom of movement between states. It’s a harbinger of a future globalised socio-economic system where borders and statehood will be irrelevant. One where the term ‘economic-migrant’ will no longer be a thinly veiled insult, just as it wasn’t when we and other nations economically migrated across the globe centuries ago, annexing and occupying entire countries as we went. In that context, and in view of the Tories much vaunted ‘on your bike’ ethos, I find it perplexing that we now seem to regard our attraction as place of opportunity as a bad thing.\nAnd while we’re on that subject, if I were a British migrant living on the continent I’d be feeling distinctly uncomfortable right now. Especially those who have lived there for longer than 15 years and are inexplicably denied the right to vote in a referendum that may well decide their future.\nThose whistling tunes in the dark about independent trade agreements with Europe and other global partners will soon find that our status as the 5th richest nation in the world is built on foundations largely stamped with a CE logo. Already Sterling has plummeted on the news that Boris is heading for the lifeboats.\nMuch of our apparent wealth is generated by the financial sector and supported by our membership of the EU. Who will want to trade with us as a small individual nation with a growing national debt and a dwindling economic base? No wonder the city was such a key part of Cameron’s negotiations.\nThe finance sector is pretty much all we have left. We don’t have anything else to trade. China and the USA know this and have already warned us that a UK outside the EU will be of much less interest to them. The US in particular sees our connection with Europe as a valuable conduit into EU financial markets.\nUncoupling ourselves from the EU will be a long, painful and essentially irreversible process. We won’t wake up one day and see bluebirds over the white cliffs and a land of milk and honey for all. It will take years of debate, legal dispute and the unpicking of labyrinthine systems of regulation woven into our own statutory frameworks. A drawn out and retrograde process, during which I believe we’ll slowly come to see the folly of our ways.\nAnd once we’ve closed our borders and thumbed our noses at one of the biggest trading blocs on the planet, it will be too late to realise that we’re now more of a Pekinese than a bulldog. An isle not so much sceptred as septic, poisoned by our own arrogance and bigotry, left entirely at the mercy of a broken political system where wealth goes one way, and protection is only there for those who can afford it.\nAs Britain shrivels into, at best, a tawdry tax haven in perpetual serfdom to a rich elite, we’ll come to the sad realisation that we’ve been sold a Jerusalem built on false promises and false flags. I wonder if border controls and apocryphal straight bananas will seem quite so important then.",

They affect all our lives, not just personally, but in broader human and economic terms.\nI’m a vocal advocate of social enterprise, and believe that there are many big businesses out there that can be made to take a more ethical and responsible stance if we create the right conditions to encourage it.

Many key economists and business commentators are now having similar epiphanies about how business and consumption needs to be managed in a sustainable, responsible and accountable way, if we’re all going to avoid a backlash against the kinds of excesses and irresponsible business practices that became prevalent over the past 20 or 30 years.\nEssentially businesses need to grow up and take responsibility for the societies we’ve helped to create.\nI’ve recently become very interested in something now being called the circular economy, where consumption itself is fed back into the creation of new resources and products. This doesn’t just encompass recycling, but also upcycling and renewable energy as part of the manufacturing process, along with emergent technologies, social media, and the fourth economy, comprising enterprises that not only make a profit for business owners, but also put something back into the social economy.\nThat might all sound a bit hippy and tree-huggy, but it’s something that’s being taken very seriously now by many key figures in the business world.

And I know it’s not all about Black Friday and Cyber Monday and Think about it Tuesday!\nI’m a small independent retailer myself, and I know how vital this time of the year is for small businesses, many of them struggling against the huge chain stores and out of town developments. Most small retailers need to make 40% or more of their annual turnover in the run up to Christmas or they may not be here next time. Please think about that when you’re doing your Christmas shop. If you want vibrant, original, independents you have to show them some love and splash a bit of cash.\nAs a campaigner and writer on all things retail, I’ll be supporting my local indie high street this weekend. I hope you will too!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_retail-2_page_3/content_397.html": "Last week myself and John Haywood from the Banbury and Cherwell Green Party visited the market in central Banbury to speak to the stall holders about the changes being proposed to this 1000 year old tradition in the heart of an historic town.\nWe spoke with all the stallholders present, although sadly they were only 10 of them trading on the day. They were all all opposed to Cherwell District Council’s illogical and damaging decision to restrict the stalls to the Cornhill end of the Market Place. A plan also supported by the Conservative controlled Town Council.\nI started my own 25 year long retail career on a market stall, and worked it for 7 years with my partner though rain, hail sleet, snow and sunshine. I know how difficult it can be to make a living and how fragile the trading environment can be. Your livelihood can depend on so many variable factors, and one of the major fears is losing your regular pitch, for whatever reason.\nIt may seem silly to anyone who hasn’t traded in a market themselves, but where your stall sits can make all the difference between success and failure. The location of competing trades, the flow of people moving through the market, who your neighbours are, your visibility and prominence in the market as a whole are all desperately important.\nThere appears to have been absolutely no consultation with stall holders or customers about these unpopular changes, and based on what stallholders and visitors told me I foresee them being the death knell for this historic trading post as more and more traders fall by the wayside.\nSo what seems like a minor change to the council, will probably be anything but to the people trying to make a living out of the market. This move could likely kill it off! it’s already become smaller and therefore less popular, especially over the last 20 years. In 1997 there were 120 stalls, now its down to less than 20.\nConsidering it’s reduced pull for consumers it’s completely incongruous that the rents being charged by the private firm managing on behalf of the council are almost double that charged by neighbouring markets such as Abingdon, Aylesbury, Hinkley, Oxford and Thame. And as with most things these days, the rent goes up every year. Meanwhile trade is slowly dwindling away to nothing, leaving regular and loyal traders quite literally out in the cold.\nThe Council’s plan includes opening the Market car park for use on Thursdays and Fridays. There is no evidence to suggest this will increase car park usage and revenue to the Council – people already using other car parks such as that near to the Matalan Store will simply park in the market place instead.\nGovernment initiatives on town centre regeneration called for more emphasis and support for market days and the traders that build and run these vital hubs of trade and local amenity in our towns and cities. The Portas review cited markets as one of the easiest ways that town centres could be revitalised and kept alive. Why then is the Conservative run Cherwell Council ignoring the views of it’s own established market traders? Why are they proposing moves that could potentially irreparably damage trade in such an established and once vibrant local fixture?\nBanbury market should be seen by Cherwell Council as an asset to the town. They should be supporting it actively and engaging with the traders and customers to find ways of safeguarding the it’s future, rather than taking unilateral actions with no consultation.\nThis is a Charter Market, which bestows on Banbury the status of a Market Town. By birthright it should be located in the Market Square.\nI would urge Cherwell councillors to do what I did. Take a walk around the market and speak to the people whose livelihoods are in their hands. Speak also to the local residents and patrons of the market and ask them what they think about the priorities that they are planning to enforce on everyone.\nThis is not a decision that can be taken just by moving squares on a map.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_type_gallery_page_14/content_463.html": "It’s a Thursday so it must be election day! It seems like elections are almost a weekly occurrence now. Brenda of Bristol must furious!\nJoking aside, I must admit I was surprised to find myself thrown into another election so soon after winning 3 local council seats in May.\nBut it seems that our strong and stable government can’t manage to hang on for any longer than a coupe of years at most these days, even with the so-called fixed- term Parliament Act!\nThis just goes to show how desperately we need electoral reform in this country, a system by which more than one party can contribute to the process of government and more than one set of opinions can be taken into account.\nIt seems that, far from our first past the post system giving us a government of unity and decisiveness, when it comes to the most monumental political upheaval in a generation, we simply can’t agree on anything!\nIn those circumstances we have to go back to the country and hope that the numbers stack up differently afterwards. Somehow I suspect they won’t. While we cling to our broken 2 party state, we will just see-saw backwards and forwards between opposing positions.\nOn the key issue of Brexit, Labour are still offering a confused position, saying they would re-negotiate the deal with the EU and then put it to the people. That’s a great in principle, but in practice it means Labour will presumably be rooting for their new deal in any subsequent vote. That, by any sensible definition, makes them a party of leave.\nThe Libdems simply want to ignore the 2016 vote and treat Brexit like it never happened. Whilst that’s an attractive prospect for those of us who would rather remain, it’s not a way to resolve the political schism in our country at the moment.\nThe 2016 result was hardly decisive as it showed a split right down the middle of the argument. We could probably have run the vote again the following day and got a different result!\nThe only way to properly heal this country is with a second referendum as soon as possible after the election. No more deals being negotiated, no more simply pushing the Brexit button out of expediency (as the Tories would have us do), but a properly informed, final say on the direction this country will take and what is in the best interests of everyone.\nPersonally, if that second vote still comes out as leave I’m done on the subject of Brexit. I’m quite happy to let the chips fall where they may and shift my focus to trying to prepare the country for what I think will be the most damaging decade in history since the last war.\nBut to those who say we shouldn’t have a second vote, I’d point to the fact that we’re now having our third national vote since 2015! If ‘the will of the people’ really was the main driving force in our democracy, we’d keep the government we voted for in 2015, regardless of the wishes of the government at the time. But we haven’t.\nSo if we can have 3 general elections in 4 years, why not a confirmatory vote on something that was decided by a small minority three and a half years ago, when we didn’t know what we know now? Something that could impact on all our futures and those of generations to come. Why is that to be decided on just one vote?\nI really don’t know why anyone should object to the idea of a People’s Vote. If the will of the people hasn’t changed, the result will be the same. The only reason I can see that the Brexit contingent would object to another vote, is that they think they will lose it.\nIn which case they know in their heart of hearts that the mood of the country has changed. They know that the vote in 2016 was probably a fluke, and they’re terrified of the genuine will of the people being followed now. they simply want to railroad us all into the abyss before anyone realised what’s happening. That’s no way to run a country!\nSo let’s get on with this election and I hope vote in some more Green MPs who can influence Westminster enough to resolve the national insanity we seem to have thrown ourselves into over Brexit.\nWe don’t need to get Brexit done. We need to do away with it once and for all!",

I was tweeted tonight by a parent led group campaigning against cuts in school funding in Oxfordshire asking if I realised just how bad the situation was.\nAt this point I’m the only candidate to reply. But maybe the others will catch up later.\nBut playing catch-up seems to be the way for our education system, with a report coming out only a few days ago on the dire state of repair of some school buildings. As someone who went to school in the 70s, I find it shocking that we should have let our education system become so under-valued in such a short period of time.\nMy best friend from back in those days keeps in touch with me, and he has just retired as a senior head teacher. He now does consultancy work for schools that are suffering under the same system he battled through. Essentially the privatisation of our education system that does little to help students and puts a lot of money into the pockets of Academy shareholders.\nThe future of our children should not be for sale to the highest bidder, and we should not be seeing a situation where parents have to raise hundreds of pounds to subsidise books or pay for bus passes so their children can actually get to school. Again, I remember free bus passes for school-children, but that seems like a long-lost utopia now.\nWe need an education system that provides opportunity to everyone. Schools that cater for all levels of ability and aspiration. The chance for everyone who wants to move on to further and higher education to do so without saddling themselves with a lifetime of debt.\nWe also need to value our teachers and educators, paying them a decent salary and ensuring they have fair conditions to work in. Like doctors and nurses they are taken far too much for granted and expected to cope with appalling stress simply because they are dedicated people.\nThe Conservative’s promises of extra funding don’t come close to addressing the problems that have been stored up over the past 10 years. Their so-called ‘extra’ spending amounts to nothing more than setting the clock back to the point before they imposed austerity on us all.\nSee the Green Party Manifesto by clicking here. Go to page 55 to see our comprehensive range of proposals and policies about revitalising our education system and bringing schools into the 21sct century, whilst unlocking the potential of students and teachers at all levels.\nA proper education for the next generation should be a priority for all of us.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_westgate-centre/content_379.html": "After what seems like centuries of wrangling, planning applications, withdrawn projects, hand shaking and head banging, Oxford is finally set to join other cities with a giant shiny shopping centre nobody really needs any more.\nHaving experienced the damage that these behemoths can do to small local retailers, myself included, this is a moment I and many others have dreaded.\nThe council of course has applied a heavy spin on the whole project, whilst ushering the developers and large multi-nationals into the city with wide-eyed certainty that a new shopping centre will solve all the problems we now have.\nWe know at least one of those problems – that of affordable housing in the city centre – won’t even be dented by this grandiose project. In a move that is frankly baffling from a socialist led council, planners have dashed all hopes that the accommodation element designed into the revamped centre would be for social housing or affordable homes. Whilst Green councillors opposed this move, others apparently felt that poorer people won’t be able to keep the new apartments up to the standards they expect to be demanded.\nSo no comfortable inner-city pied-à-terres for the ordinary folk of Oxford then. Which is a shame considering Oxford City Council provided virtually nothing for that sector last year, despite claims that this was a priority policy.\nJobs are not the only thing to consider\nJudging by the analyses carried out over the past 10 years it looks highly likely that the new Westgate extension in Oxford will have a significant impact on other retail destinations both in the immediate vicinity and county wide.\nThe council has claimed that 3400 jobs will be created by the opening of the new centre, which seems like a rather optimistic number to me. Even if one accepts that figure, previous analyses have suggested that the number of jobs created will be far outweighed by those that will be destroyed elsewhere in the city and the surrounding areas.\nIt’s very easy to focus just on the number of jobs created, but when similar centres have opened there have been many casualties in other areas. This doesn’t even take into account the damage that’s likely to be done to trade during the building and infrastructure works and the impact of additional competition for small retailers that attracting large multi-nationals into the area will provide.\nIn an era where many retail chains are looking to reduce their portfolios, the time for this centre has been and gone. There’s already plenty of retail space in Oxford city centre, some of it lying vacant even now. Until the council addresses the systemic issues with people visiting the city, such as parking, local transport and city centre management, a revamped shopping centre isn’t going to add that much prosperity to a town encircled by much better alternatives.\nThe new shopping centre will likely have some novelty value for a few months, but once the realities of trading in Oxford begin to bite, I doubt it’ll be anything more than another usual-suspect clone-town brand zoo.\nYears of disruption\nAccording to a recent article in the Oxford Mail, a scrutinising committee of city centre councillors are due to meet to discuss ways of keeping businesses alive during the hugely disruptive infrastructure works needed for the new extension.\nSo Oxford City Council wait until AFTER the works have begun to think about how to mitigate the problems that will inevitably be caused by the works?\nAnother great example of the forethought and careful planning we’ve come to expect from our wonderful city council!\nI was at a meeting with both the city and county council leaders over a year ago where I highlighted the potential damage that will be done by the infrastructure works required for the Westgate extension. Having already experienced the same in Bristol a few years before, it was clear to me and many others that the likely upheaval required for the Westgate works were going to do more damage than they were likely to be worth in the current climate.\nSeems like it all fell on deaf ears. As usual.\nEmpty shops\nMy business in Cornmarket Street closed it’s doors for the last time after 20 years last year. Despite numerous pronouncements in the press that the city council was eager to support local businesses, we got zip-all support, even after asking on several occasions. Indeed, at one point their planning department were very close to scuppering the only deal we could achieve to sell the store. Had they not done a last minute U-turn there would have been one more empty and un-lettable shop in the city centre.\nCouncillors are also now apparently worried about the growing number of empty shops in the city, despite previous claims that there were queues of businesses eager to take space. Perhaps news has started to filter out that retailing in Oxford is not what it once was?\nIn that context one has to wonder who is going to populate the new cathedral of consumption when it is finally completed, and for those that do take up residence, what kind of trading environment will they find? With 40% of retail leases across the country coming up for renewal at the end of this year, it really does beg the question about how much space will be required when the Westgate centre is completed in 2017. Moreover what will the rest of the city look like once all the remaining viable stores have de-camped into the waiting warmth of a lovely new mall?\nWith council plans to push up the cost of parking YET AGAIN and the negative impact of roadworks, and the city centre looking like a building site, it’s likely most consumers will continue to go elsewhere to shop, surrounded as we are by much more attractive and easily reached locations around the city and the county. And once again, experience tells me that once people find better alternatives, they’re unlikely to return, other than for a quick nose around the new development.\nA committee composed of councillors with absolutely no idea how businesses in Oxford operate, setting out to ‘examine’ how to deal with these issues now, is tantamount to closing the door after the horse has bolted, lived out it’s natural life and ended up in a dog food tin. This project as has been in the planning stages for so many years it’s truly staggering that the implications are only being discussed now.\nOxford is of course known as the city of ‘dreaming spires’. It seems that in terms of strategic planning, many of our councillors have also been asleep on the job.",

In fact I didn’t really expect to be doing this all again. For someone who isn’t a natural politician, I thought in 2015 that once in a lifetime was enough.\nBut we did it all again and I have to say I enjoyed most of it as much as I did last time.\nI will admit though that the come-down from this campaign has been much harder given that I failed to build on the vote achieved last time. In fact it was reduced, mainly by virtue of people believing they were voting for Jeremy Corbyn.\nI do have to say, as I said numerous times during the campaign, Labour had no hopes of winning in this constituency. The Labour candidate is also no supporter of Corbyn. In fact I support him more than he does!\nSo those previously loyal Green voters who switched this time to Labour really did nothing to help towards a Labour victory in Westminster and have arguably done some damage to the Greens.\nThe number of votes cast in a general election does count for each party. Not just in electoral terms but also in terms of how much government money is given to that party to continue to be part of the democratic process, something known as ‘short money’. We also have the deposits in each constituency, which at £500 a time is money that a party like the Greens, who don’t have large corporate backers, can ill afford to lose.\nOver the whole country the Green vote fell by roughly 50% and that was certainly the case in Banbury. As a result there may well be a lot less chances to vote Green next time we have an election, especially if that’s any time soon. Much of the funds generated in this election will go towards leaflets, deposits and other expenses. The reduction in ‘short money’ will be something of a blow too.\nSo your vote and your support for the Greens really matters, whether we win or not. Labour won’t face the loss of their deposits and, with hundreds of MP in Parliament and now hundreds of thousands of members, they won’t be short of funds either.\nPlease remember that next time you think about abandoning the party you say you otherwise support. We’re only here because of that support, and when it’s removed we quickly lose the ability to give you the choice to vote Green in the future.\nEvery one of those 1250 people who took the trouble to support a party they truly believe in and give me their precious vote yesterday has my personal thanks.\nI am of course disappointed that there weren’t more, especially as there were over twice that number just two years ago when our policies were just are relevant as they are now.\nThe dash to Labour was perhaps understandable in the context of Jeremy Corbyn’s popular appeal, but in a constituency like Banbury and vote for any of the progressive parties would have sent a message of hope and defiance just as effectively as one for Labour.\nSadly, in solidly safe seats like Banbury it’s very unlikely that one party will ever loosen the stranglehold being applied by The Conservatives, so we have to work together as the Greens have done in other constituencies.\nWhilst I congratulate Sean for achieving an impressive increase on his vote share, he was still some 12000 votes away from a win. All the time Labour and the Conservatives continue to reject the electoral reform proposed by Greens and the Libdems we’re very unlikely to see individual votes changing the outcome of elections like these.\nI’m very pleased on a national level to see The Conservatives on ever more shaky ground and I hope all the other opposition parties in Westminster will work together to thwart what will probably be a severe and extreme right coalition between the Tories and the DUP. I think we see now that this election was less about the good of the country and more about Theresa May clinging on to power at any cost.\nAs always, it was truly depressing to see the Conservative vote increase in number in a constituency that should be acutely aware of the damage they are likely to wreak on public services, the NHS and in particular the Horton Hospital which is now very likely to be completely downgraded or closed if the Conservatives maintain power.\nThanks to everyone who worked on my campaign and to the other candidates for a clean and well fought fight. I hope going forward, progressive parties in Banbury may work more closely together to achieve real social change and electoral reform, that way we can ensure every voice and every vote counts in the future.",

I was tweeted tonight by a parent led group campaigning against cuts in school funding in Oxfordshire asking if I realised just how bad the situation was.\nAt this point I’m the only candidate to reply. But maybe the others will catch up later.\nBut playing catch-up seems to be the way for our education system, with a report coming out only a few days ago on the dire state of repair of some school buildings. As someone who went to school in the 70s, I find it shocking that we should have let our education system become so under-valued in such a short period of time.\nMy best friend from back in those days keeps in touch with me, and he has just retired as a senior head teacher. He now does consultancy work for schools that are suffering under the same system he battled through. Essentially the privatisation of our education system that does little to help students and puts a lot of money into the pockets of Academy shareholders.\nThe future of our children should not be for sale to the highest bidder, and we should not be seeing a situation where parents have to raise hundreds of pounds to subsidise books or pay for bus passes so their children can actually get to school. Again, I remember free bus passes for school-children, but that seems like a long-lost utopia now.\nWe need an education system that provides opportunity to everyone. Schools that cater for all levels of ability and aspiration. The chance for everyone who wants to move on to further and higher education to do so without saddling themselves with a lifetime of debt.\nWe also need to value our teachers and educators, paying them a decent salary and ensuring they have fair conditions to work in. Like doctors and nurses they are taken far too much for granted and expected to cope with appalling stress simply because they are dedicated people.\nThe Conservative’s promises of extra funding don’t come close to addressing the problems that have been stored up over the past 10 years. Their so-called ‘extra’ spending amounts to nothing more than setting the clock back to the point before they imposed austerity on us all.\nSee the Green Party Manifesto by clicking here. Go to page 55 to see our comprehensive range of proposals and policies about revitalising our education system and bringing schools into the 21sct century, whilst unlocking the potential of students and teachers at all levels.\nA proper education for the next generation should be a priority for all of us.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_local-election-2025/content_280.html": "It’s hard to believe it’s 4 years since I was elected as the first Green County Councillor in Cherwell in 2021 during the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. It was a worrying time for all of us and as a new County Councillor I had to quickly come to terms with my new responsibilities whilst navigating remote meetings and all the various limitations that were placed on all of us in our day to day lives. I know people who were personally affected by the virus and some that still are. Thankfully I and most of my family came out unscathed, although I did lose a close family member to the virus who I still miss today.\nCovid now seems like a distant memory as we all deal with other issues, not least the cost of living crisis, the ongoing lack of affordable housing and the pressures on our health service. We are also about to see seismic changes in the way local government operates which means that this is likely to be the last County Council election in Oxfordshire.\nWe also have boundary changes to the County Council which sees my current division of Kidlington South split into 2 new divisions – Kidlington East and Kidlington West. This left me with a dilemma about which division to stand in for this election. Ultimately I chose Kidlington East which includes most of the area that is also covered by my District Council Ward. I’ve dealt with a lot of casework in this part of my current division and there are still a number of ongoing issues so I feel I have to try to maintain some contiunity there.\nWe do also have a strong Green candidate in Kidlington West though, which includes Yarnton and Begbroke as well as Roundham ward in Kidlington. My wife and fellow councillor District and Parish Councillor Fiona Mawson is standing there and I hope she will be able to provide some continuity of representation there, as well as building on her 10 years experience as a Yarnton Parish Councillor where she is currently the Deputy Chair.\nOver the next 2-3 years there will also be a further reorganisation of local government which will see a single authority combining the remits of both the District and the County Council. The details of how this will be achieved are still being hammered out but there are concerns that moving to a larger, more remote authority could reduce local engagement.\nThere are also moves being made by the City Council to expand their borders to swallow up areas like Kidlington, Gosford, Yarnton and Begbroke into one larger authority. I don’t think that’s what local residents want. Neither do I think it will be in their best interests. So I will be fighting to maintain the integrity of all our local villages to prevent us becoming just a suburb of Oxford city.\nOn top of this we have to deal with the creation of a new local plan amidst sweeping changes to the planning process which could also see a significant erosion of local democracy. This is likely to lead to even more erosion of our surrounding green spaces, especially if the City Council get their way.\nSo it’s clear that, during the next few years, we will need strong voices at all levels of local government in Oxfordshire to ensure we end up with a workable model that truly represents local residents and responds to their needs. I would like to continue to be that voice for Kidlington East\nWhilst I hope we won’t be facing anything on the scale of Covid again for a very long time, there could be other equally disruptive events on the world stage coming our way. We are now seeing the impacts of climate change on our communities with increased incidents of flooding which has brought misery to many residents. I’m working hard to try to reduce the impact of that and we’ve seen new measures introduced locally to support residents faced with the threat of flooding. I am continuing to push for more.\nSo I hope you will choose to support me again in the County Elections on May 1st to work for you as probably your last county councillor before the changes are made to local government structures. I still feel there’s work to be done in the division, not least in the face of some of the new developments that over the next few years that could have significant impacts on all our lives along with the challenges posed by national government and global events.\nI’m trying to get round to meet as many people on the doorstep as possible, but with all the changes going on at the moment, it’s a huge task. If you’d like me to come and see you to discuss any local issues please contact me and I’ll try to arrange something. Otherwise feel free to email, message or call me.",

Lots to say on this, but as always happens with these things, a 10-minute interview gets condensed into a 10-second comment!\nOn the way back we passed several signs on field gates warning about how the area is under threat from the Oxford to Cambridge Expressway. As someone who’s been involved in the campaign to stop this ridiculous and unnecessary development I thought I’d add a few more comments by way of a video and also expand a bit on what the Green Party would do to protect our vital green spaces.\nThis is something I’ve been involved with for a number of years now, right across the county, trying to combat the epidemic of projects that want to destroy these areas in the name of profit and greed.\nYes we need housing, but it has to be the right housing in the right places. Building on green belt will never be viable in terms of affordable housing as the land is so expensive. Developers build in a set level of profitability, usually a staggering 20%! That means that removing protection from green spaces like these just increases the number of high value, unaffordable houses being built.\nNot only that, concreting over green spaces means they can no longer lock up the carbon that we need to reduce in our environment, and they also increase the likelihood of flooding as they can no longer absorb the increased level of rain we’re getting as the climate patterns shift.\nThe Conservatives back all these projects because they are there to help wealthy landowners, developers and investors make a fat profit out of our rural heritage. As your MP I would resist all these projects, just as I now resist them as a District and Parish Councillor.\nGreens CAN WIN\nAs we’ve just seen in Wallingford, where another Green councillor has just been elected to the county council, Greens CAN WIN and we WILL WIN if people get out and give us their vote. Even if I don’t win in Banbury, a significant increase in the Green vote there will send a strong message to government that we demand change. An increased Green vote will be a visible signal of that, whereas another ‘heroic defeat’ for the other parties will get lost in the usual fog of post-election reporting.\nNow more than ever we need a strong Green voice, for the environment, for our future and for our children’s future. Please vote Green on December 12th.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_green-belt/content_29.html": "I am still trying to remain open-minded about Oxford United Football Club’s proposals to build an 18000 seater stadium on green belt land that forms part of the Kidlington Gap at Stratfield Brake. But as the County and District Councillor for the area that Stratfield Brake sits within, I think the County Cabinet’s agreement to enter into negotiations with OUFC was premature, given that there were still so many unanswered questions a year on from the initial approaches from the club to the council.\nOf course we all want to help the club find a new home, but if we’re talking about using public assets to do that, we need transparency about what they’ve done to help themselves. For example, we still don’t have evidence that they’ve have explored all legal remedies to stay where they are.\nIt also appeared from the club’s own long-awaited report that they hadn’t even started looking at other alternative sites until October last year, after claiming at the beginning of 2022 that they had already explored all other options.\nAfter waiting 8 months for the full report on the club’s plans, it took a further 2 months for it to be circulated to stakeholders in a heavily edited form which doesn’t suggest that they are willing to be as transparent with local residents and stakeholders as they have claimed in the past.\nKidlington Parish Council (KPC) had been waiting for most of last year for the report from the club showing their detailed plans for the main Stratfield Brake site (which they are leaseholders of) so that they could be put out to local consultation. They could not take a decision on relinquishing their lease until they had consulted with the local residents who they represent.\nThe club has tried to blame the council for delays in making a decision on the initial very broad proposals but that was simply not the case. KPC wanted to make a decision on an informed basis and had been working towards a genuine local consultation, but to facilitate that they needed details of what the club were proposing. Thus any delay in the decision by the council are entirely the fault of the football club. Instead of engaging properly with KPC to help them hold a local consultation, they have gone around them by moving their plans to the site known as the Triangle which KPC has no direct control over.\nAs a result, I made a plea to the cabinet to include an amendment to the proposals to enter into negotiations with the club that would also commit the council to a full local consultation on the proposals before any final decision was made which should include the option to accept or reject the proposals. This wasn’t even responded to.\nAs the local county councillor I was disappointed that my call to the County Cabinet for a full local consultation didn’t seem to be endorsed. That would at least have given local residents some comfort that their views, both for and against the proposals, would be properly taken into account.\nThere was a reference to future engagement with stakeholders but it’s not clear who would undertake this and if it would be at a point where the local community would have a chance to say yes or no to the plans once they know what they are. With so many questions still left unanswered, we need a definite assurance that such a consultation will be part of the final decision process, otherwise we may find ourselves overtaken by circumstances as plans progress and positions become embedded”.\nWhilst I’m pleased to see the council took note of local concerns raised in last year’s country-wide engagement exercise, what is being proposed now is a rather different prospect and doesn’t completely deal with local views about having yet another significant development sited on some of Kidlington’s dwindling green spaces.\nIf we’re going to condone building on the green belt we need to ensure there is quantifiable local support for that. There are a range of views, as we saw at the meeting, and I want to make sure I’m fully representing the balance of local opinion, but until we ask the whole community we don’t know what that is.\nMy position as the local councillor for the area is that I have to support the majority view of the residents that will be affected by this development whatever they are. I don’t understand why there is a resistance from both the club and their fans as well as the council to asking local people directly what they think of this idea. There may be opposition, but there may equally be majority support for the plans. If so we can proceed on that basis knowing that the club would be welcomed by the village. Surely that would be a better outcome for all concerned, especially OUFC’s owners who I assume wouldn’t want to impose themselves on to a community that would resent them being there.\nI will continue to advocate for a full local consultation both internally within the council and with other local representatives, particularly the local MP Layla Moran.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_type_gallery_page_9/content_448.html": "Cherwell District Council announced it’s budget last week detailing £4.4m in cuts and extra charges that it will be imposing on the residents of Cherwell as well as an increase in council tax.\nDuring the budget debate I raised my concerns that around a third of these cuts and charges were as a result of losses incurred over the past two years in Banbury\nIn a nutshell the centre is predicted to make a loss of around £1.6m in the 21/22 financial year after having made a similar loss in 20/21. On a broader scale, taking into account some small gains in the first 2 years the council owned the development, it will have racked up losses in the region of £2.5m by the end of the next financial year if the current predictions are correct. To close the gap left by that hole in the budget there have been additional service cuts with around a third of those in the forthcoming budget directly attributable to pressures from Castle Quay.\nYou may have seen some of this in the press this week in Oxford Mail and the Banbury Guardian\nI was also interviewed by BBC Radio Oxford, although my section was recorded and heavily edited, after which Cllr Tony Ilot ,the Lead Member for Financial Management & Governance on Cherwell District Council, was invited on the show live to respond. If we’d been on at the same time I might have pointed out that as the councillor responsible for this development it would have been more encouraging had he bothered to do his homework before coming on. At one point he seemed uncertain about how much the losses amounted to (he guessed at £1.3m and the interviewer had to correct him that it was £1.6m) and he also claimed that the £1.6m was a cumulative loss since the council took ownership. It’s not, it’s just the predicted loss for the forthcoming year on top of a similar one for the last year. You’d think the Lead Member for Financial Management & Governance might have been a little more cognisant of the situation given the scale of problem, but this lack of concern over important details is a familiar theme with Cherwell’s Conservatives.\nCllr Ilot also seemed quite laid back about the fact that the centre is now worth less than half what was paid for item having lost a whopping £30m in value. They are also currently spending even more than the original purchase price for the shopping centre on the canal side extension which, as a retail analyst myself, I think they are going to struggle to make a return on.\nYou can listen to the interview in full here\nThe council’s line on this has been that the losses at CQ have not directly resulted in an increase in the council tax. As that increase was already in the pipeline anyway that’s probably fair to say, but it also fair to say that if this white elephant wasn’t providing such a huge financial drag on the council’s resources, we may not have needed to increase the tax and we certainly wouldn’t have need many of the cuts in services.\nIt will be interesting to see how much support we get for the high street in Kidlington and the Exeter Close project in the light of all this. Certainly something we can point them to if they start penny-pinching on our project to support the eye-watering amounts of public money that’s being poured into one scheme in the far north of the district that we’re all footing the bill for.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2019_06/content_32.html": "A number of fundamental questions about Oxford City Council’s submission of its local plan have been raised by the planning inspector in his initial questions and comments. These questions are strikingly familiar to anyone who was at the Public Inquiry into Cherwell District Council’s Local Plan Review earlier this year.\nAt the hearing, local campaigners called on Cherwell to delay any further work on the plan to build 4400 houses on prime Green Belt in Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke until the true figures of housing need in Oxford were known.\nCherwell’s local plan review is predicated on a perceived obligation to help meet Oxford City’s housing need. Campaigners against the plans have repeatedly argued that Oxford’s need cannot be quantified until their local plan has been agreed, approved and published. Something the City Council has been slow to progress.\nInstead, District councils have relied on guesswork and a ‘working assumption’ from the Oxfordshire Growth Board (OGB) based on figures in the 2014 Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA). A report that itself has been highly criticised since its publication.\nIn response, the City Council commissioned an update to the SHMA. This demonstrated that the original figures were over-estimates, a conclusion backed by follow up analysis from an independent planning consultant presented to the Cherwell hearing. Both the city and district councils, including Cherwell, have sought to ignore the implications of these reports, but the inconsistencies have not escaped the planning inspector. These include:\n- The fact that figures being used to underpin assumptions of need are now over 8 years old\n- That the 2018 SHMA points to a significantly lower housing need than that shown in the 2014 version and that these figures have not been incorporated into the City’s plan.\n- Inconsistencies in estimated housing capacities in the City’s plan and the ‘Growth Deal’ proposals\n- Suggestions of prescriptive planning policies that preclude development in numerous key areas\n- Concerns over double counting of homeless numbers where new households are ignored\n- Inappropriate market ‘uplifts’ producing around a 30% over-estimate of housing need\nIan Middleton, Cherwell District Council’s new Green councillor said\n“The inspector’s comments are a clear vindication of the position taken by groups opposed to Cherwell’s plans to devastate green spaces in South Cherwell on the basis of an assumed need that has been significantly inflated.\nDuring the public inquiry, Cherwell resolutely refused to listen to calls from myself and MP Layla Moran to delay their plans until the City’s need had been properly established. It’s now clear we were right and the need to suspend Cherwell’s local plan review, regardless of their planning inspector’s verdict, is even more urgent.\nThe assumptions on housing need used by the OGB have now been undermined by 2 independent studies, and a planning inspector. How much more evidence does the council need to admit that their proposals in Kidlington, Begbroke and Yarnton are misguided and woefully unsound?\nIt would be hugely irresponsible for a council to impose such sweeping and irreversible damage on local communities when they know that the data underpinning those plans is at best questionable and at worse completely wrong”\nThe planning inspector is expected to publish his response to the Cherwell Local plan review in the next few weeks.\nYou can see the full text of the planning inspector’s comments and questions on the city council plan here https://www.oxford.gov.uk/downloads/file/6397/ic1_-_inspectors_initial_questions_and_comments_to_occ",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_pioneer-square/content_255.html": "As I said in the recent election debate on the BBC, in my opinion they shouldn’t.\nThere are many reasons it’s a bad idea, both from a business perspective and as part of local spending priorities.\nI’ve worked in retail nearly all my life. I built and ran a national chain of jewellery stores across the country and traded in several shopping centres, including some of the most prestigious in the country such as Bluewater in Kent and the new Bullring Centre in Birmingham. I write a regular column for Retail week Magazine and comment regularly in the national press on retail issues as well as offering consultancy services. One of my main focusses is independent retail and commercial property. So I know a little bit about what I’m talking about.\nCherwell District Council (CDC) leader Barry Wood claims that buying the Castle Quay Shopping Centre in Banbury is a good deal for the people of Cherwell. This decision was also backed by the Labour group on the council and their leader Sean Woodcock has assured me there’s a good business case for doing it. Unfortunately neither of them have been able to show it to me so far.\nTheir belief is that buying a commercial property like a shopping centre is a good idea as property will always rise in value. This may be the case for domestic property and some kinds of commercial premises, but not always with retail space.\nA Good Investment?\nThe argument for buying the scheme seems to be that if they hadn’t, the centre would have shut down. It has many long term empty units and is generally struggling to compete in an ever crowded marketplace. The council’s decision a few years ago to allow a new shopping park to open on the outskirts of Banbury haven’t helped its plight.\nIt’s extremely unlikely though that it would have closed down. Much more likely that it would have been offloaded by its pension investment owners to another investment company with more experience of running a shopping centre than some local councillors.\nMoreover, if the argument is that the centre was about to collapse, that doesn’t exactly make it an attractive investment for public money does it?\nThere have been some shopping centre failures in the past, but they are few and far between. But when they do go, they tend to go completely. That means an almost total loss for anyone unlucky enough to be the owner at the time. There will be some residual value in the land, but that’s unlikely to reflect the full price paid for the whole development.\nThere have been a growing number of retail failures in recent years with 650 collapses so far this year alone, and we’re not even half way through yet! Some of them very high profile and heavily leveraged operations. Others are busy negotiating partial closures and rent reductions with their landlords. Others are moving more into the online arena and abandoning physical retail space almost altogether.\nNone of this bodes well for an under-let, under-invested and down at heel shopping centre in a struggling town in North Oxfordshire.\nSo essentially CDC are gambling with public money against the odds. And it doesn’t end there.\nOther Costs\nAccording to Barry Wood the scheme is turning a profit at the moment, but as I’ve said previously, I’ve not seen evidence of that. I have seen a large number of long term voids in the centre, and with the potential for these to increase in number I fear the profitability may be marginal or likely to decline.\nThere will also be ongoing running costs for the centre and presumably additional investment to do whatever it is with the place that they feel will revitalise it. Again details on that are sketchy, but I think there’s some talk about dividing the larger units into smaller ones to attract independent retailers. Whilst I support that idea to some extent there are a lot of things to consider about that course of action.\nFirstly the cost of doing the work, which may include major re-modelling of the units due to, amongst other things, fire regulations. I’ve seen at least one shopping centre management come unstuck with similar plans due to rules on access to fire exit routes.\nHelping Smaller Retailers?\nSecondly smaller independents usually don’t have a huge budget for shopfitting, so there will be additional cost in partially fitting out the units, including new shopfronts etc to attract smaller operators and to ensure that their stores fit in with a modern shopping centre scheme.\nBusiness Rates\nThirdly there’s the loss of business rates on the empty units that are there now, and will most likely be there for a while. Considering the current climate in retail there’s also a good chance that voids could increase. At the moment the landlords will be paying rates on those premises even though they’re empty and a good deal of that money goes to CDC. With the council now being the landlords, they’re going to be paying the rates to themselves, effectively wiping out that income.\nDevaluation of the Asset\nFinally there’s the issue of valuation. Shopping developments are broadly valued on their rental potential. This is why landlords will leave units empty rather than let them out at a reduced rent. If the council’s plan is to lower the rent for smaller or other retailers, that will have a knock on effect on the value of those units and then on others when rent reviews come around. Other tenants now paying a higher rent will also push for a reduction when their leases come up for renewal or rent reviews are due or maybe even before.\nThe net effect of this would be to push down rents, not only in the centre but across the town, reducing loan to asset values across the board. In broad terms I’d welcome that. I’ve long argued that retail property values are hugely inflated. But in terms of the Council’s investment exposure in Castle Quay it’s a potentially dangerous situation, not only leading to a potential devaluation of the asset, but also any loans secured on it being partially called in.\nThere may be some balancing in terms of appreciation on the total asset value, but in the current climate and in a falling retail market, there a very good chance that the overall value of the scheme will fall relative to the amount the council has sunk into it, both as an initial investment and any further day to day expenditure.\nAll of this appears to have passed Cherwell Councillors and the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives by. They obviously have a very patchy understanding of how retail property works and the implications and pitfalls they are letting us all as council tax payers in for.\nMoreover there’s the question of if so much money should be focussed in the north of the district while ignoring other areas. Mr Wood commented in the Radio debate on Wednesday that he recognised that there were empty units in Pioneer Square in Bicester and that it was difficult to get them filled. Yet this doesn’t seem to have concerned him over the purchase of Castle Quay. Indeed, having set the precedent in Banbury I asked him during the debate if the council intended to buy Pioneer Square as well. He didn’t reply.\nOther Options\nA more sensible and prudent approach to the problems in both areas would be to work with the landlords rather than bailing them out with public money. Leave them with the risk whilst introducing local initiatives that help smaller retailers get a foothold and would also support the centre.\nThese could include rates reductions, which Barry Wood dismissed out of hand when I challenged him on it during the election debate. Neither he nor Sean Woodcock appeared to know that it has been within the gift of local councils to reduce rates on specific properties at their discretion for several years now.\nIf they wanted to provide smaller, more affordable space for independent retailers, they could lease units from the centres on a medium to long term basis, probably negotiating favourable terms with the landlords as a council will have a very good covenant. These could then be divided up (if required) and then sublet on flexible terms on reduced rents to retailers, although this would have to be agreed beforehand with the landlord for the same reasons discussed above concerning rental levels and valuations.\nThis would achieve the same aim of revitalising schemes both in Banbury and Bicester and would not involve the council in risking large amounts of public money. It would also mean that the bulk of the £60m they are now tying up in one area could be spread across the district.\nThis is the kind of strategic thinking we need, rather that the amateurish speculation of a council who seems to want to play at being shopkeepers with our money. This is why we need a more diverse representation on the council and councillors like me who will challenge these misguided moves before millions of pounds of desperately needed council funds are put at risk.",

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_planning_page_2/content_331.html": "Last night we saw the Cherwell Conservatives in their true colours as they waved through some fundamental changes to the council constitution despite the report they were based on being full of errors and inconsistencies.\nThe report itself had not been through the scrutiny and overview process, neither had any councillor, to my knowledge, been previously consulted or invited to comment on it. It was simply dropped on to the December meeting agenda, possibly in the hope that it wouldn’t receive too much attention from councillors in the run up to Christmas.\nThis throws up a fundamental question on how the council is run. Should significant issues of democratic accountability be amended by officers with virtually no input from elected councillors? I’d argue not. Councillors are bound by the constitution and the rules governing meetings. They should at the very least be consulted appropriately on any changes that will affect these rules.\nThe proposals included restrictions on motions and amendments length, shorter notice periods for questions to council, and the ability to reject motions on the basis of heavily subjective assessments of them being ‘vexatious’ or ‘frivolous’. They are arguably designed to limit both the scope of debates and, by implication, the ability of councillors to fully represent their ward residents.\nArguments were put forward that these rules already exist on some local councils, yet in Oxfordshire only one out of 5 district councils have similar rules (although with far greater latitude on things like motion length) and only the County Council has anything approaching this level of restriction. It’s arguable that the County, with usually a far greater number of motions and procedural matters need a more streamlined system, but at district level this has never been an issue in Oxfordshire.\nOne has to ask what the motivations would be for the council agreeing to these proposals so readily. It’s probable that after the recent change in the makeup of the council, with more non-conservative councillors being elected every year, the Tories are simply frightened of public debate.\nThis would appear to be predicated on the Conservatives bare-faced admission that they had already decided how they would vote on issues before any motion was proposed or debate initiated. Barry Wood’s repeated claim in meetings that all his councillors will essentially do as they are told completely undermines the basis of individual councillor representation.\nEven though the report containing these proposals was significantly flawed, it was voted through by the Conservatives on the apparent understanding that it could be re-written or corrected later, without the need for further ratification. That in itself would seem to be a ludicrous approach. How can any such changes be approved in advance of knowing what they are?\nAs we have seen on numerous occasions, this is the reality of democracy in Cherwell, where the dominant follow-my-leader Tories vote en-bloc on everything, regardless of the interests of the people they represent.\nThis was evident during the debate at the same meeting over a second successive motion brought to the council calling on it to oppose the Oxford to Cambridge Expressway. This included claims from Councillor Dan Sames – the council’s lead on green issues – that he is “passionate” about the environment, whilst simultaneously keeping an ‘open mind’ about a huge motorway being built, possibly through environmentally sensitive areas like Otmoor, which he represents. Councillors like this voted for a climate change emergency motion and then somehow reconcile that with building a huge motorway. This shows just how little commitment they really have towards care for the environment.\nCherwell District Council is now the only council in Oxfordshire not to have voted to oppose the Expressway. As a result they are tacitly supporting it subject only to the final route. Any route will be environmentally damaging, but this doesn’t seem to be an issue for the ‘Concreting Conservatives’.\nThe fact that council leader, Barry Wood, is also the Chair of the Arc Leaders Group appointed by the MHCLG to promote the expressway plans, as well as being an OxLEP and Oxfordshire Growth Board member – both organisations with a vested interest in promoting the expressway – seems not to be regarded as significant bias by the council. I’d surmise that that is the only reason why we’re still having this debate in Cherwell – the instruction from Cllr Wood to his poodle councillors appears to be that they should not undermine his position on all these bodies by opposing one of their keynote projects.\nI do not have an open mind about the Expressway and will continue to oppose it at every opportunity in favour of much more sustainable and environmentally sensitive projects such as East/West Rail. We do not need any more massive major road building projects in this part of the county (or arguably anywhere else) regardless of which route they may take. The Green Party’s commitment to tackling climate change cannot be overruled by the imperatives of growth for its own sake that lie at the heart of Conservative proposals in Oxfordshire.\nYou can view a webcast of the entire meeting on the Cherwell District Council website here http://modgov.cherwell.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=114&MId=3240&Ver=4",

Increased development on surrounding areas has also exacerbated the problem, and with huge amounts of additional houses planned for the green fields around villages in South Cherwell, there are now serious concerns amongst residents about what the future holds.\nRun-off from areas like Spring Hill are sources of flood water which now regularly hit the villages of Yarnton and Begbroke below. These are areas due to be built on as part of Cherwell’s recently adopted partial plan review (site PR9).\nI’m regularly being contacted, both as a district and parish councillor, by residents watching flood water approaching their homes, yet there are very few options open to me to help them.\nThese incidents often occur out of office hours. As a district councillor I have an emergency response number to call, but the last time I used that when I was trying to help residents facing flooding in Garden City Kidlington, I was told I should call the police and ask them to deal with it. When I did so, the police operator seemed bemused that I was given that advice\nOther agencies such as the fire service are quite understandably reluctant to tie up vital fire and rescue resources unless property has actually been inundated. This is quite a distressing situation to have to explain to residents who are trying to prevent that from happening in the first place.\nThames water are usually difficult to reach and often do very little when they are finally contacted. I hear regular complaints about blocked drains and flood channels as well as pumping stations either not working at all or being unable to cope with the level of flood water. Again, the only emergency contact I have for Thames Water is the same number that any member of the public can call\nThe county council will deliver sandbags, but usually by that point the situation has reached crisis level and residents have to hope that they will hold back water which may already be at their thresholds\nThis just isn’t good enough. We need to stop treating these incidents as one-off events and put together a credible, structured, multi-agency response that can swing into action when councillors and other local agencies need it. It’s very frustrating as a local councillor not being able to help when residents expect you to have levers to pull that just aren’t available to us\nAdvancing climate change means that we will now have to live with the escalating threat of flooding on a year-round basis. Increased development on what are now relatively permeable green spaces, such as Spring Hill in Begbroke will only make matters worse.\nThis is not a criticism of individual agencies. There just seems to be no credible protocol about what can and should be done and who should be doing it. We need a central control point that can co-ordinate a response to all levels of flooding whenever and wherever it happens, as well as a local flood task force to ensure flood defences are mapped and regularly maintained.\nAdvancing climate change means that we will now have to live with the escalating threat of flooding on a year-round basis. Increased development on what are now relatively permeable green spaces, such as Spring Hill in Begbroke will only make matters worse.\nSite promoters promise that they will put flood defences in place, but with the frequency and intensity of flooding increasing every year, most defences will eventually be overwhelmed. Developers are also usually more concerned with ensuring new properties don’t flood, with less consideration for the impact of new developments on existing residents. Areas that may in the past have been flood free will soon find themselves in the firing line with little hope of holding those responsible to account. I made a video about this last year that you can see below",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_sewage/content_237.html": "I’ve just spent a couple of days in the gorgeous village of Stonesfield researching the state of the river Evenlode which was recently given the unenviable title of the most polluted river in England.\nAnd it’s hardly surprising given that in the past few years the amount of sewage being pumped in to the river has risen from 8000 hours per year to 12000 hours. The river itself is not insubstantial, being deep enough in some areas to swim in, although these days you’d be brave to risk it given the level of E coli and other nasties lurking in its once crystal clear depths.\nI spoke to brilliant local councillor Genny Early about the history of the river that she’s lived near for the past 30 years and the tale was not a happy one. Where once you could look out from the local footbridge at fish swimming amongst the river weeds and watch local dogs play happily in the waters, we now have a soupy grey clag, virtually devoid of life and reputedly toxic to everyone including our canine companions.\nThe cause is toxic dumping from up to 9 different local sewage works, given effective carte blanche by the Conservative government to use this river, and others in the area, as an open sewer to enable companies like Thames Water to pay out record dividends to investors whilst doing next to nothing to fix inadequate infrastructure.\nThis is the starkest example of how privatisation has failed us all with greedy and cynical corporations grabbing every opportunity to make obscene amounts of money by (in this case) quite literally shitting on local communities.\nI made a video with Genny showing just how bad things have got in this area, in sickening contrast to the beautiful local landscape. You can watch it by clicking here.\nWe simply can’t allow this situation to continue and only the Greens have the real solution to take privatised utilities back into public control where they belong. Water is quite literally an essential for life on this planet. If we’ve reached the point where that is simply a commodity to be bartered between corporations on the open market we really have reached the bottom of a very murky barrel.\nGreens would take water and other essential public utilities and services back into public control as the only way to deal with this obscene failure of duty to keep our waterways and rivers clean and accessible for wildlife and recreation. Other parties are suggesting half way houses of fines and extra taxation. None of that will work in an industry that simply doesn’t care any more.\nWe need radical solutions to these unprecedented outcomes and only the Green Party has a vision bold enough to deliver those.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2018_05/content_50.html": "Another election fought and another campaign behind us n Cherwell\nIt was very solid result for the Greens in Kidlington East with a convincing second place well above Labour and a tripling of our 2016 vote. Moreover a spectacular win for my electoral partner, Libdem candidate Alaric Rose in Kidlington West who nearly doubled the Libdem vote and completely wiped the floor with the Conservatives!\nIt would have been great to have won my seat as well, but with such a short campaign it was hard to get the message out to enough people. Ultimately it was a total validation for both of us of our decision to work together for the common good.\nSlightly galling that the Carmen Griffiths kept her seat as I understand she was hardly seen on the campaign trail. She wasn’t at the count, didn’t make an appearance on polling day (to my knowledge) and instead sat back and let local Tory cult figures like Maurice Billington do all the campaigning for her.\nJudging by her attendance record at council meetings this seems to be a pattern of behaviour for a pretty lacklustre councillor. I think many of the voters in the ward didn’t actually know which blue candidate they were voting for and seemed oblivious to the fact that there were more dedicated candidates on offer who would much more effectively represent them in Cherwell.\nPerhaps when Carmen and her remaining Tory colleagues fail to turn up at other key planning meetings and the green belt is concreted over, bringing with it traffic chaos, pollution, and the collapse of local infrastructure, all those that trooped into the polling station to dutifully put a cross in the Tory box, regardless of the candidate, will realise their mistake. It might be a bit late then though.\nOne other stark reality from the results is that if Labour had endorsed me (as we suggested) and we had endorsed them in one of the North Oxfordshire wards (as we offered) we would both have easily won our seats, meaning a new Labour, Green and Libdem seat on the council and 3 Tory losses instead of 1. Just imagine what sort of message that would have sent out! Especially on important and urgent local issues like the building on green belt in the area.\nLabour really need to wake up to the reality of fractured left politics in this country and work with other parties like the Greens and the Libdems. We need to stop living in the past and embrace the future. There’s more that unites us than divides us and if we’re going to stop yet another Conservative government in 2022 we must start building alliances. If anyone from Labour wants to talk, I’m all ears.\nIn the meantime I intend to go on being a thorn in the side of Cherwell’s complacent Tory leadership and will be working closely with Alaric as part of our pre-election co-operative agreement. I may not be able to vote on council matters, but I can certainly speak up in the council chamber and outside in the media. I’ll be fighting hard on local green belt and conservation issues and keeping a wary eye on the attendance record of my Tory opponent. The Greens will be fighting the elections in the ward once again next year and I hope that will again be in partnership with the Liberal Democrats.\nFinally a big thank you to everyone who voted for me and to the dedicated people who helped us pull together such a professional campaign in such a short time. the Greens made historic gains across the country yesterday and I think it’s a credit to all our members that we can do this stuff on such a small budgets and with small teams. Just think what we could do in government!\nStay tuned and follow this website/blog for updates on what I and the Green Party will be doing between now and the next elections.\nVoteGreen#2019",

The Banbury Phone Box Library is one such brilliant piece of local engagement which is now garnering international attention as BT looks towards chopping it off at the knees.\nThe red phone box is almost as iconic as the red bus as a national symbol of Britain around the world. You’d think if you were company who owns and operates these highly visible pieces of cultural capital you’d be only too pleased to see them being involved in well supported local campaigns that add value to a service that is perhaps not as loved as it once was.\nIn that context it seems daft to me that BT are hell bent on annoying small and large communities across the country by removing public call boxes where they’re valued for numerous reasons other than a quick natter on the phone. It’s even more self-defeating that they’re erasing some of the very symbols of Britishness that have helped them build a world class multi-national company.\nIt has to be said that the Town Council in Banbury share some of the potential blame if the box is removed, as they are refusing to adopt it (something that BT now allow for the princely sum of £1), if BT go ahead with plans to decommission the phone service in the box. Previously they struck a deal with BT to adopt the box and save the library and a local steel fabrication firm offered to fix permanent shelves in the box to house the books to assuage BT’s prior objections to the library service on health and safety grounds, as they believed the current shelving arrangements could be dangerous.\nBT now claims that it is uneconomic for them to continue to run the service anyway, even though I understand thousands of calls were made from it last year.\nThe under-story seems to be that BT want out of the call box game at any cost, and most of that cost will be borne by local communities using the boxes for a number of vital social services or simply to make a call when other options are not available to them.\nBanbury Town Council now say that they’re not prepared to adopt the box if it is then decommissioned by BT. Whilst I support taking a stance against the loss of the phone service, I think it would be a sad loss to the community of the box were to be removed as a result of the Town Council refusing to adopt the box itself.\nMoreover, If BT are claiming the box is loss making, I think it would be useful for them to provide the figures backing that up. It would at least give us an idea of the likely shortfall which could perhaps be covered in some other way.\nIt’s also crazy that BT are missing this as an opportunity for some very positive PR. It has to be said that they’re not universally loved as a company, so something like this, that is fairly minimal in cost terms, would seem to be a great way for them to connect with the community.\nGoing forward perhaps the government needs to bring in a legal requirement on telecoms companies like this to provide a certain number of public call points in an area. Just because most of us carry mobiles now, doesn’t mean that sometimes they might not fail at a vital time, or have been forgotten when they’re most needed. I know BT used to be obliged to seek permission from local or parish councils in order to remove a box, but it sounds like that requirement has now been watered down. In very rural areas mobile phone reception is also notoriously patchy. In those areas call boxes provide a vital service for emergency calls.\nIn terms of usage statistics, it might also be interesting to track the number of calls made against the minimum price of a call in a phone box, which I understand is now 60p. Perhaps BT need to be reminded of the law of supply and demand.\nIf you’re on Twitter you can follow and support the campaign to save the Banbury Phone Box Library by following the hashtag #SaveOurPhoneboxLibrary",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2019_12_page_3/content_413.html": "I took a day out of campaigning this week to attend and speak at the public inquiry of the Oxford City local plan.\nIt was a feeling of déjà vu for me as I spent several days doing the same thing in Cherwell earlier this year when our local plan partial review was being examined. Cherwell is pushing to build thousands of houses on green belt land in the south of the district and I have been campaigning for the past 2 years to protect those vital green areas for future generations.\nI was at the inquiry into the city plans because it’s those proposals that are forcing local district councils to add to their own housing requirements to service what the city claims is an ‘unmet need’. Whilst I and other campaigners don’t dispute that Oxford has a need for housing for its own workers, claims that they can’t meet that need within their own boundaries are hotly disputed.\nIt’s generally believed that the reason they can’t meet that need themselves is that they would rather use their own land for economic development to build more shops, offices, hotels, restaurants and student accommodation. The Labour run city council then expect the surrounding rural districts to meet their housing need for them and Conservative run councils like Cherwell are only too glad to oblige as this gives them a perfect excuse to enrich the local landowners and developers who support them.\nIt’s sad to see that both Labour and the Conservatives are pursuing a policy of green belt destruction in Oxfordshire when there really is no need. There are plenty of brownfield sites available to build on, as well as empty properties that should be re-purposed or brought back into use.\nI want to see more genuinely affordable housing for people on average incomes. More social and council housing. Rent controls on private landlords and an end to unfair developer lease & ground rent charges, but we will never see large amounts of affordable housing in Oxfordshire if they are built on high value green belt land. The only reason these areas are targetted is because they are ripe to be used by developers to build high value executive homes and mini-mansions to make a massive killing.\nThere should not be development on Green Belt land except where there is an incontrovertible need to do so. Our precious green spaces should not be handed over the developers simply to make huge profits for landowners and speculators, especially when much of that housing is not affordable in any real sense.\nGreen spaces are also now even more vital to help combat climate change and flooding. Concreting them over and adding more roads and houses with inefficient heating systems just piles on the pressure to the environment and exports Oxford’s poor air quality standards to the rural areas of the county.\nThe Green party has pledged to build 100,000 genuinely affordable socially rented properties every year for 10 years. Houses that will be built to the Passive House standard meaning they will be both sustainable and affordable to maintain and heat.\nThis will not only provide much-needed homes for people of average incomes, they will be the right houses in the right places and will also provide employment for thousands of builders and manufacturers.\nThis is on top of retrofitting every house in the country to make them more energy efficient as part of our Green New Deal.\nAs a founding member of a housing co-op in London in the 1980s, I also want to encourage other ways of getting people into affordable housing such as Land Trusts and Co-ops and see more social and council housing built.\nYou can find out more about our policies on housing in our manifesto here https://www.greenparty.org.uk/assets/files/Elections/Green%20Party%20Manifesto%202019.pdf",

On a broader scale, taking into account some small gains in the first 2 years the council owned the development, it will have racked up losses in the region of £2.5m by the end of the next financial year if the current predictions are correct. To close the gap left by that hole in the budget there have been additional service cuts with around a third of those in the forthcoming budget directly attributable to pressures from Castle Quay.\nYou may have seen some of this in the press this week in Oxford Mail and the Banbury Guardian\nI was also interviewed by BBC Radio Oxford, although my section was recorded and heavily edited, after which Cllr Tony Ilot ,the Lead Member for Financial Management & Governance on Cherwell District Council, was invited on the show live to respond. If we’d been on at the same time I might have pointed out that as the councillor responsible for this development it would have been more encouraging had he bothered to do his homework before coming on. At one point he seemed uncertain about how much the losses amounted to (he guessed at £1.3m and the interviewer had to correct him that it was £1.6m) and he also claimed that the £1.6m was a cumulative loss since the council took ownership. It’s not, it’s just the predicted loss for the forthcoming year on top of a similar one for the last year. You’d think the Lead Member for Financial Management & Governance might have been a little more cognisant of the situation given the scale of problem, but this lack of concern over important details is a familiar theme with Cherwell’s Conservatives.\nCllr Ilot also seemed quite laid back about the fact that the centre is now worth less than half what was paid for item having lost a whopping £30m in value. They are also currently spending even more than the original purchase price for the shopping centre on the canal side extension which, as a retail analyst myself, I think they are going to struggle to make a return on.\nYou can listen to the interview in full here\nThe council’s line on this has been that the losses at CQ have not directly resulted in an increase in the council tax. As that increase was already in the pipeline anyway that’s probably fair to say, but it also fair to say that if this white elephant wasn’t providing such a huge financial drag on the council’s resources, we may not have needed to increase the tax and we certainly wouldn’t have need many of the cuts in services.\nIt will be interesting to see how much support we get for the high street in Kidlington and the Exeter Close project in the light of all this. Certainly something we can point them to if they start penny-pinching on our project to support the eye-watering amounts of public money that’s being poured into one scheme in the far north of the district that we’re all footing the bill for.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_community_page_10/content_444.html": "Hydraulic Fracturing or ‘Fracking’ is a new unconventional and controversial technique for extracting gas and in some case oil from the deep bedrock. It has serious environmental and quality of life issues for all of us, but particularly for those of us who live in areas that sit on top of these deposits. Unfortunately for us, that included large areas of North Oxford and Cherwell.\nFracking has been sold as being the answer to the UK’s energy problems, but in areas like the USA where it’s been widely used, this has not been proved to be the case. What has been shown is that it contaminates water supplies and creates huge amounts of noise and disruption for local residents. It’s also been implicated as the cause land movements and in some cases actual earthquakes. Indeed when the first test drill was sunk in the UK near Blackpool, they experienced one of the strongest earth tremors recorded in the area in decades.\nThe main process involves drilling large bore holes, often sideways underneath properties not owned by the drilling companies (as right that has now been granted to them by the government) and pumping a cocktail of water and up to 90 different chemicals, many of them highly toxic, into the ground under immense pressure. This cracks the rock and releases trapped gas. The water is then recycled back into the normal water system where it’s treated and used again. That is apart from the water that leaks into local water courses and along with some of chemicals and the gas.\nIf you want to see how this process affects local people watch the film Gasland and Gasland 2, clips of which are available on YouTube.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZe1AeH0Qz8\nAnother main method is something called underground coal gasification, which involved drilling into coal seams and then setting them alight. The controlled burn then generates coal gas which is extracted. This process is often hard to control and becomes every bit as horrific as it sounds. This is the type of extraction that we could see being used in areas like Bloxham which sits on large coal deposits.\nA national pressure group has also been set up called ‘Frack Off’. They recently released a short video that explains what we may see in our area if fracking is allowed to go ahead.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYniYtJEeeI\ngovernment’s presumption against fracking in designated areas, such as national parks, goes to show that the Coalition recognises that hydraulic fracking will harm the environment and presents significant risks.\nThe Green Party calls on the government to offer all communities the same protection from dirty and dangerous fracking and shift energy policy focus instead towards clean, renewable energy sources and energy conservation.\nThe latest bidding process for licenses to extract shale gas from large parts of the UK is under way. The government is also proposing to pay large amounts of money to local councils that support fracking, regardless of local residents wishes.\nAbout half the UK is open to exploration, but tightened rules cover areas of outstanding beauty and large areas of Cherwell. The Green Party is the only mainstream political party fighting to stop fracking being pushed through by a government which consistently puts corporate profit over people.\nCaroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, said:\n“While the Government has signalled an intention to ensure some protective measures, we can have little confidence in promises of a robust regulatory framework.\n“We know fracking can cause water contamination and shortages, as well as air and soil pollution. And this is an industry that’s made a catalogue of errors already. But legitimate concerns over its very real environmental and health risks are falling on deaf ears.\n“By seeking to lock us ever-more firmly into fossil fuel dependence the Government is turning a blind eye to reason. It’s crystal clear that we need to be shifting to clean, renewable energy sources.\n“We need a rapid shift to a zero carbon economy and that is not going to happen by pouring resources into establishing an entirely new fossil fuel industry.”\nAs your MP I would fight tooth and nail to prevent our wonderful communities and countryside from being torn apart by this ‘bottom of the barrel’ technology. The Green Party is the only major party standing up against these proposals and we need support of local communities to help us stop these wells from being set up before it’s too late. Once the process is begun we may all live to regret the fact that we didn’t stand up to be counted when we had the chance.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_rental-losses/content_123.html": "Many people will have heard the absurd comments from Cherwell’s lead councillor for Financial Management and Governance, Tony Ilott, on BBC Oxford breakfast radio on Tuesday. I thought it was worth covering a few of the comments made by the Conservative representative in more detail.\nThe programme featured a running topic on the amount of back rent owed to several councils in Oxfordshire and you can hear it here. This is not a problem unique to this county as so many councils now rely on commercial investment to make ends meet since central government no longer provide enough funding for even the basic services that we all rely on.\nThis problem is exacerbated by the fact that legislation requires local authorities to balance their budgets every year and prevents them from borrowing to cover any shortfalls. This leaves them in the position of trying to operate like private investors without having the same financial flexibility.\nWith many local authorities now heavily invested in commercial property they have all faced a huge shortfall in income from rents that have not been paid throughout the pandemic. To add insult to this injury, even though the Chancellor said he would provide “whatever it takes” to help local government, central government has excluded losses from commercial investments from it’s support payments to councils.\nThe need to balance the books each year results in councils being left with only 2 options when they have a shortfall in rents. Either they increase council tax (which can only be done up to certain limits without a costly referendum) or they cut services.\nthat’s going to be a pretty expensive chicken dinner for the residents of Cherwell!\nThis is what Cherwell District Council did in 2021 when they reported losses in the region of £1.6m against the Castle Quay shopping centre in Banbury. With similar losses predicted for the next financial year, this is likely to put the same pressures on the budget for the following year which will inevitably mean yet more cuts, along with additional charges like we’ve seen this year for things like garden waste collections.\nCommercial landlords would usually carry these sorts of shortfalls over a period of years, often borrowing to cover the gaps, and recover as much of the rent as they could over that time with deferral agreements with tenants. Ultimately some of the losses may have to be written off. But as explained above, councils can’t do this. So as long as these shortfalls are on the books, more cuts or tax increases are the only way to deal with the problem each year.\nIt was clear though from the interview Cllr Ilott really didn’t understand any of the mechanics of this, which is quite staggering considering his role on the council. When he was asked if he thought there should be a change in legislation that would allow councils to deal with these problems, he said he didn’t think so. Instead he chose to make childish personal comments about me and avoided answering the interviewer’s questions about how the council will recover these losses.\nit’s clear that they have no real vision for how to revitalise the development other than the idea that making it bigger will somehow make it better.\nHe did make mention of ‘working with tenants’ which of course is a good plan. As a retail consultant myself I’d always advocate such a move, but due to the limitations imposed on councils, this can only be done on a year by year basis. Any outstanding debts at the end of each year will need to be accounted for and action taken on increased taxation or services cuts.\nCllr Illot suggested that we look at things “in the round” and I agree we should do that. Unfortunately, time restraints on the programme prevented me from laying out the full details, but I’m happy to do so here :\n- Losses in the last financial year attributable to Castle Quay – £1.6m\n- Losses predicted in the next financial year due to Castle Quay – approx £1.6m\n- Rent owed to Cherwell District Council at this point – nearly £2m\n- Loss in value of Castle Quay shopping centre since the council took full ownership – over £30m (it’s now worth less than half what they paid for it 4 years ago)\n- Additional investment being ploughed into expanding the centre – £73m (underwritten by council tax payers)\n- Interest on the loans to finance all this (so far) – £2m+ per year\n- Cuts required to the entire council budget this year – £4.4m\nYes some of this can be blamed on the pandemic, but retail was already on the decline when the council took the frankly bizarre decision to buy the scheme, especially as it’s clear that they have no real vision for how to revitalise the development other than the idea that making it bigger will somehow make it better. That and Cllr Ilott’s head in the sand optimism seems to be the main strategy from our Conservative councillors.\nI don’t see that as good value for the council tax payers of Cherwell. Judging by Cllr Illott’s flippancy and lack of concern he seems to regard massive financial losses along with the associated financial impact on resident’s pockets as fine as long as he can get some chicken.\nI’d say that taking all that into account that’s going to be a pretty expensive chicken dinner for the residents of Cherwell!\nAnd let’s not forget that all this money is going into one town in Cherwell – Banbury. Meanwhile Bicester town centre’s retail area is being hollowed out due to the council’s planning decisions elsewhere, and the whole of the district – every single tax payer – is footing the bill for all this incompetence. As is often the case with Cherwell Council , the south of the district is left to fend for itself and pick up the tab.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_author_ianmiddleton99_page_7/content_431.html": "Many people will have heard the absurd comments from Cherwell’s lead councillor for Financial Management and Governance, Tony Ilott, on BBC Oxford breakfast radio on Tuesday. I thought it was worth covering a few of the comments made by the Conservative representative in more detail.\nThe programme featured a running topic on the amount of back rent owed to several councils in Oxfordshire and you can hear it here. This is not a problem unique to this county as so many councils now rely on commercial investment to make ends meet since central government no longer provide enough funding for even the basic services that we all rely on.\nThis problem is exacerbated by the fact that legislation requires local authorities to balance their budgets every year and prevents them from borrowing to cover any shortfalls. This leaves them in the position of trying to operate like private investors without having the same financial flexibility.\nWith many local authorities now heavily invested in commercial property they have all faced a huge shortfall in income from rents that have not been paid throughout the pandemic. To add insult to this injury, even though the Chancellor said he would provide “whatever it takes” to help local government, central government has excluded losses from commercial investments from it’s support payments to councils.\nThe need to balance the books each year results in councils being left with only 2 options when they have a shortfall in rents. Either they increase council tax (which can only be done up to certain limits without a costly referendum) or they cut services.\nthat’s going to be a pretty expensive chicken dinner for the residents of Cherwell!\nThis is what Cherwell District Council did in 2021 when they reported losses in the region of £1.6m against the Castle Quay shopping centre in Banbury. With similar losses predicted for the next financial year, this is likely to put the same pressures on the budget for the following year which will inevitably mean yet more cuts, along with additional charges like we’ve seen this year for things like garden waste collections.\nCommercial landlords would usually carry these sorts of shortfalls over a period of years, often borrowing to cover the gaps, and recover as much of the rent as they could over that time with deferral agreements with tenants. Ultimately some of the losses may have to be written off. But as explained above, councils can’t do this. So as long as these shortfalls are on the books, more cuts or tax increases are the only way to deal with the problem each year.\nIt was clear though from the interview Cllr Ilott really didn’t understand any of the mechanics of this, which is quite staggering considering his role on the council. When he was asked if he thought there should be a change in legislation that would allow councils to deal with these problems, he said he didn’t think so. Instead he chose to make childish personal comments about me and avoided answering the interviewer’s questions about how the council will recover these losses.\nit’s clear that they have no real vision for how to revitalise the development other than the idea that making it bigger will somehow make it better.\nHe did make mention of ‘working with tenants’ which of course is a good plan. As a retail consultant myself I’d always advocate such a move, but due to the limitations imposed on councils, this can only be done on a year by year basis. Any outstanding debts at the end of each year will need to be accounted for and action taken on increased taxation or services cuts.\nCllr Illot suggested that we look at things “in the round” and I agree we should do that. Unfortunately, time restraints on the programme prevented me from laying out the full details, but I’m happy to do so here :\n- Losses in the last financial year attributable to Castle Quay – £1.6m\n- Losses predicted in the next financial year due to Castle Quay – approx £1.6m\n- Rent owed to Cherwell District Council at this point – nearly £2m\n- Loss in value of Castle Quay shopping centre since the council took full ownership – over £30m (it’s now worth less than half what they paid for it 4 years ago)\n- Additional investment being ploughed into expanding the centre – £73m (underwritten by council tax payers)\n- Interest on the loans to finance all this (so far) – £2m+ per year\n- Cuts required to the entire council budget this year – £4.4m\nYes some of this can be blamed on the pandemic, but retail was already on the decline when the council took the frankly bizarre decision to buy the scheme, especially as it’s clear that they have no real vision for how to revitalise the development other than the idea that making it bigger will somehow make it better. That and Cllr Ilott’s head in the sand optimism seems to be the main strategy from our Conservative councillors.\nI don’t see that as good value for the council tax payers of Cherwell. Judging by Cllr Illott’s flippancy and lack of concern he seems to regard massive financial losses along with the associated financial impact on resident’s pockets as fine as long as he can get some chicken.\nI’d say that taking all that into account that’s going to be a pretty expensive chicken dinner for the residents of Cherwell!\nAnd let’s not forget that all this money is going into one town in Cherwell – Banbury. Meanwhile Bicester town centre’s retail area is being hollowed out due to the council’s planning decisions elsewhere, and the whole of the district – every single tax payer – is footing the bill for all this incompetence. As is often the case with Cherwell Council , the south of the district is left to fend for itself and pick up the tab. If I were a cynical soul I might suggest that this is because the majority of support for the councillors who agreed to this whole adventure comes from the north of the district.\nBut I think we should all be able to rely on decent fiscal management from our local councillors, no matter where we live. Sadly it seems clear to me that we can’t expect this as long as the Conservatives are in charge.\nIt’s about time the Tories got a proper grip on council finances and stopped playing chicken with all our money!",

It’s not only removing vital green infrastructure it’s also going to massively increase congestion on local roads as it creates another 4500 jobs that the city simply doesn’t need, without providing the houses that it does desperately need.\nOxford City Council claims it can’t meet its own affordable housing needs. The Oxford North development demonstrates the reason why. The City Council chooses not to meet that need and instead pushes it on to the surrounding districts such as Cherwell and South Oxfordshire.\nI joined the protest as Wolvercote directly abuts my district council ward in Cherwell and is likely to impact heavily on Kidlington, especially on top of the extra development that is planned for the area around Kidlington, Gosford and Water Eaton, Yarnton and Begbroke, assuming that goes ahead.\nI made a short video giving some of the context which you can watch using this link below.\nThe people of Wolvercote and North Oxford send a message to St Johns College Oxford University\nWe need to stand up against the same brazen greed that is motivating the concreting over of our precious green spaces before it’s too late. You’ll have a chance to send a message to those councillors who backed these projects in the election in May.\nIn Cherwell the plans were promoted and pushed through by the Conservative ruling group in the face of massive opposition from local residents which they completely disregarded and continue to ignore. In Oxford the Labour run City Council continues to apply pressure on other districts to deal with the housing need the city is making worse by using spaces like these to build more economic development rather than affordable housing,\nGreens have always stood against this sort of opportunistic expansionism for profit and we always will.",

They’ve lost faith in democracy and I don’t blame them when the same party always wins!\nBut in this election there is the chance for change. I can win this vote in the county elections, as I did in 2019 in the district elections, and Fiona Mawson can win in the district again giving, us 2 Green councillors in the area. But we need everyone to get out there and make their mark.\nI’ve lived in Yarnton for 28 years (along with Fiona) and seen how uninterested our local councils are about what happens to our local villages. There’s no better example of this than the concreting over of our green belt, forced on us by the Conservative led District Council.\nTory councillors will tell you they tried to stop it, but they didn’t speak up at the Public Inquiry because they’re not allowed to defy their party leadership. As your Green councillor, we will work for you. Greens don’t answer to a party whip and we always put people before politics.\nI’ve been opposing the council’s development plans for 4 years and I intend to carry on fighting. Our legal challenge will be heard in June and I hope we’ll win. But whatever happens, we’ll need strong local councillors to look out for our interests on planning applications to ensure that developers deliver on infrastructure , flooding protection and health and education provision.\nBut we need everyone to get out and vote to make that happen. If people don’t vote the status quo usually wins. In Oxfordshire that usually means the Tories, but in recent years things have started to change. In 2019 the Greens went from 2 councillors in Oxfordshire to 12. That has really made a difference across the county and that’s palpable in areas like Kidlington where all of a sudden we’re seeing more investment.\nLabour voters might consider voting Green as the best way of removing the Tory stranglehold on our local government and helping to realise some of our shared social justice aims.\nIf you usually vote for another party, you can vote tactically this time, lending your vote to me and Fiona temporarily just for this election. Libdems should vote Green on this occasion as we’re working together as we have done for the past 3 years now. Labour voters might consider voting Green as the best way of removing the Tory stranglehold on our local government and helping to realise some of our shared social justice aims.\nVoting Conservative, or not voting at all, just sends a message to the ruling groups on both the County and the District that we’re all fine with what they’re doing to our areas. They won’t care if you don’t vote, especially if they don’t think you’d vote for them.\nNot voting is not a protest, it’s the epitome of an empty gesture and plays into the hands of the parties that always win. If you really want to protest then get out there and make your mark, and if possible do it for a party that has a chance of upsetting the applecart.\nIf you usually vote for another party, you can vote tactically this time\nIn Kidlington that’s the Green Party. We made the Conservatives sit up and take notice when we won in 2019 and if we do it again this year (twice!) they can’t fail to get the message that their own actions in these areas have consequences. And what’s more you get active, responsive and engaged councillors into the bargain. Just read a few of the endorsements from local residents for me below.\nPlease don’t waste your vote on Thursday.

He stands up for our Green Belt and our environment, and for ensuring that we have a future.”\nDavid Brown, Yarnton Resident\n“Ian delivered for the larder for months, sometimes taking 2-3 routes to make sure our community had food and other essentials during the first lockdown. Thereafter Ian was an ardent supporter of community interests and helped advise and establish the larder”\nEmily Connally, Founder of The Cherwell Larder\n“Ian has been fighting against Cherwell’s proposals to build on green belt land in Begbroke and Yarnton since they were first announced. He’s used every opportunity to oppose them and has always looked out for residents. I believe he would make an excellent county councillor and I would trust him to represent my best interests as a resident in the most effective way.”\nKK, Spring Hill resident\n“Ian has been a huge help to us, and really seems to care about issues impacting residents. Very accessible and always willing to lend advice and support.”\nN Donoghue, Kidlington resident\n“Ian has provided valuable help to the residents in our Close by getting involved and by providing ongoing support. It is reassuring to know that when needed, he is approachable and really does take an active interest in his local community”\nG Bishop, Kidlington resident\n“I first met Ian when he was delivering food to my area during lockdown. He didn’t tell me he was a councillor until weeks later. He’s the sort of councillor we need more of. Someone who cares about our community and isn’t out for himself. He’s always thinking of others and works to make our lives more liveable.”\nSteve Norton, Brandon Close",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_childrens-centres/content_209.html": "Dear Mr Hudspeth\nI was the Green Party Parliamentary Candidate for Banbury in May. I’ve met you a couple of times, the most recent being after the public meeting held in Banbury Town Hall as part of Oxfordshire County Council’s consultation process on the proposed additional £50m cuts to local services.\nSo it was with great interest that I read your correspondence with David Cameron, splashed across national headlines last week, which painted a clear picture of a Prime Minister with only a tenuous grasp on the realities of the demands he has made on local authorities such as Oxfordshire, where he also happens to be an MP.\nAt the meeting we briefly touched on the magnitude of the savings being demanded in the context of our national finances. I made the case that with a national debt of £1.56 trillion – nearly half of which was added by our Conservative Chancellor during the tenure of the last government – a deficit of £83bn and annual interest payments of around £43bn, saving £50m from local authority spending was the equivalent of trying to pay your mortgage off by skipping breakfast once a year.\nWhilst these cuts will have virtually zero impact on the debt left to future generations, they will have a huge effect on those who depend on the front line services being withdrawn. In particular on adult social care facilities and the children’s centres you plan to close which were amongst Mr Cameron’s principal concerns.\nYour reply to me was that we all had to “do our bit”. Well it seems from your response to the PM that ‘our bit’ has already been well and truly done.\nAs a local politician expected to deliver on these impossible polices, I’m sure you know that they are economically illiterate. Cuts to social care will impact on the health service as a whole. Cuts to support for young people have potential effects on social order. Cuts to public transport have serious implications for the workforce and people in isolated rural communities.\nI hope you’ll agree with me that there’s a point where cuts can no longer be the solution to balancing the books. Personally I think we’re already well beyond that line in the sand.\nSo I’m confused by your own position on government policy, given that you continue to publicly affirm that you share Mr Cameron’s blind faith in the blunt instrument of austerity as the answer to all our problems.\nYou’ve also made much of the statistic that 2% of the county’s population consumes 50% of the finances. I’m sure the old, the sick and infirm are a great drain on our public services, but in a modern society surely those people should expect to be looked after by those of us who are better able to do so.\nDo you feel perhaps that this 2% should be prepared to support the more lavish spending plans of our government in other spheres? The wasting of hundreds of billions to allow us to play our part in a thermonuclear Armageddon maybe. Or vanity transport projects that will allow people to get from London to Birmingham 15 minutes faster, when Oxfordshire County Council has just voted to cut local bus subsidies in the county.\nShould Oxfordshire pensioners be made fearful of putting their heating on this winter but be comforted as they shiver in the dark that they are ‘doing their bit’? All this while the government you support hands over £5.9bn to private oil and gas companies – a figure well over a thousand times greater than the cuts we are being asked to make – and slashes support for local renewable energy projects, meaning we will miss EU emissions reductions obligations and become the only G7 country to increase spending on fossil fuels.\nI really feel that you have to come down on one side of the fence or the other here. You can’t continue to support the cuts in public whilst apparently opposing them in private. As leader of the county council, the people of Oxfordshire deserve an unequivocal statement of your aims and allegiances.\nYou will no doubt be aware that Mr Cameron’s intervention in Oxford has now prompted requests from over 100 other councils to have a similar direct consultation with him over budget pressures. He also faces accusations of ministerial impropriety over his intervention with you.\nSo perhaps now would be a good time for hard-pressed council leaders such as yourself to make a firmer stand. You could set an example and refuse to pass what you have already told the PM is an impossible budget to balance in any morally defensible way. I know such actions come with potential repercussions, but if other council leaders followed your lead, how many mutinies could Westminster really handle? This could be your place in history calling!\nAlternatively you could join the drive for the abolition or raising of the now outdated 2% referendum threshold on council tax increases. As you hinted at in your letter to Mr Cameron, selling the family silver can only plug the gaps for so long. If we want well funded local services, we should all be prepared to pay ‘our bit’ for them. Polls carried out by the Oxfordshire Green Party, The Oxford Mail and at your own consultation events have shown that people would be prepared to pay more council tax if they saw the money going to essential services.\nOf course this would require the government to square the circle of increasingly expensive public services without any rise in taxation. But if they truly believe in localism, councils should surely be free to set their own local levy, unhindered by ideological thresholds dictated by central doctrine.\nI think the people of Oxfordshire would welcome your further engagement with the PM on their behalf and with local activists on these matters. I personally look forward to your thoughts on how best to capitalise on what has now become a national talking point, and how we can use this new focus in the best interests of Oxfordshire residents and other similarly concerned groups across the country.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_author_ianmiddleton99_page_21/content_487.html": "This is a copy of a piece I wrote for Huffington Post this week. You can find and comment on the original here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/eu-referendum-immigration_b_9322718.html\nSo here it is. After years of campaigning and complaining, manoeuvring and cajoling, half-truths and good old fashioned British pig-headedness, the moaning masses of middle England have finally got their referendum.\nI say ‘their’ referendum because this isn’t being staged at great expense for those of us who want to stay part of Europe. It’s not even for those who don’t really give a toss either way.\nIt’s certainly not for those more outward looking souls, who appreciate the many advantages of being a member of the European club. The easy movement between states (yes that does apply to us as well as all those annoying refugees and migrants) and the free transport of goods. Funding for urban and industrial renewal. Numerous environmental improvements to beaches, rivers and the countryside, including controls on things like GMOs. Human rights, animal rights, consumer rights. Cheaper phone charges and easier and cheaper travel and currency exchange. Social welfare protection and labour rights, and a panoply of other advantages that most people take for granted and will miss when they’re gone.\nNo, it’s a referendum for misguided and ill-informed little-Englanders, draped in Union flags, firm in the belief of two world wars and one world cup and certain the word ‘Great’ attached to Britain means something other than the first letter on a sticker they slap on the back of their booze cruise charabang, just to remind those envious foreigners that they were unlucky enough to be born on inferior soil.\nBut moreover, it’s a referendum for politicians who have been looking at continental Europe down the wrong end of the telescope for so long now, they just don’t realise how small this country has become on the world stage. A myopic concern about how much money we pay to Europe and a studied ignorance of the huge returns our EU membership generates.\nMost people who focus on our payment to Brussels like to remind us what else we could do with that money. Yet with a growing national debt, and stubbornly high deficit, any such savings would likely fall into the same black hole as most of the rest of our national finances. Either that or it would go towards servicing the country’s circa £50bn annual interest payments, paid in large part to European banks anyway.\nIt’s not 1975. The geo-political landscape has changed around us since the last time we decided if we wanted to be a part of Europe. Yes, back in the swinging 70s it was the ‘Common Market’, but by necessity and common interest it’s become more than that. Those advocating some kind of return to a simple trading relationship are ignoring both the reality of our reduced place in the world and the promiscuity of world markets.\nNeither is it 1938, even though Cameron’s Chamberlain moment was equally as hollow. Just like his pre-war counterpart, the agreement he reached in Brussels was peripheral and disposable, focussing as it did on the false polemic of immigration and border control.\nIt was a pantomime, with Donald Tusk and Angela Merkel as the ugly sisters to Cameron’s Cinderella. Shouts of “they’re behind you” were evident from the likes of UKIP and Front National pointing to the ‘hordes’ or ‘swarms’ or ‘bunches’ of ‘migrants’, ‘refugees’ or ‘immigrants’, depending on which description David Cameron and the BBC have alighted on this week.\nI totally agree that EU democratic and regulatory processes are in desperate need of reform, but these weren’t the points that Cameron argued. Driven by domestic pressures, piled on by a widening xenophobic rhetoric, he was pushed into a rushed and ill-conceived round of negotiations that resulted in him metaphorically claiming ‘peace in our time’ outside Number 10. It was a performance put on to give him a platform to launch the referendum that we all knew was coming, and the critic’s reviews weren’t great.\nSadly for him, us, and the rest of Europe, this was a missed opportunity that could have sparked a trans-national debate about the real future of the EU and brought about radical changes to shape it into something more even-handed and responsive to the needs of all member states.\nBut instead, Cameron wasted what could have been his real place in history for the sake of a thumbs up from the likes of Farage, Gove and Galloway whilst gaining little tangible return for the UK, save for some token restrictions on benefit payments to migrants who rarely claim them anyway.\nIn fact it’s recently been revealed that the UK government has no idea how much immigration costs us, nor how much migrants contribute to our economy. But let’s not let a little thing like lack of facts get in the way of a nicely staked out scapegoat.\nAnd while we’re on the subject of discrimination, we mustn’t forget those hard-pressed city bankers quaking in their handmade brogues, terrified that they may be penalised for being outside the Eurozone. That of course, amid the posturing about immigration, was the main concern for Cameron and his paymasters. Essentially he was in Brussels to fight for the right to discriminate against the poor whilst protecting the interests of the obscenely rich, although of course that wasn’t so eagerly reported.\nAnd there we have it. The crux of all this political, psychological and media-spun mendacity – Corporate interest. Insular businesses seeking to rid themselves of the European interference and regulation that keeps all the rest of us safer and better looked after. The refugee and migrant crises couldn’t have come at a better time for these vested interests to galvanise public opinion in favour of an out vote.\nOn this flimsiest of pretexts, and on evidence largely pulled out UKIP’s collective backside, we’re potentially going to launch ourselves into one of the biggest national disasters for several generations. The ‘Brexit’ silo mentality that is about as relevant in today’s globally connected society as statutes recorded on vellum.\nOne of the greatest achievements and advantages of the EU is freedom of movement between states. It’s a harbinger of a future globalised socio-economic system where borders and statehood will be irrelevant. One where the term ‘economic-migrant’ will no longer be a thinly veiled insult, just as it wasn’t when we and other nations economically migrated across the globe centuries ago, annexing and occupying entire countries as we went. In that context, and in view of the Tories much vaunted ‘on your bike’ ethos, I find it perplexing that we now seem to regard our attraction as place of opportunity as a bad thing.\nAnd while we’re on that subject, if I were a British migrant living on the continent I’d be feeling distinctly uncomfortable right now. Especially those who have lived there for longer than 15 years and are inexplicably denied the right to vote in a referendum that may well decide their future.\nThose whistling tunes in the dark about independent trade agreements with Europe and other global partners will soon find that our status as the 5th richest nation in the world is built on foundations largely stamped with a CE logo. Already Sterling has plummeted on the news that Boris is heading for the lifeboats.\nMuch of our apparent wealth is generated by the financial sector and supported by our membership of the EU. Who will want to trade with us as a small individual nation with a growing national debt and a dwindling economic base? No wonder the city was such a key part of Cameron’s negotiations.\nThe finance sector is pretty much all we have left. We don’t have anything else to trade. China and the USA know this and have already warned us that a UK outside the EU will be of much less interest to them. The US in particular sees our connection with Europe as a valuable conduit into EU financial markets.\nUncoupling ourselves from the EU will be a long, painful and essentially irreversible process. We won’t wake up one day and see bluebirds over the white cliffs and a land of milk and honey for all. It will take years of debate, legal dispute and the unpicking of labyrinthine systems of regulation woven into our own statutory frameworks. A drawn out and retrograde process, during which I believe we’ll slowly come to see the folly of our ways.\nAnd once we’ve closed our borders and thumbed our noses at one of the biggest trading blocs on the planet, it will be too late to realise that we’re now more of a Pekinese than a bulldog. An isle not so much sceptred as septic, poisoned by our own arrogance and bigotry, left entirely at the mercy of a broken political system where wealth goes one way, and protection is only there for those who can afford it.\nAs Britain shrivels into, at best, a tawdry tax haven in perpetual serfdom to a rich elite, we’ll come to the sad realisation that we’ve been sold a Jerusalem built on false promises and false flags. I wonder if border controls and apocryphal straight bananas will seem quite so important then.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_walking/content_114.html": "I was flabbergasted to see cycle lane markings appearing on some roads in my ward in east Kidlington after asking the county council to repair them since I was elected in 2019.\nRoads such as Yarnton Road, which is a major route from Kidlington, have been in a terrible state of repair for years, with large potholes, cracks and raised areas around access covers. Areas near the kerbside are heavily damaged making for an uncomfortable and dangerous ride for cyclists and other road users. Yet repeated requests to the council and reports on Fix My Street have gone unheeded.\nNow, in the wake of increased cycling as a result of the pandemic, cycle lane symbols have appeared on this road on top of the cracks and potholes, with no attempt to repair the long-standing degradation of the road surface.\nOther roads, such as the Bicester Road, have had painted cycle lanes on the main carriageway for some time, but there are also poorly maintained and often blocked by parked cars meaning cyclists have to face oncoming traffic to navigate them. This is particularly bad given that this road has a local school and is also subject to an air quality management area.\nBut I was gobsmacked when I saw the cycling symbol on Yarnton Road. This is a road that I regularly cycle down and it’s a real bone shaker. It’s no exaggeration to say that you have to hang on for dear life as you bounce along the road near the curbs, dodging potholes and cracks. It’s especially dangerous at night.\nThe road forms part of a national cycling route, but you’d never know it to look at the surface of the carriageway. It’s certainly not for the faint-hearted! I couldn’t believe they just slapped a cycle symbol on the road without any attention to its terrible condition.\nIt takes more than a pot of paint and a stencil to create a cycle path. The road surface has to be fit for riders if they are to be encouraged to use it. Even motorists complain about the state of this road. How does the council expect cyclists to cope as they rattle across these severely damaged and uneven surfaces? This is just pure tokenism!\nIt just goes to show how little the council knows or cares about the plight of cyclists in the county. If they really want to encourage more sustainable transport, especially post COVID, they have to take cyclists needs into proper account when carrying out road maintenance rather than literally just painting over the cracks!\nWe need more Green councillors on the county council to take these sorts of issue seriously and deliver real improvements for cyclists, pedestrians and other road users, rather than these half-hearted token gestures from a council devoid of real leadership and direction.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2018_04_28_should-cherwell-district-council-be-spending-public-money-buying-shopping-centres/content_330.html": "As I said in the recent election debate on the BBC, in my opinion they shouldn’t.\nThere are many reasons it’s a bad idea, both from a business perspective and as part of local spending priorities.\nI’ve worked in retail nearly all my life. I built and ran a national chain of jewellery stores across the country and traded in several shopping centres, including some of the most prestigious in the country such as Bluewater in Kent and the new Bullring Centre in Birmingham. I write a regular column for Retail week Magazine and comment regularly in the national press on retail issues as well as offering consultancy services. One of my main focusses is independent retail and commercial property. So I know a little bit about what I’m talking about.\nCherwell District Council (CDC) leader Barry Wood claims that buying the Castle Quay Shopping Centre in Banbury is a good deal for the people of Cherwell. This decision was also backed by the Labour group on the council and their leader Sean Woodcock has assured me there’s a good business case for doing it. Unfortunately neither of them have been able to show it to me so far.\nTheir belief is that buying a commercial property like a shopping centre is a good idea as property will always rise in value. This may be the case for domestic property and some kinds of commercial premises, but not always with retail space.\nA Good Investment?\nThe argument for buying the scheme seems to be that if they hadn’t, the centre would have shut down. It has many long term empty units and is generally struggling to compete in an ever crowded marketplace. The council’s decision a few years ago to allow a new shopping park to open on the outskirts of Banbury haven’t helped its plight.\nIt’s extremely unlikely though that it would have closed down. Much more likely that it would have been offloaded by its pension investment owners to another investment company with more experience of running a shopping centre than some local councillors.\nMoreover, if the argument is that the centre was about to collapse, that doesn’t exactly make it an attractive investment for public money does it?\nThere have been some shopping centre failures in the past, but they are few and far between. But when they do go, they tend to go completely. That means an almost total loss for anyone unlucky enough to be the owner at the time. There will be some residual value in the land, but that’s unlikely to reflect the full price paid for the whole development.\nThere have been a growing number of retail failures in recent years with 650 collapses so far this year alone, and we’re not even half way through yet! Some of them very high profile and heavily leveraged operations. Others are busy negotiating partial closures and rent reductions with their landlords. Others are moving more into the online arena and abandoning physical retail space almost altogether.\nNone of this bodes well for an under-let, under-invested and down at heel shopping centre in a struggling town in North Oxfordshire.\nSo essentially CDC are gambling with public money against the odds. And it doesn’t end there.\nOther Costs\nAccording to Barry Wood the scheme is turning a profit at the moment, but as I’ve said previously, I’ve not seen evidence of that. I have seen a large number of long term voids in the centre, and with the potential for these to increase in number I fear the profitability may be marginal or likely to decline.\nThere will also be ongoing running costs for the centre and presumably additional investment to do whatever it is with the place that they feel will revitalise it. Again details on that are sketchy, but I think there’s some talk about dividing the larger units into smaller ones to attract independent retailers. Whilst I support that idea to some extent there are a lot of things to consider about that course of action.\nFirstly the cost of doing the work, which may include major re-modelling of the units due to, amongst other things, fire regulations. I’ve seen at least one shopping centre management come unstuck with similar plans due to rules on access to fire exit routes.\nHelping Smaller Retailers?\nSecondly smaller independents usually don’t have a huge budget for shopfitting, so there will be additional cost in partially fitting out the units, including new shopfronts etc to attract smaller operators and to ensure that their stores fit in with a modern shopping centre scheme.\nBusiness Rates\nThirdly there’s the loss of business rates on the empty units that are there now, and will most likely be there for a while. Considering the current climate in retail there’s also a good chance that voids could increase. At the moment the landlords will be paying rates on those premises even though they’re empty and a good deal of that money goes to CDC. With the council now being the landlords, they’re going to be paying the rates to themselves, effectively wiping out that income.\nDevaluation of the Asset\nFinally there’s the issue of valuation. Shopping developments are broadly valued on their rental potential. This is why landlords will leave units empty rather than let them out at a reduced rent. If the council’s plan is to lower the rent for smaller or other retailers, that will have a knock on effect on the value of those units and then on others when rent reviews come around. Other tenants now paying a higher rent will also push for a reduction when their leases come up for renewal or rent reviews are due or maybe even before.\nThe net effect of this would be to push down rents, not only in the centre but across the town, reducing loan to asset values across the board. In broad terms I’d welcome that. I’ve long argued that retail property values are hugely inflated. But in terms of the Council’s investment exposure in Castle Quay it’s a potentially dangerous situation, not only leading to a potential devaluation of the asset, but also any loans secured on it being partially called in.\nThere may be some balancing in terms of appreciation on the total asset value, but in the current climate and in a falling retail market, there a very good chance that the overall value of the scheme will fall relative to the amount the council has sunk into it, both as an initial investment and any further day to day expenditure.\nAll of this appears to have passed Cherwell Councillors and the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives by. They obviously have a very patchy understanding of how retail property works and the implications and pitfalls they are letting us all as council tax payers in for.\nMoreover there’s the question of if so much money should be focussed in the north of the district while ignoring other areas. Mr Wood commented in the Radio debate on Wednesday that he recognised that there were empty units in Pioneer Square in Bicester and that it was difficult to get them filled. Yet this doesn’t seem to have concerned him over the purchase of Castle Quay. Indeed, having set the precedent in Banbury I asked him during the debate if the council intended to buy Pioneer Square as well. He didn’t reply.\nOther Options\nA more sensible and prudent approach to the problems in both areas would be to work with the landlords rather than bailing them out with public money. Leave them with the risk whilst introducing local initiatives that help smaller retailers get a foothold and would also support the centre.\nThese could include rates reductions, which Barry Wood dismissed out of hand when I challenged him on it during the election debate. Neither he nor Sean Woodcock appeared to know that it has been within the gift of local councils to reduce rates on specific properties at their discretion for several years now.\nIf they wanted to provide smaller, more affordable space for independent retailers, they could lease units from the centres on a medium to long term basis, probably negotiating favourable terms with the landlords as a council will have a very good covenant. These could then be divided up (if required) and then sublet on flexible terms on reduced rents to retailers, although this would have to be agreed beforehand with the landlord for the same reasons discussed above concerning rental levels and valuations.\nThis would achieve the same aim of revitalising schemes both in Banbury and Bicester and would not involve the council in risking large amounts of public money. It would also mean that the bulk of the £60m they are now tying up in one area could be spread across the district.\nThis is the kind of strategic thinking we need, rather that the amateurish speculation of a council who seems to want to play at being shopkeepers with our money. This is why we need a more diverse representation on the council and councillors like me who will challenge these misguided moves before millions of pounds of desperately needed council funds are put at risk.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_oufc/content_300.html": "I am still trying to remain open-minded about Oxford United Football Club’s proposals to build an 18000 seater stadium on green belt land that forms part of the Kidlington Gap at Stratfield Brake. But as the County and District Councillor for the area that Stratfield Brake sits within, I think the County Cabinet’s agreement to enter into negotiations with OUFC was premature, given that there were still so many unanswered questions a year on from the initial approaches from the club to the council.\nOf course we all want to help the club find a new home, but if we’re talking about using public assets to do that, we need transparency about what they’ve done to help themselves. For example, we still don’t have evidence that they’ve have explored all legal remedies to stay where they are.\nIt also appeared from the club’s own long-awaited report that they hadn’t even started looking at other alternative sites until October last year, after claiming at the beginning of 2022 that they had already explored all other options.\nAfter waiting 8 months for the full report on the club’s plans, it took a further 2 months for it to be circulated to stakeholders in a heavily edited form which doesn’t suggest that they are willing to be as transparent with local residents and stakeholders as they have claimed in the past.\nKidlington Parish Council (KPC) had been waiting for most of last year for the report from the club showing their detailed plans for the main Stratfield Brake site (which they are leaseholders of) so that they could be put out to local consultation. They could not take a decision on relinquishing their lease until they had consulted with the local residents who they represent.\nThe club has tried to blame the council for delays in making a decision on the initial very broad proposals but that was simply not the case. KPC wanted to make a decision on an informed basis and had been working towards a genuine local consultation, but to facilitate that they needed details of what the club were proposing. Thus any delay in the decision by the council are entirely the fault of the football club. Instead of engaging properly with KPC to help them hold a local consultation, they have gone around them by moving their plans to the site known as the Triangle which KPC has no direct control over.\nAs a result, I made a plea to the cabinet to include an amendment to the proposals to enter into negotiations with the club that would also commit the council to a full local consultation on the proposals before any final decision was made which should include the option to accept or reject the proposals. This wasn’t even responded to.\nAs the local county councillor I was disappointed that my call to the County Cabinet for a full local consultation didn’t seem to be endorsed. That would at least have given local residents some comfort that their views, both for and against the proposals, would be properly taken into account.\nThere was a reference to future engagement with stakeholders but it’s not clear who would undertake this and if it would be at a point where the local community would have a chance to say yes or no to the plans once they know what they are. With so many questions still left unanswered, we need a definite assurance that such a consultation will be part of the final decision process, otherwise we may find ourselves overtaken by circumstances as plans progress and positions become embedded”.\nWhilst I’m pleased to see the council took note of local concerns raised in last year’s country-wide engagement exercise, what is being proposed now is a rather different prospect and doesn’t completely deal with local views about having yet another significant development sited on some of Kidlington’s dwindling green spaces.\nIf we’re going to condone building on the green belt we need to ensure there is quantifiable local support for that. There are a range of views, as we saw at the meeting, and I want to make sure I’m fully representing the balance of local opinion, but until we ask the whole community we don’t know what that is.\nMy position as the local councillor for the area is that I have to support the majority view of the residents that will be affected by this development whatever they are. I don’t understand why there is a resistance from both the club and their fans as well as the council to asking local people directly what they think of this idea. There may be opposition, but there may equally be majority support for the plans. If so we can proceed on that basis knowing that the club would be welcomed by the village. Surely that would be a better outcome for all concerned, especially OUFC’s owners who I assume wouldn’t want to impose themselves on to a community that would resent them being there.\nI will continue to advocate for a full local consultation both internally within the council and with other local representatives, particularly the local MP Layla Moran.",

It has serious environmental and quality of life issues for all of us, but particularly for those of us who live in areas that sit on top of these deposits. Unfortunately for us, that included large areas of North Oxford and Cherwell.\nFracking has been sold as being the answer to the UK’s energy problems, but in areas like the USA where it’s been widely used, this has not been proved to be the case. What has been shown is that it contaminates water supplies and creates huge amounts of noise and disruption for local residents. It’s also been implicated as the cause land movements and in some cases actual earthquakes. Indeed when the first test drill was sunk in the UK near Blackpool, they experienced one of the strongest earth tremors recorded in the area in decades.\nThe main process involves drilling large bore holes, often sideways underneath properties not owned by the drilling companies (as right that has now been granted to them by the government) and pumping a cocktail of water and up to 90 different chemicals, many of them highly toxic, into the ground under immense pressure. This cracks the rock and releases trapped gas. The water is then recycled back into the normal water system where it’s treated and used again. That is apart from the water that leaks into local water courses and along with some of chemicals and the gas.\nIf you want to see how this process affects local people watch the film Gasland and Gasland 2, clips of which are available on YouTube.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZe1AeH0Qz8\nAnother main method is something called underground coal gasification, which involved drilling into coal seams and then setting them alight. The controlled burn then generates coal gas which is extracted. This process is often hard to control and becomes every bit as horrific as it sounds. This is the type of extraction that we could see being used in areas like Bloxham which sits on large coal deposits.\nA national pressure group has also been set up called ‘Frack Off’. They recently released a short video that explains what we may see in our area if fracking is allowed to go ahead.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYniYtJEeeI\ngovernment’s presumption against fracking in designated areas, such as national parks, goes to show that the Coalition recognises that hydraulic fracking will harm the environment and presents significant risks.\nThe Green Party calls on the government to offer all communities the same protection from dirty and dangerous fracking and shift energy policy focus instead towards clean, renewable energy sources and energy conservation.\nThe latest bidding process for licenses to extract shale gas from large parts of the UK is under way. The government is also proposing to pay large amounts of money to local councils that support fracking, regardless of local residents wishes.\nAbout half the UK is open to exploration, but tightened rules cover areas of outstanding beauty and large areas of Cherwell. The Green Party is the only mainstream political party fighting to stop fracking being pushed through by a government which consistently puts corporate profit over people.\nCaroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, said:\n“While the Government has signalled an intention to ensure some protective measures, we can have little confidence in promises of a robust regulatory framework.\n“We know fracking can cause water contamination and shortages, as well as air and soil pollution. And this is an industry that’s made a catalogue of errors already. But legitimate concerns over its very real environmental and health risks are falling on deaf ears.\n“By seeking to lock us ever-more firmly into fossil fuel dependence the Government is turning a blind eye to reason. It’s crystal clear that we need to be shifting to clean, renewable energy sources.\n“We need a rapid shift to a zero carbon economy and that is not going to happen by pouring resources into establishing an entirely new fossil fuel industry.”\nAs your MP I would fight tooth and nail to prevent our wonderful communities and countryside from being torn apart by this ‘bottom of the barrel’ technology. The Green Party is the only major party standing up against these proposals and we need support of local communities to help us stop these wells from being set up before it’s too late. Once the process is begun we may all live to regret the fact that we didn’t stand up to be counted when we had the chance.",

Holding the council to account on local services, defending our green spaces and making sure Kidlington gets a fair hearing at council meetings.\nI will also be focussing on climate change, as you’d expect from a Green councillor.\nMy thanks go to everyone who voted for me and believed in me, as well as my dedicated team of helpers and supporters, many of whom went the extra mile for me in the final days, working tirelessly in the run up to what was a very close election.\nIt’s been a very hard 10 weeks of campaigning and I’m only just coming to terms with actually winning after 7 years of being a runner-up.\nEverything we did during the campaign counted towards that result. Just missing out one step or one person not being there could have cost us the win.\nMy thanks also go out to my partners on the Libdem side without whom none of this would have been possible. Special thanks to Neil Fawcett, Alaric Rose, Doug Williamson, Conor McKenzie, Katherine T. Tyson, and of course my superb MP Layla Moran. Congratulations also go to Conrad and Katherine who both also won their seats in Kidlington West and on Kidlington Parish Council.

I hope I can justify your faith in me.\nI’ll be sending out personal thanks to everyone in the coming days, but for now I hope you’ll enjoy basking in the glow of what has been a great few days for the Greens and will hopefully go on to be a sign of things to come!",

Moreover a spectacular win for my electoral partner, Libdem candidate Alaric Rose in Kidlington West who nearly doubled the Libdem vote and completely wiped the floor with the Conservatives!\nIt would have been great to have won my seat as well, but with such a short campaign it was hard to get the message out to enough people. Ultimately it was a total validation for both of us of our decision to work together for the common good.\nSlightly galling that the Carmen Griffiths kept her seat as I understand she was hardly seen on the campaign trail. She wasn’t at the count, didn’t make an appearance on polling day (to my knowledge) and instead sat back and let local Tory cult figures like Maurice Billington do all the campaigning for her.\nJudging by her attendance record at council meetings this seems to be a pattern of behaviour for a pretty lacklustre councillor. I think many of the voters in the ward didn’t actually know which blue candidate they were voting for and seemed oblivious to the fact that there were more dedicated candidates on offer who would much more effectively represent them in Cherwell.\nPerhaps when Carmen and her remaining Tory colleagues fail to turn up at other key planning meetings and the green belt is concreted over, bringing with it traffic chaos, pollution, and the collapse of local infrastructure, all those that trooped into the polling station to dutifully put a cross in the Tory box, regardless of the candidate, will realise their mistake. It might be a bit late then though.\nOne other stark reality from the results is that if Labour had endorsed me (as we suggested) and we had endorsed them in one of the North Oxfordshire wards (as we offered) we would both have easily won our seats, meaning a new Labour, Green and Libdem seat on the council and 3 Tory losses instead of 1. Just imagine what sort of message that would have sent out! Especially on important and urgent local issues like the building on green belt in the area.\nLabour really need to wake up to the reality of fractured left politics in this country and work with other parties like the Greens and the Libdems. We need to stop living in the past and embrace the future. There’s more that unites us than divides us and if we’re going to stop yet another Conservative government in 2022 we must start building alliances. If anyone from Labour wants to talk, I’m all ears.\nIn the meantime I intend to go on being a thorn in the side of Cherwell’s complacent Tory leadership and will be working closely with Alaric as part of our pre-election co-operative agreement. I may not be able to vote on council matters, but I can certainly speak up in the council chamber and outside in the media. I’ll be fighting hard on local green belt and conservation issues and keeping a wary eye on the attendance record of my Tory opponent. The Greens will be fighting the elections in the ward once again next year and I hope that will again be in partnership with the Liberal Democrats.\nFinally a big thank you to everyone who voted for me and to the dedicated people who helped us pull together such a professional campaign in such a short time. the Greens made historic gains across the country yesterday and I think it’s a credit to all our members that we can do this stuff on such a small budgets and with small teams.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_oxford/content_410.html": "After what seems like centuries of wrangling, planning applications, withdrawn projects, hand shaking and head banging, Oxford is finally set to join other cities with a giant shiny shopping centre nobody really needs any more.\nHaving experienced the damage that these behemoths can do to small local retailers, myself included, this is a moment I and many others have dreaded.\nThe council of course has applied a heavy spin on the whole project, whilst ushering the developers and large multi-nationals into the city with wide-eyed certainty that a new shopping centre will solve all the problems we now have.\nWe know at least one of those problems – that of affordable housing in the city centre – won’t even be dented by this grandiose project. In a move that is frankly baffling from a socialist led council, planners have dashed all hopes that the accommodation element designed into the revamped centre would be for social housing or affordable homes. Whilst Green councillors opposed this move, others apparently felt that poorer people won’t be able to keep the new apartments up to the standards they expect to be demanded.\nSo no comfortable inner-city pied-à-terres for the ordinary folk of Oxford then. Which is a shame considering Oxford City Council provided virtually nothing for that sector last year, despite claims that this was a priority policy.\nJobs are not the only thing to consider\nJudging by the analyses carried out over the past 10 years it looks highly likely that the new Westgate extension in Oxford will have a significant impact on other retail destinations both in the immediate vicinity and county wide.\nThe council has claimed that 3400 jobs will be created by the opening of the new centre, which seems like a rather optimistic number to me. Even if one accepts that figure, previous analyses have suggested that the number of jobs created will be far outweighed by those that will be destroyed elsewhere in the city and the surrounding areas.\nIt’s very easy to focus just on the number of jobs created, but when similar centres have opened there have been many casualties in other areas. This doesn’t even take into account the damage that’s likely to be done to trade during the building and infrastructure works and the impact of additional competition for small retailers that attracting large multi-nationals into the area will provide.\nIn an era where many retail chains are looking to reduce their portfolios, the time for this centre has been and gone. There’s already plenty of retail space in Oxford city centre, some of it lying vacant even now. Until the council addresses the systemic issues with people visiting the city, such as parking, local transport and city centre management, a revamped shopping centre isn’t going to add that much prosperity to a town encircled by much better alternatives.\nThe new shopping centre will likely have some novelty value for a few months, but once the realities of trading in Oxford begin to bite, I doubt it’ll be anything more than another usual-suspect clone-town brand zoo.\nYears of disruption\nAccording to a recent article in the Oxford Mail, a scrutinising committee of city centre councillors are due to meet to discuss ways of keeping businesses alive during the hugely disruptive infrastructure works needed for the new extension.\nSo Oxford City Council wait until AFTER the works have begun to think about how to mitigate the problems that will inevitably be caused by the works?\nAnother great example of the forethought and careful planning we’ve come to expect from our wonderful city council!\nI was at a meeting with both the city and county council leaders over a year ago where I highlighted the potential damage that will be done by the infrastructure works required for the Westgate extension. Having already experienced the same in Bristol a few years before, it was clear to me and many others that the likely upheaval required for the Westgate works were going to do more damage than they were likely to be worth in the current climate.\nSeems like it all fell on deaf ears. As usual.\nEmpty shops\nMy business in Cornmarket Street closed it’s doors for the last time after 20 years last year. Despite numerous pronouncements in the press that the city council was eager to support local businesses, we got zip-all support, even after asking on several occasions. Indeed, at one point their planning department were very close to scuppering the only deal we could achieve to sell the store. Had they not done a last minute U-turn there would have been one more empty and un-lettable shop in the city centre.\nCouncillors are also now apparently worried about the growing number of empty shops in the city, despite previous claims that there were queues of businesses eager to take space. Perhaps news has started to filter out that retailing in Oxford is not what it once was?\nIn that context one has to wonder who is going to populate the new cathedral of consumption when it is finally completed, and for those that do take up residence, what kind of trading environment will they find? With 40% of retail leases across the country coming up for renewal at the end of this year, it really does beg the question about how much space will be required when the Westgate centre is completed in 2017. Moreover what will the rest of the city look like once all the remaining viable stores have de-camped into the waiting warmth of a lovely new mall?\nWith council plans to push up the cost of parking YET AGAIN and the negative impact of roadworks, and the city centre looking like a building site, it’s likely most consumers will continue to go elsewhere to shop, surrounded as we are by much more attractive and easily reached locations around the city and the county. And once again, experience tells me that once people find better alternatives, they’re unlikely to return, other than for a quick nose around the new development.\nA committee composed of councillors with absolutely no idea how businesses in Oxford operate, setting out to ‘examine’ how to deal with these issues now, is tantamount to closing the door after the horse has bolted, lived out it’s natural life and ended up in a dog food tin. This project as has been in the planning stages for so many years it’s truly staggering that the implications are only being discussed now.\nOxford is of course known as the city of ‘dreaming spires’. It seems that in terms of strategic planning, many of our councillors have also been asleep on the job.",

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_high-street/content_267.html": "I’ve been involved in retail for as long as I can remember. From my first proper job as a Saturday boy in a menswear store in Lewisham through my days as a market trader in Camden Lock and Greenwich to being co-founder of a national high street chain that started with a small store in Oxford selling silver jewellery. and grew into a national chain trading in 6 of country’s major retail locations, including London’s prestigious Covent Garden.\nIn that time I saw almost as many ups as I did downs. I’ve half jokingly said that I spent 20 years building the business and then another 10 trying extricating it from the failing high street. Like so many other retailers who entered the high street during the boom years in the early 1990s, I fell foul of the simultaneous boom in commercial property development. So many new malls were opened in the 90s and early 2000s it was difficult to keep up and I opened stores in some of the most iconic examples such as the New Bullring in Birmingham and Bluewater in Kent.\nThe other boom at the time was in business rates, which along with rents skyrocketed through that period as institutional landlords, mostly backed by large pension funds, cashed in on the retail bubble ploughing millions into new shiny malls based on the emerging US model. It was great while it lasted and we all became caught up in the heady days of seemingly limitless opportunities. But we soon discovered there were limits.\nThe Financial crash in 2008 gave us all a pretty sharp reality check and things soon started to become far less buoyant and rents that had been agreed on the back of rude profit margins started to look far less tenable as turnovers started to fall.\nThere soon followed a series of frantic rounds of renegotiation with landlords who themselves were facing the prospect of huge hole in their new developments as retailers started to fall over with alarming regularity. In many cases we were able to come to mutual agreements to keep us trading at the shopping malls looking full, but the one thing that couldn’t be re-negotiated were business rates. Set as they were, by the central valuation office, and administered by local authorities, they were completely devoid of any chance of concession unless you had an understanding council. In my experience their understanding was rather limited, and after 5 years as a local councillor myself I now understand more about why that was.\nSo we were all caught in a perfect storm that only a few managed to emerge from. My business was one of the luckier ones as I managed to negotiate deals that gave us breathing space. But I could see the writing on the wall and it was telling me to get out of the high street and decamp to the internet where so many of our competitors were lurking. Thereby hangs another very long story.\nBut suffice to say I have an intimate understanding of the plight of the high street, in fact much more intimate than I would prefer. For that reason one of my personal priorities as a fresh faced new MP would be to push for a new system of business rates or local high street taxation. Other things like rent controls and use classes would also be high on the agenda, but none of this will be an easy fix for an industry in the doldrums after so many years in decline. But I know from my own experience that smaller independents are both the lifeblood of local high streets whilst also being the most vulnerable.\nIn terms of the dreaded business rates, I think I could take elements from the land tax approach of the Green party and add in some aspect of a local purchase tax as seen in the USA. Such a tax would be far more progressive and have more respect for the ability of businesses to pay such an additional tax. That would give a far greater connection between the local community, local authorities and the retailers themselves. If all retailers did well then they would all reap the benefits.\nSpeaking to local councillors and retailers about business rates reform\nI don’t really have the answer to full business rates reform, but I’ve been campaigning for a better system for over 10 years. I would advocate a situation where we involved existing high street retailers in the process of finding a solution. There have been past attempts at doing this, but very few, if any, involved small independent retailers. I think that was a mistake.\nThe Labour Party have boldly announced that they would scrap the current business rates system, but they haven’t said what they would replace it with. I’ve been here before many times, and both Labour and the Tories have frequently promised reform but never delivered on that. One of the biggest reason is that business rates are a virtually guaranteed income for government bringing in over £13bn a year. Even if the premises are empty, the landlord cops for the bill so it’s a win-win for Westminster. So any new system is likely to be just as iniquitous and damaging, especially to smaller operators.\nI think there is a way of developing a system of local high street taxation that could benefit all sides of the equation, including the consumer. Just scrapping the business rates system with no plan for what would replace it is not a solution, yet its the current proposal from the part that is most likely to form the next government in a few weeks. If I was in Westminster I’d hope to be able to provide a far better insight into the problems on the high street and how to engage with the people who face those problems every day.\nI’d like to see genuine consultation with high street stakeholders, including landlords and local councils, about the best way forwards. As a long term retailer, having moved from being a small business, through a larger expansion and back to being a ‘born again independent’, I’d like to be involved in that process. But I guess it remains to be seen what the outcome is on July 4th.\nI’ve just published a video I made during a recent visit to Bicester with some thoughts on how we can work towards a better system of high street business taxation and help to repair our broken high streets and you can watch that by clicking here.\nIf you’re a retailer or just someone who enjoys browsing physical shops, I’d suggest you vote for someone like me who has the experience to make that a viable possibility again. Retail is at the heart of every village, town and city and needs political support to make it vibrant again. Many politicians claim to have the answer but few of them have been on the inside of the industry. I think that needs to change. I’d like to change it.",

But it didn’t seem to be that much of an emergency in 2019 when they were in control of the County Council. Back then they were even worse and had been getting that way for decades.\nThe truth is that no council, regardless of political control, ever receives enough funding to fix the roads properly. The reason is that it would cost BILLIONS to do it really well and no government has ever committed to that. Our roads have been allowed to get worse year on year because no government wants to commit to the costs of fixing them properly. Why would they when local councils can take the brunt of the criticisms for them?\nNo council wants to see potholes. They are a very visible problem that nearly everyone experiences and every councillor and council officer would like to see gone. Of course we’d all like to have the unlimited funding that would be required to fix them, but it’s just not there at the moment. That, coupled with fact that we’re all driving much heavier vehicles than the roads were designed for (plus the increase in HGV traffic) means our roads take a hammering 24 hours a day. Add in the weather extremes we see now and it’s little wonder they break up.\nBut it’s not a recent problem. The Tories may say they will fix it, but they didn’t seem to be able to do so in 2019 when Oxfordshire was ranked 5th worse in the country for the number of potholes as can be seen from the attached article in my post from 2023.\nSo let’s get serious about this issue and stop using it as the proverbial political football every time an election rolls around. Potholes are always going to be with us until central government takes proper responsibility for maintaining our road network, rather than insisting on us building even more roads that we won’t be given the money to maintain. The more roads we build, the bigger and more costly the problem will get. Until governments make that connection, there’s not going to be a long-term solution.\nWe all also need to take personal responsibility for the way our roads are treated. High torque acceleration from traffic lights, on corners or near traffic calming areas such as speed humps will simply tear the road surface up. Our roads are not indestructible, certainly not when we’re all driving heavier cars with 4 wheel drive or more and more of us are buying things online that need to be delivered by heavier vans and trucks. Climate change also plays a part as heavier rainfall and sudden cold snaps play havoc with road surfaces.\nYes our roads need to be properly attended to, but until there’s a national political consensus on that, along with an ongoing commitment to proper funding from national governments, potholes will always be with us to a lesser or greater degree, and any political party that tells you different is just avoiding the holes in their own arguments.\nI’ve done my best to get potholes fixed in my division over the past 4 years but it is like playing a game of of whack-a-mole. You get one fixed and another 2 pop up somewhere else. Whilst I agree there needs to be better quality control on the standard of repairs, simply filling the holes will never solve the problem as any hole is always going to be a point of weakness in the future. In reality there are many roads in the county that need to be completely re-laid, but if the money is spent on that, it’s not there to fix areas elsewhere.\nIt’s a juggling act that will be made better over the next 2 years as OCC have committed nearly £39m to a 2 year road improvement programme. That will help matters (and they have been getting better over the past 4 years despite what the Tories might say in their leaflets), But that sort of funding is still small beer compared to what we need to spend, and that need is getting bigger every year.\nWhat I think is really needed is a pothole summit where councils, residents, motoring organisations, haulage and delivery companies, civil engineers and of course, national government can come together to work on a solution. All the time we simply blame each other every time there’s an election, there’s never going to be the long term solution that we desperately need.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_politics_page_5/content_401.html": "So ends my third and final candidacy for the Banbury constituency.\nIn a way I’ve come full circle in that my result this time was almost identical to my first one in 2015. I was only 79 votes short of that figure this time with a final result of 2607 votes, giving me 4.1% of the vote share.\nIn 2015, I received 4.6% with only a slightly higher number of votes, but the turnout was lower then. Sadly this left me about 500 votes short of keeping my deposit this time, which means the Green Party loses £500, but we did our best.\nOn a personal level I’m fairly happy with that result. It was more than double the last time I stood and represented a 2.2% increase in my vote share. That’s the best increase of all the Green Party candidates in Oxfordshire, so that’s nice to have. You have to look for the positives in these things!\nUnfortunately though, positives on a national level are thin on the ground. With a massive swing to the Tories representing such a shift in our national political landscape, I’m far more concerned about that than I am about my own result. This is something I’m still processing at the moment as I’m sure many others are. I have to say I’ve avoided news coverage of the election today as it is just too painful! Maybe sleep deprivation has played a big part in that as well!\nWhere we go from here is difficult to say. I think it’s fairly certain that Brexit will now happen, which I think we will mostly live to regret. The debate around the referendum has become so polarised now that I’m not sure anyone really knows how we got here. It’s become an argument about ‘honouring’ a vote that many people no longer really know the point of. From most of the coverage I’ve seen it’s become about who ‘won’ and who ‘lost’. It should never have been boiled down to such a simplistic argument. Especially as I think most of us will eventually be the losers from Brexit.\nThe “Get Brexit done” slogan is also an absurd reduction of the true impact of one of the most seismic shifts in our fortunes since the second world war. I still don’t think it’s something we should be treating so lightly. With so much new information available to us now compared to 2016, we should have had an opportunity to think again. Just ‘getting it over with’ really isn’t a logical motivation for carrying on with something that I think will be hugely damaging to this country and our economy. Especially as the poor and the disadvantaged will end up feeling the most pain, which makes it doubly frustrating when so many news reports seem to suggest it’s those very people who voted Tory in this election.\nThose of us on the remain side obviously haven’t made a strong enough case to those who seem so eager to jump into the abyss. Boris Johnson’s lies will, I believe, show themselves to be exactly that when we finally push the button on Brexit. Sadly it will be too late then to say I told you so to all those who think this will be a positive move.\nThe climate debate was for me equally as important as Brexit and bound up in the same argument. This also applies to the other burning issues in the UK at the moment, including the NHS and public services. I believe we will spend the next 10 years wasting parliamentary time dealing with the intricacies of extricating ourselves from the EU and negotiating disadvantageous deals with countries like the USA, when we should be dealing with the existential threat of climate change and the collapse of our health services.\nThe other issue exposed by the result is the desperate need for electoral reform. Westminster has still been carved up by the two main parties who need so few votes to get a seat in the big house. Whereas parties like the Greens with over 800,000 votes nationally only get on MP. That really doesn’t make sense and certainly explains why so many people think that voting is a pointless exercise. Moreover we need to have greater co-operation between parties to achieve electoral reform. I hope that the one positive that might come out of Labour’s terrible results might be that they will finally be open to talking to other parties about co-operating towards that end.\nBut I will do what I can to help deal with the worst damage that Brexit and climate change will inevitably do to our society both locally and globally, even though I fear that, with at least another 5 years of majority Conservative government ahead of us, that’s going to be a very difficult task.\nIt’s not one that I will shirk from though, and I will use my position as a local councillor to bring as much influence as I can to bear on what will no doubt be many more Tory excesses and attacks on the weakest in our society. With a Tory dominated District council in Cherwell it’s always an uphill struggle to ‘move the dial’ but that’s not a reason to give up and I won’t be doing that.\nFinally, an enormous thank you everyone who helped in my campaign and to everyone who contacted my directly, and through social media, to give me encouragement and support, and of course thank you for giving me your precious vote. I can assure you that I value it enormously and it was not wasted.\nFor reasons I’ve explained in another post, no vote you believe in is ever wasted, and in terms of the Green Party it will help us carry on campaigning and, most importantly now, hold the national and local government to account on the environment and climate change.\nThe fight continues!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_evenlode/content_297.html": "I’ve just spent a couple of days in the gorgeous village of Stonesfield researching the state of the river Evenlode which was recently given the unenviable title of the most polluted river in England.\nAnd it’s hardly surprising given that in the past few years the amount of sewage being pumped in to the river has risen from 8000 hours per year to 12000 hours. The river itself is not insubstantial, being deep enough in some areas to swim in, although these days you’d be brave to risk it given the level of E coli and other nasties lurking in its once crystal clear depths.\nI spoke to brilliant local councillor Genny Early about the history of the river that she’s lived near for the past 30 years and the tale was not a happy one. Where once you could look out from the local footbridge at fish swimming amongst the river weeds and watch local dogs play happily in the waters, we now have a soupy grey clag, virtually devoid of life and reputedly toxic to everyone including our canine companions.\nThe cause is toxic dumping from up to 9 different local sewage works, given effective carte blanche by the Conservative government to use this river, and others in the area, as an open sewer to enable companies like Thames Water to pay out record dividends to investors whilst doing next to nothing to fix inadequate infrastructure.\nThis is the starkest example of how privatisation has failed us all with greedy and cynical corporations grabbing every opportunity to make obscene amounts of money by (in this case) quite literally shitting on local communities.\nI made a video with Genny showing just how bad things have got in this area, in sickening contrast to the beautiful local landscape. You can watch it by clicking here.\nWe simply can’t allow this situation to continue and only the Greens have the real solution to take privatised utilities back into public control where they belong. Water is quite literally an essential for life on this planet. If we’ve reached the point where that is simply a commodity to be bartered between corporations on the open market we really have reached the bottom of a very murky barrel.\nGreens would take water and other essential public utilities and services back into public control as the only way to deal with this obscene failure of duty to keep our waterways and rivers clean and accessible for wildlife and recreation. Other parties are suggesting half way houses of fines and extra taxation. None of that will work in an industry that simply doesn’t care any more.\nWe need radical solutions to these unprecedented outcomes and only the Green Party has a vision bold enough to deliver those.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_local-elections-2023/content_344.html": "In 2019 I became the first ever Green District Councillor in Cherwell. Apart from that being a little bit of personal history for me, it was also the start of a change that would unfold across the county over the next 3 years with Greens playing their part in the removal of Conservative control in every major local authority in Oxfordshire.\nIn 2019, Green colleagues in South Oxfordshire, along with the Lib Dems virtually swept the board, taking control of the District Council from a huge Conservative majority with 5 Greens being elected. Another Green was elected on the Vale of the White Horse Council. Then in 2021 Greens, Lib Dems and Labour took control of the County Council in a three way alliance with the Lib Dems and Greens forming a separate group which I now have the honour of being deputy leader of. Finally in 2022 we took joint control of West Oxfordshire District Council with the Lib Dems and Labour as well as gaining a further seat on CDC.\nThat left CDC as the only remaining Conservative controlled council albeit with a drastically reduced majority of only 2. The group that I and 2 Lib Dems formed in 2019 grew to 12 members by the end of the last municipal year meaning that from 2022 we became the official opposition with me as deputy leader of that group.\nThat’s a huge turnaround in only a few short years which feels even shorter given that for one of those years the elections were cancelled.\nNow with Cherwell as the last remaining bastion of Conservatism in the county, the prize is for the taking. As long as all the currently sitting opposition councillors hang on to their seats (which includes me) in the forthcoming elections, we have a good chance of taking control of CDC. We really need 4 extra seats to be flipped from the Conservatives and the way the country feels about them at the moment that is a very real possibility.\nGreens hope to take one more seat in Bicester where we’ve come a close second 2 years in a row, with the Lib Dems hopefully gaining 2 more. In Banbury there’s a chance that Labour will also gain an extra seat which would then give a 4 way Green/Lib Dem/Labour/Independent alliance a majority. Even if we only gain 2-3 seats the council will fall into no overall control which gives us much more leverage to ensure that areas like Kidlington get a better slice of the district pie.\nFor far too long Kidlington has been the poor relation in Cherwell with the majority of funding and investment going to Banbury – where the council has so far sunk £130M into a failing shopping centre – and Bicester – where they plan to spend £4.25M on upgrading a car park in an events space that no one really seems to want.\nThis year we have an opportunity to see real change and real progress in areas like Kidlington as well as the rest of the district. I hope voters will take that opportunity and we can finally have a clean sweep across the county leaving progressive, forward thinking authorities looking out for the best interests of current residents and those yet to come.\nThis year, more than ever in Cherwell, every vote will count. I won in 2019 with only 72 votes to spare, although last year Fiona Mawson won with a far more convincing majority of over 250. I hope I can emulate here but we can’t afford to be complacent. Everyone needs to use their vote to support the candidate most likely to win against the Toru candidate. In Kidlington East that’s me and I hope I can count on local support.\nLet’s not lose this chance to break the Tory stranglehold and make a better future for everyone. Make sure your vote really counts on May 4th!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_begbroke/content_153.html": "I’ve spoken to hundreds of people during this short election campaign and probably the most important issue on most people’s minds right now is the threat to our local green belt.\nI made a video about it last week which has received quite a bit of attention since it was released. You can watch it here.\nOf course in Yarnton, Begbroke and Gosford (where I’m standing to become the new local County Councillor) it’s in the forefront of everyone’s minds because, if it goes ahead, we’ll be the ones living in the middle of a building site for possibly the next 10 years. We’ll also see our small rural communities destroyed and replaced with a single medium sized town, one that will probably also double up as a university campus for the Begbroke Science Park.\nBut even in Kidlington, (which comprises a large part of the County division) it’s going to have a huge impact. There may not be as many houses built in the area, but the additional strain on our local resources, such as health services, education and leisure facilities will be very detrimental. We’ll also see a noticeable reduction in air quality which is likely to have health impacts on the most vulnerable, as well as increased risks of flooding. The A44 will probably become a car park during busy times, giving us all the chance to sit and admire the 4 storey apartment blocks that will tower over the edge of the dual carriageway.\nThere’s also a good chance that Kidlington will finally lose the argument about hanging on to it’s status as a village. In 10 years time, when the population has possibly tripled, there’s likely to be a much greater push to establish the whole area as a suburb of a Greater Oxford City. Not a prospect I, or anyone else in the area, relishes but something we may have little choice over.\nI for one won’t stop fighting for that until the last blade of grass has fallen under the bulldozer’s tracks.\nAll this might be acceptable to a greater degree if these houses were going to provide affordable accommodation for local families, many of whom are crammed into a single house with perhaps 3 generations under one roof. But these aren’t for the likes of them. These will be expensive luxury executive houses built for investment purposes, with the so-called ‘affordable’ houses reserved for people in Oxford City. The District Council saw to that when they handed control of those houses over to the City Council in a closed meeting at the beginning of the first lockdown. None of these houses will be within reach of local residents.\nA lot of people have told me that all this is inevitable and that the 4400 houses are a ‘done deal’. Well that isn’t the case until we know the outcome of the legal challenge being brought to the high court next month. Until that’s over we have no idea if these proposals will stand up or collapse. There have been reports in other areas recently where challenges have been upheld, and if we get the same result Cherwell District Council will have to think again. In those circumstances we’ll need as much support on the District Council as possible which is why I’m supporting Fiona Mawson to become our second Green Party Councillor on CDC.\nBut even if we fail to stop these devastating plans though the courts, we can at least do our best to limit some of that devastation by having engaged and active councillors at all levels of local government. On the County Council fighting for infrastructure and other important considerations like flood protection, and of course at District and Parish level scrutinising the individual planning proposals themselves. We also have to be vigilant in opposing ‘infilling’ which may become more of an issue as the amount of development space in the area is snapped up by the bigger developers.\nSo I hope I and Fiona can count on the support of our local residents in the elections on Thursday. We’ve seen how our current crop of Conservative councillors have let us down on these issues, and let’s not forget that this whole idea was the brainchild of the Conservatives on Cherwell District Council in the first place, in cahoots with Oxford University, the City Council, the Oxfordshire Growth Board and the Local Enterprise Partnership. After Thursday we may have more leverage to defend our small rural communities against these faceless, unelected and anti-democratic quangos and take back control of our green heritage.\nI for one won’t stop fighting for that until the last blade of grass has fallen under the bulldozer’s tracks. I hope you’ll all support me as your Green Councillor in that long battle.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_banbury_page_4/content_420.html": "Who’d have thought that a small but effective local community initiative in an Oxfordshire town would attract such global attention? The Banbury Phone Box Library is one such brilliant piece of local engagement which is now garnering international attention as BT looks towards chopping it off at the knees.\nThe red phone box is almost as iconic as the red bus as a national symbol of Britain around the world. You’d think if you were company who owns and operates these highly visible pieces of cultural capital you’d be only too pleased to see them being involved in well supported local campaigns that add value to a service that is perhaps not as loved as it once was.\nIn that context it seems daft to me that BT are hell bent on annoying small and large communities across the country by removing public call boxes where they’re valued for numerous reasons other than a quick natter on the phone. It’s even more self-defeating that they’re erasing some of the very symbols of Britishness that have helped them build a world class multi-national company.\nIt has to be said that the Town Council in Banbury share some of the potential blame if the box is removed, as they are refusing to adopt it (something that BT now allow for the princely sum of £1), if BT go ahead with plans to decommission the phone service in the box. Previously they struck a deal with BT to adopt the box and save the library and a local steel fabrication firm offered to fix permanent shelves in the box to house the books to assuage BT’s prior objections to the library service on health and safety grounds, as they believed the current shelving arrangements could be dangerous.\nBT now claims that it is uneconomic for them to continue to run the service anyway, even though I understand thousands of calls were made from it last year.\nThe under-story seems to be that BT want out of the call box game at any cost, and most of that cost will be borne by local communities using the boxes for a number of vital social services or simply to make a call when other options are not available to them.\nBanbury Town Council now say that they’re not prepared to adopt the box if it is then decommissioned by BT. Whilst I support taking a stance against the loss of the phone service, I think it would be a sad loss to the community of the box were to be removed as a result of the Town Council refusing to adopt the box itself.\nMoreover, If BT are claiming the box is loss making, I think it would be useful for them to provide the figures backing that up. It would at least give us an idea of the likely shortfall which could perhaps be covered in some other way.\nIt’s also crazy that BT are missing this as an opportunity for some very positive PR. It has to be said that they’re not universally loved as a company, so something like this, that is fairly minimal in cost terms, would seem to be a great way for them to connect with the community.\nGoing forward perhaps the government needs to bring in a legal requirement on telecoms companies like this to provide a certain number of public call points in an area. Just because most of us carry mobiles now, doesn’t mean that sometimes they might not fail at a vital time, or have been forgotten when they’re most needed. I know BT used to be obliged to seek permission from local or parish councils in order to remove a box, but it sounds like that requirement has now been watered down. In very rural areas mobile phone reception is also notoriously patchy. In those areas call boxes provide a vital service for emergency calls.\nIn terms of usage statistics, it might also be interesting to track the number of calls made against the minimum price of a call in a phone box, which I understand is now 60p. Perhaps BT need to be reminded of the law of supply and demand.\nIf you’re on Twitter you can follow and support the campaign to save the Banbury Phone Box Library by following the hashtag #SaveOurPhoneboxLibrary",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_nandos/content_288.html": "Many people will have heard the absurd comments from Cherwell’s lead councillor for Financial Management and Governance, Tony Ilott, on BBC Oxford breakfast radio on Tuesday. I thought it was worth covering a few of the comments made by the Conservative representative in more detail.\nThe programme featured a running topic on the amount of back rent owed to several councils in Oxfordshire and you can hear it here. This is not a problem unique to this county as so many councils now rely on commercial investment to make ends meet since central government no longer provide enough funding for even the basic services that we all rely on.\nThis problem is exacerbated by the fact that legislation requires local authorities to balance their budgets every year and prevents them from borrowing to cover any shortfalls. This leaves them in the position of trying to operate like private investors without having the same financial flexibility.\nWith many local authorities now heavily invested in commercial property they have all faced a huge shortfall in income from rents that have not been paid throughout the pandemic. To add insult to this injury, even though the Chancellor said he would provide “whatever it takes” to help local government, central government has excluded losses from commercial investments from it’s support payments to councils.\nThe need to balance the books each year results in councils being left with only 2 options when they have a shortfall in rents. Either they increase council tax (which can only be done up to certain limits without a costly referendum) or they cut services.\nthat’s going to be a pretty expensive chicken dinner for the residents of Cherwell!\nThis is what Cherwell District Council did in 2021 when they reported losses in the region of £1.6m against the Castle Quay shopping centre in Banbury. With similar losses predicted for the next financial year, this is likely to put the same pressures on the budget for the following year which will inevitably mean yet more cuts, along with additional charges like we’ve seen this year for things like garden waste collections.\nCommercial landlords would usually carry these sorts of shortfalls over a period of years, often borrowing to cover the gaps, and recover as much of the rent as they could over that time with deferral agreements with tenants. Ultimately some of the losses may have to be written off. But as explained above, councils can’t do this. So as long as these shortfalls are on the books, more cuts or tax increases are the only way to deal with the problem each year.\nIt was clear though from the interview Cllr Ilott really didn’t understand any of the mechanics of this, which is quite staggering considering his role on the council. When he was asked if he thought there should be a change in legislation that would allow councils to deal with these problems, he said he didn’t think so. Instead he chose to make childish personal comments about me and avoided answering the interviewer’s questions about how the council will recover these losses.\nit’s clear that they have no real vision for how to revitalise the development other than the idea that making it bigger will somehow make it better.\nHe did make mention of ‘working with tenants’ which of course is a good plan. As a retail consultant myself I’d always advocate such a move, but due to the limitations imposed on councils, this can only be done on a year by year basis. Any outstanding debts at the end of each year will need to be accounted for and action taken on increased taxation or services cuts.\nCllr Illot suggested that we look at things “in the round” and I agree we should do that. Unfortunately, time restraints on the programme prevented me from laying out the full details, but I’m happy to do so here :\n- Losses in the last financial year attributable to Castle Quay – £1.6m\n- Losses predicted in the next financial year due to Castle Quay – approx £1.6m\n- Rent owed to Cherwell District Council at this point – nearly £2m\n- Loss in value of Castle Quay shopping centre since the council took full ownership – over £30m (it’s now worth less than half what they paid for it 4 years ago)\n- Additional investment being ploughed into expanding the centre – £73m (underwritten by council tax payers)\n- Interest on the loans to finance all this (so far) – £2m+ per year\n- Cuts required to the entire council budget this year – £4.4m\nYes some of this can be blamed on the pandemic, but retail was already on the decline when the council took the frankly bizarre decision to buy the scheme, especially as it’s clear that they have no real vision for how to revitalise the development other than the idea that making it bigger will somehow make it better. That and Cllr Ilott’s head in the sand optimism seems to be the main strategy from our Conservative councillors.\nI don’t see that as good value for the council tax payers of Cherwell. Judging by Cllr Illott’s flippancy and lack of concern he seems to regard massive financial losses along with the associated financial impact on resident’s pockets as fine as long as he can get some chicken.\nI’d say that taking all that into account that’s going to be a pretty expensive chicken dinner for the residents of Cherwell!\nAnd let’s not forget that all this money is going into one town in Cherwell – Banbury. Meanwhile Bicester town centre’s retail area is being hollowed out due to the council’s planning decisions elsewhere, and the whole of the district – every single tax payer – is footing the bill for all this incompetence. As is often the case with Cherwell Council , the south of the district is left to fend for itself and pick up the tab. If I were a cynical soul I might suggest that this is because the majority of support for the councillors who agreed to this whole adventure comes from the north of the district.\nBut I think we should all be able to rely on decent fiscal management from our local councillors, no matter where we live. Sadly it seems clear to me that we can’t expect this as long as the Conservatives are in charge.\nIt’s about time the Tories got a proper grip on council finances and stopped playing chicken with all our money!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_green-party_page_5/content_357.html": "There are campaign leaflets flying around from the Tories blaming Labour for ‘forcing Cherwell to build on Green Belt land”, I think that’s a huge stretch of the truth.\nCherwell’s Conservative leadership and the majority of councillors came up with and voted for the plans to destroy large parts of green belt in north Oxford for reasons of their own. They used the City Council’s claims of ‘unmet housing need’ as an excuse to facilitate investment and development opportunities for the university and other large landowners.\nWe begged the council to take a step back from their plans in view of the fact that the City hadn’t published a local plan proving their ‘unmet need’ This would have been a perfect justification, but they refused. So outrageously revisionist to claim it was all Labour’s fault!\nBut this statement in the Oxford Times from the City Council’s Labour leader Susan Brown does place their cards firmly on the table. She would rather continue to focus on economic and business development than provide affordable accommodation for their own needs.\nThere are multiple sites within the boundaries of the city that could be used for medium to high density housing to solve at least the immediate problems for housing the the city centre and in East Oxford. At least 4 of those site are slated for development, predominantly for business use.\nIt’s plain that the council has repeatedly and recklessly pursued economic development instead of housing under the leadership of Bob Price and the new Labour leader intends for this to continue.\nNow their new leader has made it clear that her intention (and presumably Labour’s) is to push that envelope even further. Increase business development in the city (even though unemployment there is virtually zero) and press district councils to plough up their green spaces and destroy natural habitat to build houses to fulfil their needs.\nPresumably Ms Brown is also happy to see the city export it’s obscenely high levels of pollution and appalling air quality into the green areas around her ever expanding empire like some post-apocalyptic behemoth, consuming everyone and everything in its path.\nThat’s not a vision of sustainability or quality of life I see as particularly attractive for anyone.\nYes we need to build houses, but they need to be the right houses in the right places. If Oxford city want to deal with their own housing crisis (assuming that is proven in their own yet to be completed local plan) then the right place for housing is within their own confines. At least it is before the expect other areas to cover their backsides!\nIt was good to see Labour members on Cherwell District Council supporting campaigners in defending our precious green belt, but they really do need to have a word with their colleagues on the city council and get them to set their own house in order, literally!",

But we’re used to tall orders. In the face of what seems like a deliberate policy of starving us of media attention in favour of far more ratings grabbing pint-swilling politico-celebs like Nigel Farage, we’re still garnering support from credible commentators and respected political analysts for both our economic and social justice proposals.\nFormer Citibank financial trader Gary Stevenson and host of the You Tube Channel Gary’s Economics has analysed the Green Party manifesto and classified it as the most credible and honest in real terms. In a recent video he confirmed that he would be voting Green because we are the only party to be offering a radical and workable alternative to the proposals from every other party.\nTrade Unionist and former General Secretary of the Labour Party Jennie Formby has also announced on Twitter that she would be voting Green in this election along with numerous other high profile political and cultural leaders such as George Monbiot. It’s also reported that more and more young people are turning to the Greens as a real alternative to the ping-pong politics of the past 50 years.\nAs a moderate Green myself I’ve always seen the Greens as a true alternative vote, neither left or right. The Green Party officially rejects the traditional left–right political spectrum, describing it as “something of an anachronism” and that perfectly fits with my view on the world.\nI’m standing as the Parliamentary Candidate for Bicester and Woodstock mainly because it’s my home constituency and the place I’ve made my home for 32 years. But above all that, it’s a place I’ve seen change drastically in that time with even more drastic changes in the pipeline. From the massive development plans in and around Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Bicester with large areas of greenbelt being decimated by ill-conceived local plans to proposals to armour plate 3500 acres of green fields and farmland for hugely unpopular solar farm project in the west. I’m concerned about what these things will do to the place I’ve called home for nearly half my life.\nThere’s obviously going to be a lot more to say on this election in the remaining 2 weeks, much of which I’ve not said so far due to dealing with my new responsibilities on Cherwell District Council after being appointed to the executive on the same night that the General Election was announced (great timing Rishi!). But I’ll be breaking my silence over the next 2 weeks.\nIn the meantime, doors are being knocked, leaflets are being delivered and pollsters are polling. There’s been a huge amount of speculation about who can win in this constituency and I’m not going to add to that with my own obviously biased opinions. But with a newly drawn boundary, every voter has the historic opportunity to vote in a brand new Westminster constituency for the first time where we could all buck the trends and help me and the Greens to show that any prediction in an unknown and untested area could be drastically inaccurate.\nCan I win? Who knows? Am I serious about my candidacy? Absolutely! But then as anyone who knows me and knows my work as a local councillor and activist would tell you, I never do things by half measures. We all know that the Tories are finished, at least for the immediate future. We don’t need to vote tactically on a local basis in this election because after 14 years of chaos the country has finally woken up and are about to consign the current administration to the political skip.\nThat gives every voter in this area new opportunities and new possibilities. You can vote with your heart and for what you believe in. If that’s a better future for you and your family, a fully funded NHS and social care system, public utilities returned to responsible public control (particular water and energy), a better standard of living for all, raising millions out of poverty and protecting climate and nature, voting Green really is the only alternative. Even if I don’t win the seat, a vote for me that would contribute to a large swing to the Greens nationally will strengthen our hand in influencing national politics for the better. It will also put money into the party coffers through Short Money to help us continue the fight for a better, fairer, greener world for you and you family and their families to come.\nI’ll do my best over the next couple of weeks to make my case for your precious vote in this election and I hope you will seriously consider giving me that vote on July 4th. You should shortly be receiving leaflets from me explaining my priorities. You can also browse this website which is being updated with local issues that I think will be important in the upcoming election. I will also be adding new topics in the next few days. If you want hear me speak in the meantime, I was interviewed by Byline Times recently and was able to cover many topics that I think will be important to voters in this election. You can see that here.\nThere are also a number of hustings that you can attend to ask questions of me and the other candidates. These are :\n7.30pm – 24th June – Kidlington Methodist Church (forum on poverty)\n7.30pm – 25th June – St. Mary Magdelene Church, Park St, Woodstock\n7pm – 26th June – St Edburg Church Bicester\n6.30pm – 1st July – CPRE Country side and Environment hustings at Yarnton Village Hall\nI look forward to seeing as many people at those events as possible. If anyone would like to extend other invitations I am more than happy to come along. If any other events come up I will post them here and on my social media channels.\nRemember – this is the election where YOU get to vote FOR what YOU believe in, rather than AGAINST what you don’t.\nIf you’d like to get involved in my campaign please drop me a line at ian.middleton@greenoxford.com\nYou could also contribute to my joint fundraiser to help me and my 2 fellow North and West Oxfordshire candidates reach more voters in this campaign.

I was tweeted tonight by a parent led group campaigning against cuts in school funding in Oxfordshire asking if I realised just how bad the situation was.\nAt this point I’m the only candidate to reply. But maybe the others will catch up later.\nBut playing catch-up seems to be the way for our education system, with a report coming out only a few days ago on the dire state of repair of some school buildings. As someone who went to school in the 70s, I find it shocking that we should have let our education system become so under-valued in such a short period of time.\nMy best friend from back in those days keeps in touch with me, and he has just retired as a senior head teacher. He now does consultancy work for schools that are suffering under the same system he battled through. Essentially the privatisation of our education system that does little to help students and puts a lot of money into the pockets of Academy shareholders.\nThe future of our children should not be for sale to the highest bidder, and we should not be seeing a situation where parents have to raise hundreds of pounds to subsidise books or pay for bus passes so their children can actually get to school. Again, I remember free bus passes for school-children, but that seems like a long-lost utopia now.\nWe need an education system that provides opportunity to everyone. Schools that cater for all levels of ability and aspiration. The chance for everyone who wants to move on to further and higher education to do so without saddling themselves with a lifetime of debt.\nWe also need to value our teachers and educators, paying them a decent salary and ensuring they have fair conditions to work in. Like doctors and nurses they are taken far too much for granted and expected to cope with appalling stress simply because they are dedicated people.\nThe Conservative’s promises of extra funding don’t come close to addressing the problems that have been stored up over the past 10 years. Their so-called ‘extra’ spending amounts to nothing more than setting the clock back to the point before they imposed austerity on us all.\nSee the Green Party Manifesto by clicking here. Go to page 55 to see our comprehensive range of proposals and policies about revitalising our education system and bringing schools into the 21sct century, whilst unlocking the potential of students and teachers at all levels.\nA proper education for the next generation should be a priority for all of us. Without that what kind of world are we building for our children and ourselves?",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_type_gallery_page_7/content_437.html": "Many people will have heard the absurd comments from Cherwell’s lead councillor for Financial Management and Governance, Tony Ilott, on BBC Oxford breakfast radio on Tuesday. I thought it was worth covering a few of the comments made by the Conservative representative in more detail.\nThe programme featured a running topic on the amount of back rent owed to several councils in Oxfordshire and you can hear it here. This is not a problem unique to this county as so many councils now rely on commercial investment to make ends meet since central government no longer provide enough funding for even the basic services that we all rely on.\nThis problem is exacerbated by the fact that legislation requires local authorities to balance their budgets every year and prevents them from borrowing to cover any shortfalls. This leaves them in the position of trying to operate like private investors without having the same financial flexibility.\nWith many local authorities now heavily invested in commercial property they have all faced a huge shortfall in income from rents that have not been paid throughout the pandemic. To add insult to this injury, even though the Chancellor said he would provide “whatever it takes” to help local government, central government has excluded losses from commercial investments from it’s support payments to councils.\nThe need to balance the books each year results in councils being left with only 2 options when they have a shortfall in rents. Either they increase council tax (which can only be done up to certain limits without a costly referendum) or they cut services.\nthat’s going to be a pretty expensive chicken dinner for the residents of Cherwell!\nThis is what Cherwell District Council did in 2021 when they reported losses in the region of £1.6m against the Castle Quay shopping centre in Banbury. With similar losses predicted for the next financial year, this is likely to put the same pressures on the budget for the following year which will inevitably mean yet more cuts, along with additional charges like we’ve seen this year for things like garden waste collections.\nCommercial landlords would usually carry these sorts of shortfalls over a period of years, often borrowing to cover the gaps, and recover as much of the rent as they could over that time with deferral agreements with tenants. Ultimately some of the losses may have to be written off. But as explained above, councils can’t do this. So as long as these shortfalls are on the books, more cuts or tax increases are the only way to deal with the problem each year.\nIt was clear though from the interview Cllr Ilott really didn’t understand any of the mechanics of this, which is quite staggering considering his role on the council. When he was asked if he thought there should be a change in legislation that would allow councils to deal with these problems, he said he didn’t think so. Instead he chose to make childish personal comments about me and avoided answering the interviewer’s questions about how the council will recover these losses.\nit’s clear that they have no real vision for how to revitalise the development other than the idea that making it bigger will somehow make it better.\nHe did make mention of ‘working with tenants’ which of course is a good plan. As a retail consultant myself I’d always advocate such a move, but due to the limitations imposed on councils, this can only be done on a year by year basis. Any outstanding debts at the end of each year will need to be accounted for and action taken on increased taxation or services cuts.\nCllr Illot suggested that we look at things “in the round” and I agree we should do that. Unfortunately, time restraints on the programme prevented me from laying out the full details, but I’m happy to do so here :\n- Losses in the last financial year attributable to Castle Quay – £1.6m\n- Losses predicted in the next financial year due to Castle Quay – approx £1.6m\n- Rent owed to Cherwell District Council at this point – nearly £2m\n- Loss in value of Castle Quay shopping centre since the council took full ownership – over £30m (it’s now worth less than half what they paid for it 4 years ago)\n- Additional investment being ploughed into expanding the centre – £73m (underwritten by council tax payers)\n- Interest on the loans to finance all this (so far) – £2m+ per year\n- Cuts required to the entire council budget this year – £4.4m\nYes some of this can be blamed on the pandemic, but retail was already on the decline when the council took the frankly bizarre decision to buy the scheme, especially as it’s clear that they have no real vision for how to revitalise the development other than the idea that making it bigger will somehow make it better. That and Cllr Ilott’s head in the sand optimism seems to be the main strategy from our Conservative councillors.\nI don’t see that as good value for the council tax payers of Cherwell. Judging by Cllr Illott’s flippancy and lack of concern he seems to regard massive financial losses along with the associated financial impact on resident’s pockets as fine as long as he can get some chicken.\nI’d say that taking all that into account that’s going to be a pretty expensive chicken dinner for the residents of Cherwell!\nAnd let’s not forget that all this money is going into one town in Cherwell – Banbury. Meanwhile Bicester town centre’s retail area is being hollowed out due to the council’s planning decisions elsewhere, and the whole of the district – every single tax payer – is footing the bill for all this incompetence. As is often the case with Cherwell Council , the south of the district is left to fend for itself and pick up the tab. If I were a cynical soul I might suggest that this is because the majority of support for the councillors who agreed to this whole adventure comes from the north of the district.\nBut I think we should all be able to rely on decent fiscal management from our local councillors, no matter where we live. Sadly it seems clear to me that we can’t expect this as long as the Conservatives are in charge.\nIt’s about time the Tories got a proper grip on council finances and stopped playing chicken with all our money!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_politics_page_4/content_325.html": "In 2019 I became the first ever Green District Councillor in Cherwell. Apart from that being a little bit of personal history for me, it was also the start of a change that would unfold across the county over the next 3 years with Greens playing their part in the removal of Conservative control in every major local authority in Oxfordshire.\nIn 2019, Green colleagues in South Oxfordshire, along with the Lib Dems virtually swept the board, taking control of the District Council from a huge Conservative majority with 5 Greens being elected. Another Green was elected on the Vale of the White Horse Council. Then in 2021 Greens, Lib Dems and Labour took control of the County Council in a three way alliance with the Lib Dems and Greens forming a separate group which I now have the honour of being deputy leader of. Finally in 2022 we took joint control of West Oxfordshire District Council with the Lib Dems and Labour as well as gaining a further seat on CDC.\nThat left CDC as the only remaining Conservative controlled council albeit with a drastically reduced majority of only 2. The group that I and 2 Lib Dems formed in 2019 grew to 12 members by the end of the last municipal year meaning that from 2022 we became the official opposition with me as deputy leader of that group.\nThat’s a huge turnaround in only a few short years which feels even shorter given that for one of those years the elections were cancelled.\nNow with Cherwell as the last remaining bastion of Conservatism in the county, the prize is for the taking. As long as all the currently sitting opposition councillors hang on to their seats (which includes me) in the forthcoming elections, we have a good chance of taking control of CDC. We really need 4 extra seats to be flipped from the Conservatives and the way the country feels about them at the moment that is a very real possibility.\nGreens hope to take one more seat in Bicester where we’ve come a close second 2 years in a row, with the Lib Dems hopefully gaining 2 more. In Banbury there’s a chance that Labour will also gain an extra seat which would then give a 4 way Green/Lib Dem/Labour/Independent alliance a majority. Even if we only gain 2-3 seats the council will fall into no overall control which gives us much more leverage to ensure that areas like Kidlington get a better slice of the district pie.\nFor far too long Kidlington has been the poor relation in Cherwell with the majority of funding and investment going to Banbury – where the council has so far sunk £130M into a failing shopping centre – and Bicester – where they plan to spend £4.25M on upgrading a car park in an events space that no one really seems to want.\nThis year we have an opportunity to see real change and real progress in areas like Kidlington as well as the rest of the district. I hope voters will take that opportunity and we can finally have a clean sweep across the county leaving progressive, forward thinking authorities looking out for the best interests of current residents and those yet to come.\nThis year, more than ever in Cherwell, every vote will count. I won in 2019 with only 72 votes to spare, although last year Fiona Mawson won with a far more convincing majority of over 250. I hope I can emulate here but we can’t afford to be complacent. Everyone needs to use their vote to support the candidate most likely to win against the Toru candidate. In Kidlington East that’s me and I hope I can count on local support.\nLet’s not lose this chance to break the Tory stranglehold and make a better future for everyone. Make sure your vote really counts on May 4th!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_castle-quay/content_14.html": "In 2018 Cherwell District Council purchased the Castle Quay Shopping centre. As a retail analyst, I’m not convinced that risking council tax payers money on a venture like this is a good idea and it’s already starting to unravel as a result of declining high streets and of course the impact of online retail. This has been made even more pressing as the effects of the pandemic has led to an even greater decline in real world retail.\nSince the council purchased the centre at a vastly inflated price, it has lost nearly three quarters of it’s value. Even the new waterside project is worth less now than it cost to develop. Meanwhile the centre adds pressure to the council’s budget every year as the predicted profits from the operation fail to materialise. Council tax payers are underwriting this whole fiasco while the council sticks its collective head in the sand and hopes for the best. There is no discernible plan for how to turn things around and little in the way of understanding of the retail industry amongst the council membership.\nWhilst I accept that keeping the centre open is vital to Banbury, and I largely agree with the development of the Castle Quay extension, I remain concerned about any impact on council finances as retail failures continue in the centre. I will be maintaining a watching brief on developments there. I can see no way out of the spiral of decline that taxpayers have been saddled with by the Conservative leadership, but I realise that we are now stuck with this white elephant and we have to figure out some way to make it fly.\nIn the meantime, I’m concerned about the amount of council resources that are being poured into Castle Quay every year which is causing problems elsewhere in the district. The budgetary pressures created by the centre are adding to the loss of services and increases in council tax across the whole district simply to plug holes in the council’s finances as a result.\nMy preference would be for the council to support the smaller independent stores outside the centre in areas like Parsons Street. But I can see there is some scope to support smaller operators in the shopping centre itself. However, while all the focus is on Castle Quay there seems little left to ensure that Banbury’s once thriving independent stores are getting the attention they deserve.",

They used the City Council’s claims of ‘unmet housing need’ as an excuse to facilitate investment and development opportunities for the university and other large landowners.\nWe begged the council to take a step back from their plans in view of the fact that the City hadn’t published a local plan proving their ‘unmet need’ This would have been a perfect justification, but they refused. So outrageously revisionist to claim it was all Labour’s fault!\nBut this statement in the Oxford Times from the City Council’s Labour leader Susan Brown does place their cards firmly on the table. She would rather continue to focus on economic and business development than provide affordable accommodation for their own needs.\nThere are multiple sites within the boundaries of the city that could be used for medium to high density housing to solve at least the immediate problems for housing the the city centre and in East Oxford. At least 4 of those site are slated for development, predominantly for business use.\nIt’s plain that the council has repeatedly and recklessly pursued economic development instead of housing under the leadership of Bob Price and the new Labour leader intends for this to continue.\nNow their new leader has made it clear that her intention (and presumably Labour’s) is to push that envelope even further. Increase business development in the city (even though unemployment there is virtually zero) and press district councils to plough up their green spaces and destroy natural habitat to build houses to fulfil their needs.\nPresumably Ms Brown is also happy to see the city export it’s obscenely high levels of pollution and appalling air quality into the green areas around her ever expanding empire like some post-apocalyptic behemoth, consuming everyone and everything in its path.\nThat’s not a vision of sustainability or quality of life I see as particularly attractive for anyone.\nYes we need to build houses, but they need to be the right houses in the right places. If Oxford city want to deal with their own housing crisis (assuming that is proven in their own yet to be completed local plan) then the right place for housing is within their own confines. At least it is before the expect other areas to cover their backsides!\nIt was good to see Labour members on Cherwell District Council supporting campaigners in defending our precious green belt, but they really do need to have a word with their colleagues on the city council and get them to set their own house in order, literally!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2021_05_17_thank-you-from-your-new-county-councillor/content_104.html": "It’s been a busy 11 days since the election! So busy I’ve not been able to properly thank everyone who supported and voted for me on May 6th.\nAs the count was delayed until the 9th May and went on until late in the evening, it wasn’t until the 10th that it began to sink in that I’d actually won, beating a long standing councillor who had become something of a fixture in the area.\nIt was a fantastic election for the Greens across the country with us winning nearly 100 new seats. Some of the notable highlights were :\n- Greens in first place across Bristol West and Sheffield Central constituencies\n- Gained representation on 18 councils, bringing the total tally of councils with Green representation to 141.\n- Gained 99 seats – now 445 councillors across England and Wales\n- Won 24 seats on Bristol City Council – now joint largest party with Labour.\nAnd of course in Oxford we won many new seats with an extra seat gained on the city council and 2 new seats on the county council, myself included! After we retained our original seat on the county with Dr Pete Sudbury, that gives us 3 seats along with Robin Bennett who is also the deputy leader of South Oxfordshire District Council. I’m looking forward to working with both of them.\nThe out-turn of all this in Oxfordshire is that the Conservatives have been pushed into being the opposition party on the county for the first time ever! While they are currently showing as having 22 seats on the council, they actually only have 21 as an extra seat was gained due to a mistake made at the count that will be corrected in the high court in the next few weeks. There’s also some exciting news in the pipeline about what that means for the next administration of the council that I can’t reveal at the moment. But look out on Monday evening for an important announcement!\nMeanwhile, the Green surge continues, and thanks to you I am part of that! So a huge thank you goes out to everyone who worked on my campaign, donated money to it and of course to the people who voted for me. I will do my best to not let you down. I will be starting work on the council in the next week or so, after all the dust has settled and I am properly plugged into the systems there. The first part of that is the council AGM which will be held on Tuesday in Banbury.\nIn the meantime, please feel free to contact me with any issues you want me to look at. My first priority is going to be looking at what we can do about the state of the roads in this area. I’ve already been contacted by several people who have raised this with me and I know from my own experience that this is a very important local issue. I hope I can hit the ground running and make some visible progress on this soon.\nIt’s going to be an exciting few years with huge changes afoot in Oxfordshire and you’re all part of that, so thank you all again!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_type_gallery_page_20/content_480.html": "This is a copy of a piece I wrote for Huffington Post this week. You can find and comment on the original here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/eu-referendum-immigration_b_9322718.html\nSo here it is. After years of campaigning and complaining, manoeuvring and cajoling, half-truths and good old fashioned British pig-headedness, the moaning masses of middle England have finally got their referendum.\nI say ‘their’ referendum because this isn’t being staged at great expense for those of us who want to stay part of Europe. It’s not even for those who don’t really give a toss either way.\nIt’s certainly not for those more outward looking souls, who appreciate the many advantages of being a member of the European club. The easy movement between states (yes that does apply to us as well as all those annoying refugees and migrants) and the free transport of goods. Funding for urban and industrial renewal. Numerous environmental improvements to beaches, rivers and the countryside, including controls on things like GMOs. Human rights, animal rights, consumer rights. Cheaper phone charges and easier and cheaper travel and currency exchange. Social welfare protection and labour rights, and a panoply of other advantages that most people take for granted and will miss when they’re gone.\nNo, it’s a referendum for misguided and ill-informed little-Englanders, draped in Union flags, firm in the belief of two world wars and one world cup and certain the word ‘Great’ attached to Britain means something other than the first letter on a sticker they slap on the back of their booze cruise charabang, just to remind those envious foreigners that they were unlucky enough to be born on inferior soil.\nBut moreover, it’s a referendum for politicians who have been looking at continental Europe down the wrong end of the telescope for so long now, they just don’t realise how small this country has become on the world stage. A myopic concern about how much money we pay to Europe and a studied ignorance of the huge returns our EU membership generates.\nMost people who focus on our payment to Brussels like to remind us what else we could do with that money. Yet with a growing national debt, and stubbornly high deficit, any such savings would likely fall into the same black hole as most of the rest of our national finances. Either that or it would go towards servicing the country’s circa £50bn annual interest payments, paid in large part to European banks anyway.\nIt’s not 1975. The geo-political landscape has changed around us since the last time we decided if we wanted to be a part of Europe. Yes, back in the swinging 70s it was the ‘Common Market’, but by necessity and common interest it’s become more than that. Those advocating some kind of return to a simple trading relationship are ignoring both the reality of our reduced place in the world and the promiscuity of world markets.\nNeither is it 1938, even though Cameron’s Chamberlain moment was equally as hollow. Just like his pre-war counterpart, the agreement he reached in Brussels was peripheral and disposable, focussing as it did on the false polemic of immigration and border control.\nIt was a pantomime, with Donald Tusk and Angela Merkel as the ugly sisters to Cameron’s Cinderella. Shouts of “they’re behind you” were evident from the likes of UKIP and Front National pointing to the ‘hordes’ or ‘swarms’ or ‘bunches’ of ‘migrants’, ‘refugees’ or ‘immigrants’, depending on which description David Cameron and the BBC have alighted on this week.\nI totally agree that EU democratic and regulatory processes are in desperate need of reform, but these weren’t the points that Cameron argued. Driven by domestic pressures, piled on by a widening xenophobic rhetoric, he was pushed into a rushed and ill-conceived round of negotiations that resulted in him metaphorically claiming ‘peace in our time’ outside Number 10. It was a performance put on to give him a platform to launch the referendum that we all knew was coming, and the critic’s reviews weren’t great.\nSadly for him, us, and the rest of Europe, this was a missed opportunity that could have sparked a trans-national debate about the real future of the EU and brought about radical changes to shape it into something more even-handed and responsive to the needs of all member states.\nBut instead, Cameron wasted what could have been his real place in history for the sake of a thumbs up from the likes of Farage, Gove and Galloway whilst gaining little tangible return for the UK, save for some token restrictions on benefit payments to migrants who rarely claim them anyway.\nIn fact it’s recently been revealed that the UK government has no idea how much immigration costs us, nor how much migrants contribute to our economy. But let’s not let a little thing like lack of facts get in the way of a nicely staked out scapegoat.\nAnd while we’re on the subject of discrimination, we mustn’t forget those hard-pressed city bankers quaking in their handmade brogues, terrified that they may be penalised for being outside the Eurozone. That of course, amid the posturing about immigration, was the main concern for Cameron and his paymasters. Essentially he was in Brussels to fight for the right to discriminate against the poor whilst protecting the interests of the obscenely rich, although of course that wasn’t so eagerly reported.\nAnd there we have it. The crux of all this political, psychological and media-spun mendacity – Corporate interest. Insular businesses seeking to rid themselves of the European interference and regulation that keeps all the rest of us safer and better looked after. The refugee and migrant crises couldn’t have come at a better time for these vested interests to galvanise public opinion in favour of an out vote.\nOn this flimsiest of pretexts, and on evidence largely pulled out UKIP’s collective backside, we’re potentially going to launch ourselves into one of the biggest national disasters for several generations. The ‘Brexit’ silo mentality that is about as relevant in today’s globally connected society as statutes recorded on vellum.\nOne of the greatest achievements and advantages of the EU is freedom of movement between states. It’s a harbinger of a future globalised socio-economic system where borders and statehood will be irrelevant. One where the term ‘economic-migrant’ will no longer be a thinly veiled insult, just as it wasn’t when we and other nations economically migrated across the globe centuries ago, annexing and occupying entire countries as we went. In that context, and in view of the Tories much vaunted ‘on your bike’ ethos, I find it perplexing that we now seem to regard our attraction as place of opportunity as a bad thing.\nAnd while we’re on that subject, if I were a British migrant living on the continent I’d be feeling distinctly uncomfortable right now. Especially those who have lived there for longer than 15 years and are inexplicably denied the right to vote in a referendum that may well decide their future.\nThose whistling tunes in the dark about independent trade agreements with Europe and other global partners will soon find that our status as the 5th richest nation in the world is built on foundations largely stamped with a CE logo. Already Sterling has plummeted on the news that Boris is heading for the lifeboats.\nMuch of our apparent wealth is generated by the financial sector and supported by our membership of the EU. Who will want to trade with us as a small individual nation with a growing national debt and a dwindling economic base? No wonder the city was such a key part of Cameron’s negotiations.\nThe finance sector is pretty much all we have left. We don’t have anything else to trade. China and the USA know this and have already warned us that a UK outside the EU will be of much less interest to them. The US in particular sees our connection with Europe as a valuable conduit into EU financial markets.\nUncoupling ourselves from the EU will be a long, painful and essentially irreversible process. We won’t wake up one day and see bluebirds over the white cliffs and a land of milk and honey for all. It will take years of debate, legal dispute and the unpicking of labyrinthine systems of regulation woven into our own statutory frameworks. A drawn out and retrograde process, during which I believe we’ll slowly come to see the folly of our ways.\nAnd once we’ve closed our borders and thumbed our noses at one of the biggest trading blocs on the planet, it will be too late to realise that we’re now more of a Pekinese than a bulldog. An isle not so much sceptred as septic, poisoned by our own arrogance and bigotry, left entirely at the mercy of a broken political system where wealth goes one way, and protection is only there for those who can afford it.\nAs Britain shrivels into, at best, a tawdry tax haven in perpetual serfdom to a rich elite, we’ll come to the sad realisation that we’ve been sold a Jerusalem built on false promises and false flags. I wonder if border controls and apocryphal straight bananas will seem quite so important then.",

I think it speaks for itself, although after it was published I thought I should have pointed out that none of the the politicians I refer to in the studio on election night were Greens. As usual we weren’t invited to the BBC party. There were however representatives from Labour, Conservative, Libdems and UKIP. Given that the Greens had a reasonably good showing in the last General Election in Rochester (for a ‘marginal’ party) I’d have thought we’d have been worth a mention at least. But apparently not.\nAnyway I hope this serves as a good first post on my website/blog and you can see the original article here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/westminster-politics_b_6199214.html?utm_hp_ref=tw.\nFeel free to comment below or on the original article on the Huffington Post site.\nI recently became a parliamentary candidate for the Green Party. After years of railing against politicians, the irony, and perhaps the hypocrisy, of becoming one myself has not been lost on me.\nThen again, there were the constant jibes about my complaining a lot but doing nothing positive to make a change. So when my local party group asked me to stand, I said I’d give it a go. And here I am. Feel free to point the finger.\nOne of the first things I’ve noticed about the underbelly of politics is just how strategic it is.

The party gained 2686 votes giving them 4.6% of the vote up from 1.7% in 2010. He is a former musician, writer and ethical entrepreneur who spent 25 years in the retail sector building a national high street retail business which moved exclusively online in 2015.

Ian Says :\n“I’m honoured to have been chosen to stand in North Oxfordshire again. I feel I learnt a lot from the last campaign and I’m looking forward to having a second opportunity to put forward the case for a progressive Green future”\n“My priorities for this election are the NHS, Education, Housing, the environment and Brexit”\n“Theresa May called this election for purely opportunistic reasons. She claims to offer strength and stability yet throws the country into turmoil just as the clock starts ticking on Brexit negotiations. Whilst our changed relationship with Europe is one of the most important issues we’ve faced for a generation, we’ve also had 2 years to see what the Conservative Party has done to health, education and housing and it’s not a pretty sight.\nThe NHS in particular is facing an existential crisis with yet another round of swingeing cuts being imposed by further Conservative in the guise of sustainability. Already we’ve seen the results with the closure of full maternity services at the Horton and warnings from the Oxfordshire CCG that we stand to lose hundreds of beds across the county. This may be the last chance to save our wonderful NHS before the Conservatives achieve their ultimate goal of slashing services and privatising what’s left.\nTheresa May wants this election to be all about Brexit, I think we should be holding her party to account for it’s appalling record so far.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_page_8/content_365.html": "At the full Cherwell District Council meeting in February I brought a motion calling for a more joined up approach to flooding response in our area and across Oxfordshire which was passed unanimously by members of the council.\nThe motion called for areas that are at risk of flooding to establish a ‘flood resilient community’, including the formation of local flood response groups and forums for residents to feedback information on current and potential flooding risks,\nTo support these groups I suggested the setting up of local flood response stores to provide locally available flood alleviation equipment. I had hoped that there would be funding for this, but there was some push back on this from the County Council due to shortage of money. I still don’t think that’s good enough and will be pursuing this more fully in the future.\nThe motion also said that updated surveys and maintenance programs, with maps of drainage and flood defences and associated repair responsibilities should be published regularly to help local groups and response agencies to maintain and monitor them.\nFinally I called on risk management agencies across the county to set up a cooperative task force, including the provision of a centralised contact point which can trigger an immediate, proportionate response to all emergency flooding events. It is envisaged that all local councils and other agencies would play a part in this.\nFlooding in Yarnton\nI was very glad we managed to debate this motion, even though it only just made it before the new 11pm guillotine imposed by the Conservatives in the recent constitutional review. If it hadn’t been discussed at this meeting, it would have been another 5 months before it would have been heard and obviously we could be facing many more flood incidents before then.\nAs a councillor, I’ve been trying to help local residents deal with flooding in both my Parish and District council wards. It’s become apparent that there is no central co-ordination and no single contact point that can be called on to manage flooding at all levels. Smaller floods are often given a low priority by the relevant agencies and even the new guidance issued by the County and District councils doesn’t provide a timely response to these incidents.\nCherwell District Council recently resumed responsibility for flood defence in the region and as we also work closely with the county council we are in a unique position to take some leadership on this issue and improve responses to these distressing and costly incidents. This is even more important in areas like Yarnton and Begbroke which have been flooded recently and where the council has recently identified areas for development as part of the local plan review.\nCovering areas in tarmac and concrete is only going to increase the likelihood of flooding and we need to ensure that suitable and long lasting flood alleviation measures are included along with responsibility for maintenance.",

Not that you’d notice. Outside of ‘that’ slogan and the belief that the election is somehow going to imbue her with magic Brexit powers, we’ve seen precious little, other than some enigmatic eyebrow raising and her claim that the Tory manifesto will be the answer to everything.\nAn article I wrote recently for the new media channel Evolve Politics",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_tactical-voting/content_242.html": "As we approach voting day, I thought I should deal with the elephant in the room head on.\nThe two questions I’m being asked are “Is voting Green a wasted vote?” and “Shouldn’t I vote tactically in Banbury to get the Tories out?”\nI’ll take the second question first and I answer that by way of this short video, but the gist is that tactical voting in Banbury is very unlikely to work. The Tories still have a 12000 vote majority after Labour’s strongest performance in 2017. Even if you added together all the non-Tory votes in the 2017 election (including UKIP) the next nearest party (Labour) would still have been 8000 votes short of winning.\nSo you’re free to vote for what you believe in, in Banbury.\nThe first question I’ll answer with 10 reasons why voting Green is not a wasted vote\n1. The national vote share for the Greens will send a message to whomever is in government that we want to see real commitment to climate change issues.\n2. A big swing to the Greens will really shake up the other parties and make them realise this is serious!\n3. Greens have already influenced the national political landscape. Jeremy Corbyn wouldn’t be the leader of Labour if the Greens hadn’t pushed them to be more radical after the 2015 election.\n4. A big Green swing will get a lot of publicity making the point even more strongly. Just another second place for the next nearest party will get virtually no media coverage.\n5. Votes for the Greens help them get funding in the form of Short Money. In Banbury that money is worth several thousand pounds. Remember we don’t take funding from big businesses or institutions like the other parties do.\n6. Greens call ill-afford to lose the £500 deposit in any constituency. They only need to get 5% of the vote to do that. We got 4.6% in 2015 in Banbury. We only needed another 225 votes, so every vote counted.\n7. The number of votes any party gets in a GE determines how much coverage they get on national media, particularly for platforms like the BBC and ITV.\n8. We have been winning seats in Oxfordshire. We doubled our number of MEPs and gained 10 times as many council seats, with joint control of one District Council. More Green votes in all elections mean more people get into the habit of voting Green and we get more Green representatives in government.\n9. Voting Green gives encouragement to your local branch to make the effort each time to put up a candidate so you will always have the chance to vote Green.\n10. If you really care about the environment and the future for generations to come, you’ll be able to tell your children and grandchildren with a clear conscience that you voted for them in years to come. Voting with your heart is never a wasted vote!\nI hope this helps anyone who might be undecided about how they can vote in Banbury. And remember, if you’re a Green at heart, this is the time to vote with your heart. For the planet, for your children and for our future.\nIf not now, then when?",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_climate-change_page_2/content_207.html": "I took a day out of campaigning this week to attend and speak at the public inquiry of the Oxford City local plan.\nIt was a feeling of déjà vu for me as I spent several days doing the same thing in Cherwell earlier this year when our local plan partial review was being examined. Cherwell is pushing to build thousands of houses on green belt land in the south of the district and I have been campaigning for the past 2 years to protect those vital green areas for future generations.\nI was at the inquiry into the city plans because it’s those proposals that are forcing local district councils to add to their own housing requirements to service what the city claims is an ‘unmet need’. Whilst I and other campaigners don’t dispute that Oxford has a need for housing for its own workers, claims that they can’t meet that need within their own boundaries are hotly disputed.\nIt’s generally believed that the reason they can’t meet that need themselves is that they would rather use their own land for economic development to build more shops, offices, hotels, restaurants and student accommodation. The Labour run city council then expect the surrounding rural districts to meet their housing need for them and Conservative run councils like Cherwell are only too glad to oblige as this gives them a perfect excuse to enrich the local landowners and developers who support them.\nIt’s sad to see that both Labour and the Conservatives are pursuing a policy of green belt destruction in Oxfordshire when there really is no need. There are plenty of brownfield sites available to build on, as well as empty properties that should be re-purposed or brought back into use.\nI want to see more genuinely affordable housing for people on average incomes. More social and council housing. Rent controls on private landlords and an end to unfair developer lease & ground rent charges, but we will never see large amounts of affordable housing in Oxfordshire if they are built on high value green belt land. The only reason these areas are targetted is because they are ripe to be used by developers to build high value executive homes and mini-mansions to make a massive killing.\nThere should not be development on Green Belt land except where there is an incontrovertible need to do so. Our precious green spaces should not be handed over the developers simply to make huge profits for landowners and speculators, especially when much of that housing is not affordable in any real sense.\nGreen spaces are also now even more vital to help combat climate change and flooding. Concreting them over and adding more roads and houses with inefficient heating systems just piles on the pressure to the environment and exports Oxford’s poor air quality standards to the rural areas of the county.\nThe Green party has pledged to build 100,000 genuinely affordable socially rented properties every year for 10 years. Houses that will be built to the Passive House standard meaning they will be both sustainable and affordable to maintain and heat.\nThis will not only provide much-needed homes for people of average incomes, they will be the right houses in the right places and will also provide employment for thousands of builders and manufacturers.\nThis is on top of retrofitting every house in the country to make them more energy efficient as part of our Green New Deal.\nAs a founding member of a housing co-op in London in the 1980s, I also want to encourage other ways of getting people into affordable housing such as Land Trusts and Co-ops and see more social and council housing built.\nYou can find out more about our policies on housing in our manifesto here https://www.greenparty.org.uk/assets/files/Elections/Green%20Party%20Manifesto%202019.pdf",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_retail-2/content_27.html": "I’ve been involved in retail for as long as I can remember. From my first proper job as a Saturday boy in a menswear store in Lewisham through my days as a market trader in Camden Lock and Greenwich to being co-founder of a national high street chain that started with a small store in Oxford selling silver jewellery. and grew into a national chain trading in 6 of country’s major retail locations, including London’s prestigious Covent Garden.\nIn that time I saw almost as many ups as I did downs. I’ve half jokingly said that I spent 20 years building the business and then another 10 trying extricating it from the failing high street. Like so many other retailers who entered the high street during the boom years in the early 1990s, I fell foul of the simultaneous boom in commercial property development. So many new malls were opened in the 90s and early 2000s it was difficult to keep up and I opened stores in some of the most iconic examples such as the New Bullring in Birmingham and Bluewater in Kent.\nThe other boom at the time was in business rates, which along with rents skyrocketed through that period as institutional landlords, mostly backed by large pension funds, cashed in on the retail bubble ploughing millions into new shiny malls based on the emerging US model. It was great while it lasted and we all became caught up in the heady days of seemingly limitless opportunities. But we soon discovered there were limits.\nThe Financial crash in 2008 gave us all a pretty sharp reality check and things soon started to become far less buoyant and rents that had been agreed on the back of rude profit margins started to look far less tenable as turnovers started to fall.\nThere soon followed a series of frantic rounds of renegotiation with landlords who themselves were facing the prospect of huge hole in their new developments as retailers started to fall over with alarming regularity. In many cases we were able to come to mutual agreements to keep us trading at the shopping malls looking full, but the one thing that couldn’t be re-negotiated were business rates. Set as they were, by the central valuation office, and administered by local authorities, they were completely devoid of any chance of concession unless you had an understanding council. In my experience their understanding was rather limited, and after 5 years as a local councillor myself I now understand more about why that was.\nSo we were all caught in a perfect storm that only a few managed to emerge from. My business was one of the luckier ones as I managed to negotiate deals that gave us breathing space. But I could see the writing on the wall and it was telling me to get out of the high street and decamp to the internet where so many of our competitors were lurking. Thereby hangs another very long story.\nBut suffice to say I have an intimate understanding of the plight of the high street, in fact much more intimate than I would prefer. For that reason one of my personal priorities as a fresh faced new MP would be to push for a new system of business rates or local high street taxation. Other things like rent controls and use classes would also be high on the agenda, but none of this will be an easy fix for an industry in the doldrums after so many years in decline. But I know from my own experience that smaller independents are both the lifeblood of local high streets whilst also being the most vulnerable.\nIn terms of the dreaded business rates, I think I could take elements from the land tax approach of the Green party and add in some aspect of a local purchase tax as seen in the USA. Such a tax would be far more progressive and have more respect for the ability of businesses to pay such an additional tax. That would give a far greater connection between the local community, local authorities and the retailers themselves. If all retailers did well then they would all reap the benefits.\nSpeaking to local councillors and retailers about business rates reform\nI don’t really have the answer to full business rates reform, but I’ve been campaigning for a better system for over 10 years. I would advocate a situation where we involved existing high street retailers in the process of finding a solution. There have been past attempts at doing this, but very few, if any, involved small independent retailers. I think that was a mistake.\nThe Labour Party have boldly announced that they would scrap the current business rates system, but they haven’t said what they would replace it with. I’ve been here before many times, and both Labour and the Tories have frequently promised reform but never delivered on that. One of the biggest reason is that business rates are a virtually guaranteed income for government bringing in over £13bn a year. Even if the premises are empty, the landlord cops for the bill so it’s a win-win for Westminster. So any new system is likely to be just as iniquitous and damaging, especially to smaller operators.\nI think there is a way of developing a system of local high street taxation that could benefit all sides of the equation, including the consumer. Just scrapping the business rates system with no plan for what would replace it is not a solution, yet its the current proposal from the part that is most likely to form the next government in a few weeks. If I was in Westminster I’d hope to be able to provide a far better insight into the problems on the high street and how to engage with the people who face those problems every day.\nI’d like to see genuine consultation with high street stakeholders, including landlords and local councils, about the best way forwards. As a long term retailer, having moved from being a small business, through a larger expansion and back to being a ‘born again independent’, I’d like to be involved in that process. But I guess it remains to be seen what the outcome is on July 4th.\nI’ve just published a video I made during a recent visit to Bicester with some thoughts on how we can work towards a better system of high street business taxation and help to repair our broken high streets and you can watch that by clicking here.\nIf you’re a retailer or just someone who enjoys browsing physical shops, I’d suggest you vote for someone like me who has the experience to make that a viable possibility again. Retail is at the heart of every village, town and city and needs political support to make it vibrant again. Many politicians claim to have the answer but few of them have been on the inside of the industry. I think that needs to change. I’d like to change it.",

As a result he bears some of the blame for a Conservative majority borne on the backs of the large number of older voters who didn’t see the 2 minutes it took to mark an X on a ballot sheet as so desperately uncool.\nThis time we have Ricky Gervais leaping into the fray with this tweet :\n“OK. I’m not telling you how to vote, but this is a fact. The only vote that will keep Theresa May out is a vote for @jeremycorbyn. Cheers”\nWhilst not quite so devoid of acumen as Brand’s ill-conceived advice, Ricky’s more well meaning call to action could be equally as dangerous.\nEssentially he IS telling his fans how to vote, and his less politically astute followers may not realise the pitfalls of such a binary choice.\nThe reality is that in many constituencies a vote for Corybn will not keep Theresa May out. The real fact is that it may do the exact opposite.\nSadly, even after repeated calls from other parties to enter into an ad-hoc alliance, Labour has resolutely refused to stand aside in any constituency. Whereas, for example, The Green Party has done so now in well over 30 seats.\nIn many of those seats the Libdems have a much better chance of winning than Labour. In some others the Greens or the SNP could have it in the bag. Voting Labour could then very well help the Tories by splitting the opposition.\nBy selling the idea that a vote for Labour is a vote against the Tories, no matter where you are, The Labour party and many of its supporters could be handing another victory to the Conservatives.\nI’m not usually an advocate of tactical voting, but needs must when the devil drives, and I see the devil behind the eyes of the Conservatives. But tactical voting has to be just that. It doesn’t simply mean voting Labour as the only alternative.\nUnder our broken electoral system the only place votes really count are in marginal constituencies. Until we get electoral reform and a system of proportional representation, that won’t change. And let’s not forget that Labour supports our first past the post system just as much as the Tories do.\nBut even in a safe seat your vote can make a real difference. In 2015 UKIP gave the Conservatives a real run for their money. Even though they only won one seat in Parliament they put the Tories on notice that they were there, close behind, snapping at their heels.\nThe result was the delivery of a referendum on EU membership and the subsequent lurch to the right that followed in the footsteps of Theresa May. The Conservative manifesto, such as it is, represents one of the most extreme right outlooks for the UK for many generations. It makes Margaret Thatcher’s vision look like a tie-dyed, rose tinted call to action for the love generation. It has even been compared to the BNP’s warped ideological ramblings from the 1980s, and not without cause.\nThis can be directly traced to UKIP’s influence and its validation of ideals that make a hard line, right wing agenda more palatable to people who wouldn’t dream of dancing to the tune of more overtly hard right parties.\nLikewise the nomination and election of Jeremy Corbyn can, to a large extent, be laid at the feet of the Green Party. There can’t be many Greens who haven’t noticed just how many of our clothes have recently been stolen by Corbyn’s party. And many of us are happy to be standing here in our underwear, glad that so many of our policies have been subsumed into the Labour manifesto. The sincerest form of flattery and all that.\nBut it has to be remembered that the rise of Green membership and our increasing success in both national and local elections is arguably a major driving force behind Labour’s newly rediscovered left wing credentials and a strong Green vote will help them keep that focus.\nVoting for parties that may not be mainstream, and may not have a chance of winning is not a wasted vote. Even less so in constituencies where the seat is safer than a Roy Chubby Brown joke at a UKIP convention. A vote for the party that more closely reflects your views has a demonstrable impact on those do so to a lesser extent.\nIn the case of Labour, voting for them in constituencies they can’t win may not just prevent other parties from doing so, it also reinforces the status quo of a de facto two party state and removes Labour’s incentive to join an alliance or support electoral reform if, as is still being predicted, they don’t have a majority on June 9th.\nEven if Labour were to win, there’s a very good chance that Corbyn could be unseated early on in his reign, by a parliamentary party who still don’t wholeheartedly support him. Without the threat of other left wing alternatives looking over their shoulders, it’s entirely possible that Labour will drift back to the same Tory-lite, neoliberalism that they were so conformable with last time.\nSo unless you have a realistic opportunity of a tactical vote in your constituency, just voting for the ‘other guy’ (or gal) won’t send any sort of message other than a validation of entrenched positions.\nIf you’re not going to see real change this time around. If your vote is only going to be lost in a sea of others who voted forlornly for the a close second, or the next best thing, use it to support those who will affect real change in the longer term by holding toes to the fire in the meantime.",

They were all all opposed to Cherwell District Council’s illogical and damaging decision to restrict the stalls to the Cornhill end of the Market Place. A plan also supported by the Conservative controlled Town Council.\nI started my own 25 year long retail career on a market stall, and worked it for 7 years with my partner though rain, hail sleet, snow and sunshine. I know how difficult it can be to make a living and how fragile the trading environment can be. Your livelihood can depend on so many variable factors, and one of the major fears is losing your regular pitch, for whatever reason.\nIt may seem silly to anyone who hasn’t traded in a market themselves, but where your stall sits can make all the difference between success and failure. The location of competing trades, the flow of people moving through the market, who your neighbours are, your visibility and prominence in the market as a whole are all desperately important.\nThere appears to have been absolutely no consultation with stall holders or customers about these unpopular changes, and based on what stallholders and visitors told me I foresee them being the death knell for this historic trading post as more and more traders fall by the wayside.\nSo what seems like a minor change to the council, will probably be anything but to the people trying to make a living out of the market. This move could likely kill it off! it’s already become smaller and therefore less popular, especially over the last 20 years. In 1997 there were 120 stalls, now its down to less than 20.\nConsidering it’s reduced pull for consumers it’s completely incongruous that the rents being charged by the private firm managing on behalf of the council are almost double that charged by neighbouring markets such as Abingdon, Aylesbury, Hinkley, Oxford and Thame. And as with most things these days, the rent goes up every year. Meanwhile trade is slowly dwindling away to nothing, leaving regular and loyal traders quite literally out in the cold.\nThe Council’s plan includes opening the Market car park for use on Thursdays and Fridays. There is no evidence to suggest this will increase car park usage and revenue to the Council – people already using other car parks such as that near to the Matalan Store will simply park in the market place instead.\nGovernment initiatives on town centre regeneration called for more emphasis and support for market days and the traders that build and run these vital hubs of trade and local amenity in our towns and cities. The Portas review cited markets as one of the easiest ways that town centres could be revitalised and kept alive. Why then is the Conservative run Cherwell Council ignoring the views of it’s own established market traders? Why are they proposing moves that could potentially irreparably damage trade in such an established and once vibrant local fixture?\nBanbury market should be seen by Cherwell Council as an asset to the town. They should be supporting it actively and engaging with the traders and customers to find ways of safeguarding the it’s future, rather than taking unilateral actions with no consultation.\nThis is a Charter Market, which bestows on Banbury the status of a Market Town. By birthright it should be located in the Market Square.\nI would urge Cherwell councillors to do what I did. Take a walk around the market and speak to the people whose livelihoods are in their hands. Speak also to the local residents and patrons of the market and ask them what they think about the priorities that they are planning to enforce on everyone.\nThis is not a decision that can be taken just by moving squares on a map.",

Elections after this one are most likely to be associated with the new Unitary Authority which will be formed in Oxfordshire, although currently exactly what form that will take is unclear.\nThe option preferred by the Greens is one of 2 unitaries formed from Cherwell District, West Oxfordshire District and The City Councils with a second one formed around South Oxon and the Vale plus West Berkshire. We feel that would keep decision making as local as possible as well as ensuring that councillors don’t become too remote from the people they represent. The County Council Cabinet recently voted to push forward their preferred option of one huge council across the whole of the County, while the City Council are proposing they form their own Unitary Council by absorbing areas around them such as Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke. I would certainly strongly oppose that, as, I believe, would most of the residents in those areas!\nThe outcome of all these options could largely be driven by those people elected to the County Council tomorrow, so not only is it important to vote because it may be your last opportunity, it’s also doubly important that you get a councillor who is going to represent your views on what your future council may look like.\nOf course my advice is to vote Green at least in areas where you already have a Green Councillor such as the two new Divisions in Kidlington which make up nearly 80% of the area I currently represent on the County Council. As I can’t be in 2 places at once I have decided to stand in the new East Division because I am involved in several ongoing issues there, Not least the proposed football stadium and the huge Oxford North development. But my fellow Green Councillor Fiona Mawson is standing in the other part, now called Kidlington West even though 2 thirds of it comprises Yarnton and Begbroke. As the only candidate in this election that actually lives in that new division, I’m hopeful that she will get a good reception from voters.\nto show Green and Conservative representation\nCurrently the whole of the Kidlington East area is represented by me as the County Councillor and by me, Fiona and Linda Ward as District councillors. I’d like to think we’ve done a good job of representing the everyone there, we all certainly work hard to achieve that, so I hope I will receive your support in the East whilst Fiona is elected to replace me in the West.\nIt’s a rather complicated scenario , especially given that the whole set up is likely to change in 2 or 3 years so neither of us are likely to see out a full term as County Councillors, but in the meantime it’s important that both areas keep consistent Green representation so that work I and Fiona have started on things like ensuring development proposals are beneficial to the area can continue into the next few years, along with our input into the re-shaping of local government over the next 2 years.\nHowever you vote (and I hope it will be Green) do make sure you vote. It may be the only chance you get to make a decision that affects you and your local community for the next few years.\nIf you need any further information from me or Fiona please let us know. We have knocked on a lot of doors over the past few months, so if we missed you we’d be happy to talk.",

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_travel/content_28.html": "I wrote this post back in 2023 and not much has changed since.\nAs we approach another County Council election (probably the last), the Conservatives are declaring a “pothole emergency” presumably reflecting the climate emergency declarations of a few years ago. But it didn’t seem to be that much of an emergency in 2019 when they were in control of the County Council. Back then they were even worse and had been getting that way for decades.\nThe truth is that no council, regardless of political control, ever receives enough funding to fix the roads properly. The reason is that it would cost BILLIONS to do it really well and no government has ever committed to that. Our roads have been allowed to get worse year on year because no government wants to commit to the costs of fixing them properly. Why would they when local councils can take the brunt of the criticisms for them?\nNo council wants to see potholes. They are a very visible problem that nearly everyone experiences and every councillor and council officer would like to see gone. Of course we’d all like to have the unlimited funding that would be required to fix them, but it’s just not there at the moment. That, coupled with fact that we’re all driving much heavier vehicles than the roads were designed for (plus the increase in HGV traffic) means our roads take a hammering 24 hours a day. Add in the weather extremes we see now and it’s little wonder they break up.\nBut it’s not a recent problem. The Tories may say they will fix it, but they didn’t seem to be able to do so in 2019 when Oxfordshire was ranked 5th worse in the country for the number of potholes as can be seen from the attached article in my post from 2023.\nSo let’s get serious about this issue and stop using it as the proverbial political football every time an election rolls around. Potholes are always going to be with us until central government takes proper responsibility for maintaining our road network, rather than insisting on us building even more roads that we won’t be given the money to maintain. The more roads we build, the bigger and more costly the problem will get. Until governments make that connection, there’s not going to be a long-term solution.\nWe all also need to take personal responsibility for the way our roads are treated. High torque acceleration from traffic lights, on corners or near traffic calming areas such as speed humps will simply tear the road surface up. Our roads are not indestructible, certainly not when we’re all driving heavier cars with 4 wheel drive or more and more of us are buying things online that need to be delivered by heavier vans and trucks. Climate change also plays a part as heavier rainfall and sudden cold snaps play havoc with road surfaces.\nYes our roads need to be properly attended to, but until there’s a national political consensus on that, along with an ongoing commitment to proper funding from national governments, potholes will always be with us to a lesser or greater degree, and any political party that tells you different is just avoiding the holes in their own arguments.\nI’ve done my best to get potholes fixed in my division over the past 4 years but it is like playing a game of of whack-a-mole. You get one fixed and another 2 pop up somewhere else. Whilst I agree there needs to be better quality control on the standard of repairs, simply filling the holes will never solve the problem as any hole is always going to be a point of weakness in the future. In reality there are many roads in the county that need to be completely re-laid, but if the money is spent on that, it’s not there to fix areas elsewhere.\nIt’s a juggling act that will be made better over the next 2 years as OCC have committed nearly £39m to a 2 year road improvement programme. That will help matters (and they have been getting better over the past 4 years despite what the Tories might say in their leaflets), But that sort of funding is still small beer compared to what we need to spend, and that need is getting bigger every year.\nWhat I think is really needed is a pothole summit where councils, residents, motoring organisations, haulage and delivery companies, civil engineers and of course, national government can come together to work on a solution. All the time we simply blame each other every time there’s an election, there’s never going to be the long term solution that we desperately need.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_type_gallery_page_2/content_338.html": "So the day is finally here. The chance to vote to end 14 years of Tory misrule and see change. But is it really?\nTwo parties are saying they would provide change, but only one is offering REAL change and REAL hope – The Green Party.\nThe Labour Party slogan ‘Change’ is so reductive and self fulfilling it’s almost worthless as an electoral ambition. Will Labour provide change? Well yes, if they’re elected as the majority government we will see a change by definition. Where there was once Rishi Sunak, there will be Keir Starmer. A clear change of leader and administration, but is that all we want? Will we see REAL change? I rather doubt it.\nLabour’s manifesto suggests otherwise with so many policies seemingly just a continuation of what we have with the Tories. Things like the Bedroom Tax, The Two Child Benefit cap, a continuation of the oil and gas drilling licences granted by the Conservatives, including the highly questionable Rosebank. None of that will change and neither will things like private provision in the NHS or a really progressive tax regime.\nSo what real change will we see with Labour, or any of the other parties for that matter? It looks like the only thing that will be changing will be the climate!\nEven the Liberal Democrats haven’t really committed to change on important things like tax reform or tuition fees which of course they were instrumental in bringing in. Their candidate in Bicester & Woodstock is a well meaning guy, but he was also an adviser to the coalition government during the first period of austerity, as was the Conservative candidate, so not much change for the better there!\nCan I win in Bicester and Woodstock? That depends on you, the voters. It’s a circular argument that Greens can’t win so we don’t get votes, but if we don’t get votes we can’t win. But even if I don’t win my purpose is still to raise more awareness of the Green Party and our values. A party I’ve supported for 12 years and voted for for even longer, back when they were even more unlikely to be elected. Since then there’s been a huge surge in support for Greens, something I’ve seen first hand after being elected to 5 different councils as a Green and re-elected to one of those since.\nIf the Green Party didn’t exist and people hadn’t voted for them, do you think the other parties would have taken any notice of climate change or other Green issues? I very much doubt it and that’s even more obvious now that parties like Labour and the Conservatives are backing away from their climate change commitments because to stick by them is electorally inconvenient.\nSo the Greens have brought about real change over the past decade and will continue to push for more in the coming years, especially as we are looking set to at least triple our representation in Westminster. Change on things like the NHS, social care, social security, justice, equal rights, animal welfare, nature recovery, climate change and so much more.\nI’d of course love to be one of those parliamentarians helping to make those changes, as our new MPs will do through careful lobbying and internal pressure on whomever is in power by the end of this week. But I know that’s unlikely. But every vote for me and every other Green candidate still counts. It counts as part of the message the whole country needs to send to Westminster, even more so as the ruling party is likely to have a majority so large that they probably won’t be in the mood to listen to anyone else.\nBut I have faith that Greens will always find a way to move the needle and work for positive change. And I’ll continue to do that whatever happens in the polls on Thursday. I’m content to play a role, no matter how small in helping to make the future a brighter place for the next generation. Your vote can help me and every other Green candidate to do that, so I hope you’ll give that thought some serious consideration when you mark that cross on the ballot sheet.\nThe polls suggest that the outcome to this election is a foregone conclusion. Labour will comfortably win a huge majority and in Bicester & Woodstock the Lib Dems will romp home. If nothing else people will vote for them just to stop them sending any more leaflets! So you can safely vote Green, knowing it’s extremely unlikely to change that outcome.\nSo more than ever in this election you can vote with your heart to make real change happen. Change that means more than a different name on the House of Commons letterhead. Otherwise we’ll be right back here in 5 or 10 years time, probably with the Conservatives promising the change that we never really seem to get.\nAs someone else said during this election “If you want change you have to vote for it”. If you want REAL change you have to vote Green!",

They used the City Council’s claims of ‘unmet housing need’ as an excuse to facilitate investment and development opportunities for the university and other large landowners.\nWe begged the council to take a step back from their plans in view of the fact that the City hadn’t published a local plan proving their ‘unmet need’ This would have been a perfect justification, but they refused. So outrageously revisionist to claim it was all Labour’s fault!\nBut this statement in the Oxford Times from the City Council’s Labour leader Susan Brown does place their cards firmly on the table. She would rather continue to focus on economic and business development than provide affordable accommodation for their own needs.\nThere are multiple sites within the boundaries of the city that could be used for medium to high density housing to solve at least the immediate problems for housing the the city centre and in East Oxford. At least 4 of those site are slated for development, predominantly for business use.\nIt’s plain that the council has repeatedly and recklessly pursued economic development instead of housing under the leadership of Bob Price and the new Labour leader intends for this to continue.\nNow their new leader has made it clear that her intention (and presumably Labour’s) is to push that envelope even further. Increase business development in the city (even though unemployment there is virtually zero) and press district councils to plough up their green spaces and destroy natural habitat to build houses to fulfil their needs.\nPresumably Ms Brown is also happy to see the city export it’s obscenely high levels of pollution and appalling air quality into the green areas around her ever expanding empire like some post-apocalyptic behemoth, consuming everyone and everything in its path.\nThat’s not a vision of sustainability or quality of life I see as particularly attractive for anyone.\nYes we need to build houses, but they need to be the right houses in the right places. If Oxford city want to deal with their own housing crisis (assuming that is proven in their own yet to be completed local plan) then the right place for housing is within their own confines. At least it is before the expect other areas to cover their backsides!\nIt was good to see Labour members on Cherwell District Council supporting campaigners in defending our precious green belt, but they really do need to have a word with their colleagues on the city council and get them to set their own house in order, literally!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_planning_page_3/content_339.html": "At last week’s full council meeting of Cherwell District Council, councillors unanimously passed a climate change emergency motion calling on leader Barry Wood to report back to the council in six months on progress made on several environmental objectives for Cherwell.\nAs Cherwell’s only Green councillor I supported the motion with some reservations about the council’s true commitment to the difficult decisions that will need to be taken if the district is going to become truly carbon neutral by 2030.\nAs if to prove that point the council then went on to debate my motion calling for a rethink on plans to build on green belt in south Cherwell.\nThe motion, seconded by Libdem councillor Conrad Copeland, asked for a temporary pause to allow for new evidence to be taken into account that casts doubt on the number of houses needed to support Oxford’s unmet need – the justification for Cherwell’s partial review of its local plan.\nI also raised concerns about the amount of expansion being tacitly agreed to for the Begbroke Science Park that also encompasses large areas of Yarnton. In my opinion, this has been slipped into the review under false pretences, given that this has nothing to do with housing need in Oxford. As a result there’s mounting local criticism of the university’s ambitions to commandeer at least 1000 of the houses intended to meet Oxford’s needs for its own use as part of a new campus at Begbroke and Yarnton.\nChair of the Cherwell Development Watch Alliance, Giles Lewis, spoke in favour of the motion at the packed meeting and read out emails between the council and the university, obtained under and FOI request, that suggested plans to allow the university to expand in the area were already being supported as long ago as 2016.\nThe Labour group on the council then introduced an amendment which blocked any re-consideration of housing need numbers, even though this might mean more houses that were needed would be built on green belt.\nI pointed out that just to offset the amount of carbon produced in building the unaffordable and unneeded houses in the first place would take 572,000 trees over 10 years, or 200 per house, rather than the 1 tree per building that Cllr Wood had suggested during his address on the climate change emergency motion.\nIt’s clear that neither Labour nor the Conservatives are prepared to take the difficult decisions that are needed to combat the climate emergency. Labour were far more concerned not to be seen to be challenging inflated housing need figures proposed by their colleagues on the city council, whist the Conservatives simply want to be facilitators for large wealthy landowners in the area including the university. The location of the housing clearly has more to do with the university’s ambitions than it does with genuine housing allocation priorities. Either way it ends up with unnecessary and unaffordable housing being built that locals will have no access to on the green spaces at the heart of their community. This is a stitch-up perpetrated on the people of south Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Gosford!\nLibdem Councillor and spokesperson for the Progressive Oxfordshire group, Katherine Tyson said “These plans will simply expand the city’s appalling air quality into our rural community. At one point Labour councillor and vice-chairperson of the council Hannah Banfield seemed to suggest that, as Banbury residents had accepted bad air quality as a result of housing development in their area, the people of south Cherwell should just do the same. The argument that one ward coming to peace with poisoning their residents and children doesn’t mean that another ward should also poison their constituents. That’s not good enough for Cherwell residents. It beggars belief that such a comment could be made from a Labour councillor just after we had voted in favour of a climate change emergency motion”\nThe motion to pause the local review pending the outcome of the examination of the city council local plan and to separately consult on the university’s plans in Begbroke and Yarnton was successfully amended by the Labour group to an undertaking to review the allocation sites for the 4400 houses. It was carried by Labour with Conservatives abstaining on the vote. The subsequent motion was defeated by 16 votes to 23.",

These questions are strikingly familiar to anyone who was at the Public Inquiry into Cherwell District Council’s Local Plan Review earlier this year.\nAt the hearing, local campaigners called on Cherwell to delay any further work on the plan to build 4400 houses on prime Green Belt in Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke until the true figures of housing need in Oxford were known.\nCherwell’s local plan review is predicated on a perceived obligation to help meet Oxford City’s housing need. Campaigners against the plans have repeatedly argued that Oxford’s need cannot be quantified until their local plan has been agreed, approved and published. Something the City Council has been slow to progress.\nInstead, District councils have relied on guesswork and a ‘working assumption’ from the Oxfordshire Growth Board (OGB) based on figures in the 2014 Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA). A report that itself has been highly criticised since its publication.\nIn response, the City Council commissioned an update to the SHMA. This demonstrated that the original figures were over-estimates, a conclusion backed by follow up analysis from an independent planning consultant presented to the Cherwell hearing. Both the city and district councils, including Cherwell, have sought to ignore the implications of these reports, but the inconsistencies have not escaped the planning inspector. These include:\n- The fact that figures being used to underpin assumptions of need are now over 8 years old\n- That the 2018 SHMA points to a significantly lower housing need than that shown in the 2014 version and that these figures have not been incorporated into the City’s plan.\n- Inconsistencies in estimated housing capacities in the City’s plan and the ‘Growth Deal’ proposals\n- Suggestions of prescriptive planning policies that preclude development in numerous key areas\n- Concerns over double counting of homeless numbers where new households are ignored\n- Inappropriate market ‘uplifts’ producing around a 30% over-estimate of housing need\nIan Middleton, Cherwell District Council’s new Green councillor said\n“The inspector’s comments are a clear vindication of the position taken by groups opposed to Cherwell’s plans to devastate green spaces in South Cherwell on the basis of an assumed need that has been significantly inflated.\nDuring the public inquiry, Cherwell resolutely refused to listen to calls from myself and MP Layla Moran to delay their plans until the City’s need had been properly established. It’s now clear we were right and the need to suspend Cherwell’s local plan review, regardless of their planning inspector’s verdict, is even more urgent.\nThe assumptions on housing need used by the OGB have now been undermined by 2 independent studies, and a planning inspector. How much more evidence does the council need to admit that their proposals in Kidlington, Begbroke and Yarnton are misguided and woefully unsound?\nIt would be hugely irresponsible for a council to impose such sweeping and irreversible damage on local communities when they know that the data underpinning those plans is at best questionable and at worse completely wrong”\nThe planning inspector is expected to publish his response to the Cherwell Local plan review in the next few weeks.\nYou can see the full text of the planning inspector’s comments and questions on the city council plan here https://www.oxford.gov.uk/downloads/file/6397/ic1_-_inspectors_initial_questions_and_comments_to_occ\nOne thought on “Planning Inspector Raises Doubts Over Oxford City Council’s Housing Figures”",

Greens come from all backgrounds and bring a wealth of experience to the job. Many run their own businesses or have done so in the past, so realise the pressures that are put on to small and medium sized enterprises. I co-founded and ran a large retail operation with branches all over the country, so I have a good insight into the problems now facing our post-Covid high streets.\nMany other councillors have come from academia or the various public sectors or just from the same background as the people they represent. I was born to a working family in East London and grew up in South East London/Kent where I attended a secondary modern school in the 70s.\nBut the one thing that has driven us all to take on the job of a councillor is a desire to make the world a better place for everyone and a willingness to fully represent and work for the people who have put their faith in us by giving us their vote.\nThe Green Party doesn’t operate a party whip. We always remember we are there to represent the people who voted for us, and we will always put people before party.\nAs a District Councillor, I’ve seen first hand how local government can work against the interests of our communities rather than for them.\nParty dogma is the main reason for this with councillors being fiercely whipped, especially by the Conservative leadership. This has resulted in some frankly bizarre outcomes with residents and council tax payers bearing the brunt.\nThe Green Party doesn’t operate a party whip. We always remember we are there to represent the people who voted for us, and we will always put people before party. Green councillors are free to vote how they see fit, which has resulted in far better outcomes for residents.\nFor example it only took one Green County Councillor, working across party lines, to secure 20MPH powers for local councils as part of the ’20 is plenty’ initiative. Of course other parties now claim credit for that great achievement, but we don’t mind, as long as our communities benefit.\nBut it’s on climate change that Greens really lead the way. While we’ve welcomed other parties into the climate awareness fold, they often still don’t get it. They don’t see environmentalism as literally a global issue, preferring to compartmentalise and focus only on their own operations.\nOf course that’s important, but in the midst of an emergency we have to tackle the problem at all levels, not just those that conveniently and comfortably coincide with other priorities such as exponential growth.\nFor all these reasons and many more, voting Green brings positive change for our communities and our planet. Change that’s needed now, before it’s too late.",

Areas near the kerbside are heavily damaged making for an uncomfortable and dangerous ride for cyclists and other road users. Yet repeated requests to the council and reports on Fix My Street have gone unheeded.\nNow, in the wake of increased cycling as a result of the pandemic, cycle lane symbols have appeared on this road on top of the cracks and potholes, with no attempt to repair the long-standing degradation of the road surface.\nOther roads, such as the Bicester Road, have had painted cycle lanes on the main carriageway for some time, but there are also poorly maintained and often blocked by parked cars meaning cyclists have to face oncoming traffic to navigate them. This is particularly bad given that this road has a local school and is also subject to an air quality management area.\nBut I was gobsmacked when I saw the cycling symbol on Yarnton Road. This is a road that I regularly cycle down and it’s a real bone shaker. It’s no exaggeration to say that you have to hang on for dear life as you bounce along the road near the curbs, dodging potholes and cracks. It’s especially dangerous at night.\nThe road forms part of a national cycling route, but you’d never know it to look at the surface of the carriageway. It’s certainly not for the faint-hearted! I couldn’t believe they just slapped a cycle symbol on the road without any attention to its terrible condition.\nIt takes more than a pot of paint and a stencil to create a cycle path. The road surface has to be fit for riders if they are to be encouraged to use it. Even motorists complain about the state of this road. How does the council expect cyclists to cope as they rattle across these severely damaged and uneven surfaces? This is just pure tokenism!\nIt just goes to show how little the council knows or cares about the plight of cyclists in the county. If they really want to encourage more sustainable transport, especially post COVID, they have to take cyclists needs into proper account when carrying out road maintenance rather than literally just painting over the cracks!\nWe need more Green councillors on the county council to take these sorts of issue seriously and deliver real improvements for cyclists, pedestrians and other road users, rather than these half-hearted token gestures from a council devoid of real leadership and direction.",

They’ve lost faith in democracy and I don’t blame them when the same party always wins!\nBut in this election there is the chance for change. I can win this vote in the county elections, as I did in 2019 in the district elections, and Fiona Mawson can win in the district again giving, us 2 Green councillors in the area. But we need everyone to get out there and make their mark.\nI’ve lived in Yarnton for 28 years (along with Fiona) and seen how uninterested our local councils are about what happens to our local villages. There’s no better example of this than the concreting over of our green belt, forced on us by the Conservative led District Council.\nTory councillors will tell you they tried to stop it, but they didn’t speak up at the Public Inquiry because they’re not allowed to defy their party leadership. As your Green councillor, we will work for you. Greens don’t answer to a party whip and we always put people before politics.\nI’ve been opposing the council’s development plans for 4 years and I intend to carry on fighting. Our legal challenge will be heard in June and I hope we’ll win. But whatever happens, we’ll need strong local councillors to look out for our interests on planning applications to ensure that developers deliver on infrastructure , flooding protection and health and education provision.\nBut we need everyone to get out and vote to make that happen. If people don’t vote the status quo usually wins. In Oxfordshire that usually means the Tories, but in recent years things have started to change. In 2019 the Greens went from 2 councillors in Oxfordshire to 12. That has really made a difference across the county and that’s palpable in areas like Kidlington where all of a sudden we’re seeing more investment.\nLabour voters might consider voting Green as the best way of removing the Tory stranglehold on our local government and helping to realise some of our shared social justice aims.\nIf you usually vote for another party, you can vote tactically this time, lending your vote to me and Fiona temporarily just for this election. Libdems should vote Green on this occasion as we’re working together as we have done for the past 3 years now. Labour voters might consider voting Green as the best way of removing the Tory stranglehold on our local government and helping to realise some of our shared social justice aims.\nVoting Conservative, or not voting at all, just sends a message to the ruling groups on both the County and the District that we’re all fine with what they’re doing to our areas. They won’t care if you don’t vote, especially if they don’t think you’d vote for them.\nNot voting is not a protest, it’s the epitome of an empty gesture and plays into the hands of the parties that always win. If you really want to protest then get out there and make your mark, and if possible do it for a party that has a chance of upsetting the applecart.\nIf you usually vote for another party, you can vote tactically this time\nIn Kidlington that’s the Green Party. We made the Conservatives sit up and take notice when we won in 2019 and if we do it again this year (twice!) they can’t fail to get the message that their own actions in these areas have consequences. And what’s more you get active, responsive and engaged councillors into the bargain. Just read a few of the endorsements from local residents for me below.\nPlease don’t waste your vote on Thursday. Use it, and use it to make a difference. Vote Green and see the difference your vote can really make!\nSome of the kind comments I’ve been able to include in my election addresses during this campaign :\n“I have never voted Green before but I have no hesitation in voting for Ian Middleton for our vacant County Council seat. He stands up for our Green Belt and our environment, and for ensuring that we have a future.”\nDavid Brown, Yarnton Resident\n“Ian delivered for the larder for months, sometimes taking 2-3 routes to make sure our community had food and other essentials during the first lockdown. Thereafter Ian was an ardent supporter of community interests and helped advise and establish the larder”\nEmily Connally, Founder of The Cherwell Larder\n“Ian has been fighting against Cherwell’s proposals to build on green belt land in Begbroke and Yarnton since they were first announced. He’s used every opportunity to oppose them and has always looked out for residents. I believe he would make an excellent county councillor and I would trust him to represent my best interests as a resident in the most effective way.”\nKK, Spring Hill resident\n“Ian has been a huge help to us, and really seems to care about issues impacting residents. Very accessible and always willing to lend advice and support.”\nN Donoghue, Kidlington resident\n“Ian has provided valuable help to the residents in our Close by getting involved and by providing ongoing support. It is reassuring to know that when needed, he is approachable and really does take an active interest in his local community”\nG Bishop, Kidlington resident\n“I first met Ian when he was delivering food to my area during lockdown. He didn’t tell me he was a councillor until weeks later. He’s the sort of councillor we need more of. Someone who cares about our community and isn’t out for himself. He’s always thinking of others and works to make our lives more liveable.”\nSteve Norton, Brandon Close",

I believe it is one of the most serious threats we have ever faced. Yet it’s a threat that many people haven’t even heard of.\nThis proposed agreement has implications on a national and global level, particularly the Investor-State Dispute Settlements clause which allows corporations and private companies to take legal action against governments if they pass laws that are regarded as restricting their ability to make profits.\nThis strikes directly at the heart of our democracy, whilst effectively handing over sovereignty of all signature countries to the whim Amongst other things, TTIP also has the potential to force this country to accept genetically modified organisms into our food supply.\nIt loosens banking regulations (as the more stringent US banking laws could be subject to the lighter laws in the UK) and it could threaten jobs as more companies will be able to base their operations in the USA where labour law, employee protection and health and safety are less strictly applied.\nTTIP could also have very serious implication for the NHS in terms of the penetration of public services by private companies. Indeed TTIP could very easily be used to prevent any future moves to stop the creeping privatisation of the NHS as this may be regarded as restrictive by corporations wanting a piece of the action.\nWhilst the Conservatives, Labour and the Libdems have all stated an ambition to ensure the NHS is excluded from TTIP, we have seen no guarantees on this from any quarter.\nMoreover the extremely secretive nature of the treaty and the way it is being negotiated on our behalf behind firmly closed doors, leads me to distrust the ability or even the will of some of our representatives to ensure such exclusions will be applied.\nThe fact that both Labour and the Conservatives have self evidently displayed an ambition to see large parts of the health service and social care hived off to private companies, amid a culture of marketisation and capitulation to private providers, leaves me with very little confidence in a positive outcome for our cherished NHS.\nThe Green Party is firmly committed to blocking TTIP where we are able to, and our MEPs have already expressed deep concern about what appears to be an unavoidable quiescence to this agreement.\nYou might like to read this article by Molly Scott Cato MEP, who was recently allowed into the inner sanctum where the treaty is being drafted. Although as you will see she was sworn to secrecy and was subject to extreme measures to prevent her from recording and/or reporting what she saw. This alone sounds some very loud alarm bells with me! http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/04/secrets-ttip-corporations-not-citizens-transatlantic-trade-deal\nIf I were to be elected, I would most fervently resist the inclusion of the UK within the TTIP treaty and I would also demand that the secret negotiations now being held in Brussels should be openly and frankly reported.\nHonest and open government is our only guarantee that those trusted to look after our interests do so diligently and effectively.",

It’s not only removing vital green infrastructure it’s also going to massively increase congestion on local roads as it creates another 4500 jobs that the city simply doesn’t need, without providing the houses that it does desperately need.\nOxford City Council claims it can’t meet its own affordable housing needs. The Oxford North development demonstrates the reason why. The City Council chooses not to meet that need and instead pushes it on to the surrounding districts such as Cherwell and South Oxfordshire.\nI joined the protest as Wolvercote directly abuts my district council ward in Cherwell and is likely to impact heavily on Kidlington, especially on top of the extra development that is planned for the area around Kidlington, Gosford and Water Eaton, Yarnton and Begbroke, assuming that goes ahead.\nI made a short video giving some of the context which you can watch using this link below.\nThe people of Wolvercote and North Oxford send a message to St Johns College Oxford University\nWe need to stand up against the same brazen greed that is motivating the concreting over of our precious green spaces before it’s too late.

The proposals will be backed by £100M of government funds and will include ‘sustainable’ transport infrastructure, green spaces and new local amenities.\nOn the face of it this could be a boost for Bicester, but I suspect the devil will be in the details.\nMuch of the announcement seems to cover projects that are already in planning or underway. The new railway station for example. There’s also some confusion over if this is to be a re-imagining of the much vaunted eco-village or an entirely new project.\nIt is encouraging however to see that the project is to be built on a brown field site.\nConfusingly, the definition of a ‘garden city’ is being left to the developer’s imaginations with the government saying it doesn’t want to “impose any definition of what garden cities are”. This could likely mean we’ll end up with another estate full of either ‘luxury homes’ that ordinary people can’t afford, or shoe-boxes crammed together to generate maximum profit. That would probably mean any aspirations to provide gardens and green space will go right out the window.\nIf Nick Clegg really wants this to be development different from all the other clone estates thrown up around the country, I’m afraid he’s going to have to nail his colours to some sort of mast and properly define his intentions. But that might prove more difficult than a glib press release full of utopian imagery.\nThere would also need to be a clear vision that the people living in this new ‘city’ will be contributing to the local economy and society as well as working in it. With a train station on the doorstep, such a development could easily become a dormitory for London commuters or a sink hole of buy-to-let properties.\nAffordability will be the key. If these homes are intended for people on middle and lower incomes, then I’d support the idea. But I suspect such values won’t be compatible with what Nick Clegg sees as a ‘garden city’.\nPersonally I’d like to see more genuine thinking along these lines, subject to the above caveats. But ultimately this may all just come to nothing.\nSo many of these big legacy projects either evaporate into the ether once they’ve generated enough headlines, or turn into something very different once the realities of cost, demand and political will begin to bite.\nThere’s a veritable tsunami of these grandiose announcements coming out from government at the moment though. Like the spurious claims for new spending on road infrastructures announced earlier this week, many of them are just old or existing projects being re-launched as new spend to give the impression of a go-ahead administration full of exciting possibilities for the future.\nAnyone would think there was an election round the corner!",

It has serious environmental and quality of life issues for all of us, but particularly for those of us who live in areas that sit on top of these deposits. Unfortunately for us, that included large areas of North Oxford and Cherwell.\nFracking has been sold as being the answer to the UK’s energy problems, but in areas like the USA where it’s been widely used, this has not been proved to be the case. What has been shown is that it contaminates water supplies and creates huge amounts of noise and disruption for local residents. It’s also been implicated as the cause land movements and in some cases actual earthquakes. Indeed when the first test drill was sunk in the UK near Blackpool, they experienced one of the strongest earth tremors recorded in the area in decades.\nThe main process involves drilling large bore holes, often sideways underneath properties not owned by the drilling companies (as right that has now been granted to them by the government) and pumping a cocktail of water and up to 90 different chemicals, many of them highly toxic, into the ground under immense pressure. This cracks the rock and releases trapped gas. The water is then recycled back into the normal water system where it’s treated and used again. That is apart from the water that leaks into local water courses and along with some of chemicals and the gas.\nIf you want to see how this process affects local people watch the film Gasland and Gasland 2, clips of which are available on YouTube.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZe1AeH0Qz8\nAnother main method is something called underground coal gasification, which involved drilling into coal seams and then setting them alight. The controlled burn then generates coal gas which is extracted. This process is often hard to control and becomes every bit as horrific as it sounds. This is the type of extraction that we could see being used in areas like Bloxham which sits on large coal deposits.\nA national pressure group has also been set up called ‘Frack Off’. They recently released a short video that explains what we may see in our area if fracking is allowed to go ahead.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYniYtJEeeI\ngovernment’s presumption against fracking in designated areas, such as national parks, goes to show that the Coalition recognises that hydraulic fracking will harm the environment and presents significant risks.\nThe Green Party calls on the government to offer all communities the same protection from dirty and dangerous fracking and shift energy policy focus instead towards clean, renewable energy sources and energy conservation.\nThe latest bidding process for licenses to extract shale gas from large parts of the UK is under way. The government is also proposing to pay large amounts of money to local councils that support fracking, regardless of local residents wishes.\nAbout half the UK is open to exploration, but tightened rules cover areas of outstanding beauty and large areas of Cherwell. The Green Party is the only mainstream political party fighting to stop fracking being pushed through by a government which consistently puts corporate profit over people.\nCaroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, said:\n“While the Government has signalled an intention to ensure some protective measures, we can have little confidence in promises of a robust regulatory framework.\n“We know fracking can cause water contamination and shortages, as well as air and soil pollution. And this is an industry that’s made a catalogue of errors already. But legitimate concerns over its very real environmental and health risks are falling on deaf ears.\n“By seeking to lock us ever-more firmly into fossil fuel dependence the Government is turning a blind eye to reason. It’s crystal clear that we need to be shifting to clean, renewable energy sources.\n“We need a rapid shift to a zero carbon economy and that is not going to happen by pouring resources into establishing an entirely new fossil fuel industry.”\nAs your MP I would fight tooth and nail to prevent our wonderful communities and countryside from being torn apart by this ‘bottom of the barrel’ technology. The Green Party is the only major party standing up against these proposals and we need support of local communities to help us stop these wells from being set up before it’s too late.

None of this is new, or unusual, or even un-democratic, but it does take some getting used to.\nBut watching the BBC election special on the Rochester and Strood by-election, you could be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the political world has turned into some kind of wife swapping party from the mid 70s. It seems these days that political manoeuvring between the ruling parties has moved beyond juggling their own family jewels, and has been reduced to chucking their keys into the fruit bowl with anyone who fancies a quick fumble with their majority.\nFirstly we had UKIP’s Deputy Chairperson Suzanne Evans being interviewed about where her party would go after the predicted win in Rochester. This consisted of a serious of nods and winks about who might and might not leap out of their own party bed and sneak into theirs when the neighbours weren’t looking. A sort of Carry-On Westminster, but with less laughs.\nShe then went on to explain, with barely concealed glee, that her fondest ambition was to seduce someone from Labour to join in their little tryst. Nigel is apparently talking to a couple of MPs but she couldn’t reveal more. She did everything but tap the side of her nose, elbow Andrew Neil in the ribs and give a little Babs Windsor giggle.\nThen we had an analysis from a political expert explaining how UKIP’s performance in the by-election would determine how other sitting MPs would behave in the run up to next years general election. His premise was that if UKIP did well in Rochester, many other career politicians would be considering their position in the next few months. The expectation is apparently that if they think UKIP is a better bet for them to hold on to their seat (ooh matron!), then they would switch allegiances in order to do so.\nNow you’ll have to excuse me. I’m quite new to this game. But when one joins a party isn’t there something about ideology written into the contract? Or am I now being ridiculously naive?\nJudging by the behaviour of at least two recent pantheons of British democracy I suppose I am. It seems that standing on a platform with a bunch of like minded individuals in the hope of doing something good for the country isn’t what it’s about any more.\nNo, apparently it’s more about hanging on to the House Of Commons parking place, the expense account, and access to the House of Commons bar, rather than the boring stuff like philosophical conviction. Some back-benchers are evidently more interested in maintaining a comfortable position for themselves, rather than for their constituents. Yet, in true British carry-on style, they still keep getting elected.\nAs a newcomer to this world, I saw with fresh eyes last night these four sombre suited politicians sitting uneasily with each other, smugly carving up the political cake amongst themselves. Like children at birthday party trying to decide who gets the last portion of jelly and ice cream, the polemic was about anything other than the issues that this country and the planet really face.\nIain Duncan Smith spent a good deal of his time justifying a particularly vituperative campaign poster that portrayed the idea of voting for Mark Reckless as on a par with seeking Pol Pot as a spiritual adviser. Reckless used to be an investment banker, he didn’t live in the area, he’d only moved there to take a safe seat. All very salient points for the local electorate, but ones that seemed exquisitely irrelevant when he was the Conservative MP only a few months ago.\nMeanwhile UKIP expounded their claim that they listened to the people, and were offering an alternative to the status quo of careerist politicians who’d never done a days honest labour in their lives. Odd then that their success last night, and in Clacton a few weeks ago, relied on exactly the reverse of those ideals by welcoming with open arms two MPs firmly rooted in the rotten political establishment they claimed to despise.\nOn the point of principle I am in total agreement with them. The current political establishment has reduced democracy to the level of swapping football cards in the playground. But it’s a tawdry game of top trumps that they have just as much of a hand in as all the other entrenched Westminster parties.\nIf this is the future of politics in this country, I’m glad to be a member of a party that currently stands as an exemplar of how it is still possible to operate democratically without playing these cynical games. We may now have one less MP than UKIP, but at least ours is there on merit, rather than because she swapped her rosette for a more appealing colour.\nAnd Caroline Lucas has just won MP of the year, which is something that gives me hope. Even so, she’s now the focus of a campaign to unseat her by the Labour party in Brighton, because, and despite of the fact, that Labour and the Greens share many of the same aims.\nMoreover, if all these people care about is hanging on to their positions at all costs, what really is the point? And if the electorate is so fickle that they can’t see through this charade, maybe we deserve the graceless, flagitious mess they all seem to be making of the world.\nOne apocryphal anecdote from Rochester I heard today was that someone had voted UKIP because the sitting Tory MP hadn’t done enough for the local area. If that’s true, it’s an indictment of the great British voter more demoralising than anything supposedly implied by hanging a flag out of the window of your mock-Georgian semi.\nBut as an accidental politician I have to hope that it isn’t true, or at least typical. I have to trust that people in the UK will see past all the identikit politicos, the vested interests and the horse trading of their democratic heritage, and vote for real change and genuine representation in the next government.\nI am ever the optimist.",

Areas near the kerbside are heavily damaged making for an uncomfortable and dangerous ride for cyclists and other road users. Yet repeated requests to the council and reports on Fix My Street have gone unheeded.\nNow, in the wake of increased cycling as a result of the pandemic, cycle lane symbols have appeared on this road on top of the cracks and potholes, with no attempt to repair the long-standing degradation of the road surface.\nOther roads, such as the Bicester Road, have had painted cycle lanes on the main carriageway for some time, but there are also poorly maintained and often blocked by parked cars meaning cyclists have to face oncoming traffic to navigate them. This is particularly bad given that this road has a local school and is also subject to an air quality management area.\nBut I was gobsmacked when I saw the cycling symbol on Yarnton Road. This is a road that I regularly cycle down and it’s a real bone shaker. It’s no exaggeration to say that you have to hang on for dear life as you bounce along the road near the curbs, dodging potholes and cracks. It’s especially dangerous at night.\nThe road forms part of a national cycling route, but you’d never know it to look at the surface of the carriageway. It’s certainly not for the faint-hearted! I couldn’t believe they just slapped a cycle symbol on the road without any attention to its terrible condition.\nIt takes more than a pot of paint and a stencil to create a cycle path. The road surface has to be fit for riders if they are to be encouraged to use it. Even motorists complain about the state of this road. How does the council expect cyclists to cope as they rattle across these severely damaged and uneven surfaces? This is just pure tokenism!\nIt just goes to show how little the council knows or cares about the plight of cyclists in the county. If they really want to encourage more sustainable transport, especially post COVID, they have to take cyclists needs into proper account when carrying out road maintenance rather than literally just painting over the cracks!\nWe need more Green councillors on the county council to take these sorts of issue seriously and deliver real improvements for cyclists, pedestrians and other road users, rather than these half-hearted token gestures from a council devoid of real leadership and direction.",

They used the City Council’s claims of ‘unmet housing need’ as an excuse to facilitate investment and development opportunities for the university and other large landowners.\nWe begged the council to take a step back from their plans in view of the fact that the City hadn’t published a local plan proving their ‘unmet need’ This would have been a perfect justification, but they refused. So outrageously revisionist to claim it was all Labour’s fault!\nBut this statement in the Oxford Times from the City Council’s Labour leader Susan Brown does place their cards firmly on the table. She would rather continue to focus on economic and business development than provide affordable accommodation for their own needs.\nThere are multiple sites within the boundaries of the city that could be used for medium to high density housing to solve at least the immediate problems for housing the the city centre and in East Oxford. At least 4 of those site are slated for development, predominantly for business use.\nIt’s plain that the council has repeatedly and recklessly pursued economic development instead of housing under the leadership of Bob Price and the new Labour leader intends for this to continue.\nNow their new leader has made it clear that her intention (and presumably Labour’s) is to push that envelope even further. Increase business development in the city (even though unemployment there is virtually zero) and press district councils to plough up their green spaces and destroy natural habitat to build houses to fulfil their needs.\nPresumably Ms Brown is also happy to see the city export it’s obscenely high levels of pollution and appalling air quality into the green areas around her ever expanding empire like some post-apocalyptic behemoth, consuming everyone and everything in its path.\nThat’s not a vision of sustainability or quality of life I see as particularly attractive for anyone.\nYes we need to build houses, but they need to be the right houses in the right places. If Oxford city want to deal with their own housing crisis (assuming that is proven in their own yet to be completed local plan) then the right place for housing is within their own confines. At least it is before the expect other areas to cover their backsides!\nIt was good to see Labour members on Cherwell District Council supporting campaigners in defending our precious green belt, but they really do need to have a word with their colleagues on the city council and get them to set their own house in order, literally!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2023_05/content_201.html": "Yesterday evening saw the resumption of the adjourned Cherwell AGM after members failed to reach agreement on a leader and a controlling group last week.\nAfter a second vote where only votes in favour could be counted, Barry Wood was elected to lead a minority Conservative administration after Labour pulled out of an alliance deal that was close to being finalised with the Lib Dems, Greens and Independents. Greens did not vote in favour of either the Conservatives or an unworkable Labour minority administration.\nThe deal had been all but agreed and a press statement signed off by all parties when, in a surprise announcement last Tuesday, Labour said that their National executive had vetoed the arrangement and wouldn’t allow the alliance to be ratified with a Green member on the executive. As the Greens formed slightly more than 10% of the proposed alliance it was reasonable for them to expect one executive position on a 10 person committee. It was proposed that they would take the Environment portfolio.\nAs a result, no agreement could be reached over who would lead the council and the meeting was adjourned to give negotiations one more try. Labour subsequently refused to return to the negotiating table and instead added to their list of demands which further undermined the deal.\nSpeaking after the meeting Green Group Leader and Deputy Leader of the Progressive Oxfordshire Group Ian Middleton said :\n“Greens are bitterly disappointed that we have not been able to fulfil our promise to the electorate and take joint control of the council from the Conservatives. We apologise to residents for that but Labour made it impossible to agree an equitable deal that they would have been a significant part of with 50% of the Executive seats. We only asked for one seat on a 10 seat executive which was proportionate in view of us making up slightly more that 10% of the total alliance.\nHaving originally agreed to this arrangement, Labour suddenly pulled the plug citing diktats from their National Executive which local members have capitulated to. Considering this will also cut Labour out of an alliance as well as joint leadership of the council, this seems incredibly short-sighted.\nIt seems Labour would rather allow a minority of 20 Conservatives to stay in control of the council than accept one Green on the executive. They also demanded that Labour should be leader, which none of the Progressive Oxfordshire Group were comfortable with considering Cllr Woodcock’s disingenuous statements in the media surrounding the collapse of talks.\nWe were faced with impossible demands from Labour whose faceless National Executive committee are dictating to local Cherwell residents over who should be in control of their council. Greens strongly support localism, but it seems Labour would rather allow their central office to force a Conservative administration on to our communities.\nGreens have worked hard over the last 5 years, along with the Liberal Democrats and Independents to reduce the Conservative majority to the point where we would have been able to take joint control with Labour. In that time we have taken 13 Conservative seats whilst Labour have only taken 3. With 3 members, the Greens make up the deciding majority and should rightfully have a seat at the table.\nIt’s quite clear that Labour have betrayed the people of Cherwell by focusing on their own political interests rather than those of the electorate. From now on, every terrible decision and policy that the Conservatives push through can be laid at the feet of Labour. Every appalling injustice imposed on our community as a result of Conservative control can be traced back to this moment.\nGreens will now be part of a strong opposition on CDC rather than in an unstable alliance with Labour. We will continue work along with our Liberal Democrat and Independent colleagues in the spirit of co-operation that Labour have rejected and hold the Conservatives to account as part of a strengthened official opposition.\nWe are confident that together we can win enough additional seats next year to take control without Labour’s help and will do so at the first opportunity. The door is still open for Labour to come to their senses and agree a fair deal with us to take control of the council at any point during the year. In the meantime the Conservatives plans, including further green belt erosion as part of their local plan and a lack of genuine affordable housing will be resisted to the best of our ability. We hope Labour will at least join us in supporting that endeavour”",

As usual we weren’t invited to the BBC party. There were however representatives from Labour, Conservative, Libdems and UKIP.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2015_01_14_oxford-finally-flips-the-switch-on-the-onoff-shopping-centre/content_406.html": "After what seems like centuries of wrangling, planning applications, withdrawn projects, hand shaking and head banging, Oxford is finally set to join other cities with a giant shiny shopping centre nobody really needs any more.\nHaving experienced the damage that these behemoths can do to small local retailers, myself included, this is a moment I and many others have dreaded.\nThe council of course has applied a heavy spin on the whole project, whilst ushering the developers and large multi-nationals into the city with wide-eyed certainty that a new shopping centre will solve all the problems we now have.\nWe know at least one of those problems – that of affordable housing in the city centre – won’t even be dented by this grandiose project. In a move that is frankly baffling from a socialist led council, planners have dashed all hopes that the accommodation element designed into the revamped centre would be for social housing or affordable homes. Whilst Green councillors opposed this move, others apparently felt that poorer people won’t be able to keep the new apartments up to the standards they expect to be demanded.\nSo no comfortable inner-city pied-à-terres for the ordinary folk of Oxford then. Which is a shame considering Oxford City Council provided virtually nothing for that sector last year, despite claims that this was a priority policy.\nJobs are not the only thing to consider\nJudging by the analyses carried out over the past 10 years it looks highly likely that the new Westgate extension in Oxford will have a significant impact on other retail destinations both in the immediate vicinity and county wide.\nThe council has claimed that 3400 jobs will be created by the opening of the new centre, which seems like a rather optimistic number to me. Even if one accepts that figure, previous analyses have suggested that the number of jobs created will be far outweighed by those that will be destroyed elsewhere in the city and the surrounding areas.\nIt’s very easy to focus just on the number of jobs created, but when similar centres have opened there have been many casualties in other areas. This doesn’t even take into account the damage that’s likely to be done to trade during the building and infrastructure works and the impact of additional competition for small retailers that attracting large multi-nationals into the area will provide.\nIn an era where many retail chains are looking to reduce their portfolios, the time for this centre has been and gone. There’s already plenty of retail space in Oxford city centre, some of it lying vacant even now. Until the council addresses the systemic issues with people visiting the city, such as parking, local transport and city centre management, a revamped shopping centre isn’t going to add that much prosperity to a town encircled by much better alternatives.\nThe new shopping centre will likely have some novelty value for a few months, but once the realities of trading in Oxford begin to bite, I doubt it’ll be anything more than another usual-suspect clone-town brand zoo.\nYears of disruption\nAccording to a recent article in the Oxford Mail, a scrutinising committee of city centre councillors are due to meet to discuss ways of keeping businesses alive during the hugely disruptive infrastructure works needed for the new extension.\nSo Oxford City Council wait until AFTER the works have begun to think about how to mitigate the problems that will inevitably be caused by the works?\nAnother great example of the forethought and careful planning we’ve come to expect from our wonderful city council!\nI was at a meeting with both the city and county council leaders over a year ago where I highlighted the potential damage that will be done by the infrastructure works required for the Westgate extension. Having already experienced the same in Bristol a few years before, it was clear to me and many others that the likely upheaval required for the Westgate works were going to do more damage than they were likely to be worth in the current climate.\nSeems like it all fell on deaf ears. As usual.\nEmpty shops\nMy business in Cornmarket Street closed it’s doors for the last time after 20 years last year. Despite numerous pronouncements in the press that the city council was eager to support local businesses, we got zip-all support, even after asking on several occasions. Indeed, at one point their planning department were very close to scuppering the only deal we could achieve to sell the store. Had they not done a last minute U-turn there would have been one more empty and un-lettable shop in the city centre.\nCouncillors are also now apparently worried about the growing number of empty shops in the city, despite previous claims that there were queues of businesses eager to take space. Perhaps news has started to filter out that retailing in Oxford is not what it once was?\nIn that context one has to wonder who is going to populate the new cathedral of consumption when it is finally completed, and for those that do take up residence, what kind of trading environment will they find? With 40% of retail leases across the country coming up for renewal at the end of this year, it really does beg the question about how much space will be required when the Westgate centre is completed in 2017. Moreover what will the rest of the city look like once all the remaining viable stores have de-camped into the waiting warmth of a lovely new mall?\nWith council plans to push up the cost of parking YET AGAIN and the negative impact of roadworks, and the city centre looking like a building site, it’s likely most consumers will continue to go elsewhere to shop, surrounded as we are by much more attractive and easily reached locations around the city and the county. And once again, experience tells me that once people find better alternatives, they’re unlikely to return, other than for a quick nose around the new development.\nA committee composed of councillors with absolutely no idea how businesses in Oxford operate, setting out to ‘examine’ how to deal with these issues now, is tantamount to closing the door after the horse has bolted, lived out it’s natural life and ended up in a dog food tin. This project as has been in the planning stages for so many years it’s truly staggering that the implications are only being discussed now.\nOxford is of course known as the city of ‘dreaming spires’. It seems that in terms of strategic planning, many of our councillors have also been asleep on the job.\nGreeat blog post\nLikeLike",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_page_9/content_409.html": "Cherwell District Council announced it’s budget last week detailing £4.4m in cuts and extra charges that it will be imposing on the residents of Cherwell as well as an increase in council tax.\nDuring the budget debate I raised my concerns that around a third of these cuts and charges were as a result of losses incurred over the past two years in Banbury\nIn a nutshell the centre is predicted to make a loss of around £1.6m in the 21/22 financial year after having made a similar loss in 20/21. On a broader scale, taking into account some small gains in the first 2 years the council owned the development, it will have racked up losses in the region of £2.5m by the end of the next financial year if the current predictions are correct. To close the gap left by that hole in the budget there have been additional service cuts with around a third of those in the forthcoming budget directly attributable to pressures from Castle Quay.\nYou may have seen some of this in the press this week in Oxford Mail and the Banbury Guardian\nI was also interviewed by BBC Radio Oxford, although my section was recorded and heavily edited, after which Cllr Tony Ilot ,the Lead Member for Financial Management & Governance on Cherwell District Council, was invited on the show live to respond. If we’d been on at the same time I might have pointed out that as the councillor responsible for this development it would have been more encouraging had he bothered to do his homework before coming on. At one point he seemed uncertain about how much the losses amounted to (he guessed at £1.3m and the interviewer had to correct him that it was £1.6m) and he also claimed that the £1.6m was a cumulative loss since the council took ownership. It’s not, it’s just the predicted loss for the forthcoming year on top of a similar one for the last year. You’d think the Lead Member for Financial Management & Governance might have been a little more cognisant of the situation given the scale of problem, but this lack of concern over important details is a familiar theme with Cherwell’s Conservatives.\nCllr Ilot also seemed quite laid back about the fact that the centre is now worth less than half what was paid for item having lost a whopping £30m in value. They are also currently spending even more than the original purchase price for the shopping centre on the canal side extension which, as a retail analyst myself, I think they are going to struggle to make a return on.\nYou can listen to the interview in full here\nThe council’s line on this has been that the losses at CQ have not directly resulted in an increase in the council tax. As that increase was already in the pipeline anyway that’s probably fair to say, but it also fair to say that if this white elephant wasn’t providing such a huge financial drag on the council’s resources, we may not have needed to increase the tax and we certainly wouldn’t have need many of the cuts in services.\nIt will be interesting to see how much support we get for the high street in Kidlington and the Exeter Close project in the light of all this. Certainly something we can point them to if they start penny-pinching on our project to support the eye-watering amounts of public money that’s being poured into one scheme in the far north of the district that we’re all footing the bill for.",

From my first proper job as a Saturday boy in a menswear store in Lewisham through my days as a market trader in Camden Lock and Greenwich to being co-founder of a national high street chain that started with a small store in Oxford selling silver jewellery. and grew into a national chain trading in 6 of country’s major retail locations, including London’s prestigious Covent Garden.\nIn that time I saw almost as many ups as I did downs. I’ve half jokingly said that I spent 20 years building the business and then another 10 trying extricating it from the failing high street. Like so many other retailers who entered the high street during the boom years in the early 1990s, I fell foul of the simultaneous boom in commercial property development. So many new malls were opened in the 90s and early 2000s it was difficult to keep up and I opened stores in some of the most iconic examples such as the New Bullring in Birmingham and Bluewater in Kent.\nThe other boom at the time was in business rates, which along with rents skyrocketed through that period as institutional landlords, mostly backed by large pension funds, cashed in on the retail bubble ploughing millions into new shiny malls based on the emerging US model. It was great while it lasted and we all became caught up in the heady days of seemingly limitless opportunities. But we soon discovered there were limits.\nThe Financial crash in 2008 gave us all a pretty sharp reality check and things soon started to become far less buoyant and rents that had been agreed on the back of rude profit margins started to look far less tenable as turnovers started to fall.\nThere soon followed a series of frantic rounds of renegotiation with landlords who themselves were facing the prospect of huge hole in their new developments as retailers started to fall over with alarming regularity. In many cases we were able to come to mutual agreements to keep us trading at the shopping malls looking full, but the one thing that couldn’t be re-negotiated were business rates. Set as they were, by the central valuation office, and administered by local authorities, they were completely devoid of any chance of concession unless you had an understanding council. In my experience their understanding was rather limited, and after 5 years as a local councillor myself I now understand more about why that was.\nSo we were all caught in a perfect storm that only a few managed to emerge from. My business was one of the luckier ones as I managed to negotiate deals that gave us breathing space. But I could see the writing on the wall and it was telling me to get out of the high street and decamp to the internet where so many of our competitors were lurking. Thereby hangs another very long story.\nBut suffice to say I have an intimate understanding of the plight of the high street, in fact much more intimate than I would prefer. For that reason one of my personal priorities as a fresh faced new MP would be to push for a new system of business rates or local high street taxation. Other things like rent controls and use classes would also be high on the agenda, but none of this will be an easy fix for an industry in the doldrums after so many years in decline. But I know from my own experience that smaller independents are both the lifeblood of local high streets whilst also being the most vulnerable.\nIn terms of the dreaded business rates, I think I could take elements from the land tax approach of the Green party and add in some aspect of a local purchase tax as seen in the USA. Such a tax would be far more progressive and have more respect for the ability of businesses to pay such an additional tax. That would give a far greater connection between the local community, local authorities and the retailers themselves. If all retailers did well then they would all reap the benefits.\nSpeaking to local councillors and retailers about business rates reform\nI don’t really have the answer to full business rates reform, but I’ve been campaigning for a better system for over 10 years. I would advocate a situation where we involved existing high street retailers in the process of finding a solution. There have been past attempts at doing this, but very few, if any, involved small independent retailers. I think that was a mistake.\nThe Labour Party have boldly announced that they would scrap the current business rates system, but they haven’t said what they would replace it with. I’ve been here before many times, and both Labour and the Tories have frequently promised reform but never delivered on that. One of the biggest reason is that business rates are a virtually guaranteed income for government bringing in over £13bn a year. Even if the premises are empty, the landlord cops for the bill so it’s a win-win for Westminster. So any new system is likely to be just as iniquitous and damaging, especially to smaller operators.\nI think there is a way of developing a system of local high street taxation that could benefit all sides of the equation, including the consumer. Just scrapping the business rates system with no plan for what would replace it is not a solution, yet its the current proposal from the part that is most likely to form the next government in a few weeks. If I was in Westminster I’d hope to be able to provide a far better insight into the problems on the high street and how to engage with the people who face those problems every day.\nI’d like to see genuine consultation with high street stakeholders, including landlords and local councils, about the best way forwards. As a long term retailer, having moved from being a small business, through a larger expansion and back to being a ‘born again independent’, I’d like to be involved in that process. But I guess it remains to be seen what the outcome is on July 4th.\nI’ve just published a video I made during a recent visit to Bicester with some thoughts on how we can work towards a better system of high street business taxation and help to repair our broken high streets and you can watch that by clicking here.\nIf you’re a retailer or just someone who enjoys browsing physical shops, I’d suggest you vote for someone like me who has the experience to make that a viable possibility again. Retail is at the heart of every village, town and city and needs political support to make it vibrant again. Many politicians claim to have the answer but few of them have been on the inside of the industry. I think that needs to change. I’d like to change it.",

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_fracking/content_172.html": "Hydraulic Fracturing or ‘Fracking’ is a new unconventional and controversial technique for extracting gas and in some case oil from the deep bedrock. It has serious environmental and quality of life issues for all of us, but particularly for those of us who live in areas that sit on top of these deposits. Unfortunately for us, that included large areas of North Oxford and Cherwell.\nFracking has been sold as being the answer to the UK’s energy problems, but in areas like the USA where it’s been widely used, this has not been proved to be the case. What has been shown is that it contaminates water supplies and creates huge amounts of noise and disruption for local residents. It’s also been implicated as the cause land movements and in some cases actual earthquakes. Indeed when the first test drill was sunk in the UK near Blackpool, they experienced one of the strongest earth tremors recorded in the area in decades.\nThe main process involves drilling large bore holes, often sideways underneath properties not owned by the drilling companies (as right that has now been granted to them by the government) and pumping a cocktail of water and up to 90 different chemicals, many of them highly toxic, into the ground under immense pressure. This cracks the rock and releases trapped gas. The water is then recycled back into the normal water system where it’s treated and used again. That is apart from the water that leaks into local water courses and along with some of chemicals and the gas.\nIf you want to see how this process affects local people watch the film Gasland and Gasland 2, clips of which are available on YouTube.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZe1AeH0Qz8\nAnother main method is something called underground coal gasification, which involved drilling into coal seams and then setting them alight. The controlled burn then generates coal gas which is extracted. This process is often hard to control and becomes every bit as horrific as it sounds. This is the type of extraction that we could see being used in areas like Bloxham which sits on large coal deposits.\nA national pressure group has also been set up called ‘Frack Off’. They recently released a short video that explains what we may see in our area if fracking is allowed to go ahead.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYniYtJEeeI\ngovernment’s presumption against fracking in designated areas, such as national parks, goes to show that the Coalition recognises that hydraulic fracking will harm the environment and presents significant risks.\nThe Green Party calls on the government to offer all communities the same protection from dirty and dangerous fracking and shift energy policy focus instead towards clean, renewable energy sources and energy conservation.\nThe latest bidding process for licenses to extract shale gas from large parts of the UK is under way. The government is also proposing to pay large amounts of money to local councils that support fracking, regardless of local residents wishes.\nAbout half the UK is open to exploration, but tightened rules cover areas of outstanding beauty and large areas of Cherwell. The Green Party is the only mainstream political party fighting to stop fracking being pushed through by a government which consistently puts corporate profit over people.\nCaroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, said:\n“While the Government has signalled an intention to ensure some protective measures, we can have little confidence in promises of a robust regulatory framework.\n“We know fracking can cause water contamination and shortages, as well as air and soil pollution. And this is an industry that’s made a catalogue of errors already. But legitimate concerns over its very real environmental and health risks are falling on deaf ears.\n“By seeking to lock us ever-more firmly into fossil fuel dependence the Government is turning a blind eye to reason. It’s crystal clear that we need to be shifting to clean, renewable energy sources.\n“We need a rapid shift to a zero carbon economy and that is not going to happen by pouring resources into establishing an entirely new fossil fuel industry.”\nAs your MP I would fight tooth and nail to prevent our wonderful communities and countryside from being torn apart by this ‘bottom of the barrel’ technology. The Green Party is the only major party standing up against these proposals and we need support of local communities to help us stop these wells from being set up before it’s too late. Once the process is begun we may all live to regret the fact that we didn’t stand up to be counted when we had the chance.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_by-election-2/content_358.html": "This is a piece I wrote for Huffington Post earlier this week. I think it speaks for itself, although after it was published I thought I should have pointed out that none of the the politicians I refer to in the studio on election night were Greens. As usual we weren’t invited to the BBC party. There were however representatives from Labour, Conservative, Libdems and UKIP. Given that the Greens had a reasonably good showing in the last General Election in Rochester (for a ‘marginal’ party) I’d have thought we’d have been worth a mention at least. But apparently not.\nAnyway I hope this serves as a good first post on my website/blog and you can see the original article here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/westminster-politics_b_6199214.html?utm_hp_ref=tw.\nFeel free to comment below or on the original article on the Huffington Post site.\nI recently became a parliamentary candidate for the Green Party. After years of railing against politicians, the irony, and perhaps the hypocrisy, of becoming one myself has not been lost on me.\nThen again, there were the constant jibes about my complaining a lot but doing nothing positive to make a change. So when my local party group asked me to stand, I said I’d give it a go. And here I am. Feel free to point the finger.\nOne of the first things I’ve noticed about the underbelly of politics is just how strategic it is. Target wards, target seats, candidates standing in constituencies where they don’t live for the sake of political expediency. None of this is new, or unusual, or even un-democratic, but it does take some getting used to.\nBut watching the BBC election special on the Rochester and Strood by-election, you could be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the political world has turned into some kind of wife swapping party from the mid 70s. It seems these days that political manoeuvring between the ruling parties has moved beyond juggling their own family jewels, and has been reduced to chucking their keys into the fruit bowl with anyone who fancies a quick fumble with their majority.\nFirstly we had UKIP’s Deputy Chairperson Suzanne Evans being interviewed about where her party would go after the predicted win in Rochester. This consisted of a serious of nods and winks about who might and might not leap out of their own party bed and sneak into theirs when the neighbours weren’t looking. A sort of Carry-On Westminster, but with less laughs.\nShe then went on to explain, with barely concealed glee, that her fondest ambition was to seduce someone from Labour to join in their little tryst. Nigel is apparently talking to a couple of MPs but she couldn’t reveal more. She did everything but tap the side of her nose, elbow Andrew Neil in the ribs and give a little Babs Windsor giggle.\nThen we had an analysis from a political expert explaining how UKIP’s performance in the by-election would determine how other sitting MPs would behave in the run up to next years general election. His premise was that if UKIP did well in Rochester, many other career politicians would be considering their position in the next few months. The expectation is apparently that if they think UKIP is a better bet for them to hold on to their seat (ooh matron!), then they would switch allegiances in order to do so.\nNow you’ll have to excuse me. I’m quite new to this game. But when one joins a party isn’t there something about ideology written into the contract? Or am I now being ridiculously naive?\nJudging by the behaviour of at least two recent pantheons of British democracy I suppose I am. It seems that standing on a platform with a bunch of like minded individuals in the hope of doing something good for the country isn’t what it’s about any more.\nNo, apparently it’s more about hanging on to the House Of Commons parking place, the expense account, and access to the House of Commons bar, rather than the boring stuff like philosophical conviction. Some back-benchers are evidently more interested in maintaining a comfortable position for themselves, rather than for their constituents. Yet, in true British carry-on style, they still keep getting elected.\nAs a newcomer to this world, I saw with fresh eyes last night these four sombre suited politicians sitting uneasily with each other, smugly carving up the political cake amongst themselves. Like children at birthday party trying to decide who gets the last portion of jelly and ice cream, the polemic was about anything other than the issues that this country and the planet really face.\nIain Duncan Smith spent a good deal of his time justifying a particularly vituperative campaign poster that portrayed the idea of voting for Mark Reckless as on a par with seeking Pol Pot as a spiritual adviser. Reckless used to be an investment banker, he didn’t live in the area, he’d only moved there to take a safe seat. All very salient points for the local electorate, but ones that seemed exquisitely irrelevant when he was the Conservative MP only a few months ago.\nMeanwhile UKIP expounded their claim that they listened to the people, and were offering an alternative to the status quo of careerist politicians who’d never done a days honest labour in their lives. Odd then that their success last night, and in Clacton a few weeks ago, relied on exactly the reverse of those ideals by welcoming with open arms two MPs firmly rooted in the rotten political establishment they claimed to despise.\nOn the point of principle I am in total agreement with them. The current political establishment has reduced democracy to the level of swapping football cards in the playground. But it’s a tawdry game of top trumps that they have just as much of a hand in as all the other entrenched Westminster parties.\nIf this is the future of politics in this country, I’m glad to be a member of a party that currently stands as an exemplar of how it is still possible to operate democratically without playing these cynical games. We may now have one less MP than UKIP, but at least ours is there on merit, rather than because she swapped her rosette for a more appealing colour.\nAnd Caroline Lucas has just won MP of the year, which is something that gives me hope. Even so, she’s now the focus of a campaign to unseat her by the Labour party in Brighton, because, and despite of the fact, that Labour and the Greens share many of the same aims.\nMoreover, if all these people care about is hanging on to their positions at all costs, what really is the point? And if the electorate is so fickle that they can’t see through this charade, maybe we deserve the graceless, flagitious mess they all seem to be making of the world.\nOne apocryphal anecdote from Rochester I heard today was that someone had voted UKIP because the sitting Tory MP hadn’t done enough for the local area. If that’s true, it’s an indictment of the great British voter more demoralising than anything supposedly implied by hanging a flag out of the window of your mock-Georgian semi.\nBut as an accidental politician I have to hope that it isn’t true, or at least typical. I have to trust that people in the UK will see past all the identikit politicos, the vested interests and the horse trading of their democratic heritage, and vote for real change and genuine representation in the next government.\nI am ever the optimist.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_yarnton_page_3/content_411.html": "I’ve stood in every local election since I joined the Green Party in 2012, but this one feels more special.\nHaving been involved in the recent campaign to try to persuade the District Council to think again about it’s review of the local plan, I feel I really have something extra to fight for in this election.\nI wrote a detailed response to the council plans to tear up large swathes of the green belt between Kidlington. Begbroke and Yarnton and plonk 4400 houses in the middle of an area with overloaded roads and infrastructure. A plan that would see the three communities amalgamated into one sprawling conurbation, created not to serve local affordable housing needs, but to supposedly provide housing for workers in the city, even though most of the jobs are based in the east.\nYou can read the full response here\nAs everyone involved knows the oft-touted claims that this will include so-called ‘affordable’ housing is laughable. Valuable green belt land will become ten times more valuable once it becomes ripe for development and the landowners and luxury house builders will stand to make a fortune.\nI along with several others were allowed a five minute representation to the councillors in the chamber, some of whom it was later reported couldn’t even be bothered to listen to those who had come to plead their case. One was even photographed using a mobile phone during the speeches!\nSeeing the lack of connectedness demonstrated by the predominately Conservative council enraged me more than I imagined it would. If you watch the video footage from the planning meeting a few weeks ago you can hear me heckling quite loudly throughout some of speeches from Barry Wood and Colin Clarke.\nNormally I wouldn’t do something like that. They deserve their time to speak just as I and the other campaigners had. But being the last to have their say (as Cllr Wood ensured he would be) they were able to simply brush aside the very salient points raised by protesters and other councillors.\nTory councillor after Tory councillor stood up and gave no logical reason why these plans should be forced through in the face of what everyone recognised was an historic level of opposition from the people in the district they represent.\nOver 1500 responses were given to the plans, nearly all of them objecting to this wanton and unnecessary destruction of our precious green belt. Yet the council seemed oblivious to them, to the cogent arguments put forward by speakers and even to the legal opinions that were presented by the two main campaigning groups.\nThe cavalier attitude of Barry Wood, who I’d previously challenged for seeming to pre-judge the outcome of the consultation, was amply demonstrated when he and his fellow councillors abdicated their responsibility to the people of Cherwell and threw their objections at the feet of the planning inspector.\nHis closing argument was that it was the inspector who would make the final decision not them, even though they were elected to represent us. As I suspected months ago, the council had already made its mind up, and the consultation was simply a box ticking exercise. The fate of our green spaces, our wildlife habitats, our clean air and the distinctiveness of our communities has been thrown into the lap of an outside agency because the Tories on the council didn’t have the guts or the inclination to properly consider the alternatives.\nSo I hope you’ll forgive me some heckling out of pure frustration at the lack of professionalism and respect for democracy being shown by these people.\nThat’s why I want to win this election. I want a guaranteed voice in that chamber so that I can represent the views of the people in Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke – an area that is so remote from that chamber, way up at the other end of the district that people like Barry Wood and Colin Clarke feel it’s safe to throw us all under the bus for the sake of expediency.\nIt’s also why the Green Party in Kidlington is working with the Liberal Democrats in this election to elect me in Kidlington East and Alaric Rose in Kidlington West. You can see our joint statement about that here.\nI hope you’ll give me and Alaric a chance to be a strong voice for you after May 3rd.\nYou can see the full video of the planning meeting (including the heckling) on the Cherwell District Council Website. You can see my speech to the chamber here.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_author_ianmiddleton99_page_2/content_217.html": "So the day is finally here. The chance to vote to end 14 years of Tory misrule and see change. But is it really?\nTwo parties are saying they would provide change, but only one is offering REAL change and REAL hope – The Green Party.\nThe Labour Party slogan ‘Change’ is so reductive and self fulfilling it’s almost worthless as an electoral ambition. Will Labour provide change? Well yes, if they’re elected as the majority government we will see a change by definition. Where there was once Rishi Sunak, there will be Keir Starmer. A clear change of leader and administration, but is that all we want? Will we see REAL change? I rather doubt it.\nLabour’s manifesto suggests otherwise with so many policies seemingly just a continuation of what we have with the Tories. Things like the Bedroom Tax, The Two Child Benefit cap, a continuation of the oil and gas drilling licences granted by the Conservatives, including the highly questionable Rosebank. None of that will change and neither will things like private provision in the NHS or a really progressive tax regime.\nSo what real change will we see with Labour, or any of the other parties for that matter? It looks like the only thing that will be changing will be the climate!\nEven the Liberal Democrats haven’t really committed to change on important things like tax reform or tuition fees which of course they were instrumental in bringing in. Their candidate in Bicester & Woodstock is a well meaning guy, but he was also an adviser to the coalition government during the first period of austerity, as was the Conservative candidate, so not much change for the better there!\nCan I win in Bicester and Woodstock? That depends on you, the voters. It’s a circular argument that Greens can’t win so we don’t get votes, but if we don’t get votes we can’t win. But even if I don’t win my purpose is still to raise more awareness of the Green Party and our values. A party I’ve supported for 12 years and voted for for even longer, back when they were even more unlikely to be elected. Since then there’s been a huge surge in support for Greens, something I’ve seen first hand after being elected to 5 different councils as a Green and re-elected to one of those since.\nIf the Green Party didn’t exist and people hadn’t voted for them, do you think the other parties would have taken any notice of climate change or other Green issues? I very much doubt it and that’s even more obvious now that parties like Labour and the Conservatives are backing away from their climate change commitments because to stick by them is electorally inconvenient.\nSo the Greens have brought about real change over the past decade and will continue to push for more in the coming years, especially as we are looking set to at least triple our representation in Westminster. Change on things like the NHS, social care, social security, justice, equal rights, animal welfare, nature recovery, climate change and so much more.\nI’d of course love to be one of those parliamentarians helping to make those changes, as our new MPs will do through careful lobbying and internal pressure on whomever is in power by the end of this week. But I know that’s unlikely. But every vote for me and every other Green candidate still counts. It counts as part of the message the whole country needs to send to Westminster, even more so as the ruling party is likely to have a majority so large that they probably won’t be in the mood to listen to anyone else.\nBut I have faith that Greens will always find a way to move the needle and work for positive change. And I’ll continue to do that whatever happens in the polls on Thursday. I’m content to play a role, no matter how small in helping to make the future a brighter place for the next generation. Your vote can help me and every other Green candidate to do that, so I hope you’ll give that thought some serious consideration when you mark that cross on the ballot sheet.\nThe polls suggest that the outcome to this election is a foregone conclusion. Labour will comfortably win a huge majority and in Bicester & Woodstock the Lib Dems will romp home. If nothing else people will vote for them just to stop them sending any more leaflets! So you can safely vote Green, knowing it’s extremely unlikely to change that outcome.\nSo more than ever in this election you can vote with your heart to make real change happen. Change that means more than a different name on the House of Commons letterhead. Otherwise we’ll be right back here in 5 or 10 years time, probably with the Conservatives promising the change that we never really seem to get.\nAs someone else said during this election “If you want change you have to vote for it”. If you want REAL change you have to vote Green!",

Lots to say on this, but as always happens with these things, a 10-minute interview gets condensed into a 10-second comment!\nOn the way back we passed several signs on field gates warning about how the area is under threat from the Oxford to Cambridge Expressway. As someone who’s been involved in the campaign to stop this ridiculous and unnecessary development I thought I’d add a few more comments by way of a video and also expand a bit on what the Green Party would do to protect our vital green spaces.\nThis is something I’ve been involved with for a number of years now, right across the county, trying to combat the epidemic of projects that want to destroy these areas in the name of profit and greed.\nYes we need housing, but it has to be the right housing in the right places. Building on green belt will never be viable in terms of affordable housing as the land is so expensive. Developers build in a set level of profitability, usually a staggering 20%! That means that removing protection from green spaces like these just increases the number of high value, unaffordable houses being built.\nNot only that, concreting over green spaces means they can no longer lock up the carbon that we need to reduce in our environment, and they also increase the likelihood of flooding as they can no longer absorb the increased level of rain we’re getting as the climate patterns shift.\nThe Conservatives back all these projects because they are there to help wealthy landowners, developers and investors make a fat profit out of our rural heritage. As your MP I would resist all these projects, just as I now resist them as a District and Parish Councillor.\nGreens CAN WIN\nAs we’ve just seen in Wallingford, where another Green councillor has just been elected to the county council, Greens CAN WIN and we WILL WIN if people get out and give us their vote. Even if I don’t win in Banbury, a significant increase in the Green vote there will send a strong message to government that we demand change. An increased Green vote will be a visible signal of that, whereas another ‘heroic defeat’ for the other parties will get lost in the usual fog of post-election reporting.\nNow more than ever we need a strong Green voice, for the environment, for our future and for our children’s future.

The Polish community now contributes significantly to the local economy whilst Banbury’s unemployment rate stands as one of the lowest in the country, challenging the perception that immigrants compete unfairly with local talent.\nThe often ill-informed cry that immigrants come here to steal jobs is one that has been heard for centuries. It’s a thread that stubbornly runs through the immigration debate, along with illogical claims that migrants are simultaneously sponging off benefits. Yet successive generations are eventually accepted and integrated as vital members of our community. Many services such as the NHS, couldn’t survive without them.\nRegardless of borders, the job market is now a globalised proposition. Effective training and education are the real keys to safeguarding employment in the UK, with properly enforced wage regulations to protect all workers, meaning migrants would not be able to out-compete simply because they agree to lower pay.\nTighter border control might seem like an easy fix for migration imbalances, but we’re already seeing the impact of that argument on the labour market, particularly for seasonal workers since we left the EU.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_nhs/content_244.html": "For me this has always been an absolute red line in terms of how our society is organised. I’ve never been opposed to the free market, even though in my experience in business the free bit is usually very far from free.\nBut there are certain services that society needs to function, and our economy is also dependent on. These are broadly health, education, social care, welfare, transport, police, fire services, the military and local infrastructure. I may have missed something but you get the gist.\nOver the past 10 years we know that these have all been the subject of cuts, and we’ve all seen the results. Not only has this left us impoverished as a nation, it’s also applied serious downward pressure on our productivity and our economy.\nIt’s analogous to the way that businesses are run when they start to get into trouble. First you cut the things you don’t really need, then the things you think you can do without but would like to have, then you cut they think you do need but try to work around, then things you actually need to operate like stock and equipment and then finally you realise you’ve removed your ability to actually do anything productive.\nWe’re pretty much at the end of that process now, and we need to fix it.\nAdditionally, we know that many of the things that were cut didn’t need to be cut. The Tories are never one to let a good crisis go to waste and used the financial crash as an excuse to decimate social services and welfare, dismantle the NHS and remove many of the support services for those in the greatest need.\nThis was driven more by ideology and the Tories obsession with reducing the deficit at all costs, even though this had very little discernible effect on the national debt. When productivity and the economy stall, you end up with less money coming into the coffers and you have to borrow more. That’s where we are now.\nThere should be a real end to the culture of austerity and public service cuts. We’re one of the richest nations in the world, with everyone paying their fair share we should be able to care for and protect all our citizens and keep the infrastructure we all rely on well maintained and working properly.\nThe cost of train fares for example is absolutely ludicrous at the moment and are some of the highest in Europe with some of the worst services being provided. This gives lie to the idea that privatisation makes things more efficient. That said, I know that nationalised services gained a bad reputation back in the old days, but I think that was more an issue of management culture. There’s no reason why things can’t be run completely in the public sector by staff and management who are properly motivated.\nOverall though there are vital services keep our economy moving, and they should be properly supported by government. I’d like to see all of them eventually brought back fully into public ownership and run collectively for the good of the people who rely on them on a zero-sum gain basis. If private businesses can make a profit out of these services now, there’s no reason why they can’t be revenue generating for society or provided at a reduced, subsidised cost where appropriate. It may even be possible to provide some of them for free! Hopefully much freer than the so-called free market!",

After years of campaigning and complaining, manoeuvring and cajoling, half-truths and good old fashioned British pig-headedness, the moaning masses of middle England have finally got their referendum.\nI say ‘their’ referendum because this isn’t being staged at great expense for those of us who want to stay part of Europe. It’s not even for those who don’t really give a toss either way.\nIt’s certainly not for those more outward looking souls, who appreciate the many advantages of being a member of the European club. The easy movement between states (yes that does apply to us as well as all those annoying refugees and migrants) and the free transport of goods. Funding for urban and industrial renewal. Numerous environmental improvements to beaches, rivers and the countryside, including controls on things like GMOs. Human rights, animal rights, consumer rights. Cheaper phone charges and easier and cheaper travel and currency exchange. Social welfare protection and labour rights, and a panoply of other advantages that most people take for granted and will miss when they’re gone.\nNo, it’s a referendum for misguided and ill-informed little-Englanders, draped in Union flags, firm in the belief of two world wars and one world cup and certain the word ‘Great’ attached to Britain means something other than the first letter on a sticker they slap on the back of their booze cruise charabang, just to remind those envious foreigners that they were unlucky enough to be born on inferior soil.\nBut moreover, it’s a referendum for politicians who have been looking at continental Europe down the wrong end of the telescope for so long now, they just don’t realise how small this country has become on the world stage. A myopic concern about how much money we pay to Europe and a studied ignorance of the huge returns our EU membership generates.\nMost people who focus on our payment to Brussels like to remind us what else we could do with that money. Yet with a growing national debt, and stubbornly high deficit, any such savings would likely fall into the same black hole as most of the rest of our national finances. Either that or it would go towards servicing the country’s circa £50bn annual interest payments, paid in large part to European banks anyway.\nIt’s not 1975. The geo-political landscape has changed around us since the last time we decided if we wanted to be a part of Europe. Yes, back in the swinging 70s it was the ‘Common Market’, but by necessity and common interest it’s become more than that. Those advocating some kind of return to a simple trading relationship are ignoring both the reality of our reduced place in the world and the promiscuity of world markets.\nNeither is it 1938, even though Cameron’s Chamberlain moment was equally as hollow. Just like his pre-war counterpart, the agreement he reached in Brussels was peripheral and disposable, focussing as it did on the false polemic of immigration and border control.\nIt was a pantomime, with Donald Tusk and Angela Merkel as the ugly sisters to Cameron’s Cinderella. Shouts of “they’re behind you” were evident from the likes of UKIP and Front National pointing to the ‘hordes’ or ‘swarms’ or ‘bunches’ of ‘migrants’, ‘refugees’ or ‘immigrants’, depending on which description David Cameron and the BBC have alighted on this week.\nI totally agree that EU democratic and regulatory processes are in desperate need of reform, but these weren’t the points that Cameron argued. Driven by domestic pressures, piled on by a widening xenophobic rhetoric, he was pushed into a rushed and ill-conceived round of negotiations that resulted in him metaphorically claiming ‘peace in our time’ outside Number 10. It was a performance put on to give him a platform to launch the referendum that we all knew was coming, and the critic’s reviews weren’t great.\nSadly for him, us, and the rest of Europe, this was a missed opportunity that could have sparked a trans-national debate about the real future of the EU and brought about radical changes to shape it into something more even-handed and responsive to the needs of all member states.\nBut instead, Cameron wasted what could have been his real place in history for the sake of a thumbs up from the likes of Farage, Gove and Galloway whilst gaining little tangible return for the UK, save for some token restrictions on benefit payments to migrants who rarely claim them anyway.\nIn fact it’s recently been revealed that the UK government has no idea how much immigration costs us, nor how much migrants contribute to our economy. But let’s not let a little thing like lack of facts get in the way of a nicely staked out scapegoat.\nAnd while we’re on the subject of discrimination, we mustn’t forget those hard-pressed city bankers quaking in their handmade brogues, terrified that they may be penalised for being outside the Eurozone. That of course, amid the posturing about immigration, was the main concern for Cameron and his paymasters. Essentially he was in Brussels to fight for the right to discriminate against the poor whilst protecting the interests of the obscenely rich, although of course that wasn’t so eagerly reported.\nAnd there we have it. The crux of all this political, psychological and media-spun mendacity – Corporate interest. Insular businesses seeking to rid themselves of the European interference and regulation that keeps all the rest of us safer and better looked after. The refugee and migrant crises couldn’t have come at a better time for these vested interests to galvanise public opinion in favour of an out vote.\nOn this flimsiest of pretexts, and on evidence largely pulled out UKIP’s collective backside, we’re potentially going to launch ourselves into one of the biggest national disasters for several generations. The ‘Brexit’ silo mentality that is about as relevant in today’s globally connected society as statutes recorded on vellum.\nOne of the greatest achievements and advantages of the EU is freedom of movement between states. It’s a harbinger of a future globalised socio-economic system where borders and statehood will be irrelevant. One where the term ‘economic-migrant’ will no longer be a thinly veiled insult, just as it wasn’t when we and other nations economically migrated across the globe centuries ago, annexing and occupying entire countries as we went. In that context, and in view of the Tories much vaunted ‘on your bike’ ethos, I find it perplexing that we now seem to regard our attraction as place of opportunity as a bad thing.\nAnd while we’re on that subject, if I were a British migrant living on the continent I’d be feeling distinctly uncomfortable right now. Especially those who have lived there for longer than 15 years and are inexplicably denied the right to vote in a referendum that may well decide their future.\nThose whistling tunes in the dark about independent trade agreements with Europe and other global partners will soon find that our status as the 5th richest nation in the world is built on foundations largely stamped with a CE logo. Already Sterling has plummeted on the news that Boris is heading for the lifeboats.\nMuch of our apparent wealth is generated by the financial sector and supported by our membership of the EU. Who will want to trade with us as a small individual nation with a growing national debt and a dwindling economic base? No wonder the city was such a key part of Cameron’s negotiations.\nThe finance sector is pretty much all we have left. We don’t have anything else to trade. China and the USA know this and have already warned us that a UK outside the EU will be of much less interest to them. The US in particular sees our connection with Europe as a valuable conduit into EU financial markets.\nUncoupling ourselves from the EU will be a long, painful and essentially irreversible process. We won’t wake up one day and see bluebirds over the white cliffs and a land of milk and honey for all. It will take years of debate, legal dispute and the unpicking of labyrinthine systems of regulation woven into our own statutory frameworks. A drawn out and retrograde process, during which I believe we’ll slowly come to see the folly of our ways.\nAnd once we’ve closed our borders and thumbed our noses at one of the biggest trading blocs on the planet, it will be too late to realise that we’re now more of a Pekinese than a bulldog. An isle not so much sceptred as septic, poisoned by our own arrogance and bigotry, left entirely at the mercy of a broken political system where wealth goes one way, and protection is only there for those who can afford it.\nAs Britain shrivels into, at best, a tawdry tax haven in perpetual serfdom to a rich elite, we’ll come to the sad realisation that we’ve been sold a Jerusalem built on false promises and false flags. I wonder if border controls and apocryphal straight bananas will seem quite so important then.",

Elections after this one are most likely to be associated with the new Unitary Authority which will be formed in Oxfordshire, although currently exactly what form that will take is unclear.\nThe option preferred by the Greens is one of 2 unitaries formed from Cherwell District, West Oxfordshire District and The City Councils with a second one formed around South Oxon and the Vale plus West Berkshire. We feel that would keep decision making as local as possible as well as ensuring that councillors don’t become too remote from the people they represent. The County Council Cabinet recently voted to push forward their preferred option of one huge council across the whole of the County, while the City Council are proposing they form their own Unitary Council by absorbing areas around them such as Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke. I would certainly strongly oppose that, as, I believe, would most of the residents in those areas!\nThe outcome of all these options could largely be driven by those people elected to the County Council tomorrow, so not only is it important to vote because it may be your last opportunity, it’s also doubly important that you get a councillor who is going to represent your views on what your future council may look like.\nOf course my advice is to vote Green at least in areas where you already have a Green Councillor such as the two new Divisions in Kidlington which make up nearly 80% of the area I currently represent on the County Council. As I can’t be in 2 places at once I have decided to stand in the new East Division because I am involved in several ongoing issues there, Not least the proposed football stadium and the huge Oxford North development. But my fellow Green Councillor Fiona Mawson is standing in the other part, now called Kidlington West even though 2 thirds of it comprises Yarnton and Begbroke. As the only candidate in this election that actually lives in that new division, I’m hopeful that she will get a good reception from voters.\nto show Green and Conservative representation\nCurrently the whole of the Kidlington East area is represented by me as the County Councillor and by me, Fiona and Linda Ward as District councillors. I’d like to think we’ve done a good job of representing the everyone there, we all certainly work hard to achieve that, so I hope I will receive your support in the East whilst Fiona is elected to replace me in the West.\nIt’s a rather complicated scenario , especially given that the whole set up is likely to change in 2 or 3 years so neither of us are likely to see out a full term as County Councillors, but in the meantime it’s important that both areas keep consistent Green representation so that work I and Fiona have started on things like ensuring development proposals are beneficial to the area can continue into the next few years, along with our input into the re-shaping of local government over the next 2 years.\nHowever you vote (and I hope it will be Green) do make sure you vote. It may be the only chance you get to make a decision that affects you and your local community for the next few years.\nIf you need any further information from me or Fiona please let us know. We have knocked on a lot of doors over the past few months, so if we missed you we’d be happy to talk.",

In a move that is frankly baffling from a socialist led council, planners have dashed all hopes that the accommodation element designed into the revamped centre would be for social housing or affordable homes. Whilst Green councillors opposed this move, others apparently felt that poorer people won’t be able to keep the new apartments up to the standards they expect to be demanded.\nSo no comfortable inner-city pied-à-terres for the ordinary folk of Oxford then. Which is a shame considering Oxford City Council provided virtually nothing for that sector last year, despite claims that this was a priority policy.\nJobs are not the only thing to consider\nJudging by the analyses carried out over the past 10 years it looks highly likely that the new Westgate extension in Oxford will have a significant impact on other retail destinations both in the immediate vicinity and county wide.\nThe council has claimed that 3400 jobs will be created by the opening of the new centre, which seems like a rather optimistic number to me. Even if one accepts that figure, previous analyses have suggested that the number of jobs created will be far outweighed by those that will be destroyed elsewhere in the city and the surrounding areas.\nIt’s very easy to focus just on the number of jobs created, but when similar centres have opened there have been many casualties in other areas. This doesn’t even take into account the damage that’s likely to be done to trade during the building and infrastructure works and the impact of additional competition for small retailers that attracting large multi-nationals into the area will provide.\nIn an era where many retail chains are looking to reduce their portfolios, the time for this centre has been and gone. There’s already plenty of retail space in Oxford city centre, some of it lying vacant even now. Until the council addresses the systemic issues with people visiting the city, such as parking, local transport and city centre management, a revamped shopping centre isn’t going to add that much prosperity to a town encircled by much better alternatives.\nThe new shopping centre will likely have some novelty value for a few months, but once the realities of trading in Oxford begin to bite, I doubt it’ll be anything more than another usual-suspect clone-town brand zoo.\nYears of disruption\nAccording to a recent article in the Oxford Mail, a scrutinising committee of city centre councillors are due to meet to discuss ways of keeping businesses alive during the hugely disruptive infrastructure works needed for the new extension.\nSo Oxford City Council wait until AFTER the works have begun to think about how to mitigate the problems that will inevitably be caused by the works?\nAnother great example of the forethought and careful planning we’ve come to expect from our wonderful city council!\nI was at a meeting with both the city and county council leaders over a year ago where I highlighted the potential damage that will be done by the infrastructure works required for the Westgate extension. Having already experienced the same in Bristol a few years before, it was clear to me and many others that the likely upheaval required for the Westgate works were going to do more damage than they were likely to be worth in the current climate.\nSeems like it all fell on deaf ears. As usual.\nEmpty shops\nMy business in Cornmarket Street closed it’s doors for the last time after 20 years last year. Despite numerous pronouncements in the press that the city council was eager to support local businesses, we got zip-all support, even after asking on several occasions. Indeed, at one point their planning department were very close to scuppering the only deal we could achieve to sell the store. Had they not done a last minute U-turn there would have been one more empty and un-lettable shop in the city centre.\nCouncillors are also now apparently worried about the growing number of empty shops in the city, despite previous claims that there were queues of businesses eager to take space. Perhaps news has started to filter out that retailing in Oxford is not what it once was?\nIn that context one has to wonder who is going to populate the new cathedral of consumption when it is finally completed, and for those that do take up residence, what kind of trading environment will they find? With 40% of retail leases across the country coming up for renewal at the end of this year, it really does beg the question about how much space will be required when the Westgate centre is completed in 2017. Moreover what will the rest of the city look like once all the remaining viable stores have de-camped into the waiting warmth of a lovely new mall?\nWith council plans to push up the cost of parking YET AGAIN and the negative impact of roadworks, and the city centre looking like a building site, it’s likely most consumers will continue to go elsewhere to shop, surrounded as we are by much more attractive and easily reached locations around the city and the county. And once again, experience tells me that once people find better alternatives, they’re unlikely to return, other than for a quick nose around the new development.\nA committee composed of councillors with absolutely no idea how businesses in Oxford operate, setting out to ‘examine’ how to deal with these issues now, is tantamount to closing the door after the horse has bolted, lived out it’s natural life and ended up in a dog food tin. This project as has been in the planning stages for so many years it’s truly staggering that the implications are only being discussed now.\nOxford is of course known as the city of ‘dreaming spires’. It seems that in terms of strategic planning, many of our councillors have also been asleep on the job.",

Begbroke and Yarnton and plonk 4400 houses in the middle of an area with overloaded roads and infrastructure. A plan that would see the three communities amalgamated into one sprawling conurbation, created not to serve local affordable housing needs, but to supposedly provide housing for workers in the city, even though most of the jobs are based in the east.\nYou can read the full response here\nAs everyone involved knows the oft-touted claims that this will include so-called ‘affordable’ housing is laughable. Valuable green belt land will become ten times more valuable once it becomes ripe for development and the landowners and luxury house builders will stand to make a fortune.\nI along with several others were allowed a five minute representation to the councillors in the chamber, some of whom it was later reported couldn’t even be bothered to listen to those who had come to plead their case. One was even photographed using a mobile phone during the speeches!\nSeeing the lack of connectedness demonstrated by the predominately Conservative council enraged me more than I imagined it would. If you watch the video footage from the planning meeting a few weeks ago you can hear me heckling quite loudly throughout some of speeches from Barry Wood and Colin Clarke.\nNormally I wouldn’t do something like that. They deserve their time to speak just as I and the other campaigners had. But being the last to have their say (as Cllr Wood ensured he would be) they were able to simply brush aside the very salient points raised by protesters and other councillors.\nTory councillor after Tory councillor stood up and gave no logical reason why these plans should be forced through in the face of what everyone recognised was an historic level of opposition from the people in the district they represent.\nOver 1500 responses were given to the plans, nearly all of them objecting to this wanton and unnecessary destruction of our precious green belt. Yet the council seemed oblivious to them, to the cogent arguments put forward by speakers and even to the legal opinions that were presented by the two main campaigning groups.\nThe cavalier attitude of Barry Wood, who I’d previously challenged for seeming to pre-judge the outcome of the consultation, was amply demonstrated when he and his fellow councillors abdicated their responsibility to the people of Cherwell and threw their objections at the feet of the planning inspector.\nHis closing argument was that it was the inspector who would make the final decision not them, even though they were elected to represent us. As I suspected months ago, the council had already made its mind up, and the consultation was simply a box ticking exercise. The fate of our green spaces, our wildlife habitats, our clean air and the distinctiveness of our communities has been thrown into the lap of an outside agency because the Tories on the council didn’t have the guts or the inclination to properly consider the alternatives.\nSo I hope you’ll forgive me some heckling out of pure frustration at the lack of professionalism and respect for democracy being shown by these people.\nThat’s why I want to win this election. I want a guaranteed voice in that chamber so that I can represent the views of the people in Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke – an area that is so remote from that chamber, way up at the other end of the district that people like Barry Wood and Colin Clarke feel it’s safe to throw us all under the bus for the sake of expediency.\nIt’s also why the Green Party in Kidlington is working with the Liberal Democrats in this election to elect me in Kidlington East and Alaric Rose in Kidlington West. You can see our joint statement about that here.\nI hope you’ll give me and Alaric a chance to be a strong voice for you after May 3rd.\nYou can see the full video of the planning meeting (including the heckling) on the Cherwell District Council Website.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_planning_page_4/content_396.html": "As I said in the recent election debate on the BBC, in my opinion they shouldn’t.\nThere are many reasons it’s a bad idea, both from a business perspective and as part of local spending priorities.\nI’ve worked in retail nearly all my life. I built and ran a national chain of jewellery stores across the country and traded in several shopping centres, including some of the most prestigious in the country such as Bluewater in Kent and the new Bullring Centre in Birmingham. I write a regular column for Retail week Magazine and comment regularly in the national press on retail issues as well as offering consultancy services. One of my main focusses is independent retail and commercial property. So I know a little bit about what I’m talking about.\nCherwell District Council (CDC) leader Barry Wood claims that buying the Castle Quay Shopping Centre in Banbury is a good deal for the people of Cherwell. This decision was also backed by the Labour group on the council and their leader Sean Woodcock has assured me there’s a good business case for doing it. Unfortunately neither of them have been able to show it to me so far.\nTheir belief is that buying a commercial property like a shopping centre is a good idea as property will always rise in value. This may be the case for domestic property and some kinds of commercial premises, but not always with retail space.\nA Good Investment?\nThe argument for buying the scheme seems to be that if they hadn’t, the centre would have shut down. It has many long term empty units and is generally struggling to compete in an ever crowded marketplace. The council’s decision a few years ago to allow a new shopping park to open on the outskirts of Banbury haven’t helped its plight.\nIt’s extremely unlikely though that it would have closed down. Much more likely that it would have been offloaded by its pension investment owners to another investment company with more experience of running a shopping centre than some local councillors.\nMoreover, if the argument is that the centre was about to collapse, that doesn’t exactly make it an attractive investment for public money does it?\nThere have been some shopping centre failures in the past, but they are few and far between. But when they do go, they tend to go completely. That means an almost total loss for anyone unlucky enough to be the owner at the time. There will be some residual value in the land, but that’s unlikely to reflect the full price paid for the whole development.\nThere have been a growing number of retail failures in recent years with 650 collapses so far this year alone, and we’re not even half way through yet! Some of them very high profile and heavily leveraged operations. Others are busy negotiating partial closures and rent reductions with their landlords. Others are moving more into the online arena and abandoning physical retail space almost altogether.\nNone of this bodes well for an under-let, under-invested and down at heel shopping centre in a struggling town in North Oxfordshire.\nSo essentially CDC are gambling with public money against the odds. And it doesn’t end there.\nOther Costs\nAccording to Barry Wood the scheme is turning a profit at the moment, but as I’ve said previously, I’ve not seen evidence of that. I have seen a large number of long term voids in the centre, and with the potential for these to increase in number I fear the profitability may be marginal or likely to decline.\nThere will also be ongoing running costs for the centre and presumably additional investment to do whatever it is with the place that they feel will revitalise it. Again details on that are sketchy, but I think there’s some talk about dividing the larger units into smaller ones to attract independent retailers. Whilst I support that idea to some extent there are a lot of things to consider about that course of action.\nFirstly the cost of doing the work, which may include major re-modelling of the units due to, amongst other things, fire regulations. I’ve seen at least one shopping centre management come unstuck with similar plans due to rules on access to fire exit routes.\nHelping Smaller Retailers?\nSecondly smaller independents usually don’t have a huge budget for shopfitting, so there will be additional cost in partially fitting out the units, including new shopfronts etc to attract smaller operators and to ensure that their stores fit in with a modern shopping centre scheme.\nBusiness Rates\nThirdly there’s the loss of business rates on the empty units that are there now, and will most likely be there for a while. Considering the current climate in retail there’s also a good chance that voids could increase. At the moment the landlords will be paying rates on those premises even though they’re empty and a good deal of that money goes to CDC. With the council now being the landlords, they’re going to be paying the rates to themselves, effectively wiping out that income.\nDevaluation of the Asset\nFinally there’s the issue of valuation. Shopping developments are broadly valued on their rental potential. This is why landlords will leave units empty rather than let them out at a reduced rent. If the council’s plan is to lower the rent for smaller or other retailers, that will have a knock on effect on the value of those units and then on others when rent reviews come around. Other tenants now paying a higher rent will also push for a reduction when their leases come up for renewal or rent reviews are due or maybe even before.\nThe net effect of this would be to push down rents, not only in the centre but across the town, reducing loan to asset values across the board. In broad terms I’d welcome that. I’ve long argued that retail property values are hugely inflated. But in terms of the Council’s investment exposure in Castle Quay it’s a potentially dangerous situation, not only leading to a potential devaluation of the asset, but also any loans secured on it being partially called in.\nThere may be some balancing in terms of appreciation on the total asset value, but in the current climate and in a falling retail market, there a very good chance that the overall value of the scheme will fall relative to the amount the council has sunk into it, both as an initial investment and any further day to day expenditure.\nAll of this appears to have passed Cherwell Councillors and the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives by. They obviously have a very patchy understanding of how retail property works and the implications and pitfalls they are letting us all as council tax payers in for.\nMoreover there’s the question of if so much money should be focussed in the north of the district while ignoring other areas. Mr Wood commented in the Radio debate on Wednesday that he recognised that there were empty units in Pioneer Square in Bicester and that it was difficult to get them filled. Yet this doesn’t seem to have concerned him over the purchase of Castle Quay. Indeed, having set the precedent in Banbury I asked him during the debate if the council intended to buy Pioneer Square as well. He didn’t reply.\nOther Options\nA more sensible and prudent approach to the problems in both areas would be to work with the landlords rather than bailing them out with public money. Leave them with the risk whilst introducing local initiatives that help smaller retailers get a foothold and would also support the centre.\nThese could include rates reductions, which Barry Wood dismissed out of hand when I challenged him on it during the election debate. Neither he nor Sean Woodcock appeared to know that it has been within the gift of local councils to reduce rates on specific properties at their discretion for several years now.\nIf they wanted to provide smaller, more affordable space for independent retailers, they could lease units from the centres on a medium to long term basis, probably negotiating favourable terms with the landlords as a council will have a very good covenant. These could then be divided up (if required) and then sublet on flexible terms on reduced rents to retailers, although this would have to be agreed beforehand with the landlord for the same reasons discussed above concerning rental levels and valuations.\nThis would achieve the same aim of revitalising schemes both in Banbury and Bicester and would not involve the council in risking large amounts of public money. It would also mean that the bulk of the £60m they are now tying up in one area could be spread across the district.\nThis is the kind of strategic thinking we need, rather that the amateurish speculation of a council who seems to want to play at being shopkeepers with our money. This is why we need a more diverse representation on the council and councillors like me who will challenge these misguided moves before millions of pounds of desperately needed council funds are put at risk.",

Claiming, as they always do, that they have put ‘record’ levels of funding into education (as they also claim for health and so many other important services). But the devil is in the detail, with funding per pupil actually falling as class sizes increase.\nRegardless of claims to the contrary in their cobbled-together, un-costed manifesto, there are more cuts to come. But you don’t have to take my word for it, just look at the information available on the schools cuts website\nThese bare facts come from the people who know what’s happening to our schools.

So busy I’ve not been able to properly thank everyone who supported and voted for me on May 6th.\nAs the count was delayed until the 9th May and went on until late in the evening, it wasn’t until the 10th that it began to sink in that I’d actually won, beating a long standing councillor who had become something of a fixture in the area.\nIt was a fantastic election for the Greens across the country with us winning nearly 100 new seats. Some of the notable highlights were :\n- Greens in first place across Bristol West and Sheffield Central constituencies\n- Gained representation on 18 councils, bringing the total tally of councils with Green representation to 141.\n- Gained 99 seats – now 445 councillors across England and Wales\n- Won 24 seats on Bristol City Council – now joint largest party with Labour.\nAnd of course in Oxford we won many new seats with an extra seat gained on the city council and 2 new seats on the county council, myself included! After we retained our original seat on the county with Dr Pete Sudbury, that gives us 3 seats along with Robin Bennett who is also the deputy leader of South Oxfordshire District Council. I’m looking forward to working with both of them.\nThe out-turn of all this in Oxfordshire is that the Conservatives have been pushed into being the opposition party on the county for the first time ever! While they are currently showing as having 22 seats on the council, they actually only have 21 as an extra seat was gained due to a mistake made at the count that will be corrected in the high court in the next few weeks. There’s also some exciting news in the pipeline about what that means for the next administration of the council that I can’t reveal at the moment. But look out on Monday evening for an important announcement!\nMeanwhile, the Green surge continues, and thanks to you I am part of that! So a huge thank you goes out to everyone who worked on my campaign, donated money to it and of course to the people who voted for me. I will do my best to not let you down. I will be starting work on the council in the next week or so, after all the dust has settled and I am properly plugged into the systems there. The first part of that is the council AGM which will be held on Tuesday in Banbury.\nIn the meantime, please feel free to contact me with any issues you want me to look at. My first priority is going to be looking at what we can do about the state of the roads in this area. I’ve already been contacted by several people who have raised this with me and I know from my own experience that this is a very important local issue. I hope I can hit the ground running and make some visible progress on this soon.\nIt’s going to be an exciting few years with huge changes afoot in Oxfordshire and you’re all part of that, so thank you all again!",

Lots to say on this, but as always happens with these things, a 10-minute interview gets condensed into a 10-second comment!\nOn the way back we passed several signs on field gates warning about how the area is under threat from the Oxford to Cambridge Expressway. As someone who’s been involved in the campaign to stop this ridiculous and unnecessary development I thought I’d add a few more comments by way of a video and also expand a bit on what the Green Party would do to protect our vital green spaces.\nThis is something I’ve been involved with for a number of years now, right across the county, trying to combat the epidemic of projects that want to destroy these areas in the name of profit and greed.\nYes we need housing, but it has to be the right housing in the right places. Building on green belt will never be viable in terms of affordable housing as the land is so expensive. Developers build in a set level of profitability, usually a staggering 20%! That means that removing protection from green spaces like these just increases the number of high value, unaffordable houses being built.\nNot only that, concreting over green spaces means they can no longer lock up the carbon that we need to reduce in our environment, and they also increase the likelihood of flooding as they can no longer absorb the increased level of rain we’re getting as the climate patterns shift.\nThe Conservatives back all these projects because they are there to help wealthy landowners, developers and investors make a fat profit out of our rural heritage. As your MP I would resist all these projects, just as I now resist them as a District and Parish Councillor.\nGreens CAN WIN\nAs we’ve just seen in Wallingford, where another Green councillor has just been elected to the county council, Greens CAN WIN and we WILL WIN if people get out and give us their vote. Even if I don’t win in Banbury, a significant increase in the Green vote there will send a strong message to government that we demand change. An increased Green vote will be a visible signal of that, whereas another ‘heroic defeat’ for the other parties will get lost in the usual fog of post-election reporting.\nNow more than ever we need a strong Green voice, for the environment, for our future and for our children’s future. Please vote Green on December 12th.",

This crash came in the wake of a similar event with an ESA rocket that crashed shortly after lift off in Virginia.\nSadly the Virgin crash cost the life of one of the pilots of the craft, but it raises issues around the viability of space tourism, not least because of the environmental impact of such catastrophic events. Moreover the question remains as to the point of these sub-orbital flights and if they will ever amount anything other than a quick joy ride on a very expensive roller-coaster for those that can afford the $250,000 ticket price.\nThere’s much talk during the programme about the cultural impact of these flights and how individuals are inspired by their trips. I don’t really buy that personally, and think that there’s a lot more that can be done to inspire scientific exploration on the face of this planet if you have half a billion dollars to throw around.\nIf nothing else Richard Branson could use that money to keep his long forgotten promise to make Virgin Atlantic the greenest airline on the planet.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_eu_page_3/content_353.html": "This is a copy of a piece I wrote for Huffington Post this week. You can find and comment on the original here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/eu-referendum-immigration_b_9322718.html\nSo here it is. After years of campaigning and complaining, manoeuvring and cajoling, half-truths and good old fashioned British pig-headedness, the moaning masses of middle England have finally got their referendum.\nI say ‘their’ referendum because this isn’t being staged at great expense for those of us who want to stay part of Europe. It’s not even for those who don’t really give a toss either way.\nIt’s certainly not for those more outward looking souls, who appreciate the many advantages of being a member of the European club. The easy movement between states (yes that does apply to us as well as all those annoying refugees and migrants) and the free transport of goods. Funding for urban and industrial renewal. Numerous environmental improvements to beaches, rivers and the countryside, including controls on things like GMOs. Human rights, animal rights, consumer rights. Cheaper phone charges and easier and cheaper travel and currency exchange. Social welfare protection and labour rights, and a panoply of other advantages that most people take for granted and will miss when they’re gone.\nNo, it’s a referendum for misguided and ill-informed little-Englanders, draped in Union flags, firm in the belief of two world wars and one world cup and certain the word ‘Great’ attached to Britain means something other than the first letter on a sticker they slap on the back of their booze cruise charabang, just to remind those envious foreigners that they were unlucky enough to be born on inferior soil.\nBut moreover, it’s a referendum for politicians who have been looking at continental Europe down the wrong end of the telescope for so long now, they just don’t realise how small this country has become on the world stage. A myopic concern about how much money we pay to Europe and a studied ignorance of the huge returns our EU membership generates.\nMost people who focus on our payment to Brussels like to remind us what else we could do with that money. Yet with a growing national debt, and stubbornly high deficit, any such savings would likely fall into the same black hole as most of the rest of our national finances. Either that or it would go towards servicing the country’s circa £50bn annual interest payments, paid in large part to European banks anyway.\nIt’s not 1975. The geo-political landscape has changed around us since the last time we decided if we wanted to be a part of Europe. Yes, back in the swinging 70s it was the ‘Common Market’, but by necessity and common interest it’s become more than that. Those advocating some kind of return to a simple trading relationship are ignoring both the reality of our reduced place in the world and the promiscuity of world markets.\nNeither is it 1938, even though Cameron’s Chamberlain moment was equally as hollow. Just like his pre-war counterpart, the agreement he reached in Brussels was peripheral and disposable, focussing as it did on the false polemic of immigration and border control.\nIt was a pantomime, with Donald Tusk and Angela Merkel as the ugly sisters to Cameron’s Cinderella. Shouts of “they’re behind you” were evident from the likes of UKIP and Front National pointing to the ‘hordes’ or ‘swarms’ or ‘bunches’ of ‘migrants’, ‘refugees’ or ‘immigrants’, depending on which description David Cameron and the BBC have alighted on this week.\nI totally agree that EU democratic and regulatory processes are in desperate need of reform, but these weren’t the points that Cameron argued. Driven by domestic pressures, piled on by a widening xenophobic rhetoric, he was pushed into a rushed and ill-conceived round of negotiations that resulted in him metaphorically claiming ‘peace in our time’ outside Number 10. It was a performance put on to give him a platform to launch the referendum that we all knew was coming, and the critic’s reviews weren’t great.\nSadly for him, us, and the rest of Europe, this was a missed opportunity that could have sparked a trans-national debate about the real future of the EU and brought about radical changes to shape it into something more even-handed and responsive to the needs of all member states.\nBut instead, Cameron wasted what could have been his real place in history for the sake of a thumbs up from the likes of Farage, Gove and Galloway whilst gaining little tangible return for the UK, save for some token restrictions on benefit payments to migrants who rarely claim them anyway.\nIn fact it’s recently been revealed that the UK government has no idea how much immigration costs us, nor how much migrants contribute to our economy. But let’s not let a little thing like lack of facts get in the way of a nicely staked out scapegoat.\nAnd while we’re on the subject of discrimination, we mustn’t forget those hard-pressed city bankers quaking in their handmade brogues, terrified that they may be penalised for being outside the Eurozone. That of course, amid the posturing about immigration, was the main concern for Cameron and his paymasters. Essentially he was in Brussels to fight for the right to discriminate against the poor whilst protecting the interests of the obscenely rich, although of course that wasn’t so eagerly reported.\nAnd there we have it. The crux of all this political, psychological and media-spun mendacity – Corporate interest. Insular businesses seeking to rid themselves of the European interference and regulation that keeps all the rest of us safer and better looked after. The refugee and migrant crises couldn’t have come at a better time for these vested interests to galvanise public opinion in favour of an out vote.\nOn this flimsiest of pretexts, and on evidence largely pulled out UKIP’s collective backside, we’re potentially going to launch ourselves into one of the biggest national disasters for several generations. The ‘Brexit’ silo mentality that is about as relevant in today’s globally connected society as statutes recorded on vellum.\nOne of the greatest achievements and advantages of the EU is freedom of movement between states. It’s a harbinger of a future globalised socio-economic system where borders and statehood will be irrelevant. One where the term ‘economic-migrant’ will no longer be a thinly veiled insult, just as it wasn’t when we and other nations economically migrated across the globe centuries ago, annexing and occupying entire countries as we went. In that context, and in view of the Tories much vaunted ‘on your bike’ ethos, I find it perplexing that we now seem to regard our attraction as place of opportunity as a bad thing.\nAnd while we’re on that subject, if I were a British migrant living on the continent I’d be feeling distinctly uncomfortable right now. Especially those who have lived there for longer than 15 years and are inexplicably denied the right to vote in a referendum that may well decide their future.\nThose whistling tunes in the dark about independent trade agreements with Europe and other global partners will soon find that our status as the 5th richest nation in the world is built on foundations largely stamped with a CE logo. Already Sterling has plummeted on the news that Boris is heading for the lifeboats.\nMuch of our apparent wealth is generated by the financial sector and supported by our membership of the EU. Who will want to trade with us as a small individual nation with a growing national debt and a dwindling economic base? No wonder the city was such a key part of Cameron’s negotiations.\nThe finance sector is pretty much all we have left. We don’t have anything else to trade. China and the USA know this and have already warned us that a UK outside the EU will be of much less interest to them. The US in particular sees our connection with Europe as a valuable conduit into EU financial markets.\nUncoupling ourselves from the EU will be a long, painful and essentially irreversible process. We won’t wake up one day and see bluebirds over the white cliffs and a land of milk and honey for all. It will take years of debate, legal dispute and the unpicking of labyrinthine systems of regulation woven into our own statutory frameworks. A drawn out and retrograde process, during which I believe we’ll slowly come to see the folly of our ways.\nAnd once we’ve closed our borders and thumbed our noses at one of the biggest trading blocs on the planet, it will be too late to realise that we’re now more of a Pekinese than a bulldog. An isle not so much sceptred as septic, poisoned by our own arrogance and bigotry, left entirely at the mercy of a broken political system where wealth goes one way, and protection is only there for those who can afford it.\nAs Britain shrivels into, at best, a tawdry tax haven in perpetual serfdom to a rich elite, we’ll come to the sad realisation that we’ve been sold a Jerusalem built on false promises and false flags. I wonder if border controls and apocryphal straight bananas will seem quite so important then.",

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_politics/content_5.html": "Tomorrow you have the chance to vote in one of the most historic elections in this country for many years.\nThis is going to be the last County Council election before both County and district Councils are abolished under plans being pushed forward by national government. Elections after this one are most likely to be associated with the new Unitary Authority which will be formed in Oxfordshire, although currently exactly what form that will take is unclear.\nThe option preferred by the Greens is one of 2 unitaries formed from Cherwell District, West Oxfordshire District and The City Councils with a second one formed around South Oxon and the Vale plus West Berkshire. We feel that would keep decision making as local as possible as well as ensuring that councillors don’t become too remote from the people they represent. The County Council Cabinet recently voted to push forward their preferred option of one huge council across the whole of the County, while the City Council are proposing they form their own Unitary Council by absorbing areas around them such as Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke. I would certainly strongly oppose that, as, I believe, would most of the residents in those areas!\nThe outcome of all these options could largely be driven by those people elected to the County Council tomorrow, so not only is it important to vote because it may be your last opportunity, it’s also doubly important that you get a councillor who is going to represent your views on what your future council may look like.\nOf course my advice is to vote Green at least in areas where you already have a Green Councillor such as the two new Divisions in Kidlington which make up nearly 80% of the area I currently represent on the County Council. As I can’t be in 2 places at once I have decided to stand in the new East Division because I am involved in several ongoing issues there, Not least the proposed football stadium and the huge Oxford North development. But my fellow Green Councillor Fiona Mawson is standing in the other part, now called Kidlington West even though 2 thirds of it comprises Yarnton and Begbroke. As the only candidate in this election that actually lives in that new division, I’m hopeful that she will get a good reception from voters.\nto show Green and Conservative representation\nCurrently the whole of the Kidlington East area is represented by me as the County Councillor and by me, Fiona and Linda Ward as District councillors. I’d like to think we’ve done a good job of representing the everyone there, we all certainly work hard to achieve that, so I hope I will receive your support in the East whilst Fiona is elected to replace me in the West.\nIt’s a rather complicated scenario , especially given that the whole set up is likely to change in 2 or 3 years so neither of us are likely to see out a full term as County Councillors, but in the meantime it’s important that both areas keep consistent Green representation so that work I and Fiona have started on things like ensuring development proposals are beneficial to the area can continue into the next few years, along with our input into the re-shaping of local government over the next 2 years.\nHowever you vote (and I hope it will be Green) do make sure you vote. It may be the only chance you get to make a decision that affects you and your local community for the next few years.\nIf you need any further information from me or Fiona please let us know. We have knocked on a lot of doors over the past few months, so if we missed you we’d be happy to talk.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_author_ianmiddleton99_page_24/content_491.html": "Last week myself and John Haywood from the Banbury and Cherwell Green Party visited the market in central Banbury to speak to the stall holders about the changes being proposed to this 1000 year old tradition in the heart of an historic town.\nWe spoke with all the stallholders present, although sadly they were only 10 of them trading on the day. They were all all opposed to Cherwell District Council’s illogical and damaging decision to restrict the stalls to the Cornhill end of the Market Place. A plan also supported by the Conservative controlled Town Council.\nI started my own 25 year long retail career on a market stall, and worked it for 7 years with my partner though rain, hail sleet, snow and sunshine. I know how difficult it can be to make a living and how fragile the trading environment can be. Your livelihood can depend on so many variable factors, and one of the major fears is losing your regular pitch, for whatever reason.\nIt may seem silly to anyone who hasn’t traded in a market themselves, but where your stall sits can make all the difference between success and failure. The location of competing trades, the flow of people moving through the market, who your neighbours are, your visibility and prominence in the market as a whole are all desperately important.\nThere appears to have been absolutely no consultation with stall holders or customers about these unpopular changes, and based on what stallholders and visitors told me I foresee them being the death knell for this historic trading post as more and more traders fall by the wayside.\nSo what seems like a minor change to the council, will probably be anything but to the people trying to make a living out of the market. This move could likely kill it off! it’s already become smaller and therefore less popular, especially over the last 20 years. In 1997 there were 120 stalls, now its down to less than 20.\nConsidering it’s reduced pull for consumers it’s completely incongruous that the rents being charged by the private firm managing on behalf of the council are almost double that charged by neighbouring markets such as Abingdon, Aylesbury, Hinkley, Oxford and Thame. And as with most things these days, the rent goes up every year. Meanwhile trade is slowly dwindling away to nothing, leaving regular and loyal traders quite literally out in the cold.\nThe Council’s plan includes opening the Market car park for use on Thursdays and Fridays. There is no evidence to suggest this will increase car park usage and revenue to the Council – people already using other car parks such as that near to the Matalan Store will simply park in the market place instead.\nGovernment initiatives on town centre regeneration called for more emphasis and support for market days and the traders that build and run these vital hubs of trade and local amenity in our towns and cities. The Portas review cited markets as one of the easiest ways that town centres could be revitalised and kept alive. Why then is the Conservative run Cherwell Council ignoring the views of it’s own established market traders? Why are they proposing moves that could potentially irreparably damage trade in such an established and once vibrant local fixture?\nBanbury market should be seen by Cherwell Council as an asset to the town. They should be supporting it actively and engaging with the traders and customers to find ways of safeguarding the it’s future, rather than taking unilateral actions with no consultation.\nThis is a Charter Market, which bestows on Banbury the status of a Market Town. By birthright it should be located in the Market Square.\nI would urge Cherwell councillors to do what I did. Take a walk around the market and speak to the people whose livelihoods are in their hands. Speak also to the local residents and patrons of the market and ask them what they think about the priorities that they are planning to enforce on everyone.\nThis is not a decision that can be taken just by moving squares on a map.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_page_27/content_479.html": "This is a piece I wrote for Huffington Post earlier this week. I think it speaks for itself, although after it was published I thought I should have pointed out that none of the the politicians I refer to in the studio on election night were Greens. As usual we weren’t invited to the BBC party. There were however representatives from Labour, Conservative, Libdems and UKIP. Given that the Greens had a reasonably good showing in the last General Election in Rochester (for a ‘marginal’ party) I’d have thought we’d have been worth a mention at least. But apparently not.\nAnyway I hope this serves as a good first post on my website/blog and you can see the original article here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/westminster-politics_b_6199214.html?utm_hp_ref=tw.\nFeel free to comment below or on the original article on the Huffington Post site.\nI recently became a parliamentary candidate for the Green Party. After years of railing against politicians, the irony, and perhaps the hypocrisy, of becoming one myself has not been lost on me.\nThen again, there were the constant jibes about my complaining a lot but doing nothing positive to make a change. So when my local party group asked me to stand, I said I’d give it a go. And here I am. Feel free to point the finger.\nOne of the first things I’ve noticed about the underbelly of politics is just how strategic it is. Target wards, target seats, candidates standing in constituencies where they don’t live for the sake of political expediency. None of this is new, or unusual, or even un-democratic, but it does take some getting used to.\nBut watching the BBC election special on the Rochester and Strood by-election, you could be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the political world has turned into some kind of wife swapping party from the mid 70s. It seems these days that political manoeuvring between the ruling parties has moved beyond juggling their own family jewels, and has been reduced to chucking their keys into the fruit bowl with anyone who fancies a quick fumble with their majority.\nFirstly we had UKIP’s Deputy Chairperson Suzanne Evans being interviewed about where her party would go after the predicted win in Rochester. This consisted of a serious of nods and winks about who might and might not leap out of their own party bed and sneak into theirs when the neighbours weren’t looking. A sort of Carry-On Westminster, but with less laughs.\nShe then went on to explain, with barely concealed glee, that her fondest ambition was to seduce someone from Labour to join in their little tryst. Nigel is apparently talking to a couple of MPs but she couldn’t reveal more. She did everything but tap the side of her nose, elbow Andrew Neil in the ribs and give a little Babs Windsor giggle.\nThen we had an analysis from a political expert explaining how UKIP’s performance in the by-election would determine how other sitting MPs would behave in the run up to next years general election. His premise was that if UKIP did well in Rochester, many other career politicians would be considering their position in the next few months. The expectation is apparently that if they think UKIP is a better bet for them to hold on to their seat (ooh matron!), then they would switch allegiances in order to do so.\nNow you’ll have to excuse me. I’m quite new to this game. But when one joins a party isn’t there something about ideology written into the contract? Or am I now being ridiculously naive?\nJudging by the behaviour of at least two recent pantheons of British democracy I suppose I am. It seems that standing on a platform with a bunch of like minded individuals in the hope of doing something good for the country isn’t what it’s about any more.\nNo, apparently it’s more about hanging on to the House Of Commons parking place, the expense account, and access to the House of Commons bar, rather than the boring stuff like philosophical conviction. Some back-benchers are evidently more interested in maintaining a comfortable position for themselves, rather than for their constituents. Yet, in true British carry-on style, they still keep getting elected.\nAs a newcomer to this world, I saw with fresh eyes last night these four sombre suited politicians sitting uneasily with each other, smugly carving up the political cake amongst themselves. Like children at birthday party trying to decide who gets the last portion of jelly and ice cream, the polemic was about anything other than the issues that this country and the planet really face.\nIain Duncan Smith spent a good deal of his time justifying a particularly vituperative campaign poster that portrayed the idea of voting for Mark Reckless as on a par with seeking Pol Pot as a spiritual adviser. Reckless used to be an investment banker, he didn’t live in the area, he’d only moved there to take a safe seat. All very salient points for the local electorate, but ones that seemed exquisitely irrelevant when he was the Conservative MP only a few months ago.\nMeanwhile UKIP expounded their claim that they listened to the people, and were offering an alternative to the status quo of careerist politicians who’d never done a days honest labour in their lives. Odd then that their success last night, and in Clacton a few weeks ago, relied on exactly the reverse of those ideals by welcoming with open arms two MPs firmly rooted in the rotten political establishment they claimed to despise.\nOn the point of principle I am in total agreement with them. The current political establishment has reduced democracy to the level of swapping football cards in the playground. But it’s a tawdry game of top trumps that they have just as much of a hand in as all the other entrenched Westminster parties.\nIf this is the future of politics in this country, I’m glad to be a member of a party that currently stands as an exemplar of how it is still possible to operate democratically without playing these cynical games. We may now have one less MP than UKIP, but at least ours is there on merit, rather than because she swapped her rosette for a more appealing colour.\nAnd Caroline Lucas has just won MP of the year, which is something that gives me hope. Even so, she’s now the focus of a campaign to unseat her by the Labour party in Brighton, because, and despite of the fact, that Labour and the Greens share many of the same aims.\nMoreover, if all these people care about is hanging on to their positions at all costs, what really is the point? And if the electorate is so fickle that they can’t see through this charade, maybe we deserve the graceless, flagitious mess they all seem to be making of the world.\nOne apocryphal anecdote from Rochester I heard today was that someone had voted UKIP because the sitting Tory MP hadn’t done enough for the local area. If that’s true, it’s an indictment of the great British voter more demoralising than anything supposedly implied by hanging a flag out of the window of your mock-Georgian semi.\nBut as an accidental politician I have to hope that it isn’t true, or at least typical. I have to trust that people in the UK will see past all the identikit politicos, the vested interests and the horse trading of their democratic heritage, and vote for real change and genuine representation in the next government.\nI am ever the optimist.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_democracy/content_386.html": "Last night we saw the Cherwell Conservatives in their true colours as they waved through some fundamental changes to the council constitution despite the report they were based on being full of errors and inconsistencies.\nThe report itself had not been through the scrutiny and overview process, neither had any councillor, to my knowledge, been previously consulted or invited to comment on it. It was simply dropped on to the December meeting agenda, possibly in the hope that it wouldn’t receive too much attention from councillors in the run up to Christmas.\nThis throws up a fundamental question on how the council is run. Should significant issues of democratic accountability be amended by officers with virtually no input from elected councillors? I’d argue not. Councillors are bound by the constitution and the rules governing meetings. They should at the very least be consulted appropriately on any changes that will affect these rules.\nThe proposals included restrictions on motions and amendments length, shorter notice periods for questions to council, and the ability to reject motions on the basis of heavily subjective assessments of them being ‘vexatious’ or ‘frivolous’. They are arguably designed to limit both the scope of debates and, by implication, the ability of councillors to fully represent their ward residents.\nArguments were put forward that these rules already exist on some local councils, yet in Oxfordshire only one out of 5 district councils have similar rules (although with far greater latitude on things like motion length) and only the County Council has anything approaching this level of restriction. It’s arguable that the County, with usually a far greater number of motions and procedural matters need a more streamlined system, but at district level this has never been an issue in Oxfordshire.\nOne has to ask what the motivations would be for the council agreeing to these proposals so readily. It’s probable that after the recent change in the makeup of the council, with more non-conservative councillors being elected every year, the Tories are simply frightened of public debate.\nThis would appear to be predicated on the Conservatives bare-faced admission that they had already decided how they would vote on issues before any motion was proposed or debate initiated. Barry Wood’s repeated claim in meetings that all his councillors will essentially do as they are told completely undermines the basis of individual councillor representation.\nEven though the report containing these proposals was significantly flawed, it was voted through by the Conservatives on the apparent understanding that it could be re-written or corrected later, without the need for further ratification. That in itself would seem to be a ludicrous approach. How can any such changes be approved in advance of knowing what they are?\nAs we have seen on numerous occasions, this is the reality of democracy in Cherwell, where the dominant follow-my-leader Tories vote en-bloc on everything, regardless of the interests of the people they represent.\nThis was evident during the debate at the same meeting over a second successive motion brought to the council calling on it to oppose the Oxford to Cambridge Expressway. This included claims from Councillor Dan Sames – the council’s lead on green issues – that he is “passionate” about the environment, whilst simultaneously keeping an ‘open mind’ about a huge motorway being built, possibly through environmentally sensitive areas like Otmoor, which he represents. Councillors like this voted for a climate change emergency motion and then somehow reconcile that with building a huge motorway. This shows just how little commitment they really have towards care for the environment.\nCherwell District Council is now the only council in Oxfordshire not to have voted to oppose the Expressway. As a result they are tacitly supporting it subject only to the final route. Any route will be environmentally damaging, but this doesn’t seem to be an issue for the ‘Concreting Conservatives’.\nThe fact that council leader, Barry Wood, is also the Chair of the Arc Leaders Group appointed by the MHCLG to promote the expressway plans, as well as being an OxLEP and Oxfordshire Growth Board member – both organisations with a vested interest in promoting the expressway – seems not to be regarded as significant bias by the council. I’d surmise that that is the only reason why we’re still having this debate in Cherwell – the instruction from Cllr Wood to his poodle councillors appears to be that they should not undermine his position on all these bodies by opposing one of their keynote projects.\nI do not have an open mind about the Expressway and will continue to oppose it at every opportunity in favour of much more sustainable and environmentally sensitive projects such as East/West Rail. We do not need any more massive major road building projects in this part of the county (or arguably anywhere else) regardless of which route they may take. The Green Party’s commitment to tackling climate change cannot be overruled by the imperatives of growth for its own sake that lie at the heart of Conservative proposals in Oxfordshire.\nYou can view a webcast of the entire meeting on the Cherwell District Council website here http://modgov.cherwell.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=114&MId=3240&Ver=4",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_oxfordshire-county-council_page_2/content_405.html": "At the full Cherwell District Council meeting in February I brought a motion calling for a more joined up approach to flooding response in our area and across Oxfordshire which was passed unanimously by members of the council.\nThe motion called for areas that are at risk of flooding to establish a ‘flood resilient community’, including the formation of local flood response groups and forums for residents to feedback information on current and potential flooding risks,\nTo support these groups I suggested the setting up of local flood response stores to provide locally available flood alleviation equipment. I had hoped that there would be funding for this, but there was some push back on this from the County Council due to shortage of money. I still don’t think that’s good enough and will be pursuing this more fully in the future.\nThe motion also said that updated surveys and maintenance programs, with maps of drainage and flood defences and associated repair responsibilities should be published regularly to help local groups and response agencies to maintain and monitor them.\nFinally I called on risk management agencies across the county to set up a cooperative task force, including the provision of a centralised contact point which can trigger an immediate, proportionate response to all emergency flooding events. It is envisaged that all local councils and other agencies would play a part in this.\nFlooding in Yarnton\nI was very glad we managed to debate this motion, even though it only just made it before the new 11pm guillotine imposed by the Conservatives in the recent constitutional review. If it hadn’t been discussed at this meeting, it would have been another 5 months before it would have been heard and obviously we could be facing many more flood incidents before then.\nAs a councillor, I’ve been trying to help local residents deal with flooding in both my Parish and District council wards. It’s become apparent that there is no central co-ordination and no single contact point that can be called on to manage flooding at all levels. Smaller floods are often given a low priority by the relevant agencies and even the new guidance issued by the County and District councils doesn’t provide a timely response to these incidents.\nCherwell District Council recently resumed responsibility for flood defence in the region and as we also work closely with the county council we are in a unique position to take some leadership on this issue and improve responses to these distressing and costly incidents. This is even more important in areas like Yarnton and Begbroke which have been flooded recently and where the council has recently identified areas for development as part of the local plan review.\nCovering areas in tarmac and concrete is only going to increase the likelihood of flooding and we need to ensure that suitable and long lasting flood alleviation measures are included along with responsibility for maintenance.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2015_01_page_2/content_372.html": "After what seems like centuries of wrangling, planning applications, withdrawn projects, hand shaking and head banging, Oxford is finally set to join other cities with a giant shiny shopping centre nobody really needs any more.\nHaving experienced the damage that these behemoths can do to small local retailers, myself included, this is a moment I and many others have dreaded.\nThe council of course has applied a heavy spin on the whole project, whilst ushering the developers and large multi-nationals into the city with wide-eyed certainty that a new shopping centre will solve all the problems we now have.\nWe know at least one of those problems – that of affordable housing in the city centre – won’t even be dented by this grandiose project. In a move that is frankly baffling from a socialist led council, planners have dashed all hopes that the accommodation element designed into the revamped centre would be for social housing or affordable homes. Whilst Green councillors opposed this move, others apparently felt that poorer people won’t be able to keep the new apartments up to the standards they expect to be demanded.\nSo no comfortable inner-city pied-à-terres for the ordinary folk of Oxford then. Which is a shame considering Oxford City Council provided virtually nothing for that sector last year, despite claims that this was a priority policy.\nJobs are not the only thing to consider\nJudging by the analyses carried out over the past 10 years it looks highly likely that the new Westgate extension in Oxford will have a significant impact on other retail destinations both in the immediate vicinity and county wide.\nThe council has claimed that 3400 jobs will be created by the opening of the new centre, which seems like a rather optimistic number to me. Even if one accepts that figure, previous analyses have suggested that the number of jobs created will be far outweighed by those that will be destroyed elsewhere in the city and the surrounding areas.\nIt’s very easy to focus just on the number of jobs created, but when similar centres have opened there have been many casualties in other areas. This doesn’t even take into account the damage that’s likely to be done to trade during the building and infrastructure works and the impact of additional competition for small retailers that attracting large multi-nationals into the area will provide.\nIn an era where many retail chains are looking to reduce their portfolios, the time for this centre has been and gone. There’s already plenty of retail space in Oxford city centre, some of it lying vacant even now. Until the council addresses the systemic issues with people visiting the city, such as parking, local transport and city centre management, a revamped shopping centre isn’t going to add that much prosperity to a town encircled by much better alternatives.\nThe new shopping centre will likely have some novelty value for a few months, but once the realities of trading in Oxford begin to bite, I doubt it’ll be anything more than another usual-suspect clone-town brand zoo.\nYears of disruption\nAccording to a recent article in the Oxford Mail, a scrutinising committee of city centre councillors are due to meet to discuss ways of keeping businesses alive during the hugely disruptive infrastructure works needed for the new extension.\nSo Oxford City Council wait until AFTER the works have begun to think about how to mitigate the problems that will inevitably be caused by the works?\nAnother great example of the forethought and careful planning we’ve come to expect from our wonderful city council!\nI was at a meeting with both the city and county council leaders over a year ago where I highlighted the potential damage that will be done by the infrastructure works required for the Westgate extension. Having already experienced the same in Bristol a few years before, it was clear to me and many others that the likely upheaval required for the Westgate works were going to do more damage than they were likely to be worth in the current climate.\nSeems like it all fell on deaf ears. As usual.\nEmpty shops\nMy business in Cornmarket Street closed it’s doors for the last time after 20 years last year. Despite numerous pronouncements in the press that the city council was eager to support local businesses, we got zip-all support, even after asking on several occasions. Indeed, at one point their planning department were very close to scuppering the only deal we could achieve to sell the store. Had they not done a last minute U-turn there would have been one more empty and un-lettable shop in the city centre.\nCouncillors are also now apparently worried about the growing number of empty shops in the city, despite previous claims that there were queues of businesses eager to take space. Perhaps news has started to filter out that retailing in Oxford is not what it once was?\nIn that context one has to wonder who is going to populate the new cathedral of consumption when it is finally completed, and for those that do take up residence, what kind of trading environment will they find? With 40% of retail leases across the country coming up for renewal at the end of this year, it really does beg the question about how much space will be required when the Westgate centre is completed in 2017. Moreover what will the rest of the city look like once all the remaining viable stores have de-camped into the waiting warmth of a lovely new mall?\nWith council plans to push up the cost of parking YET AGAIN and the negative impact of roadworks, and the city centre looking like a building site, it’s likely most consumers will continue to go elsewhere to shop, surrounded as we are by much more attractive and easily reached locations around the city and the county. And once again, experience tells me that once people find better alternatives, they’re unlikely to return, other than for a quick nose around the new development.\nA committee composed of councillors with absolutely no idea how businesses in Oxford operate, setting out to ‘examine’ how to deal with these issues now, is tantamount to closing the door after the horse has bolted, lived out it’s natural life and ended up in a dog food tin. This project as has been in the planning stages for so many years it’s truly staggering that the implications are only being discussed now.\nOxford is of course known as the city of ‘dreaming spires’. It seems that in terms of strategic planning, many of our councillors have also been asleep on the job.",

I was tweeted tonight by a parent led group campaigning against cuts in school funding in Oxfordshire asking if I realised just how bad the situation was.\nAt this point I’m the only candidate to reply. But maybe the others will catch up later.\nBut playing catch-up seems to be the way for our education system, with a report coming out only a few days ago on the dire state of repair of some school buildings. As someone who went to school in the 70s, I find it shocking that we should have let our education system become so under-valued in such a short period of time.\nMy best friend from back in those days keeps in touch with me, and he has just retired as a senior head teacher. He now does consultancy work for schools that are suffering under the same system he battled through. Essentially the privatisation of our education system that does little to help students and puts a lot of money into the pockets of Academy shareholders.\nThe future of our children should not be for sale to the highest bidder, and we should not be seeing a situation where parents have to raise hundreds of pounds to subsidise books or pay for bus passes so their children can actually get to school. Again, I remember free bus passes for school-children, but that seems like a long-lost utopia now.\nWe need an education system that provides opportunity to everyone. Schools that cater for all levels of ability and aspiration. The chance for everyone who wants to move on to further and higher education to do so without saddling themselves with a lifetime of debt.\nWe also need to value our teachers and educators, paying them a decent salary and ensuring they have fair conditions to work in. Like doctors and nurses they are taken far too much for granted and expected to cope with appalling stress simply because they are dedicated people.\nThe Conservative’s promises of extra funding don’t come close to addressing the problems that have been stored up over the past 10 years. Their so-called ‘extra’ spending amounts to nothing more than setting the clock back to the point before they imposed austerity on us all.\nSee the Green Party Manifesto by clicking here. Go to page 55 to see our comprehensive range of proposals and policies about revitalising our education system and bringing schools into the 21sct century, whilst unlocking the potential of students and teachers at all levels.\nA proper education for the next generation should be a priority for all of us.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_county-council-elections/content_8.html": "Tomorrow you have the chance to vote in one of the most historic elections in this country for many years.\nThis is going to be the last County Council election before both County and district Councils are abolished under plans being pushed forward by national government. Elections after this one are most likely to be associated with the new Unitary Authority which will be formed in Oxfordshire, although currently exactly what form that will take is unclear.\nThe option preferred by the Greens is one of 2 unitaries formed from Cherwell District, West Oxfordshire District and The City Councils with a second one formed around South Oxon and the Vale plus West Berkshire. We feel that would keep decision making as local as possible as well as ensuring that councillors don’t become too remote from the people they represent. The County Council Cabinet recently voted to push forward their preferred option of one huge council across the whole of the County, while the City Council are proposing they form their own Unitary Council by absorbing areas around them such as Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke. I would certainly strongly oppose that, as, I believe, would most of the residents in those areas!\nThe outcome of all these options could largely be driven by those people elected to the County Council tomorrow, so not only is it important to vote because it may be your last opportunity, it’s also doubly important that you get a councillor who is going to represent your views on what your future council may look like.\nOf course my advice is to vote Green at least in areas where you already have a Green Councillor such as the two new Divisions in Kidlington which make up nearly 80% of the area I currently represent on the County Council. As I can’t be in 2 places at once I have decided to stand in the new East Division because I am involved in several ongoing issues there, Not least the proposed football stadium and the huge Oxford North development. But my fellow Green Councillor Fiona Mawson is standing in the other part, now called Kidlington West even though 2 thirds of it comprises Yarnton and Begbroke. As the only candidate in this election that actually lives in that new division, I’m hopeful that she will get a good reception from voters.\nto show Green and Conservative representation\nCurrently the whole of the Kidlington East area is represented by me as the County Councillor and by me, Fiona and Linda Ward as District councillors. I’d like to think we’ve done a good job of representing the everyone there, we all certainly work hard to achieve that, so I hope I will receive your support in the East whilst Fiona is elected to replace me in the West.\nIt’s a rather complicated scenario , especially given that the whole set up is likely to change in 2 or 3 years so neither of us are likely to see out a full term as County Councillors, but in the meantime it’s important that both areas keep consistent Green representation so that work I and Fiona have started on things like ensuring development proposals are beneficial to the area can continue into the next few years, along with our input into the re-shaping of local government over the next 2 years.\nHowever you vote (and I hope it will be Green) do make sure you vote. It may be the only chance you get to make a decision that affects you and your local community for the next few years.\nIf you need any further information from me or Fiona please let us know.

Begbroke and Yarnton and plonk 4400 houses in the middle of an area with overloaded roads and infrastructure. A plan that would see the three communities amalgamated into one sprawling conurbation, created not to serve local affordable housing needs, but to supposedly provide housing for workers in the city, even though most of the jobs are based in the east.\nYou can read the full response here\nAs everyone involved knows the oft-touted claims that this will include so-called ‘affordable’ housing is laughable. Valuable green belt land will become ten times more valuable once it becomes ripe for development and the landowners and luxury house builders will stand to make a fortune.\nI along with several others were allowed a five minute representation to the councillors in the chamber, some of whom it was later reported couldn’t even be bothered to listen to those who had come to plead their case. One was even photographed using a mobile phone during the speeches!\nSeeing the lack of connectedness demonstrated by the predominately Conservative council enraged me more than I imagined it would.

They deserve their time to speak just as I and the other campaigners had. But being the last to have their say (as Cllr Wood ensured he would be) they were able to simply brush aside the very salient points raised by protesters and other councillors.\nTory councillor after Tory councillor stood up and gave no logical reason why these plans should be forced through in the face of what everyone recognised was an historic level of opposition from the people in the district they represent.\nOver 1500 responses were given to the plans, nearly all of them objecting to this wanton and unnecessary destruction of our precious green belt. Yet the council seemed oblivious to them, to the cogent arguments put forward by speakers and even to the legal opinions that were presented by the two main campaigning groups.\nThe cavalier attitude of Barry Wood, who I’d previously challenged for seeming to pre-judge the outcome of the consultation, was amply demonstrated when he and his fellow councillors abdicated their responsibility to the people of Cherwell and threw their objections at the feet of the planning inspector.\nHis closing argument was that it was the inspector who would make the final decision not them, even though they were elected to represent us. As I suspected months ago, the council had already made its mind up, and the consultation was simply a box ticking exercise. The fate of our green spaces, our wildlife habitats, our clean air and the distinctiveness of our communities has been thrown into the lap of an outside agency because the Tories on the council didn’t have the guts or the inclination to properly consider the alternatives.\nSo I hope you’ll forgive me some heckling out of pure frustration at the lack of professionalism and respect for democracy being shown by these people.\nThat’s why I want to win this election. I want a guaranteed voice in that chamber so that I can represent the views of the people in Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke – an area that is so remote from that chamber, way up at the other end of the district that people like Barry Wood and Colin Clarke feel it’s safe to throw us all under the bus for the sake of expediency.\nIt’s also why the Green Party in Kidlington is working with the Liberal Democrats in this election to elect me in Kidlington East and Alaric Rose in Kidlington West. You can see our joint statement about that here.\nI hope you’ll give me and Alaric a chance to be a strong voice for you after May 3rd.\nYou can see the full video of the planning meeting (including the heckling) on the Cherwell District Council Website.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_rochester-and-strood/content_334.html": "This is a piece I wrote for Huffington Post earlier this week. I think it speaks for itself, although after it was published I thought I should have pointed out that none of the the politicians I refer to in the studio on election night were Greens. As usual we weren’t invited to the BBC party. There were however representatives from Labour, Conservative, Libdems and UKIP. Given that the Greens had a reasonably good showing in the last General Election in Rochester (for a ‘marginal’ party) I’d have thought we’d have been worth a mention at least. But apparently not.\nAnyway I hope this serves as a good first post on my website/blog and you can see the original article here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/westminster-politics_b_6199214.html?utm_hp_ref=tw.\nFeel free to comment below or on the original article on the Huffington Post site.\nI recently became a parliamentary candidate for the Green Party. After years of railing against politicians, the irony, and perhaps the hypocrisy, of becoming one myself has not been lost on me.\nThen again, there were the constant jibes about my complaining a lot but doing nothing positive to make a change. So when my local party group asked me to stand, I said I’d give it a go. And here I am. Feel free to point the finger.\nOne of the first things I’ve noticed about the underbelly of politics is just how strategic it is. Target wards, target seats, candidates standing in constituencies where they don’t live for the sake of political expediency. None of this is new, or unusual, or even un-democratic, but it does take some getting used to.\nBut watching the BBC election special on the Rochester and Strood by-election, you could be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the political world has turned into some kind of wife swapping party from the mid 70s. It seems these days that political manoeuvring between the ruling parties has moved beyond juggling their own family jewels, and has been reduced to chucking their keys into the fruit bowl with anyone who fancies a quick fumble with their majority.\nFirstly we had UKIP’s Deputy Chairperson Suzanne Evans being interviewed about where her party would go after the predicted win in Rochester. This consisted of a serious of nods and winks about who might and might not leap out of their own party bed and sneak into theirs when the neighbours weren’t looking. A sort of Carry-On Westminster, but with less laughs.\nShe then went on to explain, with barely concealed glee, that her fondest ambition was to seduce someone from Labour to join in their little tryst. Nigel is apparently talking to a couple of MPs but she couldn’t reveal more. She did everything but tap the side of her nose, elbow Andrew Neil in the ribs and give a little Babs Windsor giggle.\nThen we had an analysis from a political expert explaining how UKIP’s performance in the by-election would determine how other sitting MPs would behave in the run up to next years general election. His premise was that if UKIP did well in Rochester, many other career politicians would be considering their position in the next few months. The expectation is apparently that if they think UKIP is a better bet for them to hold on to their seat (ooh matron!), then they would switch allegiances in order to do so.\nNow you’ll have to excuse me. I’m quite new to this game. But when one joins a party isn’t there something about ideology written into the contract? Or am I now being ridiculously naive?\nJudging by the behaviour of at least two recent pantheons of British democracy I suppose I am. It seems that standing on a platform with a bunch of like minded individuals in the hope of doing something good for the country isn’t what it’s about any more.\nNo, apparently it’s more about hanging on to the House Of Commons parking place, the expense account, and access to the House of Commons bar, rather than the boring stuff like philosophical conviction. Some back-benchers are evidently more interested in maintaining a comfortable position for themselves, rather than for their constituents. Yet, in true British carry-on style, they still keep getting elected.\nAs a newcomer to this world, I saw with fresh eyes last night these four sombre suited politicians sitting uneasily with each other, smugly carving up the political cake amongst themselves. Like children at birthday party trying to decide who gets the last portion of jelly and ice cream, the polemic was about anything other than the issues that this country and the planet really face.\nIain Duncan Smith spent a good deal of his time justifying a particularly vituperative campaign poster that portrayed the idea of voting for Mark Reckless as on a par with seeking Pol Pot as a spiritual adviser. Reckless used to be an investment banker, he didn’t live in the area, he’d only moved there to take a safe seat. All very salient points for the local electorate, but ones that seemed exquisitely irrelevant when he was the Conservative MP only a few months ago.\nMeanwhile UKIP expounded their claim that they listened to the people, and were offering an alternative to the status quo of careerist politicians who’d never done a days honest labour in their lives. Odd then that their success last night, and in Clacton a few weeks ago, relied on exactly the reverse of those ideals by welcoming with open arms two MPs firmly rooted in the rotten political establishment they claimed to despise.\nOn the point of principle I am in total agreement with them. The current political establishment has reduced democracy to the level of swapping football cards in the playground. But it’s a tawdry game of top trumps that they have just as much of a hand in as all the other entrenched Westminster parties.\nIf this is the future of politics in this country, I’m glad to be a member of a party that currently stands as an exemplar of how it is still possible to operate democratically without playing these cynical games. We may now have one less MP than UKIP, but at least ours is there on merit, rather than because she swapped her rosette for a more appealing colour.\nAnd Caroline Lucas has just won MP of the year, which is something that gives me hope. Even so, she’s now the focus of a campaign to unseat her by the Labour party in Brighton, because, and despite of the fact, that Labour and the Greens share many of the same aims.\nMoreover, if all these people care about is hanging on to their positions at all costs, what really is the point? And if the electorate is so fickle that they can’t see through this charade, maybe we deserve the graceless, flagitious mess they all seem to be making of the world.\nOne apocryphal anecdote from Rochester I heard today was that someone had voted UKIP because the sitting Tory MP hadn’t done enough for the local area. If that’s true, it’s an indictment of the great British voter more demoralising than anything supposedly implied by hanging a flag out of the window of your mock-Georgian semi.\nBut as an accidental politician I have to hope that it isn’t true, or at least typical. I have to trust that people in the UK will see past all the identikit politicos, the vested interests and the horse trading of their democratic heritage, and vote for real change and genuine representation in the next government.\nI am ever the optimist.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_local-government/content_4.html": "Tomorrow you have the chance to vote in one of the most historic elections in this country for many years.\nThis is going to be the last County Council election before both County and district Councils are abolished under plans being pushed forward by national government. Elections after this one are most likely to be associated with the new Unitary Authority which will be formed in Oxfordshire, although currently exactly what form that will take is unclear.\nThe option preferred by the Greens is one of 2 unitaries formed from Cherwell District, West Oxfordshire District and The City Councils with a second one formed around South Oxon and the Vale plus West Berkshire. We feel that would keep decision making as local as possible as well as ensuring that councillors don’t become too remote from the people they represent. The County Council Cabinet recently voted to push forward their preferred option of one huge council across the whole of the County, while the City Council are proposing they form their own Unitary Council by absorbing areas around them such as Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke. I would certainly strongly oppose that, as, I believe, would most of the residents in those areas!\nThe outcome of all these options could largely be driven by those people elected to the County Council tomorrow, so not only is it important to vote because it may be your last opportunity, it’s also doubly important that you get a councillor who is going to represent your views on what your future council may look like.\nOf course my advice is to vote Green at least in areas where you already have a Green Councillor such as the two new Divisions in Kidlington which make up nearly 80% of the area I currently represent on the County Council. As I can’t be in 2 places at once I have decided to stand in the new East Division because I am involved in several ongoing issues there, Not least the proposed football stadium and the huge Oxford North development. But my fellow Green Councillor Fiona Mawson is standing in the other part, now called Kidlington West even though 2 thirds of it comprises Yarnton and Begbroke. As the only candidate in this election that actually lives in that new division, I’m hopeful that she will get a good reception from voters.\nto show Green and Conservative representation\nCurrently the whole of the Kidlington East area is represented by me as the County Councillor and by me, Fiona and Linda Ward as District councillors. I’d like to think we’ve done a good job of representing the everyone there, we all certainly work hard to achieve that, so I hope I will receive your support in the East whilst Fiona is elected to replace me in the West.\nIt’s a rather complicated scenario , especially given that the whole set up is likely to change in 2 or 3 years so neither of us are likely to see out a full term as County Councillors, but in the meantime it’s important that both areas keep consistent Green representation so that work I and Fiona have started on things like ensuring development proposals are beneficial to the area can continue into the next few years, along with our input into the re-shaping of local government over the next 2 years.\nHowever you vote (and I hope it will be Green) do make sure you vote. It may be the only chance you get to make a decision that affects you and your local community for the next few years.\nIf you need any further information from me or Fiona please let us know. We have knocked on a lot of doors over the past few months, so if we missed you we’d be happy to talk.",

Greens did not vote in favour of either the Conservatives or an unworkable Labour minority administration.\nThe deal had been all but agreed and a press statement signed off by all parties when, in a surprise announcement last Tuesday, Labour said that their National executive had vetoed the arrangement and wouldn’t allow the alliance to be ratified with a Green member on the executive. As the Greens formed slightly more than 10% of the proposed alliance it was reasonable for them to expect one executive position on a 10 person committee. It was proposed that they would take the Environment portfolio.\nAs a result, no agreement could be reached over who would lead the council and the meeting was adjourned to give negotiations one more try. Labour subsequently refused to return to the negotiating table and instead added to their list of demands which further undermined the deal.\nSpeaking after the meeting Green Group Leader and Deputy Leader of the Progressive Oxfordshire Group Ian Middleton said :\n“Greens are bitterly disappointed that we have not been able to fulfil our promise to the electorate and take joint control of the council from the Conservatives. We apologise to residents for that but Labour made it impossible to agree an equitable deal that they would have been a significant part of with 50% of the Executive seats. We only asked for one seat on a 10 seat executive which was proportionate in view of us making up slightly more that 10% of the total alliance.\nHaving originally agreed to this arrangement, Labour suddenly pulled the plug citing diktats from their National Executive which local members have capitulated to. Considering this will also cut Labour out of an alliance as well as joint leadership of the council, this seems incredibly short-sighted.\nIt seems Labour would rather allow a minority of 20 Conservatives to stay in control of the council than accept one Green on the executive. They also demanded that Labour should be leader, which none of the Progressive Oxfordshire Group were comfortable with considering Cllr Woodcock’s disingenuous statements in the media surrounding the collapse of talks.\nWe were faced with impossible demands from Labour whose faceless National Executive committee are dictating to local Cherwell residents over who should be in control of their council. Greens strongly support localism, but it seems Labour would rather allow their central office to force a Conservative administration on to our communities.\nGreens have worked hard over the last 5 years, along with the Liberal Democrats and Independents to reduce the Conservative majority to the point where we would have been able to take joint control with Labour. In that time we have taken 13 Conservative seats whilst Labour have only taken 3. With 3 members, the Greens make up the deciding majority and should rightfully have a seat at the table.\nIt’s quite clear that Labour have betrayed the people of Cherwell by focusing on their own political interests rather than those of the electorate. From now on, every terrible decision and policy that the Conservatives push through can be laid at the feet of Labour. Every appalling injustice imposed on our community as a result of Conservative control can be traced back to this moment.\nGreens will now be part of a strong opposition on CDC rather than in an unstable alliance with Labour. We will continue work along with our Liberal Democrat and Independent colleagues in the spirit of co-operation that Labour have rejected and hold the Conservatives to account as part of a strengthened official opposition.\nWe are confident that together we can win enough additional seats next year to take control without Labour’s help and will do so at the first opportunity. The door is still open for Labour to come to their senses and agree a fair deal with us to take control of the council at any point during the year. In the meantime the Conservatives plans, including further green belt erosion as part of their local plan and a lack of genuine affordable housing will be resisted to the best of our ability. We hope Labour will at least join us in supporting that endeavour”",

Begbroke and Yarnton and plonk 4400 houses in the middle of an area with overloaded roads and infrastructure. A plan that would see the three communities amalgamated into one sprawling conurbation, created not to serve local affordable housing needs, but to supposedly provide housing for workers in the city, even though most of the jobs are based in the east.\nYou can read the full response here\nAs everyone involved knows the oft-touted claims that this will include so-called ‘affordable’ housing is laughable. Valuable green belt land will become ten times more valuable once it becomes ripe for development and the landowners and luxury house builders will stand to make a fortune.\nI along with several others were allowed a five minute representation to the councillors in the chamber, some of whom it was later reported couldn’t even be bothered to listen to those who had come to plead their case. One was even photographed using a mobile phone during the speeches!\nSeeing the lack of connectedness demonstrated by the predominately Conservative council enraged me more than I imagined it would. If you watch the video footage from the planning meeting a few weeks ago you can hear me heckling quite loudly throughout some of speeches from Barry Wood and Colin Clarke.\nNormally I wouldn’t do something like that. They deserve their time to speak just as I and the other campaigners had. But being the last to have their say (as Cllr Wood ensured he would be) they were able to simply brush aside the very salient points raised by protesters and other councillors.\nTory councillor after Tory councillor stood up and gave no logical reason why these plans should be forced through in the face of what everyone recognised was an historic level of opposition from the people in the district they represent.\nOver 1500 responses were given to the plans, nearly all of them objecting to this wanton and unnecessary destruction of our precious green belt. Yet the council seemed oblivious to them, to the cogent arguments put forward by speakers and even to the legal opinions that were presented by the two main campaigning groups.\nThe cavalier attitude of Barry Wood, who I’d previously challenged for seeming to pre-judge the outcome of the consultation, was amply demonstrated when he and his fellow councillors abdicated their responsibility to the people of Cherwell and threw their objections at the feet of the planning inspector.\nHis closing argument was that it was the inspector who would make the final decision not them, even though they were elected to represent us.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_elections/content_225.html": "It’s hard to believe it’s 4 years since I was elected as the first Green County Councillor in Cherwell in 2021 during the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. It was a worrying time for all of us and as a new County Councillor I had to quickly come to terms with my new responsibilities whilst navigating remote meetings and all the various limitations that were placed on all of us in our day to day lives. I know people who were personally affected by the virus and some that still are. Thankfully I and most of my family came out unscathed, although I did lose a close family member to the virus who I still miss today.\nCovid now seems like a distant memory as we all deal with other issues, not least the cost of living crisis, the ongoing lack of affordable housing and the pressures on our health service. We are also about to see seismic changes in the way local government operates which means that this is likely to be the last County Council election in Oxfordshire.\nWe also have boundary changes to the County Council which sees my current division of Kidlington South split into 2 new divisions – Kidlington East and Kidlington West. This left me with a dilemma about which division to stand in for this election. Ultimately I chose Kidlington East which includes most of the area that is also covered by my District Council Ward. I’ve dealt with a lot of casework in this part of my current division and there are still a number of ongoing issues so I feel I have to try to maintain some contiunity there.\nWe do also have a strong Green candidate in Kidlington West though, which includes Yarnton and Begbroke as well as Roundham ward in Kidlington. My wife and fellow councillor District and Parish Councillor Fiona Mawson is standing there and I hope she will be able to provide some continuity of representation there, as well as building on her 10 years experience as a Yarnton Parish Councillor where she is currently the Deputy Chair.\nOver the next 2-3 years there will also be a further reorganisation of local government which will see a single authority combining the remits of both the District and the County Council. The details of how this will be achieved are still being hammered out but there are concerns that moving to a larger, more remote authority could reduce local engagement.\nThere are also moves being made by the City Council to expand their borders to swallow up areas like Kidlington, Gosford, Yarnton and Begbroke into one larger authority. I don’t think that’s what local residents want. Neither do I think it will be in their best interests. So I will be fighting to maintain the integrity of all our local villages to prevent us becoming just a suburb of Oxford city.\nOn top of this we have to deal with the creation of a new local plan amidst sweeping changes to the planning process which could also see a significant erosion of local democracy. This is likely to lead to even more erosion of our surrounding green spaces, especially if the City Council get their way.\nSo it’s clear that, during the next few years, we will need strong voices at all levels of local government in Oxfordshire to ensure we end up with a workable model that truly represents local residents and responds to their needs. I would like to continue to be that voice for Kidlington East\nWhilst I hope we won’t be facing anything on the scale of Covid again for a very long time, there could be other equally disruptive events on the world stage coming our way. We are now seeing the impacts of climate change on our communities with increased incidents of flooding which has brought misery to many residents. I’m working hard to try to reduce the impact of that and we’ve seen new measures introduced locally to support residents faced with the threat of flooding. I am continuing to push for more.\nSo I hope you will choose to support me again in the County Elections on May 1st to work for you as probably your last county councillor before the changes are made to local government structures. I still feel there’s work to be done in the division, not least in the face of some of the new developments that over the next few years that could have significant impacts on all our lives along with the challenges posed by national government and global events.\nI’m trying to get round to meet as many people on the doorstep as possible, but with all the changes going on at the moment, it’s a huge task. If you’d like me to come and see you to discuss any local issues please contact me and I’ll try to arrange something. Otherwise feel free to email, message or call me.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2017_06_11_thanks-once-again/content_166.html": "I didn’t think I’d be here writing a second thank you post so soon after the last one. In fact I didn’t really expect to be doing this all again. For someone who isn’t a natural politician, I thought in 2015 that once in a lifetime was enough.\nBut we did it all again and I have to say I enjoyed most of it as much as I did last time.\nI will admit though that the come-down from this campaign has been much harder given that I failed to build on the vote achieved last time. In fact it was reduced, mainly by virtue of people believing they were voting for Jeremy Corbyn.\nI do have to say, as I said numerous times during the campaign, Labour had no hopes of winning in this constituency. The Labour candidate is also no supporter of Corbyn. In fact I support him more than he does!\nSo those previously loyal Green voters who switched this time to Labour really did nothing to help towards a Labour victory in Westminster and have arguably done some damage to the Greens.\nThe number of votes cast in a general election does count for each party. Not just in electoral terms but also in terms of how much government money is given to that party to continue to be part of the democratic process, something known as ‘short money’. We also have the deposits in each constituency, which at £500 a time is money that a party like the Greens, who don’t have large corporate backers, can ill afford to lose.\nOver the whole country the Green vote fell by roughly 50% and that was certainly the case in Banbury. As a result there may well be a lot less chances to vote Green next time we have an election, especially if that’s any time soon. Much of the funds generated in this election will go towards leaflets, deposits and other expenses. The reduction in ‘short money’ will be something of a blow too.\nSo your vote and your support for the Greens really matters, whether we win or not. Labour won’t face the loss of their deposits and, with hundreds of MP in Parliament and now hundreds of thousands of members, they won’t be short of funds either.\nPlease remember that next time you think about abandoning the party you say you otherwise support. We’re only here because of that support, and when it’s removed we quickly lose the ability to give you the choice to vote Green in the future.\nEvery one of those 1250 people who took the trouble to support a party they truly believe in and give me their precious vote yesterday has my personal thanks.\nI am of course disappointed that there weren’t more, especially as there were over twice that number just two years ago when our policies were just are relevant as they are now.\nThe dash to Labour was perhaps understandable in the context of Jeremy Corbyn’s popular appeal, but in a constituency like Banbury and vote for any of the progressive parties would have sent a message of hope and defiance just as effectively as one for Labour.\nSadly, in solidly safe seats like Banbury it’s very unlikely that one party will ever loosen the stranglehold being applied by The Conservatives, so we have to work together as the Greens have done in other constituencies.\nWhilst I congratulate Sean for achieving an impressive increase on his vote share, he was still some 12000 votes away from a win. All the time Labour and the Conservatives continue to reject the electoral reform proposed by Greens and the Libdems we’re very unlikely to see individual votes changing the outcome of elections like these.\nI’m very pleased on a national level to see The Conservatives on ever more shaky ground and I hope all the other opposition parties in Westminster will work together to thwart what will probably be a severe and extreme right coalition between the Tories and the DUP. I think we see now that this election was less about the good of the country and more about Theresa May clinging on to power at any cost.\nAs always, it was truly depressing to see the Conservative vote increase in number in a constituency that should be acutely aware of the damage they are likely to wreak on public services, the NHS and in particular the Horton Hospital which is now very likely to be completely downgraded or closed if the Conservatives maintain power.\nThanks to everyone who worked on my campaign and to the other candidates for a clean and well fought fight. I hope going forward, progressive parties in Banbury may work more closely together to achieve real social change and electoral reform, that way we can ensure every voice and every vote counts in the future.",

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2021_03_23_green-fight-for-greater-flood-protection/content_281.html": "At the full Cherwell District Council meeting in February I brought a motion calling for a more joined up approach to flooding response in our area and across Oxfordshire which was passed unanimously by members of the council.\nThe motion called for areas that are at risk of flooding to establish a ‘flood resilient community’, including the formation of local flood response groups and forums for residents to feedback information on current and potential flooding risks,\nTo support these groups I suggested the setting up of local flood response stores to provide locally available flood alleviation equipment. I had hoped that there would be funding for this, but there was some push back on this from the County Council due to shortage of money. I still don’t think that’s good enough and will be pursuing this more fully in the future.\nThe motion also said that updated surveys and maintenance programs, with maps of drainage and flood defences and associated repair responsibilities should be published regularly to help local groups and response agencies to maintain and monitor them.\nFinally I called on risk management agencies across the county to set up a cooperative task force, including the provision of a centralised contact point which can trigger an immediate, proportionate response to all emergency flooding events. It is envisaged that all local councils and other agencies would play a part in this.\nFlooding in Yarnton\nI was very glad we managed to debate this motion, even though it only just made it before the new 11pm guillotine imposed by the Conservatives in the recent constitutional review. If it hadn’t been discussed at this meeting, it would have been another 5 months before it would have been heard and obviously we could be facing many more flood incidents before then.\nAs a councillor, I’ve been trying to help local residents deal with flooding in both my Parish and District council wards. It’s become apparent that there is no central co-ordination and no single contact point that can be called on to manage flooding at all levels. Smaller floods are often given a low priority by the relevant agencies and even the new guidance issued by the County and District councils doesn’t provide a timely response to these incidents.\nCherwell District Council recently resumed responsibility for flood defence in the region and as we also work closely with the county council we are in a unique position to take some leadership on this issue and improve responses to these distressing and costly incidents. This is even more important in areas like Yarnton and Begbroke which have been flooded recently and where the council has recently identified areas for development as part of the local plan review.\nCovering areas in tarmac and concrete is only going to increase the likelihood of flooding and we need to ensure that suitable and long lasting flood alleviation measures are included along with responsibility for maintenance.\nOne thought on “Greens Win Motion for Better Flood Response in Cherwell”",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2015_01/content_222.html": "Last week myself and John Haywood from the Banbury and Cherwell Green Party visited the market in central Banbury to speak to the stall holders about the changes being proposed to this 1000 year old tradition in the heart of an historic town.\nWe spoke with all the stallholders present, although sadly they were only 10 of them trading on the day. They were all all opposed to Cherwell District Council’s illogical and damaging decision to restrict the stalls to the Cornhill end of the Market Place. A plan also supported by the Conservative controlled Town Council.\nI started my own 25 year long retail career on a market stall, and worked it for 7 years with my partner though rain, hail sleet, snow and sunshine. I know how difficult it can be to make a living and how fragile the trading environment can be. Your livelihood can depend on so many variable factors, and one of the major fears is losing your regular pitch, for whatever reason.\nIt may seem silly to anyone who hasn’t traded in a market themselves, but where your stall sits can make all the difference between success and failure. The location of competing trades, the flow of people moving through the market, who your neighbours are, your visibility and prominence in the market as a whole are all desperately important.\nThere appears to have been absolutely no consultation with stall holders or customers about these unpopular changes, and based on what stallholders and visitors told me I foresee them being the death knell for this historic trading post as more and more traders fall by the wayside.\nSo what seems like a minor change to the council, will probably be anything but to the people trying to make a living out of the market. This move could likely kill it off! it’s already become smaller and therefore less popular, especially over the last 20 years. In 1997 there were 120 stalls, now its down to less than 20.\nConsidering it’s reduced pull for consumers it’s completely incongruous that the rents being charged by the private firm managing on behalf of the council are almost double that charged by neighbouring markets such as Abingdon, Aylesbury, Hinkley, Oxford and Thame. And as with most things these days, the rent goes up every year. Meanwhile trade is slowly dwindling away to nothing, leaving regular and loyal traders quite literally out in the cold.\nThe Council’s plan includes opening the Market car park for use on Thursdays and Fridays. There is no evidence to suggest this will increase car park usage and revenue to the Council – people already using other car parks such as that near to the Matalan Store will simply park in the market place instead.\nGovernment initiatives on town centre regeneration called for more emphasis and support for market days and the traders that build and run these vital hubs of trade and local amenity in our towns and cities. The Portas review cited markets as one of the easiest ways that town centres could be revitalised and kept alive. Why then is the Conservative run Cherwell Council ignoring the views of it’s own established market traders? Why are they proposing moves that could potentially irreparably damage trade in such an established and once vibrant local fixture?\nBanbury market should be seen by Cherwell Council as an asset to the town. They should be supporting it actively and engaging with the traders and customers to find ways of safeguarding the it’s future, rather than taking unilateral actions with no consultation.\nThis is a Charter Market, which bestows on Banbury the status of a Market Town. By birthright it should be located in the Market Square.\nI would urge Cherwell councillors to do what I did. Take a walk around the market and speak to the people whose livelihoods are in their hands. Speak also to the local residents and patrons of the market and ask them what they think about the priorities that they are planning to enforce on everyone.\nThis is not a decision that can be taken just by moving squares on a map.",

The river itself is not insubstantial, being deep enough in some areas to swim in, although these days you’d be brave to risk it given the level of E coli and other nasties lurking in its once crystal clear depths.\nI spoke to brilliant local councillor Genny Early about the history of the river that she’s lived near for the past 30 years and the tale was not a happy one. Where once you could look out from the local footbridge at fish swimming amongst the river weeds and watch local dogs play happily in the waters, we now have a soupy grey clag, virtually devoid of life and reputedly toxic to everyone including our canine companions.\nThe cause is toxic dumping from up to 9 different local sewage works, given effective carte blanche by the Conservative government to use this river, and others in the area, as an open sewer to enable companies like Thames Water to pay out record dividends to investors whilst doing next to nothing to fix inadequate infrastructure.\nThis is the starkest example of how privatisation has failed us all with greedy and cynical corporations grabbing every opportunity to make obscene amounts of money by (in this case) quite literally shitting on local communities.\nI made a video with Genny showing just how bad things have got in this area, in sickening contrast to the beautiful local landscape. You can watch it by clicking here.\nWe simply can’t allow this situation to continue and only the Greens have the real solution to take privatised utilities back into public control where they belong. Water is quite literally an essential for life on this planet. If we’ve reached the point where that is simply a commodity to be bartered between corporations on the open market we really have reached the bottom of a very murky barrel.\nGreens would take water and other essential public utilities and services back into public control as the only way to deal with this obscene failure of duty to keep our waterways and rivers clean and accessible for wildlife and recreation. Other parties are suggesting half way houses of fines and extra taxation. None of that will work in an industry that simply doesn’t care any more.\nWe need radical solutions to these unprecedented outcomes and only the Green Party has a vision bold enough to deliver those.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_green-councillors/content_257.html": "Green Councillors are different to most other council members. Greens come from all backgrounds and bring a wealth of experience to the job. Many run their own businesses or have done so in the past, so realise the pressures that are put on to small and medium sized enterprises. I co-founded and ran a large retail operation with branches all over the country, so I have a good insight into the problems now facing our post-Covid high streets.\nMany other councillors have come from academia or the various public sectors or just from the same background as the people they represent. I was born to a working family in East London and grew up in South East London/Kent where I attended a secondary modern school in the 70s.\nBut the one thing that has driven us all to take on the job of a councillor is a desire to make the world a better place for everyone and a willingness to fully represent and work for the people who have put their faith in us by giving us their vote.\nThe Green Party doesn’t operate a party whip. We always remember we are there to represent the people who voted for us, and we will always put people before party.\nAs a District Councillor, I’ve seen first hand how local government can work against the interests of our communities rather than for them.\nParty dogma is the main reason for this with councillors being fiercely whipped, especially by the Conservative leadership. This has resulted in some frankly bizarre outcomes with residents and council tax payers bearing the brunt.\nThe Green Party doesn’t operate a party whip. We always remember we are there to represent the people who voted for us, and we will always put people before party. Green councillors are free to vote how they see fit, which has resulted in far better outcomes for residents.\nFor example it only took one Green County Councillor, working across party lines, to secure 20MPH powers for local councils as part of the ’20 is plenty’ initiative. Of course other parties now claim credit for that great achievement, but we don’t mind, as long as our communities benefit.\nBut it’s on climate change that Greens really lead the way. While we’ve welcomed other parties into the climate awareness fold, they often still don’t get it. They don’t see environmentalism as literally a global issue, preferring to compartmentalise and focus only on their own operations.\nOf course that’s important, but in the midst of an emergency we have to tackle the problem at all levels, not just those that conveniently and comfortably coincide with other priorities such as exponential growth.\nFor all these reasons and many more, voting Green brings positive change for our communities and our planet. Change that’s needed now, before it’s too late.",

Recognised as one of the most expensive areas of the district to live in, Kidlington does have some affordable housing in areas but the problem is that most of it is owned and allocated by the City Council. Indeed large areas of the village have been given over to the city’s needs, not least Grovelands which was built almost entirely for the City Council’s use.\nAnd soon we’ll have even more, with the local plan partial review, which was adopted in 2020 after 3 years of objection and protest from local residents and pressure groups, providing yet more housing for the City’s needs with the 50% so-called affordable element having been signed over to the City Council’s control in a closed meeting during the first lockdown in 2020.\nWe all know that the term ‘affordable housing’ is virtually meaningless in Oxfordshire, but even so, very little is built in Kidlington. Even when the district council’s policy to to ensure that 30% of all new housing on larger estates is ‘affordable’, we hardly see anything being built that fulfils that criteria.\nThe flats above the Co-op were essentially given over to the flying school for their exclusive use, even though 3 of the apartments were meant to be available for residents needing affordable accommodation. At least 15 of those flats should have been designated affordable, but the district council messed up the planning application and we ended up with just 3 units available, with the rest being let on the open market. The agreement with developer in that case was so badly negotiated that in 3 years only 1 of those flats has been let on an affordable basis. The terms demand that the council must nominate someone within a 28 day window once a year which is almost impossible to do.\nFlats on the old Co-Op car park site now almost exclusively let to a local flying school at market rent\n15 more flats are due to be built on the Kidlington Garage site at the top of the Bicester Road. When the planning application was agreed the developers were supposed to provide £609,000 in lieu of the 5 affordable apartments. But 6 months later they returned to the planning committee with a viability assessment that argued they couldn’t afford to make any contribution at all. Nothing! Zilch!\nThis is because the government mandates that developers should be guaranteed a profit of 20% on all developments (how nice it would be for other businesses to be guaranteed a profit by the government!). This leaves it open for developers to game the system and make claims that they can’t meet this profitability threshold and thereby reduce or, as in this case, completely remove their responsibility to provide any affordable units or money in lieu.\nI and my fellow Green Councillor Fiona Mawson thought this was wrong and we tabled a motion to refuse the planning application if no affordable element was provided. Sadly, as we and our opposition group are outnumbered on the planning committee, the plans were approved by the Conservative majority.\nSubsequently I brought a motion to the council to increase our affordable requirement on larger developments from 30% to 50% to bring us in line with the City policy. As we have agreed to that percentage on the developments being built in and around Kidlington for the City Council, I thought it only fair that we should give our own residents the same consideration. I was pleased to see that the motion was passed almost unanimously.\nIt’s still sobering to think though that out of around 90 apartments that have been built in Kidlington in the past 5 years, only 3 have been designated affordable and as I explained above, out of those 3, only one has actually been let to a family that needed it.\nCherwell is desperately in need of a change of direction in this issue. We need a council who is prepared to stand up to developers and push for better deals for all our residents. Moreover we need to ensure more affordable developments are brought on line that will benefit local families rather than forcing them to split up as grown children need to move away from their area simply because they can’t afford a home of their own. I believe a change of administration next month could see that better direction and I hope to be a part of that.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_community_page_8/content_433.html": "I didn’t think I’d be here writing a second thank you post so soon after the last one. In fact I didn’t really expect to be doing this all again. For someone who isn’t a natural politician, I thought in 2015 that once in a lifetime was enough.\nBut we did it all again and I have to say I enjoyed most of it as much as I did last time.\nI will admit though that the come-down from this campaign has been much harder given that I failed to build on the vote achieved last time. In fact it was reduced, mainly by virtue of people believing they were voting for Jeremy Corbyn.\nI do have to say, as I said numerous times during the campaign, Labour had no hopes of winning in this constituency. The Labour candidate is also no supporter of Corbyn. In fact I support him more than he does!\nSo those previously loyal Green voters who switched this time to Labour really did nothing to help towards a Labour victory in Westminster and have arguably done some damage to the Greens.\nThe number of votes cast in a general election does count for each party. Not just in electoral terms but also in terms of how much government money is given to that party to continue to be part of the democratic process, something known as ‘short money’. We also have the deposits in each constituency, which at £500 a time is money that a party like the Greens, who don’t have large corporate backers, can ill afford to lose.\nOver the whole country the Green vote fell by roughly 50% and that was certainly the case in Banbury. As a result there may well be a lot less chances to vote Green next time we have an election, especially if that’s any time soon. Much of the funds generated in this election will go towards leaflets, deposits and other expenses. The reduction in ‘short money’ will be something of a blow too.\nSo your vote and your support for the Greens really matters, whether we win or not. Labour won’t face the loss of their deposits and, with hundreds of MP in Parliament and now hundreds of thousands of members, they won’t be short of funds either.\nPlease remember that next time you think about abandoning the party you say you otherwise support. We’re only here because of that support, and when it’s removed we quickly lose the ability to give you the choice to vote Green in the future.\nEvery one of those 1250 people who took the trouble to support a party they truly believe in and give me their precious vote yesterday has my personal thanks.\nI am of course disappointed that there weren’t more, especially as there were over twice that number just two years ago when our policies were just are relevant as they are now.\nThe dash to Labour was perhaps understandable in the context of Jeremy Corbyn’s popular appeal, but in a constituency like Banbury and vote for any of the progressive parties would have sent a message of hope and defiance just as effectively as one for Labour.\nSadly, in solidly safe seats like Banbury it’s very unlikely that one party will ever loosen the stranglehold being applied by The Conservatives, so we have to work together as the Greens have done in other constituencies.\nWhilst I congratulate Sean for achieving an impressive increase on his vote share, he was still some 12000 votes away from a win. All the time Labour and the Conservatives continue to reject the electoral reform proposed by Greens and the Libdems we’re very unlikely to see individual votes changing the outcome of elections like these.\nI’m very pleased on a national level to see The Conservatives on ever more shaky ground and I hope all the other opposition parties in Westminster will work together to thwart what will probably be a severe and extreme right coalition between the Tories and the DUP. I think we see now that this election was less about the good of the country and more about Theresa May clinging on to power at any cost.\nAs always, it was truly depressing to see the Conservative vote increase in number in a constituency that should be acutely aware of the damage they are likely to wreak on public services, the NHS and in particular the Horton Hospital which is now very likely to be completely downgraded or closed if the Conservatives maintain power.\nThanks to everyone who worked on my campaign and to the other candidates for a clean and well fought fight. I hope going forward, progressive parties in Banbury may work more closely together to achieve real social change and electoral reform, that way we can ensure every voice and every vote counts in the future.",

Not in terms of respect for his work, but more in quiet admiration for how he has managed to stay in a post that he is so singly unsuited to for so long.\nFrom the early days of being caught on tape plotting his dastardly revenge on Rupert Murdoch, through to the incompetent and catastrophic underselling of Royal Mail to city investors based on his quaint belief in the ‘gentlemen’s agreement’, this man has shown that he is about as qualified to be a Minister of State as he is to be an international gymnast.\nI once had a great deal of respect for Dr Vince. I remember he was even touted before the last election as being a candidate for Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the improbable event of the LibDems winning outright. Yet since he took on his government position he’s demonstrated his complete lack of influence and grasp in almost every issue he’s been involved with.\nHe has, throughout his tenure, made scary noises about what he’d do to the banks if they didn’t straighten up and fly right. Yet whenever they are found up to the armpits in the cookie jar, he fades quietly into the scenery like a withering wallflower, only to appear some time after the fact, sliding his glasses down his nose, staring myopically at the camera trying to look like he knows what he’s supposed to be talking about.\nEach time he promises to get tough next time, like the pub orator boasting about what he’ll do to anyone who crosses him, just as long as he never has to follow up his words with actions. And by the same token he does very little, if anything, to back up his chest puffing and table thumping.\nI’m sure on a personal level he’s a lovely chap. He looks, after all, like everyone’s favourite cuddly uncle. But in terms of his day job, he has all the business acumen of a used teabag, the bark of a housefly, and the bite of a tortoise with gingivitis. In the face of an upcoming election, he really should be considering his retirement options.\nThe only reason I can think of that he is still in post now is because these qualities are exactly what his Conservative masters want in a minister for business. Someone who’ll make all the right noises, but ultimately stay out of their way and let them get on with filling their boots and those of their big corporate chums.\nWhile people like this are in the positions they are, it’s little wonder that we’ve seen no genuine bank reform since the crash. No prosecutions of bankers, who to any fair-minded person have been guilty of, at the very least, dishonesty and in all probability of fraud and deception, if not plain old daylight robbery.\nUntil we have a government who seriously wants to take these guys on, we’ll be living in an economic groundhog day, enjoying the odd bits of prosperity, in between stumping up yet more of our own cash to prop up the lavish lifestyles of city wide boys.\nIn the meantime I guess small businesses will need to think of alternative sources of funding for their next venture. People who are more honest and reliable than most of the banks. The Triads or the Mafia perhaps. I hear they have some very tempting offers you can’t refuse.",

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_garden-city/content_180.html": "The government announced plans today for a new ‘Garden City’ to be built on ex-MOD land on the outskirts of Bicester in Oxfordshire. The proposals will be backed by £100M of government funds and will include ‘sustainable’ transport infrastructure, green spaces and new local amenities.\nOn the face of it this could be a boost for Bicester, but I suspect the devil will be in the details.\nMuch of the announcement seems to cover projects that are already in planning or underway. The new railway station for example. There’s also some confusion over if this is to be a re-imagining of the much vaunted eco-village or an entirely new project.\nIt is encouraging however to see that the project is to be built on a brown field site.\nConfusingly, the definition of a ‘garden city’ is being left to the developer’s imaginations with the government saying it doesn’t want to “impose any definition of what garden cities are”. This could likely mean we’ll end up with another estate full of either ‘luxury homes’ that ordinary people can’t afford, or shoe-boxes crammed together to generate maximum profit. That would probably mean any aspirations to provide gardens and green space will go right out the window.\nIf Nick Clegg really wants this to be development different from all the other clone estates thrown up around the country, I’m afraid he’s going to have to nail his colours to some sort of mast and properly define his intentions. But that might prove more difficult than a glib press release full of utopian imagery.\nThere would also need to be a clear vision that the people living in this new ‘city’ will be contributing to the local economy and society as well as working in it. With a train station on the doorstep, such a development could easily become a dormitory for London commuters or a sink hole of buy-to-let properties.\nAffordability will be the key. If these homes are intended for people on middle and lower incomes, then I’d support the idea. But I suspect such values won’t be compatible with what Nick Clegg sees as a ‘garden city’.\nPersonally I’d like to see more genuine thinking along these lines, subject to the above caveats. But ultimately this may all just come to nothing.\nSo many of these big legacy projects either evaporate into the ether once they’ve generated enough headlines, or turn into something very different once the realities of cost, demand and political will begin to bite.\nThere’s a veritable tsunami of these grandiose announcements coming out from government at the moment though. Like the spurious claims for new spending on road infrastructures announced earlier this week, many of them are just old or existing projects being re-launched as new spend to give the impression of a go-ahead administration full of exciting possibilities for the future.\nAnyone would think there was an election round the corner!",

It’s not only removing vital green infrastructure it’s also going to massively increase congestion on local roads as it creates another 4500 jobs that the city simply doesn’t need, without providing the houses that it does desperately need.\nOxford City Council claims it can’t meet its own affordable housing needs. The Oxford North development demonstrates the reason why. The City Council chooses not to meet that need and instead pushes it on to the surrounding districts such as Cherwell and South Oxfordshire.\nI joined the protest as Wolvercote directly abuts my district council ward in Cherwell and is likely to impact heavily on Kidlington, especially on top of the extra development that is planned for the area around Kidlington, Gosford and Water Eaton, Yarnton and Begbroke, assuming that goes ahead.\nI made a short video giving some of the context which you can watch using this link below.\nThe people of Wolvercote and North Oxford send a message to St Johns College Oxford University\nWe need to stand up against the same brazen greed that is motivating the concreting over of our precious green spaces before it’s too late. You’ll have a chance to send a message to those councillors who backed these projects in the election in May.\nIn Cherwell the plans were promoted and pushed through by the Conservative ruling group in the face of massive opposition from local residents which they completely disregarded and continue to ignore. In Oxford the Labour run City Council continues to apply pressure on other districts to deal with the housing need the city is making worse by using spaces like these to build more economic development rather than affordable housing,\nGreens have always stood against this sort of opportunistic expansionism for profit and we always will.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_community_page_2/content_221.html": "I’ve been involved in retail for as long as I can remember. From my first proper job as a Saturday boy in a menswear store in Lewisham through my days as a market trader in Camden Lock and Greenwich to being co-founder of a national high street chain that started with a small store in Oxford selling silver jewellery. and grew into a national chain trading in 6 of country’s major retail locations, including London’s prestigious Covent Garden.\nIn that time I saw almost as many ups as I did downs. I’ve half jokingly said that I spent 20 years building the business and then another 10 trying extricating it from the failing high street. Like so many other retailers who entered the high street during the boom years in the early 1990s, I fell foul of the simultaneous boom in commercial property development. So many new malls were opened in the 90s and early 2000s it was difficult to keep up and I opened stores in some of the most iconic examples such as the New Bullring in Birmingham and Bluewater in Kent.\nThe other boom at the time was in business rates, which along with rents skyrocketed through that period as institutional landlords, mostly backed by large pension funds, cashed in on the retail bubble ploughing millions into new shiny malls based on the emerging US model. It was great while it lasted and we all became caught up in the heady days of seemingly limitless opportunities. But we soon discovered there were limits.\nThe Financial crash in 2008 gave us all a pretty sharp reality check and things soon started to become far less buoyant and rents that had been agreed on the back of rude profit margins started to look far less tenable as turnovers started to fall.\nThere soon followed a series of frantic rounds of renegotiation with landlords who themselves were facing the prospect of huge hole in their new developments as retailers started to fall over with alarming regularity. In many cases we were able to come to mutual agreements to keep us trading at the shopping malls looking full, but the one thing that couldn’t be re-negotiated were business rates. Set as they were, by the central valuation office, and administered by local authorities, they were completely devoid of any chance of concession unless you had an understanding council. In my experience their understanding was rather limited, and after 5 years as a local councillor myself I now understand more about why that was.\nSo we were all caught in a perfect storm that only a few managed to emerge from. My business was one of the luckier ones as I managed to negotiate deals that gave us breathing space. But I could see the writing on the wall and it was telling me to get out of the high street and decamp to the internet where so many of our competitors were lurking. Thereby hangs another very long story.\nBut suffice to say I have an intimate understanding of the plight of the high street, in fact much more intimate than I would prefer. For that reason one of my personal priorities as a fresh faced new MP would be to push for a new system of business rates or local high street taxation. Other things like rent controls and use classes would also be high on the agenda, but none of this will be an easy fix for an industry in the doldrums after so many years in decline. But I know from my own experience that smaller independents are both the lifeblood of local high streets whilst also being the most vulnerable.\nIn terms of the dreaded business rates, I think I could take elements from the land tax approach of the Green party and add in some aspect of a local purchase tax as seen in the USA. Such a tax would be far more progressive and have more respect for the ability of businesses to pay such an additional tax. That would give a far greater connection between the local community, local authorities and the retailers themselves. If all retailers did well then they would all reap the benefits.\nSpeaking to local councillors and retailers about business rates reform\nI don’t really have the answer to full business rates reform, but I’ve been campaigning for a better system for over 10 years. I would advocate a situation where we involved existing high street retailers in the process of finding a solution. There have been past attempts at doing this, but very few, if any, involved small independent retailers. I think that was a mistake.\nThe Labour Party have boldly announced that they would scrap the current business rates system, but they haven’t said what they would replace it with. I’ve been here before many times, and both Labour and the Tories have frequently promised reform but never delivered on that. One of the biggest reason is that business rates are a virtually guaranteed income for government bringing in over £13bn a year. Even if the premises are empty, the landlord cops for the bill so it’s a win-win for Westminster. So any new system is likely to be just as iniquitous and damaging, especially to smaller operators.\nI think there is a way of developing a system of local high street taxation that could benefit all sides of the equation, including the consumer. Just scrapping the business rates system with no plan for what would replace it is not a solution, yet its the current proposal from the part that is most likely to form the next government in a few weeks. If I was in Westminster I’d hope to be able to provide a far better insight into the problems on the high street and how to engage with the people who face those problems every day.\nI’d like to see genuine consultation with high street stakeholders, including landlords and local councils, about the best way forwards. As a long term retailer, having moved from being a small business, through a larger expansion and back to being a ‘born again independent’, I’d like to be involved in that process. But I guess it remains to be seen what the outcome is on July 4th.\nI’ve just published a video I made during a recent visit to Bicester with some thoughts on how we can work towards a better system of high street business taxation and help to repair our broken high streets and you can watch that by clicking here.\nIf you’re a retailer or just someone who enjoys browsing physical shops, I’d suggest you vote for someone like me who has the experience to make that a viable possibility again. Retail is at the heart of every village, town and city and needs political support to make it vibrant again. Many politicians claim to have the answer but few of them have been on the inside of the industry. I think that needs to change. I’d like to change it.",

He is also standing for a seat on Kidlington Parish Council in Exeter Ward.\nIn Kidlington West the Liberal Democrats will be standing candidates in two seats, including the one vacated by Alaric Rose who moved away from the area recently.\nNeither party will be standing candidates against each other in the district council elections and will be endorsing each other’s respective campaigns. All three candidates have pledged to work to forward the aims of both parties if some or all of them are elected.\nThey are campaigning for :\n- A stronger and more effective opposition to the Conservatives’ unhealthily large majority on Cherwell District Council;\n- Continued opposition to Cherwell DC’s plan to build 4,400 houses on the Green Belt in Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke to meet Oxford City’s housing needs. They want to ensure that any houses that are built should be genuinely affordable and aimed at local need;\n- Strong opposition to the Conservative’s plans for an Oxford to Cambridge Expressway especially with regard to it’s environmental and air quality impacts;\n- An end to Conservative cuts to local services and their failure to maintain local roads, cycle paths and pavements, schools and health facilities.\nGreen candidate for Kidlington East, Ian Middleton, said: “At a local level our two parties still agree on most key issues and we hope to build on the successes of last year’s campaign for both of us. Far more continues to unite us than divides us at this crucial time for our community.”\nLiberal Democrat candidate for Kidlington West, Katherine Tyson, said: “We want to work with the local community to make our area a better place to live.

They used the City Council’s claims of ‘unmet housing need’ as an excuse to facilitate investment and development opportunities for the university and other large landowners.\nWe begged the council to take a step back from their plans in view of the fact that the City hadn’t published a local plan proving their ‘unmet need’ This would have been a perfect justification, but they refused. So outrageously revisionist to claim it was all Labour’s fault!\nBut this statement in the Oxford Times from the City Council’s Labour leader Susan Brown does place their cards firmly on the table. She would rather continue to focus on economic and business development than provide affordable accommodation for their own needs.\nThere are multiple sites within the boundaries of the city that could be used for medium to high density housing to solve at least the immediate problems for housing the the city centre and in East Oxford. At least 4 of those site are slated for development, predominantly for business use.\nIt’s plain that the council has repeatedly and recklessly pursued economic development instead of housing under the leadership of Bob Price and the new Labour leader intends for this to continue.\nNow their new leader has made it clear that her intention (and presumably Labour’s) is to push that envelope even further. Increase business development in the city (even though unemployment there is virtually zero) and press district councils to plough up their green spaces and destroy natural habitat to build houses to fulfil their needs.\nPresumably Ms Brown is also happy to see the city export it’s obscenely high levels of pollution and appalling air quality into the green areas around her ever expanding empire like some post-apocalyptic behemoth, consuming everyone and everything in its path.\nThat’s not a vision of sustainability or quality of life I see as particularly attractive for anyone.\nYes we need to build houses, but they need to be the right houses in the right places. If Oxford city want to deal with their own housing crisis (assuming that is proven in their own yet to be completed local plan) then the right place for housing is within their own confines. At least it is before the expect other areas to cover their backsides!\nIt was good to see Labour members on Cherwell District Council supporting campaigners in defending our precious green belt, but they really do need to have a word with their colleagues on the city council and get them to set their own house in order, literally!",

But we’re used to tall orders. In the face of what seems like a deliberate policy of starving us of media attention in favour of far more ratings grabbing pint-swilling politico-celebs like Nigel Farage, we’re still garnering support from credible commentators and respected political analysts for both our economic and social justice proposals.\nFormer Citibank financial trader Gary Stevenson and host of the You Tube Channel Gary’s Economics has analysed the Green Party manifesto and classified it as the most credible and honest in real terms. In a recent video he confirmed that he would be voting Green because we are the only party to be offering a radical and workable alternative to the proposals from every other party.\nTrade Unionist and former General Secretary of the Labour Party Jennie Formby has also announced on Twitter that she would be voting Green in this election along with numerous other high profile political and cultural leaders such as George Monbiot. It’s also reported that more and more young people are turning to the Greens as a real alternative to the ping-pong politics of the past 50 years.\nAs a moderate Green myself I’ve always seen the Greens as a true alternative vote, neither left or right. The Green Party officially rejects the traditional left–right political spectrum, describing it as “something of an anachronism” and that perfectly fits with my view on the world.\nI’m standing as the Parliamentary Candidate for Bicester and Woodstock mainly because it’s my home constituency and the place I’ve made my home for 32 years. But above all that, it’s a place I’ve seen change drastically in that time with even more drastic changes in the pipeline. From the massive development plans in and around Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Bicester with large areas of greenbelt being decimated by ill-conceived local plans to proposals to armour plate 3500 acres of green fields and farmland for hugely unpopular solar farm project in the west. I’m concerned about what these things will do to the place I’ve called home for nearly half my life.\nThere’s obviously going to be a lot more to say on this election in the remaining 2 weeks, much of which I’ve not said so far due to dealing with my new responsibilities on Cherwell District Council after being appointed to the executive on the same night that the General Election was announced (great timing Rishi!). But I’ll be breaking my silence over the next 2 weeks.\nIn the meantime, doors are being knocked, leaflets are being delivered and pollsters are polling. There’s been a huge amount of speculation about who can win in this constituency and I’m not going to add to that with my own obviously biased opinions. But with a newly drawn boundary, every voter has the historic opportunity to vote in a brand new Westminster constituency for the first time where we could all buck the trends and help me and the Greens to show that any prediction in an unknown and untested area could be drastically inaccurate.\nCan I win? Who knows? Am I serious about my candidacy? Absolutely! But then as anyone who knows me and knows my work as a local councillor and activist would tell you, I never do things by half measures. We all know that the Tories are finished, at least for the immediate future. We don’t need to vote tactically on a local basis in this election because after 14 years of chaos the country has finally woken up and are about to consign the current administration to the political skip.\nThat gives every voter in this area new opportunities and new possibilities. You can vote with your heart and for what you believe in. If that’s a better future for you and your family, a fully funded NHS and social care system, public utilities returned to responsible public control (particular water and energy), a better standard of living for all, raising millions out of poverty and protecting climate and nature, voting Green really is the only alternative. Even if I don’t win the seat, a vote for me that would contribute to a large swing to the Greens nationally will strengthen our hand in influencing national politics for the better. It will also put money into the party coffers through Short Money to help us continue the fight for a better, fairer, greener world for you and you family and their families to come.\nI’ll do my best over the next couple of weeks to make my case for your precious vote in this election and I hope you will seriously consider giving me that vote on July 4th. You should shortly be receiving leaflets from me explaining my priorities. You can also browse this website which is being updated with local issues that I think will be important in the upcoming election. I will also be adding new topics in the next few days. If you want hear me speak in the meantime, I was interviewed by Byline Times recently and was able to cover many topics that I think will be important to voters in this election. You can see that here.\nThere are also a number of hustings that you can attend to ask questions of me and the other candidates.

If anyone would like to extend other invitations I am more than happy to come along. If any other events come up I will post them here and on my social media channels.\nRemember – this is the election where YOU get to vote FOR what YOU believe in, rather than AGAINST what you don’t.\nIf you’d like to get involved in my campaign please drop me a line at ian.middleton@greenoxford.com\nYou could also contribute to my joint fundraiser to help me and my 2 fellow North and West Oxfordshire candidates reach more voters in this campaign.

You can find and comment on the original here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/eu-referendum-immigration_b_9322718.html\nSo here it is. After years of campaigning and complaining, manoeuvring and cajoling, half-truths and good old fashioned British pig-headedness, the moaning masses of middle England have finally got their referendum.\nI say ‘their’ referendum because this isn’t being staged at great expense for those of us who want to stay part of Europe. It’s not even for those who don’t really give a toss either way.\nIt’s certainly not for those more outward looking souls, who appreciate the many advantages of being a member of the European club. The easy movement between states (yes that does apply to us as well as all those annoying refugees and migrants) and the free transport of goods. Funding for urban and industrial renewal. Numerous environmental improvements to beaches, rivers and the countryside, including controls on things like GMOs. Human rights, animal rights, consumer rights. Cheaper phone charges and easier and cheaper travel and currency exchange. Social welfare protection and labour rights, and a panoply of other advantages that most people take for granted and will miss when they’re gone.\nNo, it’s a referendum for misguided and ill-informed little-Englanders, draped in Union flags, firm in the belief of two world wars and one world cup and certain the word ‘Great’ attached to Britain means something other than the first letter on a sticker they slap on the back of their booze cruise charabang, just to remind those envious foreigners that they were unlucky enough to be born on inferior soil.\nBut moreover, it’s a referendum for politicians who have been looking at continental Europe down the wrong end of the telescope for so long now, they just don’t realise how small this country has become on the world stage. A myopic concern about how much money we pay to Europe and a studied ignorance of the huge returns our EU membership generates.\nMost people who focus on our payment to Brussels like to remind us what else we could do with that money. Yet with a growing national debt, and stubbornly high deficit, any such savings would likely fall into the same black hole as most of the rest of our national finances. Either that or it would go towards servicing the country’s circa £50bn annual interest payments, paid in large part to European banks anyway.\nIt’s not 1975. The geo-political landscape has changed around us since the last time we decided if we wanted to be a part of Europe. Yes, back in the swinging 70s it was the ‘Common Market’, but by necessity and common interest it’s become more than that. Those advocating some kind of return to a simple trading relationship are ignoring both the reality of our reduced place in the world and the promiscuity of world markets.\nNeither is it 1938, even though Cameron’s Chamberlain moment was equally as hollow. Just like his pre-war counterpart, the agreement he reached in Brussels was peripheral and disposable, focussing as it did on the false polemic of immigration and border control.\nIt was a pantomime, with Donald Tusk and Angela Merkel as the ugly sisters to Cameron’s Cinderella. Shouts of “they’re behind you” were evident from the likes of UKIP and Front National pointing to the ‘hordes’ or ‘swarms’ or ‘bunches’ of ‘migrants’, ‘refugees’ or ‘immigrants’, depending on which description David Cameron and the BBC have alighted on this week.\nI totally agree that EU democratic and regulatory processes are in desperate need of reform, but these weren’t the points that Cameron argued. Driven by domestic pressures, piled on by a widening xenophobic rhetoric, he was pushed into a rushed and ill-conceived round of negotiations that resulted in him metaphorically claiming ‘peace in our time’ outside Number 10. It was a performance put on to give him a platform to launch the referendum that we all knew was coming, and the critic’s reviews weren’t great.\nSadly for him, us, and the rest of Europe, this was a missed opportunity that could have sparked a trans-national debate about the real future of the EU and brought about radical changes to shape it into something more even-handed and responsive to the needs of all member states.\nBut instead, Cameron wasted what could have been his real place in history for the sake of a thumbs up from the likes of Farage, Gove and Galloway whilst gaining little tangible return for the UK, save for some token restrictions on benefit payments to migrants who rarely claim them anyway.\nIn fact it’s recently been revealed that the UK government has no idea how much immigration costs us, nor how much migrants contribute to our economy. But let’s not let a little thing like lack of facts get in the way of a nicely staked out scapegoat.\nAnd while we’re on the subject of discrimination, we mustn’t forget those hard-pressed city bankers quaking in their handmade brogues, terrified that they may be penalised for being outside the Eurozone. That of course, amid the posturing about immigration, was the main concern for Cameron and his paymasters. Essentially he was in Brussels to fight for the right to discriminate against the poor whilst protecting the interests of the obscenely rich, although of course that wasn’t so eagerly reported.\nAnd there we have it. The crux of all this political, psychological and media-spun mendacity – Corporate interest. Insular businesses seeking to rid themselves of the European interference and regulation that keeps all the rest of us safer and better looked after. The refugee and migrant crises couldn’t have come at a better time for these vested interests to galvanise public opinion in favour of an out vote.\nOn this flimsiest of pretexts, and on evidence largely pulled out UKIP’s collective backside, we’re potentially going to launch ourselves into one of the biggest national disasters for several generations. The ‘Brexit’ silo mentality that is about as relevant in today’s globally connected society as statutes recorded on vellum.\nOne of the greatest achievements and advantages of the EU is freedom of movement between states. It’s a harbinger of a future globalised socio-economic system where borders and statehood will be irrelevant. One where the term ‘economic-migrant’ will no longer be a thinly veiled insult, just as it wasn’t when we and other nations economically migrated across the globe centuries ago, annexing and occupying entire countries as we went. In that context, and in view of the Tories much vaunted ‘on your bike’ ethos, I find it perplexing that we now seem to regard our attraction as place of opportunity as a bad thing.\nAnd while we’re on that subject, if I were a British migrant living on the continent I’d be feeling distinctly uncomfortable right now. Especially those who have lived there for longer than 15 years and are inexplicably denied the right to vote in a referendum that may well decide their future.\nThose whistling tunes in the dark about independent trade agreements with Europe and other global partners will soon find that our status as the 5th richest nation in the world is built on foundations largely stamped with a CE logo. Already Sterling has plummeted on the news that Boris is heading for the lifeboats.\nMuch of our apparent wealth is generated by the financial sector and supported by our membership of the EU. Who will want to trade with us as a small individual nation with a growing national debt and a dwindling economic base? No wonder the city was such a key part of Cameron’s negotiations.\nThe finance sector is pretty much all we have left. We don’t have anything else to trade. China and the USA know this and have already warned us that a UK outside the EU will be of much less interest to them. The US in particular sees our connection with Europe as a valuable conduit into EU financial markets.\nUncoupling ourselves from the EU will be a long, painful and essentially irreversible process. We won’t wake up one day and see bluebirds over the white cliffs and a land of milk and honey for all. It will take years of debate, legal dispute and the unpicking of labyrinthine systems of regulation woven into our own statutory frameworks. A drawn out and retrograde process, during which I believe we’ll slowly come to see the folly of our ways.\nAnd once we’ve closed our borders and thumbed our noses at one of the biggest trading blocs on the planet, it will be too late to realise that we’re now more of a Pekinese than a bulldog. An isle not so much sceptred as septic, poisoned by our own arrogance and bigotry, left entirely at the mercy of a broken political system where wealth goes one way, and protection is only there for those who can afford it.\nAs Britain shrivels into, at best, a tawdry tax haven in perpetual serfdom to a rich elite, we’ll come to the sad realisation that we’ve been sold a Jerusalem built on false promises and false flags. I wonder if border controls and apocryphal straight bananas will seem quite so important then.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_eco-village/content_326.html": "The government announced plans today for a new ‘Garden City’ to be built on ex-MOD land on the outskirts of Bicester in Oxfordshire. The proposals will be backed by £100M of government funds and will include ‘sustainable’ transport infrastructure, green spaces and new local amenities.\nOn the face of it this could be a boost for Bicester, but I suspect the devil will be in the details.\nMuch of the announcement seems to cover projects that are already in planning or underway. The new railway station for example. There’s also some confusion over if this is to be a re-imagining of the much vaunted eco-village or an entirely new project.\nIt is encouraging however to see that the project is to be built on a brown field site.\nConfusingly, the definition of a ‘garden city’ is being left to the developer’s imaginations with the government saying it doesn’t want to “impose any definition of what garden cities are”. This could likely mean we’ll end up with another estate full of either ‘luxury homes’ that ordinary people can’t afford, or shoe-boxes crammed together to generate maximum profit. That would probably mean any aspirations to provide gardens and green space will go right out the window.\nIf Nick Clegg really wants this to be development different from all the other clone estates thrown up around the country, I’m afraid he’s going to have to nail his colours to some sort of mast and properly define his intentions. But that might prove more difficult than a glib press release full of utopian imagery.\nThere would also need to be a clear vision that the people living in this new ‘city’ will be contributing to the local economy and society as well as working in it. With a train station on the doorstep, such a development could easily become a dormitory for London commuters or a sink hole of buy-to-let properties.\nAffordability will be the key. If these homes are intended for people on middle and lower incomes, then I’d support the idea. But I suspect such values won’t be compatible with what Nick Clegg sees as a ‘garden city’.\nPersonally I’d like to see more genuine thinking along these lines, subject to the above caveats. But ultimately this may all just come to nothing.\nSo many of these big legacy projects either evaporate into the ether once they’ve generated enough headlines, or turn into something very different once the realities of cost, demand and political will begin to bite.\nThere’s a veritable tsunami of these grandiose announcements coming out from government at the moment though. Like the spurious claims for new spending on road infrastructures announced earlier this week, many of them are just old or existing projects being re-launched as new spend to give the impression of a go-ahead administration full of exciting possibilities for the future.\nAnyone would think there was an election round the corner!",

You can watch it here.\nOf course in Yarnton, Begbroke and Gosford (where I’m standing to become the new local County Councillor) it’s in the forefront of everyone’s minds because, if it goes ahead, we’ll be the ones living in the middle of a building site for possibly the next 10 years. We’ll also see our small rural communities destroyed and replaced with a single medium sized town, one that will probably also double up as a university campus for the Begbroke Science Park.\nBut even in Kidlington, (which comprises a large part of the County division) it’s going to have a huge impact. There may not be as many houses built in the area, but the additional strain on our local resources, such as health services, education and leisure facilities will be very detrimental. We’ll also see a noticeable reduction in air quality which is likely to have health impacts on the most vulnerable, as well as increased risks of flooding. The A44 will probably become a car park during busy times, giving us all the chance to sit and admire the 4 storey apartment blocks that will tower over the edge of the dual carriageway.\nThere’s also a good chance that Kidlington will finally lose the argument about hanging on to it’s status as a village. In 10 years time, when the population has possibly tripled, there’s likely to be a much greater push to establish the whole area as a suburb of a Greater Oxford City. Not a prospect I, or anyone else in the area, relishes but something we may have little choice over.\nI for one won’t stop fighting for that until the last blade of grass has fallen under the bulldozer’s tracks.\nAll this might be acceptable to a greater degree if these houses were going to provide affordable accommodation for local families, many of whom are crammed into a single house with perhaps 3 generations under one roof. But these aren’t for the likes of them. These will be expensive luxury executive houses built for investment purposes, with the so-called ‘affordable’ houses reserved for people in Oxford City. The District Council saw to that when they handed control of those houses over to the City Council in a closed meeting at the beginning of the first lockdown. None of these houses will be within reach of local residents.\nA lot of people have told me that all this is inevitable and that the 4400 houses are a ‘done deal’. Well that isn’t the case until we know the outcome of the legal challenge being brought to the high court next month. Until that’s over we have no idea if these proposals will stand up or collapse. There have been reports in other areas recently where challenges have been upheld, and if we get the same result Cherwell District Council will have to think again. In those circumstances we’ll need as much support on the District Council as possible which is why I’m supporting Fiona Mawson to become our second Green Party Councillor on CDC.\nBut even if we fail to stop these devastating plans though the courts, we can at least do our best to limit some of that devastation by having engaged and active councillors at all levels of local government. On the County Council fighting for infrastructure and other important considerations like flood protection, and of course at District and Parish level scrutinising the individual planning proposals themselves. We also have to be vigilant in opposing ‘infilling’ which may become more of an issue as the amount of development space in the area is snapped up by the bigger developers.\nSo I hope I and Fiona can count on the support of our local residents in the elections on Thursday. We’ve seen how our current crop of Conservative councillors have let us down on these issues, and let’s not forget that this whole idea was the brainchild of the Conservatives on Cherwell District Council in the first place, in cahoots with Oxford University, the City Council, the Oxfordshire Growth Board and the Local Enterprise Partnership. After Thursday we may have more leverage to defend our small rural communities against these faceless, unelected and anti-democratic quangos and take back control of our green heritage.\nI for one won’t stop fighting for that until the last blade of grass has fallen under the bulldozer’s tracks. I hope you’ll all support me as your Green Councillor in that long battle.",

Send a message. Or make a protest vote for another party.\nAnd remember there’s a difference between a tactical vote and a protest vote. A tactical vote is where you vote for a party you may not agree entirely with, because they have a chance of beating the party you totally disagree with.\nSadly in Banbury there is no tactical vote, It’s very unlikely that the 100 year long Conservative majority can be overturned by any of the opposition parties.\nSo vote for what you believe in and for the party that has always represented your views. If you’re a Labour supporter, vote Labour. A Green, vote Green. Libdem, vote Libdem. UKIP (are their really any left) vote UKIP.\nI hope that if you’ve been a Green supporter in the past you’ll vote for me and help send the Green message to Parliament. Switching to Labour might seem like a good idea this time, after all the Labour manifesto is full of Green policies from our 2015 manifesto (much to the delight of the Green Party), but abandoning your true allegiance now won’t make any difference to Labour’s chances of winning, but will reduce the Green Party’s standing in future elections.\nUnless you’re a Tory, switching parties now isn’t going to make a difference to the final result. But any non-Tory vote will at least reduce that majority and send a message to The Conservatives that they can’t take this constituency for granted.\nBut whatever you do don’t ignore this vote. It’s probably the most important one you’ll ever cast.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_kidlington/content_34.html": "So in the words of Dolly Parton – Here I come again!\nNo sooner had we got past the District Council elections than we were thrown into a General Election that I and most other pundits had assumed would be held in October or even November.\nTheories as to why we’ve been dragged into the whole merry-go-round again at this premature juncture range from speculation about the likely state of the economy and the reduction in inflation, which no political party can realistically take credit for (although the Tories are trying), to the idea that Rishi and his Tory mates needed to get their CVs in for some cushy consultancy gigs before the end of the year.\nThe other likely reason of course is that there was a chance that a vote of no confidence could be called in Mr Sunak and he wanted to leave the political sphere (as he is likely to do) on the high of being the actual PM, if only in terms of his name badge.\nWhatever the reason, here we are having been given only a short 6 weeks to make our case to the electorate, which for parties like the Greens, without the financial and operational reserves of some of the other parties is something of a tall order. But we’re used to tall orders. In the face of what seems like a deliberate policy of starving us of media attention in favour of far more ratings grabbing pint-swilling politico-celebs like Nigel Farage, we’re still garnering support from credible commentators and respected political analysts for both our economic and social justice proposals.\nFormer Citibank financial trader Gary Stevenson and host of the You Tube Channel Gary’s Economics has analysed the Green Party manifesto and classified it as the most credible and honest in real terms. In a recent video he confirmed that he would be voting Green because we are the only party to be offering a radical and workable alternative to the proposals from every other party.\nTrade Unionist and former General Secretary of the Labour Party Jennie Formby has also announced on Twitter that she would be voting Green in this election along with numerous other high profile political and cultural leaders such as George Monbiot. It’s also reported that more and more young people are turning to the Greens as a real alternative to the ping-pong politics of the past 50 years.\nAs a moderate Green myself I’ve always seen the Greens as a true alternative vote, neither left or right. The Green Party officially rejects the traditional left–right political spectrum, describing it as “something of an anachronism” and that perfectly fits with my view on the world.\nI’m standing as the Parliamentary Candidate for Bicester and Woodstock mainly because it’s my home constituency and the place I’ve made my home for 32 years. But above all that, it’s a place I’ve seen change drastically in that time with even more drastic changes in the pipeline. From the massive development plans in and around Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Bicester with large areas of greenbelt being decimated by ill-conceived local plans to proposals to armour plate 3500 acres of green fields and farmland for hugely unpopular solar farm project in the west. I’m concerned about what these things will do to the place I’ve called home for nearly half my life.\nThere’s obviously going to be a lot more to say on this election in the remaining 2 weeks, much of which I’ve not said so far due to dealing with my new responsibilities on Cherwell District Council after being appointed to the executive on the same night that the General Election was announced (great timing Rishi!). But I’ll be breaking my silence over the next 2 weeks.\nIn the meantime, doors are being knocked, leaflets are being delivered and pollsters are polling. There’s been a huge amount of speculation about who can win in this constituency and I’m not going to add to that with my own obviously biased opinions. But with a newly drawn boundary, every voter has the historic opportunity to vote in a brand new Westminster constituency for the first time where we could all buck the trends and help me and the Greens to show that any prediction in an unknown and untested area could be drastically inaccurate.\nCan I win? Who knows? Am I serious about my candidacy? Absolutely! But then as anyone who knows me and knows my work as a local councillor and activist would tell you, I never do things by half measures. We all know that the Tories are finished, at least for the immediate future. We don’t need to vote tactically on a local basis in this election because after 14 years of chaos the country has finally woken up and are about to consign the current administration to the political skip.\nThat gives every voter in this area new opportunities and new possibilities. You can vote with your heart and for what you believe in. If that’s a better future for you and your family, a fully funded NHS and social care system, public utilities returned to responsible public control (particular water and energy), a better standard of living for all, raising millions out of poverty and protecting climate and nature, voting Green really is the only alternative. Even if I don’t win the seat, a vote for me that would contribute to a large swing to the Greens nationally will strengthen our hand in influencing national politics for the better. It will also put money into the party coffers through Short Money to help us continue the fight for a better, fairer, greener world for you and you family and their families to come.\nI’ll do my best over the next couple of weeks to make my case for your precious vote in this election and I hope you will seriously consider giving me that vote on July 4th. You should shortly be receiving leaflets from me explaining my priorities. You can also browse this website which is being updated with local issues that I think will be important in the upcoming election. I will also be adding new topics in the next few days. If you want hear me speak in the meantime, I was interviewed by Byline Times recently and was able to cover many topics that I think will be important to voters in this election. You can see that here.\nThere are also a number of hustings that you can attend to ask questions of me and the other candidates. These are :\n7.30pm – 24th June – Kidlington Methodist Church (forum on poverty)\n7.30pm – 25th June – St. Mary Magdelene Church, Park St, Woodstock\n7pm – 26th June – St Edburg Church Bicester\n6.30pm – 1st July – CPRE Country side and Environment hustings at Yarnton Village Hall\nI look forward to seeing as many people at those events as possible. If anyone would like to extend other invitations I am more than happy to come along. If any other events come up I will post them here and on my social media channels.\nRemember – this is the election where YOU get to vote FOR what YOU believe in, rather than AGAINST what you don’t.\nIf you’d like to get involved in my campaign please drop me a line at ian.middleton@greenoxford.com\nYou could also contribute to my joint fundraiser to help me and my 2 fellow North and West Oxfordshire candidates reach more voters in this campaign.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_roads/content_46.html": "OK, I’ll agree, the state of our roads in Oxfordshire is shocking.\nAs I journey around the district on my bike and by car I can see the number of cracks, holes and ravines as much as any other other road user and the situation is unacceptable.\nBut our roads didn’t get into this state in just the last 2 years!\nThe Conservatives have been grandstanding in this election about potholes and blaming the Lib Dem/Labour/Green coalition on the County Council for the situation. But it’s no worse now than it was under the last Conservative controlled administration. In fact it’s probably a bit better in terms of how responsive our road management team are.\nI appreciate that seeing so many potholes is frustrating. I’m reporting them every day and they have become more numerous recently after the changeable weather. Crews are out every day fixing them but it’s a battle to try to get the worst ones prioritised and everyone understandably wants to see those in their area fixed first. But the problem with repairing them is not lack of willingness by the council, it’s lack of money/resources.\nNot a new problem\nDuring the last year of the Tory run administration on OCC a story was run in the Oxford Mail which reported that an insurance company had ranked Oxfordshire fifth worst for the number of potholes reported between 2015 and 2018. Figures showed 93,112 potholes were reported during that period amounting to 19.6 potholes per km of road.\nThe figures, from The Insurance Emporium, showed other areas worse than Oxfordshire include East Riding of Yorkshire, Northamptonshire, Edinburgh and in top spot Devon as the worst for potholes. From personal experience I’d add our sister county Buckinghamshire to that list having driven though there recently, their roads make ours look like billiard tables!\nBut the current state of the roads is something that has been building up for years due to lack of investment by successive governments. I’m not even going to blame the Conservatives for it (as they are trying to do to us now) except to say that, as a Conservative administration themselves, they could probably have leant on the government a bit more to stump up some extra cash for repairs instead of borrowing their way out of the problem and saddling us with yet more debt that taxpayers will carry for years. Even then they still didn’t sort the problem out, because quite frankly it’s not sortable without massive investment.\nOxfordshire’s highways need about £45m a year just to stop them getting any worse. The council get less than a third of that from government and another third from local taxation. Some of the remaining third is covered by borrowing that was taken out by the previous administration that will run out in 2025 (although we’ll be paying millions in interest for many years to come). No one really knows where the funding will come from to cover that when that happens. A good chunk of that funding also goes on bridge repairs, and as many of you will have noticed, our bridges are also falling apart as well and if we have a catastrophic bridge failure the result could be a lot more serious than a puncture!\nOur existing roads, are essentially worn out due to lack of proper maintenance for decades. The main cause of this is lack of central government funding made worse by the austerity measures during the last 10 years. It would now cost billions across the county to bring them all up to a decent standard and that doesn’t include pathways.\nIn the meantime the government forces local authorities to build more roads through “growth schemes” tied to essential housing that they won’t provide enough funding to maintain in the future. So the deficit continues to widen.\nPlaying politics\nLets stop playing politics over potholes. Every party blames the other for the state of the roads , but ultimately it’s a matter of investment. We all hate potholes and we all know they shouldn’t be there, but it’s daft to suggest that not fixing them is a deliberate choice for any controlling administration. If we had the spare money, don’t you think we’d spend it just to get the problem off our desks? And before people jump on the usual “if you didn’t spend it on this or that, you could fix X number of potholes” remember that government is all about making those decisions. A few £100K here or there is never going to fix the problems we have with road maintenance now we need billions if we’re going to sort this mess out.\nAs an administration we are absolutely focussed on doing the best with what we have on pothole repairs. The response time on repairs is now much better, but I accept there’s still room for improvement, particularly in terms of the longevity of some of the repairs. But we are going to need serious cash if we’re going to meet residents’ expectations and any politician who tells you otherwise is just using this issue as a campaigning tool. The only ways to get those funds is an increase in council tax, a reduction in other vital services or a very significant injection of funding from the government – and I don’t mean the paltry £3m or so that they recently announced for Oxfordshire coincidentally just before the local elections!\nSo if you really want to see a longer term systemic improvement you need to lobby the government to properly support local authorities. While you’re at it, you could mention a similar situation with health and social care, especially as they’ve just cut promised funding for carers in half!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_vote-green/content_151.html": "So the day is finally here. The chance to vote to end 14 years of Tory misrule and see change. But is it really?\nTwo parties are saying they would provide change, but only one is offering REAL change and REAL hope – The Green Party.\nThe Labour Party slogan ‘Change’ is so reductive and self fulfilling it’s almost worthless as an electoral ambition. Will Labour provide change? Well yes, if they’re elected as the majority government we will see a change by definition. Where there was once Rishi Sunak, there will be Keir Starmer. A clear change of leader and administration, but is that all we want? Will we see REAL change? I rather doubt it.\nLabour’s manifesto suggests otherwise with so many policies seemingly just a continuation of what we have with the Tories. Things like the Bedroom Tax, The Two Child Benefit cap, a continuation of the oil and gas drilling licences granted by the Conservatives, including the highly questionable Rosebank. None of that will change and neither will things like private provision in the NHS or a really progressive tax regime.\nSo what real change will we see with Labour, or any of the other parties for that matter? It looks like the only thing that will be changing will be the climate!\nEven the Liberal Democrats haven’t really committed to change on important things like tax reform or tuition fees which of course they were instrumental in bringing in. Their candidate in Bicester & Woodstock is a well meaning guy, but he was also an adviser to the coalition government during the first period of austerity, as was the Conservative candidate, so not much change for the better there!\nCan I win in Bicester and Woodstock? That depends on you, the voters. It’s a circular argument that Greens can’t win so we don’t get votes, but if we don’t get votes we can’t win. But even if I don’t win my purpose is still to raise more awareness of the Green Party and our values. A party I’ve supported for 12 years and voted for for even longer, back when they were even more unlikely to be elected. Since then there’s been a huge surge in support for Greens, something I’ve seen first hand after being elected to 5 different councils as a Green and re-elected to one of those since.\nIf the Green Party didn’t exist and people hadn’t voted for them, do you think the other parties would have taken any notice of climate change or other Green issues? I very much doubt it and that’s even more obvious now that parties like Labour and the Conservatives are backing away from their climate change commitments because to stick by them is electorally inconvenient.\nSo the Greens have brought about real change over the past decade and will continue to push for more in the coming years, especially as we are looking set to at least triple our representation in Westminster. Change on things like the NHS, social care, social security, justice, equal rights, animal welfare, nature recovery, climate change and so much more.\nI’d of course love to be one of those parliamentarians helping to make those changes, as our new MPs will do through careful lobbying and internal pressure on whomever is in power by the end of this week. But I know that’s unlikely. But every vote for me and every other Green candidate still counts. It counts as part of the message the whole country needs to send to Westminster, even more so as the ruling party is likely to have a majority so large that they probably won’t be in the mood to listen to anyone else.\nBut I have faith that Greens will always find a way to move the needle and work for positive change. And I’ll continue to do that whatever happens in the polls on Thursday. I’m content to play a role, no matter how small in helping to make the future a brighter place for the next generation. Your vote can help me and every other Green candidate to do that, so I hope you’ll give that thought some serious consideration when you mark that cross on the ballot sheet.\nThe polls suggest that the outcome to this election is a foregone conclusion. Labour will comfortably win a huge majority and in Bicester & Woodstock the Lib Dems will romp home. If nothing else people will vote for them just to stop them sending any more leaflets! So you can safely vote Green, knowing it’s extremely unlikely to change that outcome.\nSo more than ever in this election you can vote with your heart to make real change happen. Change that means more than a different name on the House of Commons letterhead. Otherwise we’ll be right back here in 5 or 10 years time, probably with the Conservatives promising the change that we never really seem to get.\nAs someone else said during this election “If you want change you have to vote for it”. If you want REAL change you have to vote Green!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_affordable-housing/content_88.html": "In Kidlington affordable housing is not just difficult to find, it’s pretty much impossible. Recognised as one of the most expensive areas of the district to live in, Kidlington does have some affordable housing in areas but the problem is that most of it is owned and allocated by the City Council. Indeed large areas of the village have been given over to the city’s needs, not least Grovelands which was built almost entirely for the City Council’s use.\nAnd soon we’ll have even more, with the local plan partial review, which was adopted in 2020 after 3 years of objection and protest from local residents and pressure groups, providing yet more housing for the City’s needs with the 50% so-called affordable element having been signed over to the City Council’s control in a closed meeting during the first lockdown in 2020.\nWe all know that the term ‘affordable housing’ is virtually meaningless in Oxfordshire, but even so, very little is built in Kidlington. Even when the district council’s policy to to ensure that 30% of all new housing on larger estates is ‘affordable’, we hardly see anything being built that fulfils that criteria.\nThe flats above the Co-op were essentially given over to the flying school for their exclusive use, even though 3 of the apartments were meant to be available for residents needing affordable accommodation. At least 15 of those flats should have been designated affordable, but the district council messed up the planning application and we ended up with just 3 units available, with the rest being let on the open market. The agreement with developer in that case was so badly negotiated that in 3 years only 1 of those flats has been let on an affordable basis. The terms demand that the council must nominate someone within a 28 day window once a year which is almost impossible to do.\nFlats on the old Co-Op car park site now almost exclusively let to a local flying school at market rent\n15 more flats are due to be built on the Kidlington Garage site at the top of the Bicester Road. When the planning application was agreed the developers were supposed to provide £609,000 in lieu of the 5 affordable apartments. But 6 months later they returned to the planning committee with a viability assessment that argued they couldn’t afford to make any contribution at all. Nothing! Zilch!\nThis is because the government mandates that developers should be guaranteed a profit of 20% on all developments (how nice it would be for other businesses to be guaranteed a profit by the government!). This leaves it open for developers to game the system and make claims that they can’t meet this profitability threshold and thereby reduce or, as in this case, completely remove their responsibility to provide any affordable units or money in lieu.\nI and my fellow Green Councillor Fiona Mawson thought this was wrong and we tabled a motion to refuse the planning application if no affordable element was provided. Sadly, as we and our opposition group are outnumbered on the planning committee, the plans were approved by the Conservative majority.\nSubsequently I brought a motion to the council to increase our affordable requirement on larger developments from 30% to 50% to bring us in line with the City policy. As we have agreed to that percentage on the developments being built in and around Kidlington for the City Council, I thought it only fair that we should give our own residents the same consideration. I was pleased to see that the motion was passed almost unanimously.\nIt’s still sobering to think though that out of around 90 apartments that have been built in Kidlington in the past 5 years, only 3 have been designated affordable and as I explained above, out of those 3, only one has actually been let to a family that needed it.\nCherwell is desperately in need of a change of direction in this issue. We need a council who is prepared to stand up to developers and push for better deals for all our residents. Moreover we need to ensure more affordable developments are brought on line that will benefit local families rather than forcing them to split up as grown children need to move away from their area simply because they can’t afford a home of their own. I believe a change of administration next month could see that better direction and I hope to be a part of that.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_saveourphoneboxlibrary/content_349.html": "Who’d have thought that a small but effective local community initiative in an Oxfordshire town would attract such global attention? The Banbury Phone Box Library is one such brilliant piece of local engagement which is now garnering international attention as BT looks towards chopping it off at the knees.\nThe red phone box is almost as iconic as the red bus as a national symbol of Britain around the world. You’d think if you were company who owns and operates these highly visible pieces of cultural capital you’d be only too pleased to see them being involved in well supported local campaigns that add value to a service that is perhaps not as loved as it once was.\nIn that context it seems daft to me that BT are hell bent on annoying small and large communities across the country by removing public call boxes where they’re valued for numerous reasons other than a quick natter on the phone. It’s even more self-defeating that they’re erasing some of the very symbols of Britishness that have helped them build a world class multi-national company.\nIt has to be said that the Town Council in Banbury share some of the potential blame if the box is removed, as they are refusing to adopt it (something that BT now allow for the princely sum of £1), if BT go ahead with plans to decommission the phone service in the box. Previously they struck a deal with BT to adopt the box and save the library and a local steel fabrication firm offered to fix permanent shelves in the box to house the books to assuage BT’s prior objections to the library service on health and safety grounds, as they believed the current shelving arrangements could be dangerous.\nBT now claims that it is uneconomic for them to continue to run the service anyway, even though I understand thousands of calls were made from it last year.\nThe under-story seems to be that BT want out of the call box game at any cost, and most of that cost will be borne by local communities using the boxes for a number of vital social services or simply to make a call when other options are not available to them.\nBanbury Town Council now say that they’re not prepared to adopt the box if it is then decommissioned by BT. Whilst I support taking a stance against the loss of the phone service, I think it would be a sad loss to the community of the box were to be removed as a result of the Town Council refusing to adopt the box itself.\nMoreover, If BT are claiming the box is loss making, I think it would be useful for them to provide the figures backing that up. It would at least give us an idea of the likely shortfall which could perhaps be covered in some other way.\nIt’s also crazy that BT are missing this as an opportunity for some very positive PR. It has to be said that they’re not universally loved as a company, so something like this, that is fairly minimal in cost terms, would seem to be a great way for them to connect with the community.\nGoing forward perhaps the government needs to bring in a legal requirement on telecoms companies like this to provide a certain number of public call points in an area. Just because most of us carry mobiles now, doesn’t mean that sometimes they might not fail at a vital time, or have been forgotten when they’re most needed. I know BT used to be obliged to seek permission from local or parish councils in order to remove a box, but it sounds like that requirement has now been watered down. In very rural areas mobile phone reception is also notoriously patchy. In those areas call boxes provide a vital service for emergency calls.\nIn terms of usage statistics, it might also be interesting to track the number of calls made against the minimum price of a call in a phone box, which I understand is now 60p. Perhaps BT need to be reminded of the law of supply and demand.\nIf you’re on Twitter you can follow and support the campaign to save the Banbury Phone Box Library by following the hashtag #SaveOurPhoneboxLibrary",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2021_02_24_my-response-to-cherwell-district-councils-2021-22-budget/content_162.html": "At the full meeting of 22nd February Cherwell District Council passed their budget for the forthcoming financial year. I spoke in the debate criticising a further lack of response to the climate emergency and highlighting the pressures that the council’s reliance on commercial investments have placed on its finances, in particular its ownership of the Castle Quay shopping centre in Banbury.\nI’ve long been a critic of the decision to risk council tax payers money by investing in a shopping centre that was already starting to show signs of distress. It was a quite ludicrous decision at the worst possible time, just as the retail economy was collapsing. As a retail analyst myself I’m acutely aware of the pitfalls of investment into retail space with provincial shopping centres being some of the most challenging developments to achieve a viable return on now.\nI and fellow members of the council have been excluded from the so-called cross party advisory group on the management of Castle Quay which is entirely composed of Conservative and Labour councillors. Labour supported the purchase of Castle Quay in 2018 for £63m with a further commitment of a similar sum to build a canal-side extension, including a cinema and a hotel.\nLooking at the figures in this budget we can see that around a third of the financial pressures are a result of losses attributed to Castle Quay. Even if the council’s own optimistic predictions are correct, by the end of next year Castle Quay will have returned a loss of around £1.9m since the council took full ownership.\nOf course all this is now being blamed on the pandemic, but that’s only part of the story. This was always a reckless investment, and that recklessness has now translated into service cuts for everyone in Cherwell.\nWhilst I agree that councils should be the drivers of town centre regeneration, that needs to be evenly distributed. Ownership of Castle Quay is likely to produce only dubious benefit to the people of Banbury with a potentially massive financial burden that will be felt by every Cherwell resident for years to come”\nAs a retail analyst and adviser, I made my misgivings about the public purchase of a struggling shopping centre clear to the council, even before I was a councillor, but was ignored.\nI knew there were already signs of problems on the horizon with several of the major tenants of the scheme, not least Debenhams which recently collapsed into administration. That failure is yet another problem that is about to hit the beleaguered development when lockdown is lifted.\nThe much vaunted opening of Lock 29 indoor market in the space previously occupied by one of the other failed anchor tenants – BHS – is yet to prove itself viable. While I support the inclusion and encouragement of many of the smaller enterprises that were invited to trade there, it’s notable that the major occupier, Happerley, pulled out last year after only 3 months.\nI have asked several questions of the council about Happerley’s involvement with the scheme and the due diligence that went into licencing that company to trade there in the first place. Those questions remain unanswered.\nI originally supported the extension of the scheme with more canal-side restaurant and leisure uses, but as time has gone on it’s becoming apparent that even that is a dubious move. One of the major parts of the development is a cinema, and we are already seeing a market shift there with several of the large cinema operators closing venues and some going into administration\nLittle focus on climate change\nWe’ve just had a taste of the pressures a global catastrophe can place on our finances. In the coming years, ecological threats will make the pandemic look like a mini-break. Yet 2 years into our declaration of a climate emergency, we have another budget with very little progress towards tackling that threat.\nThe last budget had a tiny percentage of spending dedicated to the ecological emergency and even that wasn’t fully honoured. This one has just 5 short paragraphs – less than a page of vague aspirations with no real commitment to anything. Added to that we’ve increased charges for making homes more energy efficient, the very thing we should be encouraging!\nLast year’s budget was billed as Cherwell’s “greenest budget ever” yet many of the pledges made then remain unfulfilled, not least the promise to convert lighting at Bodicote House to LED which would have saved the council money as well as helping to save the environment.\nOn top of that we also have increased building regulations charges for thermal upgrades to buildings and for the installation of solar panels. These are the very things we should be encouraging residents and businesses to do. Many councils don’t charge at all for Solar Panel installations\nThe huge financial commitment that is now being poured into the new waterside development in Banbury could have gone towards renewable energy schemes that would have both helped with climate change and returned a regular profit for the council instead of the losses we see from Castle Quay now.\nUnfortunately due to the short-sightedness and fiscal incompetence of the council’s political leadership we are now committed to a path that I think will just bring further financial misery to the residents we should be working to protect.”",

They were all all opposed to Cherwell District Council’s illogical and damaging decision to restrict the stalls to the Cornhill end of the Market Place. A plan also supported by the Conservative controlled Town Council.\nI started my own 25 year long retail career on a market stall, and worked it for 7 years with my partner though rain, hail sleet, snow and sunshine. I know how difficult it can be to make a living and how fragile the trading environment can be. Your livelihood can depend on so many variable factors, and one of the major fears is losing your regular pitch, for whatever reason.\nIt may seem silly to anyone who hasn’t traded in a market themselves, but where your stall sits can make all the difference between success and failure. The location of competing trades, the flow of people moving through the market, who your neighbours are, your visibility and prominence in the market as a whole are all desperately important.\nThere appears to have been absolutely no consultation with stall holders or customers about these unpopular changes, and based on what stallholders and visitors told me I foresee them being the death knell for this historic trading post as more and more traders fall by the wayside.\nSo what seems like a minor change to the council, will probably be anything but to the people trying to make a living out of the market. This move could likely kill it off! it’s already become smaller and therefore less popular, especially over the last 20 years. In 1997 there were 120 stalls, now its down to less than 20.\nConsidering it’s reduced pull for consumers it’s completely incongruous that the rents being charged by the private firm managing on behalf of the council are almost double that charged by neighbouring markets such as Abingdon, Aylesbury, Hinkley, Oxford and Thame. And as with most things these days, the rent goes up every year. Meanwhile trade is slowly dwindling away to nothing, leaving regular and loyal traders quite literally out in the cold.\nThe Council’s plan includes opening the Market car park for use on Thursdays and Fridays. There is no evidence to suggest this will increase car park usage and revenue to the Council – people already using other car parks such as that near to the Matalan Store will simply park in the market place instead.\nGovernment initiatives on town centre regeneration called for more emphasis and support for market days and the traders that build and run these vital hubs of trade and local amenity in our towns and cities. The Portas review cited markets as one of the easiest ways that town centres could be revitalised and kept alive. Why then is the Conservative run Cherwell Council ignoring the views of it’s own established market traders? Why are they proposing moves that could potentially irreparably damage trade in such an established and once vibrant local fixture?\nBanbury market should be seen by Cherwell Council as an asset to the town. They should be supporting it actively and engaging with the traders and customers to find ways of safeguarding the it’s future, rather than taking unilateral actions with no consultation.\nThis is a Charter Market, which bestows on Banbury the status of a Market Town. By birthright it should be located in the Market Square.\nI would urge Cherwell councillors to do what I did. Take a walk around the market and speak to the people whose livelihoods are in their hands. Speak also to the local residents and patrons of the market and ask them what they think about the priorities that they are planning to enforce on everyone.\nThis is not a decision that can be taken just by moving squares on a map.",

I’ve never been opposed to the free market, even though in my experience in business the free bit is usually very far from free.\nBut there are certain services that society needs to function, and our economy is also dependent on. These are broadly health, education, social care, welfare, transport, police, fire services, the military and local infrastructure. I may have missed something but you get the gist.\nOver the past 10 years we know that these have all been the subject of cuts, and we’ve all seen the results. Not only has this left us impoverished as a nation, it’s also applied serious downward pressure on our productivity and our economy.\nIt’s analogous to the way that businesses are run when they start to get into trouble. First you cut the things you don’t really need, then the things you think you can do without but would like to have, then you cut they think you do need but try to work around, then things you actually need to operate like stock and equipment and then finally you realise you’ve removed your ability to actually do anything productive.\nWe’re pretty much at the end of that process now, and we need to fix it.\nAdditionally, we know that many of the things that were cut didn’t need to be cut. The Tories are never one to let a good crisis go to waste and used the financial crash as an excuse to decimate social services and welfare, dismantle the NHS and remove many of the support services for those in the greatest need.\nThis was driven more by ideology and the Tories obsession with reducing the deficit at all costs, even though this had very little discernible effect on the national debt. When productivity and the economy stall, you end up with less money coming into the coffers and you have to borrow more. That’s where we are now.\nThere should be a real end to the culture of austerity and public service cuts. We’re one of the richest nations in the world, with everyone paying their fair share we should be able to care for and protect all our citizens and keep the infrastructure we all rely on well maintained and working properly.\nThe cost of train fares for example is absolutely ludicrous at the moment and are some of the highest in Europe with some of the worst services being provided. This gives lie to the idea that privatisation makes things more efficient. That said, I know that nationalised services gained a bad reputation back in the old days, but I think that was more an issue of management culture. There’s no reason why things can’t be run completely in the public sector by staff and management who are properly motivated.\nOverall though there are vital services keep our economy moving, and they should be properly supported by government. I’d like to see all of them eventually brought back fully into public ownership and run collectively for the good of the people who rely on them on a zero-sum gain basis. If private businesses can make a profit out of these services now, there’s no reason why they can’t be revenue generating for society or provided at a reduced, subsidised cost where appropriate. It may even be possible to provide some of them for free! Hopefully much freer than the so-called free market!",

Indeed in Oxfordshire as a whole we retained 4 out of 6 deposits and showed voter shares up to 9.2% and in one local result we actually came second! Well done to Jenny Tamblyn!\nIn Banbury itself we knew we were never going to win, but we largely achieved the goal we had set ourselves of raising our profile in the constituency and showing people that the Green Party is the rightful repository of support from anyone concerned about real social justice and progressive politics.\nNationally, The Green Party has seen over a million people demonstrating that voting for what you believe in is never a waste of time. Our share of the vote was nearly 4 times what it was in 2010 and our membership increased by nearly 2000 in the two days after the election. In Oxfordshire we’ve had 56 new members in the last 2 days!\nWe now need to build on that support and engage more than ever with a local and national dialogue about how we want to see our society shaped for the future. The Greens have always been a party with long term vision and I think, as the next 5 years unfold, that vision is going to be needed more than ever.\nIn the meantime I’d like to thank all the Green supporters in the constituency that voted for me, and those who campaigned for me, put up posters, leafleted, knocked on doors and stood in the street with me. You’re some of the unsung heroes of this campaign and you should be rightly proud of your achievement.\nMy gratitude of course also goes out to my dedicated campaign team and members of The Banbury and Cherwell Green Party branch. In particular my agent and campaign manager John Haywood, researcher and adviser Colin Clark, our Chairman Chris Manley, the irrepressible Lisa Miller for her exertions on Facebook, and all those others too numerous to mention who have worked so hard over the last 5 years to get us where we are now.\nA special thank you goes to our press officer and my partner Fiona Mawson, who’s practical and emotional support was invaluable to me throughout the campaign, even though she beat me in the local elections!\nAfter the result of the general election we now more than ever need to see a continuation of the Green surge to offer the people of Britain an alternative to the Conservative agenda of austerity and cuts and the holding of the poor and vulnerable to ransom to pay for the lifestyles of the rich and privileged.\nMoreover we need to re-double our efforts to protect our cherished NHS from the clutches of private healthcare providers that will now be given a free reign by a government ideologically opposed to free and comprehensive state health provision.\nI’ll remain as our Prospective Parliamentary Candidate (PPC) for the foreseeable future, unless my circumstances change or the local branch decide they want or need someone new. So I’ll be keeping this website up and running as a place for me to drop the occasional post about local, national and global Green issues. I hope people will choose to engage with me on them during that time.\nIf you’d like to read more I have two other blogs you might like to follow. One on specific retail matters\nfiftyshadesofretail.wordpress.com\nand another on general political and human and animal rights issues\nwavinganddrowning.wordpress.com\nI also write regularly for Huffington Post\nwww.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton\nI hope we can keep the conversations going through what I think will be some very challenging years to come\nRegardless of our differing ideologies I’m never one to miss an opportunity to quote Churchill in circumstances like these, so I’ll leave you with his well known words –\n“This isn’t the end, it isn’t even the beginning of the end, but it might just be the end of the beginning”\nThanks again\nIan",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_castle-quay_page_2/content_176.html": "As I said in the recent election debate on the BBC, in my opinion they shouldn’t.\nThere are many reasons it’s a bad idea, both from a business perspective and as part of local spending priorities.\nI’ve worked in retail nearly all my life. I built and ran a national chain of jewellery stores across the country and traded in several shopping centres, including some of the most prestigious in the country such as Bluewater in Kent and the new Bullring Centre in Birmingham. I write a regular column for Retail week Magazine and comment regularly in the national press on retail issues as well as offering consultancy services. One of my main focusses is independent retail and commercial property. So I know a little bit about what I’m talking about.\nCherwell District Council (CDC) leader Barry Wood claims that buying the Castle Quay Shopping Centre in Banbury is a good deal for the people of Cherwell. This decision was also backed by the Labour group on the council and their leader Sean Woodcock has assured me there’s a good business case for doing it. Unfortunately neither of them have been able to show it to me so far.\nTheir belief is that buying a commercial property like a shopping centre is a good idea as property will always rise in value. This may be the case for domestic property and some kinds of commercial premises, but not always with retail space.\nA Good Investment?\nThe argument for buying the scheme seems to be that if they hadn’t, the centre would have shut down. It has many long term empty units and is generally struggling to compete in an ever crowded marketplace. The council’s decision a few years ago to allow a new shopping park to open on the outskirts of Banbury haven’t helped its plight.\nIt’s extremely unlikely though that it would have closed down. Much more likely that it would have been offloaded by its pension investment owners to another investment company with more experience of running a shopping centre than some local councillors.\nMoreover, if the argument is that the centre was about to collapse, that doesn’t exactly make it an attractive investment for public money does it?\nThere have been some shopping centre failures in the past, but they are few and far between. But when they do go, they tend to go completely. That means an almost total loss for anyone unlucky enough to be the owner at the time. There will be some residual value in the land, but that’s unlikely to reflect the full price paid for the whole development.\nThere have been a growing number of retail failures in recent years with 650 collapses so far this year alone, and we’re not even half way through yet! Some of them very high profile and heavily leveraged operations. Others are busy negotiating partial closures and rent reductions with their landlords. Others are moving more into the online arena and abandoning physical retail space almost altogether.\nNone of this bodes well for an under-let, under-invested and down at heel shopping centre in a struggling town in North Oxfordshire.\nSo essentially CDC are gambling with public money against the odds. And it doesn’t end there.\nOther Costs\nAccording to Barry Wood the scheme is turning a profit at the moment, but as I’ve said previously, I’ve not seen evidence of that. I have seen a large number of long term voids in the centre, and with the potential for these to increase in number I fear the profitability may be marginal or likely to decline.\nThere will also be ongoing running costs for the centre and presumably additional investment to do whatever it is with the place that they feel will revitalise it. Again details on that are sketchy, but I think there’s some talk about dividing the larger units into smaller ones to attract independent retailers. Whilst I support that idea to some extent there are a lot of things to consider about that course of action.\nFirstly the cost of doing the work, which may include major re-modelling of the units due to, amongst other things, fire regulations. I’ve seen at least one shopping centre management come unstuck with similar plans due to rules on access to fire exit routes.\nHelping Smaller Retailers?\nSecondly smaller independents usually don’t have a huge budget for shopfitting, so there will be additional cost in partially fitting out the units, including new shopfronts etc to attract smaller operators and to ensure that their stores fit in with a modern shopping centre scheme.\nBusiness Rates\nThirdly there’s the loss of business rates on the empty units that are there now, and will most likely be there for a while. Considering the current climate in retail there’s also a good chance that voids could increase. At the moment the landlords will be paying rates on those premises even though they’re empty and a good deal of that money goes to CDC. With the council now being the landlords, they’re going to be paying the rates to themselves, effectively wiping out that income.\nDevaluation of the Asset\nFinally there’s the issue of valuation. Shopping developments are broadly valued on their rental potential. This is why landlords will leave units empty rather than let them out at a reduced rent. If the council’s plan is to lower the rent for smaller or other retailers, that will have a knock on effect on the value of those units and then on others when rent reviews come around. Other tenants now paying a higher rent will also push for a reduction when their leases come up for renewal or rent reviews are due or maybe even before.\nThe net effect of this would be to push down rents, not only in the centre but across the town, reducing loan to asset values across the board. In broad terms I’d welcome that. I’ve long argued that retail property values are hugely inflated. But in terms of the Council’s investment exposure in Castle Quay it’s a potentially dangerous situation, not only leading to a potential devaluation of the asset, but also any loans secured on it being partially called in.\nThere may be some balancing in terms of appreciation on the total asset value, but in the current climate and in a falling retail market, there a very good chance that the overall value of the scheme will fall relative to the amount the council has sunk into it, both as an initial investment and any further day to day expenditure.\nAll of this appears to have passed Cherwell Councillors and the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives by. They obviously have a very patchy understanding of how retail property works and the implications and pitfalls they are letting us all as council tax payers in for.\nMoreover there’s the question of if so much money should be focussed in the north of the district while ignoring other areas. Mr Wood commented in the Radio debate on Wednesday that he recognised that there were empty units in Pioneer Square in Bicester and that it was difficult to get them filled. Yet this doesn’t seem to have concerned him over the purchase of Castle Quay. Indeed, having set the precedent in Banbury I asked him during the debate if the council intended to buy Pioneer Square as well. He didn’t reply.\nOther Options\nA more sensible and prudent approach to the problems in both areas would be to work with the landlords rather than bailing them out with public money. Leave them with the risk whilst introducing local initiatives that help smaller retailers get a foothold and would also support the centre.\nThese could include rates reductions, which Barry Wood dismissed out of hand when I challenged him on it during the election debate. Neither he nor Sean Woodcock appeared to know that it has been within the gift of local councils to reduce rates on specific properties at their discretion for several years now.\nIf they wanted to provide smaller, more affordable space for independent retailers, they could lease units from the centres on a medium to long term basis, probably negotiating favourable terms with the landlords as a council will have a very good covenant. These could then be divided up (if required) and then sublet on flexible terms on reduced rents to retailers, although this would have to be agreed beforehand with the landlord for the same reasons discussed above concerning rental levels and valuations.\nThis would achieve the same aim of revitalising schemes both in Banbury and Bicester and would not involve the council in risking large amounts of public money. It would also mean that the bulk of the £60m they are now tying up in one area could be spread across the district.\nThis is the kind of strategic thinking we need, rather that the amateurish speculation of a council who seems to want to play at being shopkeepers with our money. This is why we need a more diverse representation on the council and councillors like me who will challenge these misguided moves before millions of pounds of desperately needed council funds are put at risk.",

But it’s no worse now than it was under the last Conservative controlled administration. In fact it’s probably a bit better in terms of how responsive our road management team are.\nI appreciate that seeing so many potholes is frustrating. I’m reporting them every day and they have become more numerous recently after the changeable weather. Crews are out every day fixing them but it’s a battle to try to get the worst ones prioritised and everyone understandably wants to see those in their area fixed first. But the problem with repairing them is not lack of willingness by the council, it’s lack of money/resources.\nNot a new problem\nDuring the last year of the Tory run administration on OCC a story was run in the Oxford Mail which reported that an insurance company had ranked Oxfordshire fifth worst for the number of potholes reported between 2015 and 2018. Figures showed 93,112 potholes were reported during that period amounting to 19.6 potholes per km of road.\nThe figures, from The Insurance Emporium, showed other areas worse than Oxfordshire include East Riding of Yorkshire, Northamptonshire, Edinburgh and in top spot Devon as the worst for potholes. From personal experience I’d add our sister county Buckinghamshire to that list having driven though there recently, their roads make ours look like billiard tables!\nBut the current state of the roads is something that has been building up for years due to lack of investment by successive governments. I’m not even going to blame the Conservatives for it (as they are trying to do to us now) except to say that, as a Conservative administration themselves, they could probably have leant on the government a bit more to stump up some extra cash for repairs instead of borrowing their way out of the problem and saddling us with yet more debt that taxpayers will carry for years. Even then they still didn’t sort the problem out, because quite frankly it’s not sortable without massive investment.\nOxfordshire’s highways need about £45m a year just to stop them getting any worse. The council get less than a third of that from government and another third from local taxation. Some of the remaining third is covered by borrowing that was taken out by the previous administration that will run out in 2025 (although we’ll be paying millions in interest for many years to come). No one really knows where the funding will come from to cover that when that happens. A good chunk of that funding also goes on bridge repairs, and as many of you will have noticed, our bridges are also falling apart as well and if we have a catastrophic bridge failure the result could be a lot more serious than a puncture!\nOur existing roads, are essentially worn out due to lack of proper maintenance for decades. The main cause of this is lack of central government funding made worse by the austerity measures during the last 10 years. It would now cost billions across the county to bring them all up to a decent standard and that doesn’t include pathways.\nIn the meantime the government forces local authorities to build more roads through “growth schemes” tied to essential housing that they won’t provide enough funding to maintain in the future. So the deficit continues to widen.\nPlaying politics\nLets stop playing politics over potholes. Every party blames the other for the state of the roads , but ultimately it’s a matter of investment. We all hate potholes and we all know they shouldn’t be there, but it’s daft to suggest that not fixing them is a deliberate choice for any controlling administration. If we had the spare money, don’t you think we’d spend it just to get the problem off our desks? And before people jump on the usual “if you didn’t spend it on this or that, you could fix X number of potholes” remember that government is all about making those decisions. A few £100K here or there is never going to fix the problems we have with road maintenance now we need billions if we’re going to sort this mess out.\nAs an administration we are absolutely focussed on doing the best with what we have on pothole repairs. The response time on repairs is now much better, but I accept there’s still room for improvement, particularly in terms of the longevity of some of the repairs. But we are going to need serious cash if we’re going to meet residents’ expectations and any politician who tells you otherwise is just using this issue as a campaigning tool. The only ways to get those funds is an increase in council tax, a reduction in other vital services or a very significant injection of funding from the government – and I don’t mean the paltry £3m or so that they recently announced for Oxfordshire coincidentally just before the local elections!\nSo if you really want to see a longer term systemic improvement you need to lobby the government to properly support local authorities. While you’re at it, you could mention a similar situation with health and social care, especially as they’ve just cut promised funding for carers in half!",

Claiming, as they always do, that they have put ‘record’ levels of funding into education (as they also claim for health and so many other important services). But the devil is in the detail, with funding per pupil actually falling as class sizes increase.\nRegardless of claims to the contrary in their cobbled-together, un-costed manifesto, there are more cuts to come. But you don’t have to take my word for it, just look at the information available on the schools cuts website\nThese bare facts come from the people who know what’s happening to our schools. The teachers at the sharp end of the Conservative agenda. While these backward looking politicians wax lyrical about the good old grammar school days, our schools are being run into the ground and sold off to private companies to asset strip for a quick buck or two.\nThis needs to stop now. Education is too important to be undersold, under-funded, undermined and treated as an optional extra in one of the richest economies in the world.\nRead what The Green Party would do about education in government and then read below what you can expect from another 5 years of Tory rule.

This is a stance now known among animal rights activists as ‘speciesism’ and it’s something I strongly oppose. I feel both are equally important and that we will never be a fully mature species ourselves until we recognise that fact.\nI am an ethical vegan and and an animal rights campaigner and support all moves to realign animal rights issues with those of the UDHR. I would also like to see much tougher sentences passed against animal abusers and those who allow animals to suffer and die as a result of neglect.\nI am of course intrinsically opposed to the meat, dairy and poultry industries in all their guises. However as a pragmatist I know that we will never eradicate these activities in the short to medium term. Realistically I would prefer to see much more stringent controls over livestock farming, animal transport and abattoirs. I am a campaigner for CCTV in slaughterhouses and against the ‘AG GAG’ legislation in the USA.\nI support much of the work of The Compassion In World Farming group although of course my ultimate ambition would be to see animals removed from the farming equation completely and the land used to provide feed and fodder for animals much more efficiently used to provide food for humans.\nBut I also accept that livestock farmers are part of the countryside equation and have to be able to make a living. To that end I support the idea of the ‘less but better’ approach to meat and dairy where smaller scale farms produce higher quality foods in small quantities but at a premium price. This would favour smaller farms as opposed to industrial livestock farming which is the greatest cause of global agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.\nI am a passionate advocate of animal rights issues and a long term campaigner on everything from no-kill shelters, badger baiting, fox hunting, badger culls, animal experiments, livestock welfare, farming, diet, mega-farms and many other similar issues.\nI am a supporter of FRAME, BUAV, PCRM and PETA. Although I do have some issues with certain PETA campaigns.\nI am of course totally opposed to the use of fur, leather or any other animal products in any application, but especially clothing. I think we need to have a greater awareness of the use of such products, particularly fur, in many of the things we buy. One of the big concerns for me is educating people about how to tell real fur from faux fur, which is often not as easy as many people think.\nI am against animals being used in any entertainment capacity, including circuses, water parks (such as Sea World), Zoos and wildlife parks, except where there is a proven and valid conservation dimension to their work.\nI am anti-hunting of all kinds, including of course fox hunting, big game hunting and recreation hunting. I am of course vehemently opposed to snares. I do accept that in closed populations some animals may need to be culled for reasons of land management. Whilst I’m not supportive of anything that ends the life of any living creature prematurely, I am pragmatic where the good of the many outweighs that of the few (thank you Mr Spock!).\nI support many campaigns against poaching and hunting of big game in Africa, especially the Rhino and Elephants.\nI am against the testing of cosmetics, household and similar products on animals and support the work of groups like FRAME and PCRM to move away from animal testing for drugs and other therapies. I am inherently opposed to animal testing of all kinds and would want to see scientists move towards cell culture, computer modelling and controlled human testing of drugs in the future.\nI do not support any kind of bloodsport, including of course bullfighting, dog fighting, hare coursing and other similar activities. I am a supporter of the Hunt Saboteurs organisation and I brought a motion to Cherwell Council in 2020 calling for the suspension of fox hunting within the district following revelations about alleged deliberate flouting of the law by local hunts. This was blocked by the Conservative members of the council.\nI would also like to see horse racing much more strictly controlled and extreme steeplechase events curtailed or banned. At the very least I would like to see races such as the Grand National severely limited in terms of the risk factors to both animals and riders, if not banned altogether. I am also opposed to greyhound racing in it’s current form.\nLikewise I think the explosion in livestock abuse and the mechanisation of the livestock farming industry is a result of the cost pressures placed on farmers by food procurers and supermarkets. I would like to see our consumption of all such produce reduced and a fairer price paid to farmers for their produce as a start on the road to weaning the planet off animal products.\nI am a vehement campaigner against the production, sale and consumption of Foie Gras and have been involved in several campaigns to stop local restaurants serving this vile product.\nI am opposed to all forms of whaling, the killing of seals and a vocal and active campaigner against the killing of dolphins and pilot whales both in the Faeroe Islands and in Taji Cove Japan. Indeed I wrote along letter to the Japanese ambassador in 2014 during the annual Taji dolphin drive to save a pod of dolphins from imminent slaughter.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_planning/content_75.html": "In Kidlington affordable housing is not just difficult to find, it’s pretty much impossible. Recognised as one of the most expensive areas of the district to live in, Kidlington does have some affordable housing in areas but the problem is that most of it is owned and allocated by the City Council. Indeed large areas of the village have been given over to the city’s needs, not least Grovelands which was built almost entirely for the City Council’s use.\nAnd soon we’ll have even more, with the local plan partial review, which was adopted in 2020 after 3 years of objection and protest from local residents and pressure groups, providing yet more housing for the City’s needs with the 50% so-called affordable element having been signed over to the City Council’s control in a closed meeting during the first lockdown in 2020.\nWe all know that the term ‘affordable housing’ is virtually meaningless in Oxfordshire, but even so, very little is built in Kidlington. Even when the district council’s policy to to ensure that 30% of all new housing on larger estates is ‘affordable’, we hardly see anything being built that fulfils that criteria.\nThe flats above the Co-op were essentially given over to the flying school for their exclusive use, even though 3 of the apartments were meant to be available for residents needing affordable accommodation. At least 15 of those flats should have been designated affordable, but the district council messed up the planning application and we ended up with just 3 units available, with the rest being let on the open market. The agreement with developer in that case was so badly negotiated that in 3 years only 1 of those flats has been let on an affordable basis. The terms demand that the council must nominate someone within a 28 day window once a year which is almost impossible to do.\nFlats on the old Co-Op car park site now almost exclusively let to a local flying school at market rent\n15 more flats are due to be built on the Kidlington Garage site at the top of the Bicester Road. When the planning application was agreed the developers were supposed to provide £609,000 in lieu of the 5 affordable apartments. But 6 months later they returned to the planning committee with a viability assessment that argued they couldn’t afford to make any contribution at all. Nothing! Zilch!\nThis is because the government mandates that developers should be guaranteed a profit of 20% on all developments (how nice it would be for other businesses to be guaranteed a profit by the government!). This leaves it open for developers to game the system and make claims that they can’t meet this profitability threshold and thereby reduce or, as in this case, completely remove their responsibility to provide any affordable units or money in lieu.\nI and my fellow Green Councillor Fiona Mawson thought this was wrong and we tabled a motion to refuse the planning application if no affordable element was provided. Sadly, as we and our opposition group are outnumbered on the planning committee, the plans were approved by the Conservative majority.\nSubsequently I brought a motion to the council to increase our affordable requirement on larger developments from 30% to 50% to bring us in line with the City policy. As we have agreed to that percentage on the developments being built in and around Kidlington for the City Council, I thought it only fair that we should give our own residents the same consideration. I was pleased to see that the motion was passed almost unanimously.\nIt’s still sobering to think though that out of around 90 apartments that have been built in Kidlington in the past 5 years, only 3 have been designated affordable and as I explained above, out of those 3, only one has actually been let to a family that needed it.\nCherwell is desperately in need of a change of direction in this issue. We need a council who is prepared to stand up to developers and push for better deals for all our residents. Moreover we need to ensure more affordable developments are brought on line that will benefit local families rather than forcing them to split up as grown children need to move away from their area simply because they can’t afford a home of their own. I believe a change of administration next month could see that better direction and I hope to be a part of that.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_politics_page_11/content_445.html": "Dear Mr Hudspeth\nI was the Green Party Parliamentary Candidate for Banbury in May. I’ve met you a couple of times, the most recent being after the public meeting held in Banbury Town Hall as part of Oxfordshire County Council’s consultation process on the proposed additional £50m cuts to local services.\nSo it was with great interest that I read your correspondence with David Cameron, splashed across national headlines last week, which painted a clear picture of a Prime Minister with only a tenuous grasp on the realities of the demands he has made on local authorities such as Oxfordshire, where he also happens to be an MP.\nAt the meeting we briefly touched on the magnitude of the savings being demanded in the context of our national finances. I made the case that with a national debt of £1.56 trillion – nearly half of which was added by our Conservative Chancellor during the tenure of the last government – a deficit of £83bn and annual interest payments of around £43bn, saving £50m from local authority spending was the equivalent of trying to pay your mortgage off by skipping breakfast once a year.\nWhilst these cuts will have virtually zero impact on the debt left to future generations, they will have a huge effect on those who depend on the front line services being withdrawn. In particular on adult social care facilities and the children’s centres you plan to close which were amongst Mr Cameron’s principal concerns.\nYour reply to me was that we all had to “do our bit”. Well it seems from your response to the PM that ‘our bit’ has already been well and truly done.\nAs a local politician expected to deliver on these impossible polices, I’m sure you know that they are economically illiterate. Cuts to social care will impact on the health service as a whole. Cuts to support for young people have potential effects on social order. Cuts to public transport have serious implications for the workforce and people in isolated rural communities.\nI hope you’ll agree with me that there’s a point where cuts can no longer be the solution to balancing the books. Personally I think we’re already well beyond that line in the sand.\nSo I’m confused by your own position on government policy, given that you continue to publicly affirm that you share Mr Cameron’s blind faith in the blunt instrument of austerity as the answer to all our problems.\nYou’ve also made much of the statistic that 2% of the county’s population consumes 50% of the finances. I’m sure the old, the sick and infirm are a great drain on our public services, but in a modern society surely those people should expect to be looked after by those of us who are better able to do so.\nDo you feel perhaps that this 2% should be prepared to support the more lavish spending plans of our government in other spheres? The wasting of hundreds of billions to allow us to play our part in a thermonuclear Armageddon maybe. Or vanity transport projects that will allow people to get from London to Birmingham 15 minutes faster, when Oxfordshire County Council has just voted to cut local bus subsidies in the county.\nShould Oxfordshire pensioners be made fearful of putting their heating on this winter but be comforted as they shiver in the dark that they are ‘doing their bit’? All this while the government you support hands over £5.9bn to private oil and gas companies – a figure well over a thousand times greater than the cuts we are being asked to make – and slashes support for local renewable energy projects, meaning we will miss EU emissions reductions obligations and become the only G7 country to increase spending on fossil fuels.\nI really feel that you have to come down on one side of the fence or the other here. You can’t continue to support the cuts in public whilst apparently opposing them in private. As leader of the county council, the people of Oxfordshire deserve an unequivocal statement of your aims and allegiances.\nYou will no doubt be aware that Mr Cameron’s intervention in Oxford has now prompted requests from over 100 other councils to have a similar direct consultation with him over budget pressures. He also faces accusations of ministerial impropriety over his intervention with you.\nSo perhaps now would be a good time for hard-pressed council leaders such as yourself to make a firmer stand. You could set an example and refuse to pass what you have already told the PM is an impossible budget to balance in any morally defensible way. I know such actions come with potential repercussions, but if other council leaders followed your lead, how many mutinies could Westminster really handle? This could be your place in history calling!\nAlternatively you could join the drive for the abolition or raising of the now outdated 2% referendum threshold on council tax increases. As you hinted at in your letter to Mr Cameron, selling the family silver can only plug the gaps for so long. If we want well funded local services, we should all be prepared to pay ‘our bit’ for them. Polls carried out by the Oxfordshire Green Party, The Oxford Mail and at your own consultation events have shown that people would be prepared to pay more council tax if they saw the money going to essential services.\nOf course this would require the government to square the circle of increasingly expensive public services without any rise in taxation. But if they truly believe in localism, councils should surely be free to set their own local levy, unhindered by ideological thresholds dictated by central doctrine.\nI think the people of Oxfordshire would welcome your further engagement with the PM on their behalf and with local activists on these matters. I personally look forward to your thoughts on how best to capitalise on what has now become a national talking point, and how we can use this new focus in the best interests of Oxfordshire residents and other similarly concerned groups across the country.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_social-entrepreneur/content_149.html": "As a businessperson, a long time retailer, and now a retail commentator and journalist, one of the most difficult things for me to reconcile is my involvement in the promotion of consumerism.\nThat’s at odds with my more recent conviction that we can’t continue to squander the world’s finite resources on WANTS, whilst ignoring the NEEDS of most of the planet’s population.\nThe Green Party might be seen by some as an anti-capitalist movement. We are however a broad church with many facets. I was encouraged to become a candidate BECAUSE of my business experience rather than in spite of it, and I saw that as an encouraging aspect.\nI’ve run large companies, and I now run a small one. I’m probably something of a gamekeeper turned poacher. But I’ve seen both sides of this debate and come to realise that the idea of continual economic growth is indeed a myth. And one we have to stop believing before we run out of road.\nI was at the launch of a new book by Naomi Klein a few months ago. She makes some interesting points about the connections between environmental issues and the global economy. The basic tenet is that when resources and commodities are monetised on the kinds of scale they are now, the result is economic and environmental catastrophe. And we’re just getting a taste of that.\nThe direct impacts are of course climate change, which if you ascribe to that view, is starting to bring with it the kinds of drastic changes in weather patterns that we’ve seen in recent years.\nThese are all things we’re having to come to terms with now and they’re all traceable to global economic activity. They affect all our lives, not just personally, but in broader human and economic terms.\nI’m a vocal advocate of social enterprise, and believe that there are many big businesses out there that can be made to take a more ethical and responsible stance if we create the right conditions to encourage it. And happily for me there is already a growing movement within the more enlightened areas of the business world towards ethical business and sustainable capitalism.\nThat might sound like some thing of an oxymoron, but in many sectors of business now there’s a realisation dawning that if we continue to squeeze the pips of the economy, we’ll eventually run out of juice.\nAmidst calls from some people for a revolution against rampant capitalism, I see the future as more of an evolution towards a business ethos that views social justice and connection with local and national communities as an asset, rather than an inconvenience. I’m certainly not anti-capitalist, but I am anti-unfettered capitalism. I agree that the market should be allowed to decide some things. But I believe the state has the job of holding us all to account for our actions and tempering the excesses of marketisation to prevent it working against the common good.\nAnd it’s not just us greeny types taking up this mantra. Many key economists and business commentators are now having similar epiphanies about how business and consumption needs to be managed in a sustainable, responsible and accountable way, if we’re all going to avoid a backlash against the kinds of excesses and irresponsible business practices that became prevalent over the past 20 or 30 years.\nEssentially businesses need to grow up and take responsibility for the societies we’ve helped to create.\nI’ve recently become very interested in something now being called the circular economy, where consumption itself is fed back into the creation of new resources and products. This doesn’t just encompass recycling, but also upcycling and renewable energy as part of the manufacturing process, along with emergent technologies, social media, and the fourth economy, comprising enterprises that not only make a profit for business owners, but also put something back into the social economy.\nThat might all sound a bit hippy and tree-huggy, but it’s something that’s being taken very seriously now by many key figures in the business world. Most notably Bill Gates and Richard Branson. And with good reason.\nIf you can make money with clean conscience, look after your employees, business partners, suppliers, and most importantly the planet AND enjoy what you’re doing, what’s not to like?\nYou also get to sleep pretty well at night too\nSo I hope I can convince you that there is scope within a Green World for enterprise and innovation. Without the need for a constantly growing economy and an ever greater consumption of the worlds finite resources.\nWith the potential for over a million green jobs out there, and an ethical economy that has only scratched the surface of an emerging market, there are plenty of opportunities for business leaders and entrepreneurs in a future Green and pleasant land.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_green-party/content_17.html": "Tomorrow you have the chance to vote in one of the most historic elections in this country for many years.\nThis is going to be the last County Council election before both County and district Councils are abolished under plans being pushed forward by national government. Elections after this one are most likely to be associated with the new Unitary Authority which will be formed in Oxfordshire, although currently exactly what form that will take is unclear.\nThe option preferred by the Greens is one of 2 unitaries formed from Cherwell District, West Oxfordshire District and The City Councils with a second one formed around South Oxon and the Vale plus West Berkshire. We feel that would keep decision making as local as possible as well as ensuring that councillors don’t become too remote from the people they represent. The County Council Cabinet recently voted to push forward their preferred option of one huge council across the whole of the County, while the City Council are proposing they form their own Unitary Council by absorbing areas around them such as Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke. I would certainly strongly oppose that, as, I believe, would most of the residents in those areas!\nThe outcome of all these options could largely be driven by those people elected to the County Council tomorrow, so not only is it important to vote because it may be your last opportunity, it’s also doubly important that you get a councillor who is going to represent your views on what your future council may look like.\nOf course my advice is to vote Green at least in areas where you already have a Green Councillor such as the two new Divisions in Kidlington which make up nearly 80% of the area I currently represent on the County Council. As I can’t be in 2 places at once I have decided to stand in the new East Division because I am involved in several ongoing issues there, Not least the proposed football stadium and the huge Oxford North development. But my fellow Green Councillor Fiona Mawson is standing in the other part, now called Kidlington West even though 2 thirds of it comprises Yarnton and Begbroke. As the only candidate in this election that actually lives in that new division, I’m hopeful that she will get a good reception from voters.\nto show Green and Conservative representation\nCurrently the whole of the Kidlington East area is represented by me as the County Councillor and by me, Fiona and Linda Ward as District councillors. I’d like to think we’ve done a good job of representing the everyone there, we all certainly work hard to achieve that, so I hope I will receive your support in the East whilst Fiona is elected to replace me in the West.\nIt’s a rather complicated scenario , especially given that the whole set up is likely to change in 2 or 3 years so neither of us are likely to see out a full term as County Councillors, but in the meantime it’s important that both areas keep consistent Green representation so that work I and Fiona have started on things like ensuring development proposals are beneficial to the area can continue into the next few years, along with our input into the re-shaping of local government over the next 2 years.\nHowever you vote (and I hope it will be Green) do make sure you vote. It may be the only chance you get to make a decision that affects you and your local community for the next few years.\nIf you need any further information from me or Fiona please let us know. We have knocked on a lot of doors over the past few months, so if we missed you we’d be happy to talk.",

The chance to vote to end 14 years of Tory misrule and see change. But is it really?\nTwo parties are saying they would provide change, but only one is offering REAL change and REAL hope – The Green Party.\nThe Labour Party slogan ‘Change’ is so reductive and self fulfilling it’s almost worthless as an electoral ambition. Will Labour provide change? Well yes, if they’re elected as the majority government we will see a change by definition. Where there was once Rishi Sunak, there will be Keir Starmer. A clear change of leader and administration, but is that all we want? Will we see REAL change? I rather doubt it.\nLabour’s manifesto suggests otherwise with so many policies seemingly just a continuation of what we have with the Tories. Things like the Bedroom Tax, The Two Child Benefit cap, a continuation of the oil and gas drilling licences granted by the Conservatives, including the highly questionable Rosebank. None of that will change and neither will things like private provision in the NHS or a really progressive tax regime.\nSo what real change will we see with Labour, or any of the other parties for that matter? It looks like the only thing that will be changing will be the climate!\nEven the Liberal Democrats haven’t really committed to change on important things like tax reform or tuition fees which of course they were instrumental in bringing in. Their candidate in Bicester & Woodstock is a well meaning guy, but he was also an adviser to the coalition government during the first period of austerity, as was the Conservative candidate, so not much change for the better there!\nCan I win in Bicester and Woodstock? That depends on you, the voters. It’s a circular argument that Greens can’t win so we don’t get votes, but if we don’t get votes we can’t win. But even if I don’t win my purpose is still to raise more awareness of the Green Party and our values. A party I’ve supported for 12 years and voted for for even longer, back when they were even more unlikely to be elected. Since then there’s been a huge surge in support for Greens, something I’ve seen first hand after being elected to 5 different councils as a Green and re-elected to one of those since.\nIf the Green Party didn’t exist and people hadn’t voted for them, do you think the other parties would have taken any notice of climate change or other Green issues? I very much doubt it and that’s even more obvious now that parties like Labour and the Conservatives are backing away from their climate change commitments because to stick by them is electorally inconvenient.\nSo the Greens have brought about real change over the past decade and will continue to push for more in the coming years, especially as we are looking set to at least triple our representation in Westminster. Change on things like the NHS, social care, social security, justice, equal rights, animal welfare, nature recovery, climate change and so much more.\nI’d of course love to be one of those parliamentarians helping to make those changes, as our new MPs will do through careful lobbying and internal pressure on whomever is in power by the end of this week. But I know that’s unlikely. But every vote for me and every other Green candidate still counts. It counts as part of the message the whole country needs to send to Westminster, even more so as the ruling party is likely to have a majority so large that they probably won’t be in the mood to listen to anyone else.\nBut I have faith that Greens will always find a way to move the needle and work for positive change. And I’ll continue to do that whatever happens in the polls on Thursday. I’m content to play a role, no matter how small in helping to make the future a brighter place for the next generation. Your vote can help me and every other Green candidate to do that, so I hope you’ll give that thought some serious consideration when you mark that cross on the ballot sheet.\nThe polls suggest that the outcome to this election is a foregone conclusion. Labour will comfortably win a huge majority and in Bicester & Woodstock the Lib Dems will romp home. If nothing else people will vote for them just to stop them sending any more leaflets! So you can safely vote Green, knowing it’s extremely unlikely to change that outcome.\nSo more than ever in this election you can vote with your heart to make real change happen. Change that means more than a different name on the House of Commons letterhead. Otherwise we’ll be right back here in 5 or 10 years time, probably with the Conservatives promising the change that we never really seem to get.\nAs someone else said during this election “If you want change you have to vote for it”. If you want REAL change you have to vote Green!",

She claims to offer strength and stability yet throws the country into turmoil just as the clock starts ticking on Brexit negotiations. Whilst our changed relationship with Europe is one of the most important issues we’ve faced for a generation, we’ve also had 2 years to see what the Conservative Party has done to health, education and housing and it’s not a pretty sight.\nThe NHS in particular is facing an existential crisis with yet another round of swingeing cuts being imposed by further Conservative in the guise of sustainability. Already we’ve seen the results with the closure of full maternity services at the Horton and warnings from the Oxfordshire CCG that we stand to lose hundreds of beds across the county. This may be the last chance to save our wonderful NHS before the Conservatives achieve their ultimate goal of slashing services and privatising what’s left.\nTheresa May wants this election to be all about Brexit, I think we should be holding her party to account for it’s appalling record so far. We have a chance to end their iniquitous and self serving reign now, before it’s too late”",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_market/content_189.html": "Last week myself and John Haywood from the Banbury and Cherwell Green Party visited the market in central Banbury to speak to the stall holders about the changes being proposed to this 1000 year old tradition in the heart of an historic town.\nWe spoke with all the stallholders present, although sadly they were only 10 of them trading on the day. They were all all opposed to Cherwell District Council’s illogical and damaging decision to restrict the stalls to the Cornhill end of the Market Place. A plan also supported by the Conservative controlled Town Council.\nI started my own 25 year long retail career on a market stall, and worked it for 7 years with my partner though rain, hail sleet, snow and sunshine. I know how difficult it can be to make a living and how fragile the trading environment can be. Your livelihood can depend on so many variable factors, and one of the major fears is losing your regular pitch, for whatever reason.\nIt may seem silly to anyone who hasn’t traded in a market themselves, but where your stall sits can make all the difference between success and failure. The location of competing trades, the flow of people moving through the market, who your neighbours are, your visibility and prominence in the market as a whole are all desperately important.\nThere appears to have been absolutely no consultation with stall holders or customers about these unpopular changes, and based on what stallholders and visitors told me I foresee them being the death knell for this historic trading post as more and more traders fall by the wayside.\nSo what seems like a minor change to the council, will probably be anything but to the people trying to make a living out of the market. This move could likely kill it off! it’s already become smaller and therefore less popular, especially over the last 20 years. In 1997 there were 120 stalls, now its down to less than 20.\nConsidering it’s reduced pull for consumers it’s completely incongruous that the rents being charged by the private firm managing on behalf of the council are almost double that charged by neighbouring markets such as Abingdon, Aylesbury, Hinkley, Oxford and Thame. And as with most things these days, the rent goes up every year. Meanwhile trade is slowly dwindling away to nothing, leaving regular and loyal traders quite literally out in the cold.\nThe Council’s plan includes opening the Market car park for use on Thursdays and Fridays. There is no evidence to suggest this will increase car park usage and revenue to the Council – people already using other car parks such as that near to the Matalan Store will simply park in the market place instead.\nGovernment initiatives on town centre regeneration called for more emphasis and support for market days and the traders that build and run these vital hubs of trade and local amenity in our towns and cities. The Portas review cited markets as one of the easiest ways that town centres could be revitalised and kept alive. Why then is the Conservative run Cherwell Council ignoring the views of it’s own established market traders? Why are they proposing moves that could potentially irreparably damage trade in such an established and once vibrant local fixture?\nBanbury market should be seen by Cherwell Council as an asset to the town. They should be supporting it actively and engaging with the traders and customers to find ways of safeguarding the it’s future, rather than taking unilateral actions with no consultation.\nThis is a Charter Market, which bestows on Banbury the status of a Market Town. By birthright it should be located in the Market Square.\nI would urge Cherwell councillors to do what I did. Take a walk around the market and speak to the people whose livelihoods are in their hands. Speak also to the local residents and patrons of the market and ask them what they think about the priorities that they are planning to enforce on everyone.\nThis is not a decision that can be taken just by moving squares on a map.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_politics_page_10/content_443.html": "This is a copy of a piece I wrote for Huffington Post this week. You can find and comment on the original here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/eu-referendum-immigration_b_9322718.html\nSo here it is. After years of campaigning and complaining, manoeuvring and cajoling, half-truths and good old fashioned British pig-headedness, the moaning masses of middle England have finally got their referendum.\nI say ‘their’ referendum because this isn’t being staged at great expense for those of us who want to stay part of Europe. It’s not even for those who don’t really give a toss either way.\nIt’s certainly not for those more outward looking souls, who appreciate the many advantages of being a member of the European club. The easy movement between states (yes that does apply to us as well as all those annoying refugees and migrants) and the free transport of goods. Funding for urban and industrial renewal. Numerous environmental improvements to beaches, rivers and the countryside, including controls on things like GMOs. Human rights, animal rights, consumer rights. Cheaper phone charges and easier and cheaper travel and currency exchange. Social welfare protection and labour rights, and a panoply of other advantages that most people take for granted and will miss when they’re gone.\nNo, it’s a referendum for misguided and ill-informed little-Englanders, draped in Union flags, firm in the belief of two world wars and one world cup and certain the word ‘Great’ attached to Britain means something other than the first letter on a sticker they slap on the back of their booze cruise charabang, just to remind those envious foreigners that they were unlucky enough to be born on inferior soil.\nBut moreover, it’s a referendum for politicians who have been looking at continental Europe down the wrong end of the telescope for so long now, they just don’t realise how small this country has become on the world stage. A myopic concern about how much money we pay to Europe and a studied ignorance of the huge returns our EU membership generates.\nMost people who focus on our payment to Brussels like to remind us what else we could do with that money. Yet with a growing national debt, and stubbornly high deficit, any such savings would likely fall into the same black hole as most of the rest of our national finances. Either that or it would go towards servicing the country’s circa £50bn annual interest payments, paid in large part to European banks anyway.\nIt’s not 1975. The geo-political landscape has changed around us since the last time we decided if we wanted to be a part of Europe. Yes, back in the swinging 70s it was the ‘Common Market’, but by necessity and common interest it’s become more than that. Those advocating some kind of return to a simple trading relationship are ignoring both the reality of our reduced place in the world and the promiscuity of world markets.\nNeither is it 1938, even though Cameron’s Chamberlain moment was equally as hollow. Just like his pre-war counterpart, the agreement he reached in Brussels was peripheral and disposable, focussing as it did on the false polemic of immigration and border control.\nIt was a pantomime, with Donald Tusk and Angela Merkel as the ugly sisters to Cameron’s Cinderella. Shouts of “they’re behind you” were evident from the likes of UKIP and Front National pointing to the ‘hordes’ or ‘swarms’ or ‘bunches’ of ‘migrants’, ‘refugees’ or ‘immigrants’, depending on which description David Cameron and the BBC have alighted on this week.\nI totally agree that EU democratic and regulatory processes are in desperate need of reform, but these weren’t the points that Cameron argued. Driven by domestic pressures, piled on by a widening xenophobic rhetoric, he was pushed into a rushed and ill-conceived round of negotiations that resulted in him metaphorically claiming ‘peace in our time’ outside Number 10. It was a performance put on to give him a platform to launch the referendum that we all knew was coming, and the critic’s reviews weren’t great.\nSadly for him, us, and the rest of Europe, this was a missed opportunity that could have sparked a trans-national debate about the real future of the EU and brought about radical changes to shape it into something more even-handed and responsive to the needs of all member states.\nBut instead, Cameron wasted what could have been his real place in history for the sake of a thumbs up from the likes of Farage, Gove and Galloway whilst gaining little tangible return for the UK, save for some token restrictions on benefit payments to migrants who rarely claim them anyway.\nIn fact it’s recently been revealed that the UK government has no idea how much immigration costs us, nor how much migrants contribute to our economy. But let’s not let a little thing like lack of facts get in the way of a nicely staked out scapegoat.\nAnd while we’re on the subject of discrimination, we mustn’t forget those hard-pressed city bankers quaking in their handmade brogues, terrified that they may be penalised for being outside the Eurozone. That of course, amid the posturing about immigration, was the main concern for Cameron and his paymasters. Essentially he was in Brussels to fight for the right to discriminate against the poor whilst protecting the interests of the obscenely rich, although of course that wasn’t so eagerly reported.\nAnd there we have it. The crux of all this political, psychological and media-spun mendacity – Corporate interest. Insular businesses seeking to rid themselves of the European interference and regulation that keeps all the rest of us safer and better looked after. The refugee and migrant crises couldn’t have come at a better time for these vested interests to galvanise public opinion in favour of an out vote.\nOn this flimsiest of pretexts, and on evidence largely pulled out UKIP’s collective backside, we’re potentially going to launch ourselves into one of the biggest national disasters for several generations. The ‘Brexit’ silo mentality that is about as relevant in today’s globally connected society as statutes recorded on vellum.\nOne of the greatest achievements and advantages of the EU is freedom of movement between states. It’s a harbinger of a future globalised socio-economic system where borders and statehood will be irrelevant. One where the term ‘economic-migrant’ will no longer be a thinly veiled insult, just as it wasn’t when we and other nations economically migrated across the globe centuries ago, annexing and occupying entire countries as we went. In that context, and in view of the Tories much vaunted ‘on your bike’ ethos, I find it perplexing that we now seem to regard our attraction as place of opportunity as a bad thing.\nAnd while we’re on that subject, if I were a British migrant living on the continent I’d be feeling distinctly uncomfortable right now. Especially those who have lived there for longer than 15 years and are inexplicably denied the right to vote in a referendum that may well decide their future.\nThose whistling tunes in the dark about independent trade agreements with Europe and other global partners will soon find that our status as the 5th richest nation in the world is built on foundations largely stamped with a CE logo. Already Sterling has plummeted on the news that Boris is heading for the lifeboats.\nMuch of our apparent wealth is generated by the financial sector and supported by our membership of the EU. Who will want to trade with us as a small individual nation with a growing national debt and a dwindling economic base? No wonder the city was such a key part of Cameron’s negotiations.\nThe finance sector is pretty much all we have left. We don’t have anything else to trade. China and the USA know this and have already warned us that a UK outside the EU will be of much less interest to them. The US in particular sees our connection with Europe as a valuable conduit into EU financial markets.\nUncoupling ourselves from the EU will be a long, painful and essentially irreversible process. We won’t wake up one day and see bluebirds over the white cliffs and a land of milk and honey for all. It will take years of debate, legal dispute and the unpicking of labyrinthine systems of regulation woven into our own statutory frameworks. A drawn out and retrograde process, during which I believe we’ll slowly come to see the folly of our ways.\nAnd once we’ve closed our borders and thumbed our noses at one of the biggest trading blocs on the planet, it will be too late to realise that we’re now more of a Pekinese than a bulldog. An isle not so much sceptred as septic, poisoned by our own arrogance and bigotry, left entirely at the mercy of a broken political system where wealth goes one way, and protection is only there for those who can afford it.\nAs Britain shrivels into, at best, a tawdry tax haven in perpetual serfdom to a rich elite, we’ll come to the sad realisation that we’ve been sold a Jerusalem built on false promises and false flags. I wonder if border controls and apocryphal straight bananas will seem quite so important then.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_oxfordshire-county-council/content_245.html": "It’s hard to believe it’s 4 years since I was elected as the first Green County Councillor in Cherwell in 2021 during the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. It was a worrying time for all of us and as a new County Councillor I had to quickly come to terms with my new responsibilities whilst navigating remote meetings and all the various limitations that were placed on all of us in our day to day lives. I know people who were personally affected by the virus and some that still are. Thankfully I and most of my family came out unscathed, although I did lose a close family member to the virus who I still miss today.\nCovid now seems like a distant memory as we all deal with other issues, not least the cost of living crisis, the ongoing lack of affordable housing and the pressures on our health service. We are also about to see seismic changes in the way local government operates which means that this is likely to be the last County Council election in Oxfordshire.\nWe also have boundary changes to the County Council which sees my current division of Kidlington South split into 2 new divisions – Kidlington East and Kidlington West. This left me with a dilemma about which division to stand in for this election. Ultimately I chose Kidlington East which includes most of the area that is also covered by my District Council Ward. I’ve dealt with a lot of casework in this part of my current division and there are still a number of ongoing issues so I feel I have to try to maintain some contiunity there.\nWe do also have a strong Green candidate in Kidlington West though, which includes Yarnton and Begbroke as well as Roundham ward in Kidlington. My wife and fellow councillor District and Parish Councillor Fiona Mawson is standing there and I hope she will be able to provide some continuity of representation there, as well as building on her 10 years experience as a Yarnton Parish Councillor where she is currently the Deputy Chair.\nOver the next 2-3 years there will also be a further reorganisation of local government which will see a single authority combining the remits of both the District and the County Council. The details of how this will be achieved are still being hammered out but there are concerns that moving to a larger, more remote authority could reduce local engagement.\nThere are also moves being made by the City Council to expand their borders to swallow up areas like Kidlington, Gosford, Yarnton and Begbroke into one larger authority. I don’t think that’s what local residents want. Neither do I think it will be in their best interests. So I will be fighting to maintain the integrity of all our local villages to prevent us becoming just a suburb of Oxford city.\nOn top of this we have to deal with the creation of a new local plan amidst sweeping changes to the planning process which could also see a significant erosion of local democracy. This is likely to lead to even more erosion of our surrounding green spaces, especially if the City Council get their way.\nSo it’s clear that, during the next few years, we will need strong voices at all levels of local government in Oxfordshire to ensure we end up with a workable model that truly represents local residents and responds to their needs. I would like to continue to be that voice for Kidlington East\nWhilst I hope we won’t be facing anything on the scale of Covid again for a very long time, there could be other equally disruptive events on the world stage coming our way. We are now seeing the impacts of climate change on our communities with increased incidents of flooding which has brought misery to many residents. I’m working hard to try to reduce the impact of that and we’ve seen new measures introduced locally to support residents faced with the threat of flooding. I am continuing to push for more.\nSo I hope you will choose to support me again in the County Elections on May 1st to work for you as probably your last county councillor before the changes are made to local government structures. I still feel there’s work to be done in the division, not least in the face of some of the new developments that over the next few years that could have significant impacts on all our lives along with the challenges posed by national government and global events.\nI’m trying to get round to meet as many people on the doorstep as possible, but with all the changes going on at the moment, it’s a huge task. If you’d like me to come and see you to discuss any local issues please contact me and I’ll try to arrange something. Otherwise feel free to email, message or call me.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_defections/content_243.html": "This is a piece I wrote for Huffington Post earlier this week. I think it speaks for itself, although after it was published I thought I should have pointed out that none of the the politicians I refer to in the studio on election night were Greens. As usual we weren’t invited to the BBC party. There were however representatives from Labour, Conservative, Libdems and UKIP. Given that the Greens had a reasonably good showing in the last General Election in Rochester (for a ‘marginal’ party) I’d have thought we’d have been worth a mention at least. But apparently not.\nAnyway I hope this serves as a good first post on my website/blog and you can see the original article here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/westminster-politics_b_6199214.html?utm_hp_ref=tw.\nFeel free to comment below or on the original article on the Huffington Post site.\nI recently became a parliamentary candidate for the Green Party. After years of railing against politicians, the irony, and perhaps the hypocrisy, of becoming one myself has not been lost on me.\nThen again, there were the constant jibes about my complaining a lot but doing nothing positive to make a change. So when my local party group asked me to stand, I said I’d give it a go. And here I am. Feel free to point the finger.\nOne of the first things I’ve noticed about the underbelly of politics is just how strategic it is. Target wards, target seats, candidates standing in constituencies where they don’t live for the sake of political expediency. None of this is new, or unusual, or even un-democratic, but it does take some getting used to.\nBut watching the BBC election special on the Rochester and Strood by-election, you could be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the political world has turned into some kind of wife swapping party from the mid 70s. It seems these days that political manoeuvring between the ruling parties has moved beyond juggling their own family jewels, and has been reduced to chucking their keys into the fruit bowl with anyone who fancies a quick fumble with their majority.\nFirstly we had UKIP’s Deputy Chairperson Suzanne Evans being interviewed about where her party would go after the predicted win in Rochester. This consisted of a serious of nods and winks about who might and might not leap out of their own party bed and sneak into theirs when the neighbours weren’t looking. A sort of Carry-On Westminster, but with less laughs.\nShe then went on to explain, with barely concealed glee, that her fondest ambition was to seduce someone from Labour to join in their little tryst. Nigel is apparently talking to a couple of MPs but she couldn’t reveal more. She did everything but tap the side of her nose, elbow Andrew Neil in the ribs and give a little Babs Windsor giggle.\nThen we had an analysis from a political expert explaining how UKIP’s performance in the by-election would determine how other sitting MPs would behave in the run up to next years general election. His premise was that if UKIP did well in Rochester, many other career politicians would be considering their position in the next few months. The expectation is apparently that if they think UKIP is a better bet for them to hold on to their seat (ooh matron!), then they would switch allegiances in order to do so.\nNow you’ll have to excuse me. I’m quite new to this game. But when one joins a party isn’t there something about ideology written into the contract? Or am I now being ridiculously naive?\nJudging by the behaviour of at least two recent pantheons of British democracy I suppose I am. It seems that standing on a platform with a bunch of like minded individuals in the hope of doing something good for the country isn’t what it’s about any more.\nNo, apparently it’s more about hanging on to the House Of Commons parking place, the expense account, and access to the House of Commons bar, rather than the boring stuff like philosophical conviction. Some back-benchers are evidently more interested in maintaining a comfortable position for themselves, rather than for their constituents. Yet, in true British carry-on style, they still keep getting elected.\nAs a newcomer to this world, I saw with fresh eyes last night these four sombre suited politicians sitting uneasily with each other, smugly carving up the political cake amongst themselves. Like children at birthday party trying to decide who gets the last portion of jelly and ice cream, the polemic was about anything other than the issues that this country and the planet really face.\nIain Duncan Smith spent a good deal of his time justifying a particularly vituperative campaign poster that portrayed the idea of voting for Mark Reckless as on a par with seeking Pol Pot as a spiritual adviser. Reckless used to be an investment banker, he didn’t live in the area, he’d only moved there to take a safe seat. All very salient points for the local electorate, but ones that seemed exquisitely irrelevant when he was the Conservative MP only a few months ago.\nMeanwhile UKIP expounded their claim that they listened to the people, and were offering an alternative to the status quo of careerist politicians who’d never done a days honest labour in their lives. Odd then that their success last night, and in Clacton a few weeks ago, relied on exactly the reverse of those ideals by welcoming with open arms two MPs firmly rooted in the rotten political establishment they claimed to despise.\nOn the point of principle I am in total agreement with them. The current political establishment has reduced democracy to the level of swapping football cards in the playground. But it’s a tawdry game of top trumps that they have just as much of a hand in as all the other entrenched Westminster parties.\nIf this is the future of politics in this country, I’m glad to be a member of a party that currently stands as an exemplar of how it is still possible to operate democratically without playing these cynical games. We may now have one less MP than UKIP, but at least ours is there on merit, rather than because she swapped her rosette for a more appealing colour.\nAnd Caroline Lucas has just won MP of the year, which is something that gives me hope. Even so, she’s now the focus of a campaign to unseat her by the Labour party in Brighton, because, and despite of the fact, that Labour and the Greens share many of the same aims.\nMoreover, if all these people care about is hanging on to their positions at all costs, what really is the point? And if the electorate is so fickle that they can’t see through this charade, maybe we deserve the graceless, flagitious mess they all seem to be making of the world.\nOne apocryphal anecdote from Rochester I heard today was that someone had voted UKIP because the sitting Tory MP hadn’t done enough for the local area. If that’s true, it’s an indictment of the great British voter more demoralising than anything supposedly implied by hanging a flag out of the window of your mock-Georgian semi.\nBut as an accidental politician I have to hope that it isn’t true, or at least typical. I have to trust that people in the UK will see past all the identikit politicos, the vested interests and the horse trading of their democratic heritage, and vote for real change and genuine representation in the next government.\nI am ever the optimist.",

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_type_gallery_page_4/content_423.html": "OK, I’ll agree, the state of our roads in Oxfordshire is shocking.\nAs I journey around the district on my bike and by car I can see the number of cracks, holes and ravines as much as any other other road user and the situation is unacceptable.\nBut our roads didn’t get into this state in just the last 2 years!\nThe Conservatives have been grandstanding in this election about potholes and blaming the Lib Dem/Labour/Green coalition on the County Council for the situation. But it’s no worse now than it was under the last Conservative controlled administration. In fact it’s probably a bit better in terms of how responsive our road management team are.\nI appreciate that seeing so many potholes is frustrating. I’m reporting them every day and they have become more numerous recently after the changeable weather. Crews are out every day fixing them but it’s a battle to try to get the worst ones prioritised and everyone understandably wants to see those in their area fixed first. But the problem with repairing them is not lack of willingness by the council, it’s lack of money/resources.\nNot a new problem\nDuring the last year of the Tory run administration on OCC a story was run in the Oxford Mail which reported that an insurance company had ranked Oxfordshire fifth worst for the number of potholes reported between 2015 and 2018. Figures showed 93,112 potholes were reported during that period amounting to 19.6 potholes per km of road.\nThe figures, from The Insurance Emporium, showed other areas worse than Oxfordshire include East Riding of Yorkshire, Northamptonshire, Edinburgh and in top spot Devon as the worst for potholes. From personal experience I’d add our sister county Buckinghamshire to that list having driven though there recently, their roads make ours look like billiard tables!\nBut the current state of the roads is something that has been building up for years due to lack of investment by successive governments. I’m not even going to blame the Conservatives for it (as they are trying to do to us now) except to say that, as a Conservative administration themselves, they could probably have leant on the government a bit more to stump up some extra cash for repairs instead of borrowing their way out of the problem and saddling us with yet more debt that taxpayers will carry for years. Even then they still didn’t sort the problem out, because quite frankly it’s not sortable without massive investment.\nOxfordshire’s highways need about £45m a year just to stop them getting any worse. The council get less than a third of that from government and another third from local taxation. Some of the remaining third is covered by borrowing that was taken out by the previous administration that will run out in 2025 (although we’ll be paying millions in interest for many years to come). No one really knows where the funding will come from to cover that when that happens. A good chunk of that funding also goes on bridge repairs, and as many of you will have noticed, our bridges are also falling apart as well and if we have a catastrophic bridge failure the result could be a lot more serious than a puncture!\nOur existing roads, are essentially worn out due to lack of proper maintenance for decades. The main cause of this is lack of central government funding made worse by the austerity measures during the last 10 years. It would now cost billions across the county to bring them all up to a decent standard and that doesn’t include pathways.\nIn the meantime the government forces local authorities to build more roads through “growth schemes” tied to essential housing that they won’t provide enough funding to maintain in the future. So the deficit continues to widen.\nPlaying politics\nLets stop playing politics over potholes. Every party blames the other for the state of the roads , but ultimately it’s a matter of investment. We all hate potholes and we all know they shouldn’t be there, but it’s daft to suggest that not fixing them is a deliberate choice for any controlling administration. If we had the spare money, don’t you think we’d spend it just to get the problem off our desks? And before people jump on the usual “if you didn’t spend it on this or that, you could fix X number of potholes” remember that government is all about making those decisions. A few £100K here or there is never going to fix the problems we have with road maintenance now we need billions if we’re going to sort this mess out.\nAs an administration we are absolutely focussed on doing the best with what we have on pothole repairs. The response time on repairs is now much better, but I accept there’s still room for improvement, particularly in terms of the longevity of some of the repairs. But we are going to need serious cash if we’re going to meet residents’ expectations and any politician who tells you otherwise is just using this issue as a campaigning tool. The only ways to get those funds is an increase in council tax, a reduction in other vital services or a very significant injection of funding from the government – and I don’t mean the paltry £3m or so that they recently announced for Oxfordshire coincidentally just before the local elections!\nSo if you really want to see a longer term systemic improvement you need to lobby the government to properly support local authorities. While you’re at it, you could mention a similar situation with health and social care, especially as they’ve just cut promised funding for carers in half!",

This crash came in the wake of a similar event with an ESA rocket that crashed shortly after lift off in Virginia.\nSadly the Virgin crash cost the life of one of the pilots of the craft, but it raises issues around the viability of space tourism, not least because of the environmental impact of such catastrophic events. Moreover the question remains as to the point of these sub-orbital flights and if they will ever amount anything other than a quick joy ride on a very expensive roller-coaster for those that can afford the $250,000 ticket price.\nThere’s much talk during the programme about the cultural impact of these flights and how individuals are inspired by their trips. I don’t really buy that personally, and think that there’s a lot more that can be done to inspire scientific exploration on the face of this planet if you have half a billion dollars to throw around.\nIf nothing else Richard Branson could use that money to keep his long forgotten promise to make Virgin Atlantic the greenest airline on the planet.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_page_10/content_419.html": "I was flabbergasted to see cycle lane markings appearing on some roads in my ward in east Kidlington after asking the county council to repair them since I was elected in 2019.\nRoads such as Yarnton Road, which is a major route from Kidlington, have been in a terrible state of repair for years, with large potholes, cracks and raised areas around access covers. Areas near the kerbside are heavily damaged making for an uncomfortable and dangerous ride for cyclists and other road users. Yet repeated requests to the council and reports on Fix My Street have gone unheeded.\nNow, in the wake of increased cycling as a result of the pandemic, cycle lane symbols have appeared on this road on top of the cracks and potholes, with no attempt to repair the long-standing degradation of the road surface.\nOther roads, such as the Bicester Road, have had painted cycle lanes on the main carriageway for some time, but there are also poorly maintained and often blocked by parked cars meaning cyclists have to face oncoming traffic to navigate them. This is particularly bad given that this road has a local school and is also subject to an air quality management area.\nBut I was gobsmacked when I saw the cycling symbol on Yarnton Road. This is a road that I regularly cycle down and it’s a real bone shaker. It’s no exaggeration to say that you have to hang on for dear life as you bounce along the road near the curbs, dodging potholes and cracks. It’s especially dangerous at night.\nThe road forms part of a national cycling route, but you’d never know it to look at the surface of the carriageway. It’s certainly not for the faint-hearted! I couldn’t believe they just slapped a cycle symbol on the road without any attention to its terrible condition.\nIt takes more than a pot of paint and a stencil to create a cycle path. The road surface has to be fit for riders if they are to be encouraged to use it. Even motorists complain about the state of this road. How does the council expect cyclists to cope as they rattle across these severely damaged and uneven surfaces? This is just pure tokenism!\nIt just goes to show how little the council knows or cares about the plight of cyclists in the county. If they really want to encourage more sustainable transport, especially post COVID, they have to take cyclists needs into proper account when carrying out road maintenance rather than literally just painting over the cracks!\nWe need more Green councillors on the county council to take these sorts of issue seriously and deliver real improvements for cyclists, pedestrians and other road users, rather than these half-hearted token gestures from a council devoid of real leadership and direction.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2015_04/content_40.html": "The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is a EU/USA treaty being negotiated in secret on our behalf. I believe it is one of the most serious threats we have ever faced. Yet it’s a threat that many people haven’t even heard of.\nThis proposed agreement has implications on a national and global level, particularly the Investor-State Dispute Settlements clause which allows corporations and private companies to take legal action against governments if they pass laws that are regarded as restricting their ability to make profits.\nThis strikes directly at the heart of our democracy, whilst effectively handing over sovereignty of all signature countries to the whim Amongst other things, TTIP also has the potential to force this country to accept genetically modified organisms into our food supply.\nIt loosens banking regulations (as the more stringent US banking laws could be subject to the lighter laws in the UK) and it could threaten jobs as more companies will be able to base their operations in the USA where labour law, employee protection and health and safety are less strictly applied.\nTTIP could also have very serious implication for the NHS in terms of the penetration of public services by private companies. Indeed TTIP could very easily be used to prevent any future moves to stop the creeping privatisation of the NHS as this may be regarded as restrictive by corporations wanting a piece of the action.\nWhilst the Conservatives, Labour and the Libdems have all stated an ambition to ensure the NHS is excluded from TTIP, we have seen no guarantees on this from any quarter.\nMoreover the extremely secretive nature of the treaty and the way it is being negotiated on our behalf behind firmly closed doors, leads me to distrust the ability or even the will of some of our representatives to ensure such exclusions will be applied.\nThe fact that both Labour and the Conservatives have self evidently displayed an ambition to see large parts of the health service and social care hived off to private companies, amid a culture of marketisation and capitulation to private providers, leaves me with very little confidence in a positive outcome for our cherished NHS.\nThe Green Party is firmly committed to blocking TTIP where we are able to, and our MEPs have already expressed deep concern about what appears to be an unavoidable quiescence to this agreement.\nYou might like to read this article by Molly Scott Cato MEP, who was recently allowed into the inner sanctum where the treaty is being drafted. Although as you will see she was sworn to secrecy and was subject to extreme measures to prevent her from recording and/or reporting what she saw. This alone sounds some very loud alarm bells with me! http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/04/secrets-ttip-corporations-not-citizens-transatlantic-trade-deal\nIf I were to be elected, I would most fervently resist the inclusion of the UK within the TTIP treaty and I would also demand that the secret negotiations now being held in Brussels should be openly and frankly reported.\nHonest and open government is our only guarantee that those trusted to look after our interests do so diligently and effectively.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_type_gallery_page_27/content_495.html": "This is a piece I wrote for Huffington Post earlier this week. I think it speaks for itself, although after it was published I thought I should have pointed out that none of the the politicians I refer to in the studio on election night were Greens. As usual we weren’t invited to the BBC party. There were however representatives from Labour, Conservative, Libdems and UKIP. Given that the Greens had a reasonably good showing in the last General Election in Rochester (for a ‘marginal’ party) I’d have thought we’d have been worth a mention at least. But apparently not.\nAnyway I hope this serves as a good first post on my website/blog and you can see the original article here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/westminster-politics_b_6199214.html?utm_hp_ref=tw.\nFeel free to comment below or on the original article on the Huffington Post site.\nI recently became a parliamentary candidate for the Green Party. After years of railing against politicians, the irony, and perhaps the hypocrisy, of becoming one myself has not been lost on me.\nThen again, there were the constant jibes about my complaining a lot but doing nothing positive to make a change. So when my local party group asked me to stand, I said I’d give it a go. And here I am. Feel free to point the finger.\nOne of the first things I’ve noticed about the underbelly of politics is just how strategic it is. Target wards, target seats, candidates standing in constituencies where they don’t live for the sake of political expediency. None of this is new, or unusual, or even un-democratic, but it does take some getting used to.\nBut watching the BBC election special on the Rochester and Strood by-election, you could be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the political world has turned into some kind of wife swapping party from the mid 70s. It seems these days that political manoeuvring between the ruling parties has moved beyond juggling their own family jewels, and has been reduced to chucking their keys into the fruit bowl with anyone who fancies a quick fumble with their majority.\nFirstly we had UKIP’s Deputy Chairperson Suzanne Evans being interviewed about where her party would go after the predicted win in Rochester. This consisted of a serious of nods and winks about who might and might not leap out of their own party bed and sneak into theirs when the neighbours weren’t looking. A sort of Carry-On Westminster, but with less laughs.\nShe then went on to explain, with barely concealed glee, that her fondest ambition was to seduce someone from Labour to join in their little tryst. Nigel is apparently talking to a couple of MPs but she couldn’t reveal more. She did everything but tap the side of her nose, elbow Andrew Neil in the ribs and give a little Babs Windsor giggle.\nThen we had an analysis from a political expert explaining how UKIP’s performance in the by-election would determine how other sitting MPs would behave in the run up to next years general election. His premise was that if UKIP did well in Rochester, many other career politicians would be considering their position in the next few months. The expectation is apparently that if they think UKIP is a better bet for them to hold on to their seat (ooh matron!), then they would switch allegiances in order to do so.\nNow you’ll have to excuse me. I’m quite new to this game. But when one joins a party isn’t there something about ideology written into the contract? Or am I now being ridiculously naive?\nJudging by the behaviour of at least two recent pantheons of British democracy I suppose I am. It seems that standing on a platform with a bunch of like minded individuals in the hope of doing something good for the country isn’t what it’s about any more.\nNo, apparently it’s more about hanging on to the House Of Commons parking place, the expense account, and access to the House of Commons bar, rather than the boring stuff like philosophical conviction. Some back-benchers are evidently more interested in maintaining a comfortable position for themselves, rather than for their constituents. Yet, in true British carry-on style, they still keep getting elected.\nAs a newcomer to this world, I saw with fresh eyes last night these four sombre suited politicians sitting uneasily with each other, smugly carving up the political cake amongst themselves. Like children at birthday party trying to decide who gets the last portion of jelly and ice cream, the polemic was about anything other than the issues that this country and the planet really face.\nIain Duncan Smith spent a good deal of his time justifying a particularly vituperative campaign poster that portrayed the idea of voting for Mark Reckless as on a par with seeking Pol Pot as a spiritual adviser. Reckless used to be an investment banker, he didn’t live in the area, he’d only moved there to take a safe seat. All very salient points for the local electorate, but ones that seemed exquisitely irrelevant when he was the Conservative MP only a few months ago.\nMeanwhile UKIP expounded their claim that they listened to the people, and were offering an alternative to the status quo of careerist politicians who’d never done a days honest labour in their lives. Odd then that their success last night, and in Clacton a few weeks ago, relied on exactly the reverse of those ideals by welcoming with open arms two MPs firmly rooted in the rotten political establishment they claimed to despise.\nOn the point of principle I am in total agreement with them. The current political establishment has reduced democracy to the level of swapping football cards in the playground. But it’s a tawdry game of top trumps that they have just as much of a hand in as all the other entrenched Westminster parties.\nIf this is the future of politics in this country, I’m glad to be a member of a party that currently stands as an exemplar of how it is still possible to operate democratically without playing these cynical games. We may now have one less MP than UKIP, but at least ours is there on merit, rather than because she swapped her rosette for a more appealing colour.\nAnd Caroline Lucas has just won MP of the year, which is something that gives me hope. Even so, she’s now the focus of a campaign to unseat her by the Labour party in Brighton, because, and despite of the fact, that Labour and the Greens share many of the same aims.\nMoreover, if all these people care about is hanging on to their positions at all costs, what really is the point? And if the electorate is so fickle that they can’t see through this charade, maybe we deserve the graceless, flagitious mess they all seem to be making of the world.\nOne apocryphal anecdote from Rochester I heard today was that someone had voted UKIP because the sitting Tory MP hadn’t done enough for the local area. If that’s true, it’s an indictment of the great British voter more demoralising than anything supposedly implied by hanging a flag out of the window of your mock-Georgian semi.\nBut as an accidental politician I have to hope that it isn’t true, or at least typical. I have to trust that people in the UK will see past all the identikit politicos, the vested interests and the horse trading of their democratic heritage, and vote for real change and genuine representation in the next government.\nI am ever the optimist.",

Problems with roads, cycle paths, flooding and other county wide issues are raised with me frequently and I do my best to deal with them. But the stumbling block is often that the county council tends to be less receptive to me as a District Councillor leaving me with very little in the way of influence.\nIf I sat on the county council I think so many of the things I work and campaign for, not least tackling important issues like climate change, would be far easier to get done.\nTo that end I hope you’ll feel able to support me in some way, either by donating to and sharing my fundraiser or hopefully helping out in other practical ways like delivering leaflets or letters, filling envelopes, or maybe helping with door knocking or telephone canvassing.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_ge2017/content_311.html": "I love a bit of comedy as much as the next person, but I do sometimes wish comedians would stay out of politics.\nIn 2015 Russell Brand advised young people not to vote as part of his personal philosophy of half-baked revolution. As a result he bears some of the blame for a Conservative majority borne on the backs of the large number of older voters who didn’t see the 2 minutes it took to mark an X on a ballot sheet as so desperately uncool.\nThis time we have Ricky Gervais leaping into the fray with this tweet :\n“OK. I’m not telling you how to vote, but this is a fact. The only vote that will keep Theresa May out is a vote for @jeremycorbyn. Cheers”\nWhilst not quite so devoid of acumen as Brand’s ill-conceived advice, Ricky’s more well meaning call to action could be equally as dangerous.\nEssentially he IS telling his fans how to vote, and his less politically astute followers may not realise the pitfalls of such a binary choice.\nThe reality is that in many constituencies a vote for Corybn will not keep Theresa May out. The real fact is that it may do the exact opposite.\nSadly, even after repeated calls from other parties to enter into an ad-hoc alliance, Labour has resolutely refused to stand aside in any constituency. Whereas, for example, The Green Party has done so now in well over 30 seats.\nIn many of those seats the Libdems have a much better chance of winning than Labour. In some others the Greens or the SNP could have it in the bag. Voting Labour could then very well help the Tories by splitting the opposition.\nBy selling the idea that a vote for Labour is a vote against the Tories, no matter where you are, The Labour party and many of its supporters could be handing another victory to the Conservatives.\nI’m not usually an advocate of tactical voting, but needs must when the devil drives, and I see the devil behind the eyes of the Conservatives. But tactical voting has to be just that. It doesn’t simply mean voting Labour as the only alternative.\nUnder our broken electoral system the only place votes really count are in marginal constituencies. Until we get electoral reform and a system of proportional representation, that won’t change. And let’s not forget that Labour supports our first past the post system just as much as the Tories do.\nBut even in a safe seat your vote can make a real difference. In 2015 UKIP gave the Conservatives a real run for their money. Even though they only won one seat in Parliament they put the Tories on notice that they were there, close behind, snapping at their heels.\nThe result was the delivery of a referendum on EU membership and the subsequent lurch to the right that followed in the footsteps of Theresa May. The Conservative manifesto, such as it is, represents one of the most extreme right outlooks for the UK for many generations. It makes Margaret Thatcher’s vision look like a tie-dyed, rose tinted call to action for the love generation. It has even been compared to the BNP’s warped ideological ramblings from the 1980s, and not without cause.\nThis can be directly traced to UKIP’s influence and its validation of ideals that make a hard line, right wing agenda more palatable to people who wouldn’t dream of dancing to the tune of more overtly hard right parties.\nLikewise the nomination and election of Jeremy Corbyn can, to a large extent, be laid at the feet of the Green Party. There can’t be many Greens who haven’t noticed just how many of our clothes have recently been stolen by Corbyn’s party. And many of us are happy to be standing here in our underwear, glad that so many of our policies have been subsumed into the Labour manifesto. The sincerest form of flattery and all that.\nBut it has to be remembered that the rise of Green membership and our increasing success in both national and local elections is arguably a major driving force behind Labour’s newly rediscovered left wing credentials and a strong Green vote will help them keep that focus.\nVoting for parties that may not be mainstream, and may not have a chance of winning is not a wasted vote. Even less so in constituencies where the seat is safer than a Roy Chubby Brown joke at a UKIP convention. A vote for the party that more closely reflects your views has a demonstrable impact on those do so to a lesser extent.\nIn the case of Labour, voting for them in constituencies they can’t win may not just prevent other parties from doing so, it also reinforces the status quo of a de facto two party state and removes Labour’s incentive to join an alliance or support electoral reform if, as is still being predicted, they don’t have a majority on June 9th.\nEven if Labour were to win, there’s a very good chance that Corbyn could be unseated early on in his reign, by a parliamentary party who still don’t wholeheartedly support him. Without the threat of other left wing alternatives looking over their shoulders, it’s entirely possible that Labour will drift back to the same Tory-lite, neoliberalism that they were so conformable with last time.\nSo unless you have a realistic opportunity of a tactical vote in your constituency, just voting for the ‘other guy’ (or gal) won’t send any sort of message other than a validation of entrenched positions.\nIf you’re not going to see real change this time around. If your vote is only going to be lost in a sea of others who voted forlornly for the a close second, or the next best thing, use it to support those who will affect real change in the longer term by holding toes to the fire in the meantime.",

But we’re used to tall orders. In the face of what seems like a deliberate policy of starving us of media attention in favour of far more ratings grabbing pint-swilling politico-celebs like Nigel Farage, we’re still garnering support from credible commentators and respected political analysts for both our economic and social justice proposals.\nFormer Citibank financial trader Gary Stevenson and host of the You Tube Channel Gary’s Economics has analysed the Green Party manifesto and classified it as the most credible and honest in real terms. In a recent video he confirmed that he would be voting Green because we are the only party to be offering a radical and workable alternative to the proposals from every other party.\nTrade Unionist and former General Secretary of the Labour Party Jennie Formby has also announced on Twitter that she would be voting Green in this election along with numerous other high profile political and cultural leaders such as George Monbiot. It’s also reported that more and more young people are turning to the Greens as a real alternative to the ping-pong politics of the past 50 years.\nAs a moderate Green myself I’ve always seen the Greens as a true alternative vote, neither left or right. The Green Party officially rejects the traditional left–right political spectrum, describing it as “something of an anachronism” and that perfectly fits with my view on the world.\nI’m standing as the Parliamentary Candidate for Bicester and Woodstock mainly because it’s my home constituency and the place I’ve made my home for 32 years. But above all that, it’s a place I’ve seen change drastically in that time with even more drastic changes in the pipeline. From the massive development plans in and around Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Bicester with large areas of greenbelt being decimated by ill-conceived local plans to proposals to armour plate 3500 acres of green fields and farmland for hugely unpopular solar farm project in the west. I’m concerned about what these things will do to the place I’ve called home for nearly half my life.\nThere’s obviously going to be a lot more to say on this election in the remaining 2 weeks, much of which I’ve not said so far due to dealing with my new responsibilities on Cherwell District Council after being appointed to the executive on the same night that the General Election was announced (great timing Rishi!). But I’ll be breaking my silence over the next 2 weeks.\nIn the meantime, doors are being knocked, leaflets are being delivered and pollsters are polling. There’s been a huge amount of speculation about who can win in this constituency and I’m not going to add to that with my own obviously biased opinions. But with a newly drawn boundary, every voter has the historic opportunity to vote in a brand new Westminster constituency for the first time where we could all buck the trends and help me and the Greens to show that any prediction in an unknown and untested area could be drastically inaccurate.\nCan I win? Who knows? Am I serious about my candidacy? Absolutely! But then as anyone who knows me and knows my work as a local councillor and activist would tell you, I never do things by half measures. We all know that the Tories are finished, at least for the immediate future. We don’t need to vote tactically on a local basis in this election because after 14 years of chaos the country has finally woken up and are about to consign the current administration to the political skip.\nThat gives every voter in this area new opportunities and new possibilities. You can vote with your heart and for what you believe in. If that’s a better future for you and your family, a fully funded NHS and social care system, public utilities returned to responsible public control (particular water and energy), a better standard of living for all, raising millions out of poverty and protecting climate and nature, voting Green really is the only alternative. Even if I don’t win the seat, a vote for me that would contribute to a large swing to the Greens nationally will strengthen our hand in influencing national politics for the better. It will also put money into the party coffers through Short Money to help us continue the fight for a better, fairer, greener world for you and you family and their families to come.\nI’ll do my best over the next couple of weeks to make my case for your precious vote in this election and I hope you will seriously consider giving me that vote on July 4th.

This is not a problem unique to this county as so many councils now rely on commercial investment to make ends meet since central government no longer provide enough funding for even the basic services that we all rely on.\nThis problem is exacerbated by the fact that legislation requires local authorities to balance their budgets every year and prevents them from borrowing to cover any shortfalls. This leaves them in the position of trying to operate like private investors without having the same financial flexibility.\nWith many local authorities now heavily invested in commercial property they have all faced a huge shortfall in income from rents that have not been paid throughout the pandemic. To add insult to this injury, even though the Chancellor said he would provide “whatever it takes” to help local government, central government has excluded losses from commercial investments from it’s support payments to councils.\nThe need to balance the books each year results in councils being left with only 2 options when they have a shortfall in rents. Either they increase council tax (which can only be done up to certain limits without a costly referendum) or they cut services.\nthat’s going to be a pretty expensive chicken dinner for the residents of Cherwell!\nThis is what Cherwell District Council did in 2021 when they reported losses in the region of £1.6m against the Castle Quay shopping centre in Banbury. With similar losses predicted for the next financial year, this is likely to put the same pressures on the budget for the following year which will inevitably mean yet more cuts, along with additional charges like we’ve seen this year for things like garden waste collections.\nCommercial landlords would usually carry these sorts of shortfalls over a period of years, often borrowing to cover the gaps, and recover as much of the rent as they could over that time with deferral agreements with tenants. Ultimately some of the losses may have to be written off. But as explained above, councils can’t do this. So as long as these shortfalls are on the books, more cuts or tax increases are the only way to deal with the problem each year.\nIt was clear though from the interview Cllr Ilott really didn’t understand any of the mechanics of this, which is quite staggering considering his role on the council. When he was asked if he thought there should be a change in legislation that would allow councils to deal with these problems, he said he didn’t think so. Instead he chose to make childish personal comments about me and avoided answering the interviewer’s questions about how the council will recover these losses.\nit’s clear that they have no real vision for how to revitalise the development other than the idea that making it bigger will somehow make it better.\nHe did make mention of ‘working with tenants’ which of course is a good plan. As a retail consultant myself I’d always advocate such a move, but due to the limitations imposed on councils, this can only be done on a year by year basis. Any outstanding debts at the end of each year will need to be accounted for and action taken on increased taxation or services cuts.\nCllr Illot suggested that we look at things “in the round” and I agree we should do that. Unfortunately, time restraints on the programme prevented me from laying out the full details, but I’m happy to do so here :\n- Losses in the last financial year attributable to Castle Quay – £1.6m\n- Losses predicted in the next financial year due to Castle Quay – approx £1.6m\n- Rent owed to Cherwell District Council at this point – nearly £2m\n- Loss in value of Castle Quay shopping centre since the council took full ownership – over £30m (it’s now worth less than half what they paid for it 4 years ago)\n- Additional investment being ploughed into expanding the centre – £73m (underwritten by council tax payers)\n- Interest on the loans to finance all this (so far) – £2m+ per year\n- Cuts required to the entire council budget this year – £4.4m\nYes some of this can be blamed on the pandemic, but retail was already on the decline when the council took the frankly bizarre decision to buy the scheme, especially as it’s clear that they have no real vision for how to revitalise the development other than the idea that making it bigger will somehow make it better. That and Cllr Ilott’s head in the sand optimism seems to be the main strategy from our Conservative councillors.\nI don’t see that as good value for the council tax payers of Cherwell. Judging by Cllr Illott’s flippancy and lack of concern he seems to regard massive financial losses along with the associated financial impact on resident’s pockets as fine as long as he can get some chicken.\nI’d say that taking all that into account that’s going to be a pretty expensive chicken dinner for the residents of Cherwell!\nAnd let’s not forget that all this money is going into one town in Cherwell – Banbury. Meanwhile Bicester town centre’s retail area is being hollowed out due to the council’s planning decisions elsewhere, and the whole of the district – every single tax payer – is footing the bill for all this incompetence. As is often the case with Cherwell Council , the south of the district is left to fend for itself and pick up the tab. If I were a cynical soul I might suggest that this is because the majority of support for the councillors who agreed to this whole adventure comes from the north of the district.\nBut I think we should all be able to rely on decent fiscal management from our local councillors, no matter where we live. Sadly it seems clear to me that we can’t expect this as long as the Conservatives are in charge.\nIt’s about time the Tories got a proper grip on council finances and stopped playing chicken with all our money!",

They used the City Council’s claims of ‘unmet housing need’ as an excuse to facilitate investment and development opportunities for the university and other large landowners.\nWe begged the council to take a step back from their plans in view of the fact that the City hadn’t published a local plan proving their ‘unmet need’ This would have been a perfect justification, but they refused. So outrageously revisionist to claim it was all Labour’s fault!\nBut this statement in the Oxford Times from the City Council’s Labour leader Susan Brown does place their cards firmly on the table. She would rather continue to focus on economic and business development than provide affordable accommodation for their own needs.\nThere are multiple sites within the boundaries of the city that could be used for medium to high density housing to solve at least the immediate problems for housing the the city centre and in East Oxford. At least 4 of those site are slated for development, predominantly for business use.\nIt’s plain that the council has repeatedly and recklessly pursued economic development instead of housing under the leadership of Bob Price and the new Labour leader intends for this to continue.\nNow their new leader has made it clear that her intention (and presumably Labour’s) is to push that envelope even further. Increase business development in the city (even though unemployment there is virtually zero) and press district councils to plough up their green spaces and destroy natural habitat to build houses to fulfil their needs.\nPresumably Ms Brown is also happy to see the city export it’s obscenely high levels of pollution and appalling air quality into the green areas around her ever expanding empire like some post-apocalyptic behemoth, consuming everyone and everything in its path.\nThat’s not a vision of sustainability or quality of life I see as particularly attractive for anyone.\nYes we need to build houses, but they need to be the right houses in the right places. If Oxford city want to deal with their own housing crisis (assuming that is proven in their own yet to be completed local plan) then the right place for housing is within their own confines. At least it is before the expect other areas to cover their backsides!\nIt was good to see Labour members on Cherwell District Council supporting campaigners in defending our precious green belt, but they really do need to have a word with their colleagues on the city council and get them to set their own house in order, literally!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_countryside/content_236.html": "Hydraulic Fracturing or ‘Fracking’ is a new unconventional and controversial technique for extracting gas and in some case oil from the deep bedrock. It has serious environmental and quality of life issues for all of us, but particularly for those of us who live in areas that sit on top of these deposits. Unfortunately for us, that included large areas of North Oxford and Cherwell.\nFracking has been sold as being the answer to the UK’s energy problems, but in areas like the USA where it’s been widely used, this has not been proved to be the case. What has been shown is that it contaminates water supplies and creates huge amounts of noise and disruption for local residents. It’s also been implicated as the cause land movements and in some cases actual earthquakes. Indeed when the first test drill was sunk in the UK near Blackpool, they experienced one of the strongest earth tremors recorded in the area in decades.\nThe main process involves drilling large bore holes, often sideways underneath properties not owned by the drilling companies (as right that has now been granted to them by the government) and pumping a cocktail of water and up to 90 different chemicals, many of them highly toxic, into the ground under immense pressure. This cracks the rock and releases trapped gas. The water is then recycled back into the normal water system where it’s treated and used again. That is apart from the water that leaks into local water courses and along with some of chemicals and the gas.\nIf you want to see how this process affects local people watch the film Gasland and Gasland 2, clips of which are available on YouTube.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZe1AeH0Qz8\nAnother main method is something called underground coal gasification, which involved drilling into coal seams and then setting them alight. The controlled burn then generates coal gas which is extracted. This process is often hard to control and becomes every bit as horrific as it sounds. This is the type of extraction that we could see being used in areas like Bloxham which sits on large coal deposits.\nA national pressure group has also been set up called ‘Frack Off’. They recently released a short video that explains what we may see in our area if fracking is allowed to go ahead.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYniYtJEeeI\ngovernment’s presumption against fracking in designated areas, such as national parks, goes to show that the Coalition recognises that hydraulic fracking will harm the environment and presents significant risks.\nThe Green Party calls on the government to offer all communities the same protection from dirty and dangerous fracking and shift energy policy focus instead towards clean, renewable energy sources and energy conservation.\nThe latest bidding process for licenses to extract shale gas from large parts of the UK is under way. The government is also proposing to pay large amounts of money to local councils that support fracking, regardless of local residents wishes.\nAbout half the UK is open to exploration, but tightened rules cover areas of outstanding beauty and large areas of Cherwell. The Green Party is the only mainstream political party fighting to stop fracking being pushed through by a government which consistently puts corporate profit over people.\nCaroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, said:\n“While the Government has signalled an intention to ensure some protective measures, we can have little confidence in promises of a robust regulatory framework.\n“We know fracking can cause water contamination and shortages, as well as air and soil pollution. And this is an industry that’s made a catalogue of errors already. But legitimate concerns over its very real environmental and health risks are falling on deaf ears.\n“By seeking to lock us ever-more firmly into fossil fuel dependence the Government is turning a blind eye to reason. It’s crystal clear that we need to be shifting to clean, renewable energy sources.\n“We need a rapid shift to a zero carbon economy and that is not going to happen by pouring resources into establishing an entirely new fossil fuel industry.”\nAs your MP I would fight tooth and nail to prevent our wonderful communities and countryside from being torn apart by this ‘bottom of the barrel’ technology. The Green Party is the only major party standing up against these proposals and we need support of local communities to help us stop these wells from being set up before it’s too late. Once the process is begun we may all live to regret the fact that we didn’t stand up to be counted when we had the chance.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2023_02_20_why-im-concerned-about-occs-agreement-to-enter-into-negotiations-with-oufc/content_125.html": "I am still trying to remain open-minded about Oxford United Football Club’s proposals to build an 18000 seater stadium on green belt land that forms part of the Kidlington Gap at Stratfield Brake. But as the County and District Councillor for the area that Stratfield Brake sits within, I think the County Cabinet’s agreement to enter into negotiations with OUFC was premature, given that there were still so many unanswered questions a year on from the initial approaches from the club to the council.\nOf course we all want to help the club find a new home, but if we’re talking about using public assets to do that, we need transparency about what they’ve done to help themselves. For example, we still don’t have evidence that they’ve have explored all legal remedies to stay where they are.\nIt also appeared from the club’s own long-awaited report that they hadn’t even started looking at other alternative sites until October last year, after claiming at the beginning of 2022 that they had already explored all other options.\nAfter waiting 8 months for the full report on the club’s plans, it took a further 2 months for it to be circulated to stakeholders in a heavily edited form which doesn’t suggest that they are willing to be as transparent with local residents and stakeholders as they have claimed in the past.\nKidlington Parish Council (KPC) had been waiting for most of last year for the report from the club showing their detailed plans for the main Stratfield Brake site (which they are leaseholders of) so that they could be put out to local consultation. They could not take a decision on relinquishing their lease until they had consulted with the local residents who they represent.\nThe club has tried to blame the council for delays in making a decision on the initial very broad proposals but that was simply not the case. KPC wanted to make a decision on an informed basis and had been working towards a genuine local consultation, but to facilitate that they needed details of what the club were proposing. Thus any delay in the decision by the council are entirely the fault of the football club. Instead of engaging properly with KPC to help them hold a local consultation, they have gone around them by moving their plans to the site known as the Triangle which KPC has no direct control over.\nAs a result, I made a plea to the cabinet to include an amendment to the proposals to enter into negotiations with the club that would also commit the council to a full local consultation on the proposals before any final decision was made which should include the option to accept or reject the proposals. This wasn’t even responded to.\nAs the local county councillor I was disappointed that my call to the County Cabinet for a full local consultation didn’t seem to be endorsed. That would at least have given local residents some comfort that their views, both for and against the proposals, would be properly taken into account.\nThere was a reference to future engagement with stakeholders but it’s not clear who would undertake this and if it would be at a point where the local community would have a chance to say yes or no to the plans once they know what they are. With so many questions still left unanswered, we need a definite assurance that such a consultation will be part of the final decision process, otherwise we may find ourselves overtaken by circumstances as plans progress and positions become embedded”.\nWhilst I’m pleased to see the council took note of local concerns raised in last year’s country-wide engagement exercise, what is being proposed now is a rather different prospect and doesn’t completely deal with local views about having yet another significant development sited on some of Kidlington’s dwindling green spaces.\nIf we’re going to condone building on the green belt we need to ensure there is quantifiable local support for that. There are a range of views, as we saw at the meeting, and I want to make sure I’m fully representing the balance of local opinion, but until we ask the whole community we don’t know what that is.\nMy position as the local councillor for the area is that I have to support the majority view of the residents that will be affected by this development whatever they are. I don’t understand why there is a resistance from both the club and their fans as well as the council to asking local people directly what they think of this idea. There may be opposition, but there may equally be majority support for the plans. If so we can proceed on that basis knowing that the club would be welcomed by the village. Surely that would be a better outcome for all concerned, especially OUFC’s owners who I assume wouldn’t want to impose themselves on to a community that would resent them being there.\nI will continue to advocate for a full local consultation both internally within the council and with other local representatives, particularly the local MP Layla Moran.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_community_page_7/content_427.html": "As I said in the recent election debate on the BBC, in my opinion they shouldn’t.\nThere are many reasons it’s a bad idea, both from a business perspective and as part of local spending priorities.\nI’ve worked in retail nearly all my life. I built and ran a national chain of jewellery stores across the country and traded in several shopping centres, including some of the most prestigious in the country such as Bluewater in Kent and the new Bullring Centre in Birmingham. I write a regular column for Retail week Magazine and comment regularly in the national press on retail issues as well as offering consultancy services. One of my main focusses is independent retail and commercial property. So I know a little bit about what I’m talking about.\nCherwell District Council (CDC) leader Barry Wood claims that buying the Castle Quay Shopping Centre in Banbury is a good deal for the people of Cherwell. This decision was also backed by the Labour group on the council and their leader Sean Woodcock has assured me there’s a good business case for doing it. Unfortunately neither of them have been able to show it to me so far.\nTheir belief is that buying a commercial property like a shopping centre is a good idea as property will always rise in value. This may be the case for domestic property and some kinds of commercial premises, but not always with retail space.\nA Good Investment?\nThe argument for buying the scheme seems to be that if they hadn’t, the centre would have shut down. It has many long term empty units and is generally struggling to compete in an ever crowded marketplace. The council’s decision a few years ago to allow a new shopping park to open on the outskirts of Banbury haven’t helped its plight.\nIt’s extremely unlikely though that it would have closed down. Much more likely that it would have been offloaded by its pension investment owners to another investment company with more experience of running a shopping centre than some local councillors.\nMoreover, if the argument is that the centre was about to collapse, that doesn’t exactly make it an attractive investment for public money does it?\nThere have been some shopping centre failures in the past, but they are few and far between. But when they do go, they tend to go completely. That means an almost total loss for anyone unlucky enough to be the owner at the time. There will be some residual value in the land, but that’s unlikely to reflect the full price paid for the whole development.\nThere have been a growing number of retail failures in recent years with 650 collapses so far this year alone, and we’re not even half way through yet! Some of them very high profile and heavily leveraged operations. Others are busy negotiating partial closures and rent reductions with their landlords. Others are moving more into the online arena and abandoning physical retail space almost altogether.\nNone of this bodes well for an under-let, under-invested and down at heel shopping centre in a struggling town in North Oxfordshire.\nSo essentially CDC are gambling with public money against the odds. And it doesn’t end there.\nOther Costs\nAccording to Barry Wood the scheme is turning a profit at the moment, but as I’ve said previously, I’ve not seen evidence of that. I have seen a large number of long term voids in the centre, and with the potential for these to increase in number I fear the profitability may be marginal or likely to decline.\nThere will also be ongoing running costs for the centre and presumably additional investment to do whatever it is with the place that they feel will revitalise it. Again details on that are sketchy, but I think there’s some talk about dividing the larger units into smaller ones to attract independent retailers. Whilst I support that idea to some extent there are a lot of things to consider about that course of action.\nFirstly the cost of doing the work, which may include major re-modelling of the units due to, amongst other things, fire regulations. I’ve seen at least one shopping centre management come unstuck with similar plans due to rules on access to fire exit routes.\nHelping Smaller Retailers?\nSecondly smaller independents usually don’t have a huge budget for shopfitting, so there will be additional cost in partially fitting out the units, including new shopfronts etc to attract smaller operators and to ensure that their stores fit in with a modern shopping centre scheme.\nBusiness Rates\nThirdly there’s the loss of business rates on the empty units that are there now, and will most likely be there for a while. Considering the current climate in retail there’s also a good chance that voids could increase. At the moment the landlords will be paying rates on those premises even though they’re empty and a good deal of that money goes to CDC. With the council now being the landlords, they’re going to be paying the rates to themselves, effectively wiping out that income.\nDevaluation of the Asset\nFinally there’s the issue of valuation. Shopping developments are broadly valued on their rental potential. This is why landlords will leave units empty rather than let them out at a reduced rent. If the council’s plan is to lower the rent for smaller or other retailers, that will have a knock on effect on the value of those units and then on others when rent reviews come around. Other tenants now paying a higher rent will also push for a reduction when their leases come up for renewal or rent reviews are due or maybe even before.\nThe net effect of this would be to push down rents, not only in the centre but across the town, reducing loan to asset values across the board. In broad terms I’d welcome that. I’ve long argued that retail property values are hugely inflated. But in terms of the Council’s investment exposure in Castle Quay it’s a potentially dangerous situation, not only leading to a potential devaluation of the asset, but also any loans secured on it being partially called in.\nThere may be some balancing in terms of appreciation on the total asset value, but in the current climate and in a falling retail market, there a very good chance that the overall value of the scheme will fall relative to the amount the council has sunk into it, both as an initial investment and any further day to day expenditure.\nAll of this appears to have passed Cherwell Councillors and the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives by. They obviously have a very patchy understanding of how retail property works and the implications and pitfalls they are letting us all as council tax payers in for.\nMoreover there’s the question of if so much money should be focussed in the north of the district while ignoring other areas. Mr Wood commented in the Radio debate on Wednesday that he recognised that there were empty units in Pioneer Square in Bicester and that it was difficult to get them filled. Yet this doesn’t seem to have concerned him over the purchase of Castle Quay. Indeed, having set the precedent in Banbury I asked him during the debate if the council intended to buy Pioneer Square as well. He didn’t reply.\nOther Options\nA more sensible and prudent approach to the problems in both areas would be to work with the landlords rather than bailing them out with public money. Leave them with the risk whilst introducing local initiatives that help smaller retailers get a foothold and would also support the centre.\nThese could include rates reductions, which Barry Wood dismissed out of hand when I challenged him on it during the election debate. Neither he nor Sean Woodcock appeared to know that it has been within the gift of local councils to reduce rates on specific properties at their discretion for several years now.\nIf they wanted to provide smaller, more affordable space for independent retailers, they could lease units from the centres on a medium to long term basis, probably negotiating favourable terms with the landlords as a council will have a very good covenant. These could then be divided up (if required) and then sublet on flexible terms on reduced rents to retailers, although this would have to be agreed beforehand with the landlord for the same reasons discussed above concerning rental levels and valuations.\nThis would achieve the same aim of revitalising schemes both in Banbury and Bicester and would not involve the council in risking large amounts of public money. It would also mean that the bulk of the £60m they are now tying up in one area could be spread across the district.\nThis is the kind of strategic thinking we need, rather that the amateurish speculation of a council who seems to want to play at being shopkeepers with our money. This is why we need a more diverse representation on the council and councillors like me who will challenge these misguided moves before millions of pounds of desperately needed council funds are put at risk.",

We all face global annihilation unless we radically address the problems of global warming – largely created by man made increases in CO2 emissions. In short, the use of fossil fuels and the production of carbon dioxide threaten our very existence.\nAs of December 2020, renewable sources generated 40.2% of the electricity produced in the UK;[2] around 6% of total UK energy usage. That’s an improvement on previous years but it’s not enough. Germany produces so much renewable energy that it exports electricity to France.\nWe need to invest in renewable resources and more efficient energy use, better insulation and conservation measures and a huge increase in recycling. Such investment will generate hundreds of thousands of jobs and secure employment throughout the UK and is good for peace and world security by helping us to rely less on foreign oil and other counties natural resources.\nThere is much debate about the extraction of shale gas (Fracturing or “Fracking”) rocks under ground, with coal and methane gasses escaping into the atmosphere. Those in favour say a larger domestic source of gas will lessen our reliance on foreign suppliers and offer a cheaper alternative energy.\nThe Green Party is opposed as gas will not be publicly owned – its price and supply determined by commodity speculators. The US national gas price decline is not applicable to a small country like the UK and estimates indicate that there are only about 20 years of shale gas supplies available. This amount does not warrant the enormous environmental damage caused by extraction and the threat of earthquakes as experienced in Lancashire and methane gas escaping through our taps as is happening in the USA. The thirst for water for gas extraction could also lead to water shortages and certainly price rises.\nIn North Oxfordshire we have a very high Radon Gas area. Radon is a bigger potential cause of lung cancer than tobacco. Do we trust drillers such as Cuadrilla to handle Radon and other toxic substances safely, given that the government has given them consent “to mark their own homework” in this respect?\n“Fracking is a diversion from having a proper energy and green jobs policy which promotes continuing improvements in energy efficiency and investment in domestic renewables”\nWind turbines too have been controversial. Personally I, like many others, think they are beautiful. Far more so than electricity pylons covering the countryside, though these are acceptable now, long after their introduction. Unfortunately the Conservative government banned on-shore wind turbines some years ago and are only now (2023) beginning to consider lifting the moratorium. The UK has 40% of Europe’s wind and tidal differences whilst Spain has 40% of its sunshine. We need a European wide co-operative energy policy to ensure security of supply and to mitigate the effects of energy commodity speculation. The UK’s departure from the EU will make this more difficult..\nWe need to introduce stronger planning policies to support on shore wind, tidal, wave, solar and geothermal energy schemes and help local planning authorities to make more consistent decisions and to give micro-renewables “permitted development” status.\nMoreover we need to roll back the Tory government’s policies of side-lining and undermining re-usable energy and green initiatives in favour of massive global fossil fuel corporations who drive carbon emissions purely for profit at the expense of a clean environment for generations to come. The Conservatives continue to give gave £billions in public subsidies to fossil fuel companies whilst cancelling many green initiatives which David Cameron famously referred to as ‘all that green crap’. Meanwhile they claim there’s not enough money in the coffers for the NHS.\nBotley West Solar Farm\nAs you might imagine this proposals has caused something of a split in Green circles as we naturally support renewables and solar is one of the cleanest and quickest to bring on stream. But I am in the opposition camp to this proposal for numerous reasons. The principal ones being that it’s going to use up valuable farmland that should be used for producing food. Useable farmland is going to become even more important as climate change makes some areas less fertile and we shouldn’t be tying that land up by armour plating it.\nMuch of the land proposed is also Green Belt and as a long term campaigner to protect our dwindling green spaces the idea of covering 3500 acres of it with glass and steel just doesn’t sit well with me. I don’t buy the idea that the spaces around the panels could be used for biodiversity, even though I accept that there could be some element of that. As for sheep grazing, that just perpetuates a form of agriculture that we shouldn’t be promoting as Greens anyway, in my opinion.\nWhilst I may support utility solar projects up to around 100 acres, BWSF is several orders of magnitude bigger than that and I can fully understand why people are appalled at the idea of the beautiful countryside around Oxfordshire being so blighted. As a frequent walker in that area I would much prefer to see green fields than solar panels and with so many of them being proposed they will be the dominant feature in a largely rural area.\nI also don’t want a project like this to become an exemplar for how much disruption and impact utility level solar can have on a community. It’s likely to be held up as the wrong way to do these things which could prevent future more appropriate facilities being approved in the future.\nSo on balance I oppose BWSF, even though that opposition carries very little weight given the way the government is approaching local consultation on the matter. I don’t see a change of administration in Westminster making any difference to that. In fact I think a Labour government would be more likely to push it through. It of course remains to be seen, but in the meantime I’m happy to add my voice along with other dissenters to see this project scrapped in favour of other more sensitive and appropriate forms of renewables such as on shore wind and wave power.\nNuclear power\nI’m on the fence about the Green Party’s policy of opposing nuclear power on principle, but the government’s plans for the development of the multi-billion pound Hinkley Point Nuclear power Station by the French and Chinese and paying twice the current market rate per megawatt hour of energy produced for the next 35 years is insane. However, nuclear power produced by plants using uranium is expensive and takes longer to produce than renewable energies. In addition to its known risks there is still no safe way of disposing of nuclear waste. But there may be a place for different forms of nuclear power in our energy mix.\nWith Hinkley Point, payment to the operators will be “fully indexed to the consumer price index”. Guaranteed income for corporations, risk assumed by the tax payer – a deal that looks as bad as any private finance initiative contract. Not only that the clunky third generation power station chosen for Hinkley C is already outdated, beside the promise of integral fast reactors and liquid fluoride thorium reactors.\nThe chief scientific adviser at the government’s Energy department suggested some years ago that if integral fast reactors were deployed, the UK’s stockpile of nuclear waste could be used to generate enough low carbon energy to meet all UK demand for 500 years. These reactors would keep recycling waste until hardly any remained: solving 3 huge problems – energy supply, nuclear waste and climate change – at once.\nMore recently the idea of small modular reactors has been mooted which would take up no more space than a medium sized warehouse and could provide energy for hundreds of thousands of homes. If this technology was combined with Thorium we could see a far more benign form of nuclear energy, one which is inherently much safer than current reactors and, importantly for me would not produce any weapons grade materials. In fact Thorium reactors can use nuclear waste as a fuel!\nThorium reactors use an element that is already extracted in large quantities as an unwanted by product of other mining industries. Hinkley Point, requiring uranium mining and still producing nuclear waste in 2063 is to commit 20th century technologies through most of the 21st century.",

As someone who’s been involved in the campaign to stop this ridiculous and unnecessary development I thought I’d add a few more comments by way of a video and also expand a bit on what the Green Party would do to protect our vital green spaces.\nThis is something I’ve been involved with for a number of years now, right across the county, trying to combat the epidemic of projects that want to destroy these areas in the name of profit and greed.\nYes we need housing, but it has to be the right housing in the right places. Building on green belt will never be viable in terms of affordable housing as the land is so expensive. Developers build in a set level of profitability, usually a staggering 20%! That means that removing protection from green spaces like these just increases the number of high value, unaffordable houses being built.\nNot only that, concreting over green spaces means they can no longer lock up the carbon that we need to reduce in our environment, and they also increase the likelihood of flooding as they can no longer absorb the increased level of rain we’re getting as the climate patterns shift.\nThe Conservatives back all these projects because they are there to help wealthy landowners, developers and investors make a fat profit out of our rural heritage.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2015_05_05_cherwell-or-fracking-well/content_156.html": "Hydraulic Fracturing or ‘Fracking’ is a new unconventional and controversial technique for extracting gas and in some case oil from the deep bedrock. It has serious environmental and quality of life issues for all of us, but particularly for those of us who live in areas that sit on top of these deposits. Unfortunately for us, that included large areas of North Oxford and Cherwell.\nFracking has been sold as being the answer to the UK’s energy problems, but in areas like the USA where it’s been widely used, this has not been proved to be the case. What has been shown is that it contaminates water supplies and creates huge amounts of noise and disruption for local residents. It’s also been implicated as the cause land movements and in some cases actual earthquakes. Indeed when the first test drill was sunk in the UK near Blackpool, they experienced one of the strongest earth tremors recorded in the area in decades.\nThe main process involves drilling large bore holes, often sideways underneath properties not owned by the drilling companies (as right that has now been granted to them by the government) and pumping a cocktail of water and up to 90 different chemicals, many of them highly toxic, into the ground under immense pressure. This cracks the rock and releases trapped gas. The water is then recycled back into the normal water system where it’s treated and used again. That is apart from the water that leaks into local water courses and along with some of chemicals and the gas.\nIf you want to see how this process affects local people watch the film Gasland and Gasland 2, clips of which are available on YouTube.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZe1AeH0Qz8\nAnother main method is something called underground coal gasification, which involved drilling into coal seams and then setting them alight. The controlled burn then generates coal gas which is extracted. This process is often hard to control and becomes every bit as horrific as it sounds. This is the type of extraction that we could see being used in areas like Bloxham which sits on large coal deposits.\nA national pressure group has also been set up called ‘Frack Off’. They recently released a short video that explains what we may see in our area if fracking is allowed to go ahead.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYniYtJEeeI\ngovernment’s presumption against fracking in designated areas, such as national parks, goes to show that the Coalition recognises that hydraulic fracking will harm the environment and presents significant risks.\nThe Green Party calls on the government to offer all communities the same protection from dirty and dangerous fracking and shift energy policy focus instead towards clean, renewable energy sources and energy conservation.\nThe latest bidding process for licenses to extract shale gas from large parts of the UK is under way. The government is also proposing to pay large amounts of money to local councils that support fracking, regardless of local residents wishes.\nAbout half the UK is open to exploration, but tightened rules cover areas of outstanding beauty and large areas of Cherwell. The Green Party is the only mainstream political party fighting to stop fracking being pushed through by a government which consistently puts corporate profit over people.\nCaroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, said:\n“While the Government has signalled an intention to ensure some protective measures, we can have little confidence in promises of a robust regulatory framework.\n“We know fracking can cause water contamination and shortages, as well as air and soil pollution. And this is an industry that’s made a catalogue of errors already. But legitimate concerns over its very real environmental and health risks are falling on deaf ears.\n“By seeking to lock us ever-more firmly into fossil fuel dependence the Government is turning a blind eye to reason. It’s crystal clear that we need to be shifting to clean, renewable energy sources.\n“We need a rapid shift to a zero carbon economy and that is not going to happen by pouring resources into establishing an entirely new fossil fuel industry.”\nAs your MP I would fight tooth and nail to prevent our wonderful communities and countryside from being torn apart by this ‘bottom of the barrel’ technology. The Green Party is the only major party standing up against these proposals and we need support of local communities to help us stop these wells from being set up before it’s too late. Once the process is begun we may all live to regret the fact that we didn’t stand up to be counted when we had the chance.",

Greens come from all backgrounds and bring a wealth of experience to the job. Many run their own businesses or have done so in the past, so realise the pressures that are put on to small and medium sized enterprises. I co-founded and ran a large retail operation with branches all over the country, so I have a good insight into the problems now facing our post-Covid high streets.\nMany other councillors have come from academia or the various public sectors or just from the same background as the people they represent. I was born to a working family in East London and grew up in South East London/Kent where I attended a secondary modern school in the 70s.\nBut the one thing that has driven us all to take on the job of a councillor is a desire to make the world a better place for everyone and a willingness to fully represent and work for the people who have put their faith in us by giving us their vote.\nThe Green Party doesn’t operate a party whip. We always remember we are there to represent the people who voted for us, and we will always put people before party.\nAs a District Councillor, I’ve seen first hand how local government can work against the interests of our communities rather than for them.\nParty dogma is the main reason for this with councillors being fiercely whipped, especially by the Conservative leadership. This has resulted in some frankly bizarre outcomes with residents and council tax payers bearing the brunt.\nThe Green Party doesn’t operate a party whip. We always remember we are there to represent the people who voted for us, and we will always put people before party. Green councillors are free to vote how they see fit, which has resulted in far better outcomes for residents.\nFor example it only took one Green County Councillor, working across party lines, to secure 20MPH powers for local councils as part of the ’20 is plenty’ initiative. Of course other parties now claim credit for that great achievement, but we don’t mind, as long as our communities benefit.\nBut it’s on climate change that Greens really lead the way. While we’ve welcomed other parties into the climate awareness fold, they often still don’t get it. They don’t see environmentalism as literally a global issue, preferring to compartmentalise and focus only on their own operations.\nOf course that’s important, but in the midst of an emergency we have to tackle the problem at all levels, not just those that conveniently and comfortably coincide with other priorities such as exponential growth.\nFor all these reasons and many more, voting Green brings positive change for our communities and our planet. Change that’s needed now, before it’s too late.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_climate/content_299.html": "So ends my third and final candidacy for the Banbury constituency.\nIn a way I’ve come full circle in that my result this time was almost identical to my first one in 2015. I was only 79 votes short of that figure this time with a final result of 2607 votes, giving me 4.1% of the vote share.\nIn 2015, I received 4.6% with only a slightly higher number of votes, but the turnout was lower then. Sadly this left me about 500 votes short of keeping my deposit this time, which means the Green Party loses £500, but we did our best.\nOn a personal level I’m fairly happy with that result. It was more than double the last time I stood and represented a 2.2% increase in my vote share. That’s the best increase of all the Green Party candidates in Oxfordshire, so that’s nice to have. You have to look for the positives in these things!\nUnfortunately though, positives on a national level are thin on the ground. With a massive swing to the Tories representing such a shift in our national political landscape, I’m far more concerned about that than I am about my own result. This is something I’m still processing at the moment as I’m sure many others are. I have to say I’ve avoided news coverage of the election today as it is just too painful! Maybe sleep deprivation has played a big part in that as well!\nWhere we go from here is difficult to say. I think it’s fairly certain that Brexit will now happen, which I think we will mostly live to regret. The debate around the referendum has become so polarised now that I’m not sure anyone really knows how we got here. It’s become an argument about ‘honouring’ a vote that many people no longer really know the point of. From most of the coverage I’ve seen it’s become about who ‘won’ and who ‘lost’. It should never have been boiled down to such a simplistic argument. Especially as I think most of us will eventually be the losers from Brexit.\nThe “Get Brexit done” slogan is also an absurd reduction of the true impact of one of the most seismic shifts in our fortunes since the second world war. I still don’t think it’s something we should be treating so lightly. With so much new information available to us now compared to 2016, we should have had an opportunity to think again. Just ‘getting it over with’ really isn’t a logical motivation for carrying on with something that I think will be hugely damaging to this country and our economy. Especially as the poor and the disadvantaged will end up feeling the most pain, which makes it doubly frustrating when so many news reports seem to suggest it’s those very people who voted Tory in this election.\nThose of us on the remain side obviously haven’t made a strong enough case to those who seem so eager to jump into the abyss. Boris Johnson’s lies will, I believe, show themselves to be exactly that when we finally push the button on Brexit. Sadly it will be too late then to say I told you so to all those who think this will be a positive move.\nThe climate debate was for me equally as important as Brexit and bound up in the same argument. This also applies to the other burning issues in the UK at the moment, including the NHS and public services. I believe we will spend the next 10 years wasting parliamentary time dealing with the intricacies of extricating ourselves from the EU and negotiating disadvantageous deals with countries like the USA, when we should be dealing with the existential threat of climate change and the collapse of our health services.\nThe other issue exposed by the result is the desperate need for electoral reform. Westminster has still been carved up by the two main parties who need so few votes to get a seat in the big house. Whereas parties like the Greens with over 800,000 votes nationally only get on MP. That really doesn’t make sense and certainly explains why so many people think that voting is a pointless exercise. Moreover we need to have greater co-operation between parties to achieve electoral reform. I hope that the one positive that might come out of Labour’s terrible results might be that they will finally be open to talking to other parties about co-operating towards that end.\nBut I will do what I can to help deal with the worst damage that Brexit and climate change will inevitably do to our society both locally and globally, even though I fear that, with at least another 5 years of majority Conservative government ahead of us, that’s going to be a very difficult task.\nIt’s not one that I will shirk from though, and I will use my position as a local councillor to bring as much influence as I can to bear on what will no doubt be many more Tory excesses and attacks on the weakest in our society. With a Tory dominated District council in Cherwell it’s always an uphill struggle to ‘move the dial’ but that’s not a reason to give up and I won’t be doing that.\nFinally, an enormous thank you everyone who helped in my campaign and to everyone who contacted my directly, and through social media, to give me encouragement and support, and of course thank you for giving me your precious vote. I can assure you that I value it enormously and it was not wasted.\nFor reasons I’ve explained in another post, no vote you believe in is ever wasted, and in terms of the Green Party it will help us carry on campaigning and, most importantly now, hold the national and local government to account on the environment and climate change.\nThe fight continues!",

This gives us 4 members now having grown from the single member we had in 2019 (me).\nAs I reported last year we were poised to take control in 2023 as part of a 4 way alliance with the Lib Dems, Labour and the Independents. That whole project collapsed at the 11th hour when Labour pulled out of the deal because the didn’t want to work with the Greens. So we had to double our efforts this year to gain additional seats, along with the Lib Dems so that we could finish the job of removing the Conservatives from power across the whole of Oxfordshire. This was something both our parties had promised in 2023 but at that point without Labour’s support we couldn’t deliver on that pledge.\nHappily this year we can!\nAlong with our Lib Dem colleagues we had the numbers this year to take minority control of the council. Sadly we are still 3 seats short of an overall majority, but we felt we needed to deliver on our promises and so have formed an administration. The comprises of two groups – the Lib Dems, who now sit as a single group rather than as part of a group with the Greens and the Independents who have now formed their own separate group which I lead. We joined with the single independent who had previously ben part of the Progressive Oxfordshire Group – the alliance I was a founding member of in 2019.\nOur new group is called the Green and Independent Alliance, which neatly forms the acronym ‘GAIA’ which we thought was appropriate for a group of 4 Greens and one Independent, especially as the independent member is a Green in all but name.\nOur two groups have now signed a formal coalition agreement to run the council together with 2 Greens, Myself and To Beckett sitting on the executive in Green and Environment roles.\nThis is a great outcome for us and we hope for the people of Cherwell. We hope to make the district a better place to live and work for everyone as well as improving nature recovery and tackling climate change.\nOf course we have since been overtaken by events when on the very day we agreed our new administration Rishi Sunak called a General Election. I must admit that this rather caught us all on the hop just as we were all starting to get to grips with our new leadership roles on the council. This is even more tricky for me since I am the Green Party Parliamentary candidate for the new constituency of Bicester and Woodstock. There will be more on that in my next post.",

In my opinion, this has been slipped into the review under false pretences, given that this has nothing to do with housing need in Oxford. As a result there’s mounting local criticism of the university’s ambitions to commandeer at least 1000 of the houses intended to meet Oxford’s needs for its own use as part of a new campus at Begbroke and Yarnton.\nChair of the Cherwell Development Watch Alliance, Giles Lewis, spoke in favour of the motion at the packed meeting and read out emails between the council and the university, obtained under and FOI request, that suggested plans to allow the university to expand in the area were already being supported as long ago as 2016.\nThe Labour group on the council then introduced an amendment which blocked any re-consideration of housing need numbers, even though this might mean more houses that were needed would be built on green belt.\nI pointed out that just to offset the amount of carbon produced in building the unaffordable and unneeded houses in the first place would take 572,000 trees over 10 years, or 200 per house, rather than the 1 tree per building that Cllr Wood had suggested during his address on the climate change emergency motion.\nIt’s clear that neither Labour nor the Conservatives are prepared to take the difficult decisions that are needed to combat the climate emergency. Labour were far more concerned not to be seen to be challenging inflated housing need figures proposed by their colleagues on the city council, whist the Conservatives simply want to be facilitators for large wealthy landowners in the area including the university. The location of the housing clearly has more to do with the university’s ambitions than it does with genuine housing allocation priorities. Either way it ends up with unnecessary and unaffordable housing being built that locals will have no access to on the green spaces at the heart of their community. This is a stitch-up perpetrated on the people of south Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Gosford!\nLibdem Councillor and spokesperson for the Progressive Oxfordshire group, Katherine Tyson said “These plans will simply expand the city’s appalling air quality into our rural community. At one point Labour councillor and vice-chairperson of the council Hannah Banfield seemed to suggest that, as Banbury residents had accepted bad air quality as a result of housing development in their area, the people of south Cherwell should just do the same. The argument that one ward coming to peace with poisoning their residents and children doesn’t mean that another ward should also poison their constituents. That’s not good enough for Cherwell residents. It beggars belief that such a comment could be made from a Labour councillor just after we had voted in favour of a climate change emergency motion”\nThe motion to pause the local review pending the outcome of the examination of the city council local plan and to separately consult on the university’s plans in Begbroke and Yarnton was successfully amended by the Labour group to an undertaking to review the allocation sites for the 4400 houses. It was carried by Labour with Conservatives abstaining on the vote. The subsequent motion was defeated by 16 votes to 23.",

The Banbury Phone Box Library is one such brilliant piece of local engagement which is now garnering international attention as BT looks towards chopping it off at the knees.\nThe red phone box is almost as iconic as the red bus as a national symbol of Britain around the world. You’d think if you were company who owns and operates these highly visible pieces of cultural capital you’d be only too pleased to see them being involved in well supported local campaigns that add value to a service that is perhaps not as loved as it once was.\nIn that context it seems daft to me that BT are hell bent on annoying small and large communities across the country by removing public call boxes where they’re valued for numerous reasons other than a quick natter on the phone. It’s even more self-defeating that they’re erasing some of the very symbols of Britishness that have helped them build a world class multi-national company.\nIt has to be said that the Town Council in Banbury share some of the potential blame if the box is removed, as they are refusing to adopt it (something that BT now allow for the princely sum of £1), if BT go ahead with plans to decommission the phone service in the box. Previously they struck a deal with BT to adopt the box and save the library and a local steel fabrication firm offered to fix permanent shelves in the box to house the books to assuage BT’s prior objections to the library service on health and safety grounds, as they believed the current shelving arrangements could be dangerous.\nBT now claims that it is uneconomic for them to continue to run the service anyway, even though I understand thousands of calls were made from it last year.\nThe under-story seems to be that BT want out of the call box game at any cost, and most of that cost will be borne by local communities using the boxes for a number of vital social services or simply to make a call when other options are not available to them.\nBanbury Town Council now say that they’re not prepared to adopt the box if it is then decommissioned by BT. Whilst I support taking a stance against the loss of the phone service, I think it would be a sad loss to the community of the box were to be removed as a result of the Town Council refusing to adopt the box itself.\nMoreover, If BT are claiming the box is loss making, I think it would be useful for them to provide the figures backing that up. It would at least give us an idea of the likely shortfall which could perhaps be covered in some other way.\nIt’s also crazy that BT are missing this as an opportunity for some very positive PR. It has to be said that they’re not universally loved as a company, so something like this, that is fairly minimal in cost terms, would seem to be a great way for them to connect with the community.\nGoing forward perhaps the government needs to bring in a legal requirement on telecoms companies like this to provide a certain number of public call points in an area. Just because most of us carry mobiles now, doesn’t mean that sometimes they might not fail at a vital time, or have been forgotten when they’re most needed. I know BT used to be obliged to seek permission from local or parish councils in order to remove a box, but it sounds like that requirement has now been watered down. In very rural areas mobile phone reception is also notoriously patchy. In those areas call boxes provide a vital service for emergency calls.\nIn terms of usage statistics, it might also be interesting to track the number of calls made against the minimum price of a call in a phone box, which I understand is now 60p. Perhaps BT need to be reminded of the law of supply and demand.\nIf you’re on Twitter you can follow and support the campaign to save the Banbury Phone Box Library by following the hashtag #SaveOurPhoneboxLibrary",

I was tweeted tonight by a parent led group campaigning against cuts in school funding in Oxfordshire asking if I realised just how bad the situation was.\nAt this point I’m the only candidate to reply. But maybe the others will catch up later.\nBut playing catch-up seems to be the way for our education system, with a report coming out only a few days ago on the dire state of repair of some school buildings. As someone who went to school in the 70s, I find it shocking that we should have let our education system become so under-valued in such a short period of time.\nMy best friend from back in those days keeps in touch with me, and he has just retired as a senior head teacher. He now does consultancy work for schools that are suffering under the same system he battled through. Essentially the privatisation of our education system that does little to help students and puts a lot of money into the pockets of Academy shareholders.\nThe future of our children should not be for sale to the highest bidder, and we should not be seeing a situation where parents have to raise hundreds of pounds to subsidise books or pay for bus passes so their children can actually get to school. Again, I remember free bus passes for school-children, but that seems like a long-lost utopia now.\nWe need an education system that provides opportunity to everyone. Schools that cater for all levels of ability and aspiration. The chance for everyone who wants to move on to further and higher education to do so without saddling themselves with a lifetime of debt.\nWe also need to value our teachers and educators, paying them a decent salary and ensuring they have fair conditions to work in. Like doctors and nurses they are taken far too much for granted and expected to cope with appalling stress simply because they are dedicated people.\nThe Conservative’s promises of extra funding don’t come close to addressing the problems that have been stored up over the past 10 years. Their so-called ‘extra’ spending amounts to nothing more than setting the clock back to the point before they imposed austerity on us all.\nSee the Green Party Manifesto by clicking here. Go to page 55 to see our comprehensive range of proposals and policies about revitalising our education system and bringing schools into the 21sct century, whilst unlocking the potential of students and teachers at all levels.\nA proper education for the next generation should be a priority for all of us.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_page_17/content_453.html": "As I said in the recent election debate on the BBC, in my opinion they shouldn’t.\nThere are many reasons it’s a bad idea, both from a business perspective and as part of local spending priorities.\nI’ve worked in retail nearly all my life. I built and ran a national chain of jewellery stores across the country and traded in several shopping centres, including some of the most prestigious in the country such as Bluewater in Kent and the new Bullring Centre in Birmingham. I write a regular column for Retail week Magazine and comment regularly in the national press on retail issues as well as offering consultancy services. One of my main focusses is independent retail and commercial property. So I know a little bit about what I’m talking about.\nCherwell District Council (CDC) leader Barry Wood claims that buying the Castle Quay Shopping Centre in Banbury is a good deal for the people of Cherwell. This decision was also backed by the Labour group on the council and their leader Sean Woodcock has assured me there’s a good business case for doing it. Unfortunately neither of them have been able to show it to me so far.\nTheir belief is that buying a commercial property like a shopping centre is a good idea as property will always rise in value. This may be the case for domestic property and some kinds of commercial premises, but not always with retail space.\nA Good Investment?\nThe argument for buying the scheme seems to be that if they hadn’t, the centre would have shut down. It has many long term empty units and is generally struggling to compete in an ever crowded marketplace. The council’s decision a few years ago to allow a new shopping park to open on the outskirts of Banbury haven’t helped its plight.\nIt’s extremely unlikely though that it would have closed down. Much more likely that it would have been offloaded by its pension investment owners to another investment company with more experience of running a shopping centre than some local councillors.\nMoreover, if the argument is that the centre was about to collapse, that doesn’t exactly make it an attractive investment for public money does it?\nThere have been some shopping centre failures in the past, but they are few and far between. But when they do go, they tend to go completely. That means an almost total loss for anyone unlucky enough to be the owner at the time. There will be some residual value in the land, but that’s unlikely to reflect the full price paid for the whole development.\nThere have been a growing number of retail failures in recent years with 650 collapses so far this year alone, and we’re not even half way through yet! Some of them very high profile and heavily leveraged operations. Others are busy negotiating partial closures and rent reductions with their landlords. Others are moving more into the online arena and abandoning physical retail space almost altogether.\nNone of this bodes well for an under-let, under-invested and down at heel shopping centre in a struggling town in North Oxfordshire.\nSo essentially CDC are gambling with public money against the odds. And it doesn’t end there.\nOther Costs\nAccording to Barry Wood the scheme is turning a profit at the moment, but as I’ve said previously, I’ve not seen evidence of that. I have seen a large number of long term voids in the centre, and with the potential for these to increase in number I fear the profitability may be marginal or likely to decline.\nThere will also be ongoing running costs for the centre and presumably additional investment to do whatever it is with the place that they feel will revitalise it. Again details on that are sketchy, but I think there’s some talk about dividing the larger units into smaller ones to attract independent retailers. Whilst I support that idea to some extent there are a lot of things to consider about that course of action.\nFirstly the cost of doing the work, which may include major re-modelling of the units due to, amongst other things, fire regulations. I’ve seen at least one shopping centre management come unstuck with similar plans due to rules on access to fire exit routes.\nHelping Smaller Retailers?\nSecondly smaller independents usually don’t have a huge budget for shopfitting, so there will be additional cost in partially fitting out the units, including new shopfronts etc to attract smaller operators and to ensure that their stores fit in with a modern shopping centre scheme.\nBusiness Rates\nThirdly there’s the loss of business rates on the empty units that are there now, and will most likely be there for a while. Considering the current climate in retail there’s also a good chance that voids could increase. At the moment the landlords will be paying rates on those premises even though they’re empty and a good deal of that money goes to CDC. With the council now being the landlords, they’re going to be paying the rates to themselves, effectively wiping out that income.\nDevaluation of the Asset\nFinally there’s the issue of valuation. Shopping developments are broadly valued on their rental potential. This is why landlords will leave units empty rather than let them out at a reduced rent. If the council’s plan is to lower the rent for smaller or other retailers, that will have a knock on effect on the value of those units and then on others when rent reviews come around. Other tenants now paying a higher rent will also push for a reduction when their leases come up for renewal or rent reviews are due or maybe even before.\nThe net effect of this would be to push down rents, not only in the centre but across the town, reducing loan to asset values across the board. In broad terms I’d welcome that. I’ve long argued that retail property values are hugely inflated. But in terms of the Council’s investment exposure in Castle Quay it’s a potentially dangerous situation, not only leading to a potential devaluation of the asset, but also any loans secured on it being partially called in.\nThere may be some balancing in terms of appreciation on the total asset value, but in the current climate and in a falling retail market, there a very good chance that the overall value of the scheme will fall relative to the amount the council has sunk into it, both as an initial investment and any further day to day expenditure.\nAll of this appears to have passed Cherwell Councillors and the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives by. They obviously have a very patchy understanding of how retail property works and the implications and pitfalls they are letting us all as council tax payers in for.\nMoreover there’s the question of if so much money should be focussed in the north of the district while ignoring other areas. Mr Wood commented in the Radio debate on Wednesday that he recognised that there were empty units in Pioneer Square in Bicester and that it was difficult to get them filled. Yet this doesn’t seem to have concerned him over the purchase of Castle Quay. Indeed, having set the precedent in Banbury I asked him during the debate if the council intended to buy Pioneer Square as well. He didn’t reply.\nOther Options\nA more sensible and prudent approach to the problems in both areas would be to work with the landlords rather than bailing them out with public money. Leave them with the risk whilst introducing local initiatives that help smaller retailers get a foothold and would also support the centre.\nThese could include rates reductions, which Barry Wood dismissed out of hand when I challenged him on it during the election debate. Neither he nor Sean Woodcock appeared to know that it has been within the gift of local councils to reduce rates on specific properties at their discretion for several years now.\nIf they wanted to provide smaller, more affordable space for independent retailers, they could lease units from the centres on a medium to long term basis, probably negotiating favourable terms with the landlords as a council will have a very good covenant. These could then be divided up (if required) and then sublet on flexible terms on reduced rents to retailers, although this would have to be agreed beforehand with the landlord for the same reasons discussed above concerning rental levels and valuations.\nThis would achieve the same aim of revitalising schemes both in Banbury and Bicester and would not involve the council in risking large amounts of public money. It would also mean that the bulk of the £60m they are now tying up in one area could be spread across the district.\nThis is the kind of strategic thinking we need, rather that the amateurish speculation of a council who seems to want to play at being shopkeepers with our money. This is why we need a more diverse representation on the council and councillors like me who will challenge these misguided moves before millions of pounds of desperately needed council funds are put at risk.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2019_12_17_democracy-devalued-by-cherwell-district-council/content_182.html": "Last night we saw the Cherwell Conservatives in their true colours as they waved through some fundamental changes to the council constitution despite the report they were based on being full of errors and inconsistencies.\nThe report itself had not been through the scrutiny and overview process, neither had any councillor, to my knowledge, been previously consulted or invited to comment on it. It was simply dropped on to the December meeting agenda, possibly in the hope that it wouldn’t receive too much attention from councillors in the run up to Christmas.\nThis throws up a fundamental question on how the council is run. Should significant issues of democratic accountability be amended by officers with virtually no input from elected councillors? I’d argue not. Councillors are bound by the constitution and the rules governing meetings. They should at the very least be consulted appropriately on any changes that will affect these rules.\nThe proposals included restrictions on motions and amendments length, shorter notice periods for questions to council, and the ability to reject motions on the basis of heavily subjective assessments of them being ‘vexatious’ or ‘frivolous’. They are arguably designed to limit both the scope of debates and, by implication, the ability of councillors to fully represent their ward residents.\nArguments were put forward that these rules already exist on some local councils, yet in Oxfordshire only one out of 5 district councils have similar rules (although with far greater latitude on things like motion length) and only the County Council has anything approaching this level of restriction. It’s arguable that the County, with usually a far greater number of motions and procedural matters need a more streamlined system, but at district level this has never been an issue in Oxfordshire.\nOne has to ask what the motivations would be for the council agreeing to these proposals so readily. It’s probable that after the recent change in the makeup of the council, with more non-conservative councillors being elected every year, the Tories are simply frightened of public debate.\nThis would appear to be predicated on the Conservatives bare-faced admission that they had already decided how they would vote on issues before any motion was proposed or debate initiated. Barry Wood’s repeated claim in meetings that all his councillors will essentially do as they are told completely undermines the basis of individual councillor representation.\nEven though the report containing these proposals was significantly flawed, it was voted through by the Conservatives on the apparent understanding that it could be re-written or corrected later, without the need for further ratification. That in itself would seem to be a ludicrous approach. How can any such changes be approved in advance of knowing what they are?\nAs we have seen on numerous occasions, this is the reality of democracy in Cherwell, where the dominant follow-my-leader Tories vote en-bloc on everything, regardless of the interests of the people they represent.\nThis was evident during the debate at the same meeting over a second successive motion brought to the council calling on it to oppose the Oxford to Cambridge Expressway. This included claims from Councillor Dan Sames – the council’s lead on green issues – that he is “passionate” about the environment, whilst simultaneously keeping an ‘open mind’ about a huge motorway being built, possibly through environmentally sensitive areas like Otmoor, which he represents. Councillors like this voted for a climate change emergency motion and then somehow reconcile that with building a huge motorway. This shows just how little commitment they really have towards care for the environment.\nCherwell District Council is now the only council in Oxfordshire not to have voted to oppose the Expressway. As a result they are tacitly supporting it subject only to the final route. Any route will be environmentally damaging, but this doesn’t seem to be an issue for the ‘Concreting Conservatives’.\nThe fact that council leader, Barry Wood, is also the Chair of the Arc Leaders Group appointed by the MHCLG to promote the expressway plans, as well as being an OxLEP and Oxfordshire Growth Board member – both organisations with a vested interest in promoting the expressway – seems not to be regarded as significant bias by the council. I’d surmise that that is the only reason why we’re still having this debate in Cherwell – the instruction from Cllr Wood to his poodle councillors appears to be that they should not undermine his position on all these bodies by opposing one of their keynote projects.\nI do not have an open mind about the Expressway and will continue to oppose it at every opportunity in favour of much more sustainable and environmentally sensitive projects such as East/West Rail. We do not need any more massive major road building projects in this part of the county (or arguably anywhere else) regardless of which route they may take. The Green Party’s commitment to tackling climate change cannot be overruled by the imperatives of growth for its own sake that lie at the heart of Conservative proposals in Oxfordshire.\nYou can view a webcast of the entire meeting on the Cherwell District Council website here http://modgov.cherwell.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=114&MId=3240&Ver=4",

I spoke in the debate criticising a further lack of response to the climate emergency and highlighting the pressures that the council’s reliance on commercial investments have placed on its finances, in particular its ownership of the Castle Quay shopping centre in Banbury.\nI’ve long been a critic of the decision to risk council tax payers money by investing in a shopping centre that was already starting to show signs of distress. It was a quite ludicrous decision at the worst possible time, just as the retail economy was collapsing. As a retail analyst myself I’m acutely aware of the pitfalls of investment into retail space with provincial shopping centres being some of the most challenging developments to achieve a viable return on now.\nI and fellow members of the council have been excluded from the so-called cross party advisory group on the management of Castle Quay which is entirely composed of Conservative and Labour councillors. Labour supported the purchase of Castle Quay in 2018 for £63m with a further commitment of a similar sum to build a canal-side extension, including a cinema and a hotel.\nLooking at the figures in this budget we can see that around a third of the financial pressures are a result of losses attributed to Castle Quay. Even if the council’s own optimistic predictions are correct, by the end of next year Castle Quay will have returned a loss of around £1.9m since the council took full ownership.\nOf course all this is now being blamed on the pandemic, but that’s only part of the story. This was always a reckless investment, and that recklessness has now translated into service cuts for everyone in Cherwell.\nWhilst I agree that councils should be the drivers of town centre regeneration, that needs to be evenly distributed. Ownership of Castle Quay is likely to produce only dubious benefit to the people of Banbury with a potentially massive financial burden that will be felt by every Cherwell resident for years to come”\nAs a retail analyst and adviser, I made my misgivings about the public purchase of a struggling shopping centre clear to the council, even before I was a councillor, but was ignored.\nI knew there were already signs of problems on the horizon with several of the major tenants of the scheme, not least Debenhams which recently collapsed into administration. That failure is yet another problem that is about to hit the beleaguered development when lockdown is lifted.\nThe much vaunted opening of Lock 29 indoor market in the space previously occupied by one of the other failed anchor tenants – BHS – is yet to prove itself viable. While I support the inclusion and encouragement of many of the smaller enterprises that were invited to trade there, it’s notable that the major occupier, Happerley, pulled out last year after only 3 months.\nI have asked several questions of the council about Happerley’s involvement with the scheme and the due diligence that went into licencing that company to trade there in the first place. Those questions remain unanswered.\nI originally supported the extension of the scheme with more canal-side restaurant and leisure uses, but as time has gone on it’s becoming apparent that even that is a dubious move. One of the major parts of the development is a cinema, and we are already seeing a market shift there with several of the large cinema operators closing venues and some going into administration\nLittle focus on climate change\nWe’ve just had a taste of the pressures a global catastrophe can place on our finances. In the coming years, ecological threats will make the pandemic look like a mini-break. Yet 2 years into our declaration of a climate emergency, we have another budget with very little progress towards tackling that threat.\nThe last budget had a tiny percentage of spending dedicated to the ecological emergency and even that wasn’t fully honoured. This one has just 5 short paragraphs – less than a page of vague aspirations with no real commitment to anything. Added to that we’ve increased charges for making homes more energy efficient, the very thing we should be encouraging!\nLast year’s budget was billed as Cherwell’s “greenest budget ever” yet many of the pledges made then remain unfulfilled, not least the promise to convert lighting at Bodicote House to LED which would have saved the council money as well as helping to save the environment.\nOn top of that we also have increased building regulations charges for thermal upgrades to buildings and for the installation of solar panels. These are the very things we should be encouraging residents and businesses to do. Many councils don’t charge at all for Solar Panel installations\nThe huge financial commitment that is now being poured into the new waterside development in Banbury could have gone towards renewable energy schemes that would have both helped with climate change and returned a regular profit for the council instead of the losses we see from Castle Quay now.\nUnfortunately due to the short-sightedness and fiscal incompetence of the council’s political leadership we are now committed to a path that I think will just bring further financial misery to the residents we should be working to protect.”",

Areas near the kerbside are heavily damaged making for an uncomfortable and dangerous ride for cyclists and other road users. Yet repeated requests to the council and reports on Fix My Street have gone unheeded.\nNow, in the wake of increased cycling as a result of the pandemic, cycle lane symbols have appeared on this road on top of the cracks and potholes, with no attempt to repair the long-standing degradation of the road surface.\nOther roads, such as the Bicester Road, have had painted cycle lanes on the main carriageway for some time, but there are also poorly maintained and often blocked by parked cars meaning cyclists have to face oncoming traffic to navigate them. This is particularly bad given that this road has a local school and is also subject to an air quality management area.\nBut I was gobsmacked when I saw the cycling symbol on Yarnton Road. This is a road that I regularly cycle down and it’s a real bone shaker. It’s no exaggeration to say that you have to hang on for dear life as you bounce along the road near the curbs, dodging potholes and cracks. It’s especially dangerous at night.\nThe road forms part of a national cycling route, but you’d never know it to look at the surface of the carriageway. It’s certainly not for the faint-hearted! I couldn’t believe they just slapped a cycle symbol on the road without any attention to its terrible condition.\nIt takes more than a pot of paint and a stencil to create a cycle path. The road surface has to be fit for riders if they are to be encouraged to use it. Even motorists complain about the state of this road. How does the council expect cyclists to cope as they rattle across these severely damaged and uneven surfaces? This is just pure tokenism!\nIt just goes to show how little the council knows or cares about the plight of cyclists in the county. If they really want to encourage more sustainable transport, especially post COVID, they have to take cyclists needs into proper account when carrying out road maintenance rather than literally just painting over the cracks!\nWe need more Green councillors on the county council to take these sorts of issue seriously and deliver real improvements for cyclists, pedestrians and other road users, rather than these half-hearted token gestures from a council devoid of real leadership and direction.",

Problems with roads, cycle paths, flooding and other county wide issues are raised with me frequently and I do my best to deal with them. But the stumbling block is often that the county council tends to be less receptive to me as a District Councillor leaving me with very little in the way of influence.\nIf I sat on the county council I think so many of the things I work and campaign for, not least tackling important issues like climate change, would be far easier to get done.\nTo that end I hope you’ll feel able to support me in some way, either by donating to and sharing my fundraiser or hopefully helping out in other practical ways like delivering leaflets or letters, filling envelopes, or maybe helping with door knocking or telephone canvassing.

Moreover a spectacular win for my electoral partner, Libdem candidate Alaric Rose in Kidlington West who nearly doubled the Libdem vote and completely wiped the floor with the Conservatives!\nIt would have been great to have won my seat as well, but with such a short campaign it was hard to get the message out to enough people. Ultimately it was a total validation for both of us of our decision to work together for the common good.\nSlightly galling that the Carmen Griffiths kept her seat as I understand she was hardly seen on the campaign trail. She wasn’t at the count, didn’t make an appearance on polling day (to my knowledge) and instead sat back and let local Tory cult figures like Maurice Billington do all the campaigning for her.\nJudging by her attendance record at council meetings this seems to be a pattern of behaviour for a pretty lacklustre councillor. I think many of the voters in the ward didn’t actually know which blue candidate they were voting for and seemed oblivious to the fact that there were more dedicated candidates on offer who would much more effectively represent them in Cherwell.\nPerhaps when Carmen and her remaining Tory colleagues fail to turn up at other key planning meetings and the green belt is concreted over, bringing with it traffic chaos, pollution, and the collapse of local infrastructure, all those that trooped into the polling station to dutifully put a cross in the Tory box, regardless of the candidate, will realise their mistake. It might be a bit late then though.\nOne other stark reality from the results is that if Labour had endorsed me (as we suggested) and we had endorsed them in one of the North Oxfordshire wards (as we offered) we would both have easily won our seats, meaning a new Labour, Green and Libdem seat on the council and 3 Tory losses instead of 1. Just imagine what sort of message that would have sent out! Especially on important and urgent local issues like the building on green belt in the area.\nLabour really need to wake up to the reality of fractured left politics in this country and work with other parties like the Greens and the Libdems. We need to stop living in the past and embrace the future. There’s more that unites us than divides us and if we’re going to stop yet another Conservative government in 2022 we must start building alliances. If anyone from Labour wants to talk, I’m all ears.\nIn the meantime I intend to go on being a thorn in the side of Cherwell’s complacent Tory leadership and will be working closely with Alaric as part of our pre-election co-operative agreement. I may not be able to vote on council matters, but I can certainly speak up in the council chamber and outside in the media. I’ll be fighting hard on local green belt and conservation issues and keeping a wary eye on the attendance record of my Tory opponent. The Greens will be fighting the elections in the ward once again next year and I hope that will again be in partnership with the Liberal Democrats.\nFinally a big thank you to everyone who voted for me and to the dedicated people who helped us pull together such a professional campaign in such a short time. the Greens made historic gains across the country yesterday and I think it’s a credit to all our members that we can do this stuff on such a small budgets and with small teams. Just think what we could do in government!\nStay tuned and follow this website/blog for updates on what I and the Green Party will be doing between now and the next elections.\nVoteGreen#2019",

Increased development on surrounding areas has also exacerbated the problem, and with huge amounts of additional houses planned for the green fields around villages in South Cherwell, there are now serious concerns amongst residents about what the future holds.\nRun-off from areas like Spring Hill are sources of flood water which now regularly hit the villages of Yarnton and Begbroke below. These are areas due to be built on as part of Cherwell’s recently adopted partial plan review (site PR9).\nI’m regularly being contacted, both as a district and parish councillor, by residents watching flood water approaching their homes, yet there are very few options open to me to help them.\nThese incidents often occur out of office hours. As a district councillor I have an emergency response number to call, but the last time I used that when I was trying to help residents facing flooding in Garden City Kidlington, I was told I should call the police and ask them to deal with it. When I did so, the police operator seemed bemused that I was given that advice\nOther agencies such as the fire service are quite understandably reluctant to tie up vital fire and rescue resources unless property has actually been inundated. This is quite a distressing situation to have to explain to residents who are trying to prevent that from happening in the first place.\nThames water are usually difficult to reach and often do very little when they are finally contacted. I hear regular complaints about blocked drains and flood channels as well as pumping stations either not working at all or being unable to cope with the level of flood water. Again, the only emergency contact I have for Thames Water is the same number that any member of the public can call\nThe county council will deliver sandbags, but usually by that point the situation has reached crisis level and residents have to hope that they will hold back water which may already be at their thresholds\nThis just isn’t good enough. We need to stop treating these incidents as one-off events and put together a credible, structured, multi-agency response that can swing into action when councillors and other local agencies need it. It’s very frustrating as a local councillor not being able to help when residents expect you to have levers to pull that just aren’t available to us\nAdvancing climate change means that we will now have to live with the escalating threat of flooding on a year-round basis. Increased development on what are now relatively permeable green spaces, such as Spring Hill in Begbroke will only make matters worse.\nThis is not a criticism of individual agencies. There just seems to be no credible protocol about what can and should be done and who should be doing it. We need a central control point that can co-ordinate a response to all levels of flooding whenever and wherever it happens, as well as a local flood task force to ensure flood defences are mapped and regularly maintained.\nAdvancing climate change means that we will now have to live with the escalating threat of flooding on a year-round basis. Increased development on what are now relatively permeable green spaces, such as Spring Hill in Begbroke will only make matters worse.\nSite promoters promise that they will put flood defences in place, but with the frequency and intensity of flooding increasing every year, most defences will eventually be overwhelmed. Developers are also usually more concerned with ensuring new properties don’t flood, with less consideration for the impact of new developments on existing residents. Areas that may in the past have been flood free will soon find themselves in the firing line with little hope of holding those responsible to account. I made a video about this last year that you can see below",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_author_ianmiddleton99_page_26/content_496.html": "The government announced plans today for a new ‘Garden City’ to be built on ex-MOD land on the outskirts of Bicester in Oxfordshire. The proposals will be backed by £100M of government funds and will include ‘sustainable’ transport infrastructure, green spaces and new local amenities.\nOn the face of it this could be a boost for Bicester, but I suspect the devil will be in the details.\nMuch of the announcement seems to cover projects that are already in planning or underway. The new railway station for example. There’s also some confusion over if this is to be a re-imagining of the much vaunted eco-village or an entirely new project.\nIt is encouraging however to see that the project is to be built on a brown field site.\nConfusingly, the definition of a ‘garden city’ is being left to the developer’s imaginations with the government saying it doesn’t want to “impose any definition of what garden cities are”. This could likely mean we’ll end up with another estate full of either ‘luxury homes’ that ordinary people can’t afford, or shoe-boxes crammed together to generate maximum profit. That would probably mean any aspirations to provide gardens and green space will go right out the window.\nIf Nick Clegg really wants this to be development different from all the other clone estates thrown up around the country, I’m afraid he’s going to have to nail his colours to some sort of mast and properly define his intentions. But that might prove more difficult than a glib press release full of utopian imagery.\nThere would also need to be a clear vision that the people living in this new ‘city’ will be contributing to the local economy and society as well as working in it. With a train station on the doorstep, such a development could easily become a dormitory for London commuters or a sink hole of buy-to-let properties.\nAffordability will be the key. If these homes are intended for people on middle and lower incomes, then I’d support the idea. But I suspect such values won’t be compatible with what Nick Clegg sees as a ‘garden city’.\nPersonally I’d like to see more genuine thinking along these lines, subject to the above caveats. But ultimately this may all just come to nothing.\nSo many of these big legacy projects either evaporate into the ether once they’ve generated enough headlines, or turn into something very different once the realities of cost, demand and political will begin to bite.\nThere’s a veritable tsunami of these grandiose announcements coming out from government at the moment though. Like the spurious claims for new spending on road infrastructures announced earlier this week, many of them are just old or existing projects being re-launched as new spend to give the impression of a go-ahead administration full of exciting possibilities for the future.\nAnyone would think there was an election round the corner!",

In a move that is frankly baffling from a socialist led council, planners have dashed all hopes that the accommodation element designed into the revamped centre would be for social housing or affordable homes. Whilst Green councillors opposed this move, others apparently felt that poorer people won’t be able to keep the new apartments up to the standards they expect to be demanded.\nSo no comfortable inner-city pied-à-terres for the ordinary folk of Oxford then. Which is a shame considering Oxford City Council provided virtually nothing for that sector last year, despite claims that this was a priority policy.\nJobs are not the only thing to consider\nJudging by the analyses carried out over the past 10 years it looks highly likely that the new Westgate extension in Oxford will have a significant impact on other retail destinations both in the immediate vicinity and county wide.\nThe council has claimed that 3400 jobs will be created by the opening of the new centre, which seems like a rather optimistic number to me. Even if one accepts that figure, previous analyses have suggested that the number of jobs created will be far outweighed by those that will be destroyed elsewhere in the city and the surrounding areas.\nIt’s very easy to focus just on the number of jobs created, but when similar centres have opened there have been many casualties in other areas. This doesn’t even take into account the damage that’s likely to be done to trade during the building and infrastructure works and the impact of additional competition for small retailers that attracting large multi-nationals into the area will provide.\nIn an era where many retail chains are looking to reduce their portfolios, the time for this centre has been and gone. There’s already plenty of retail space in Oxford city centre, some of it lying vacant even now. Until the council addresses the systemic issues with people visiting the city, such as parking, local transport and city centre management, a revamped shopping centre isn’t going to add that much prosperity to a town encircled by much better alternatives.\nThe new shopping centre will likely have some novelty value for a few months, but once the realities of trading in Oxford begin to bite, I doubt it’ll be anything more than another usual-suspect clone-town brand zoo.\nYears of disruption\nAccording to a recent article in the Oxford Mail, a scrutinising committee of city centre councillors are due to meet to discuss ways of keeping businesses alive during the hugely disruptive infrastructure works needed for the new extension.\nSo Oxford City Council wait until AFTER the works have begun to think about how to mitigate the problems that will inevitably be caused by the works?\nAnother great example of the forethought and careful planning we’ve come to expect from our wonderful city council!\nI was at a meeting with both the city and county council leaders over a year ago where I highlighted the potential damage that will be done by the infrastructure works required for the Westgate extension. Having already experienced the same in Bristol a few years before, it was clear to me and many others that the likely upheaval required for the Westgate works were going to do more damage than they were likely to be worth in the current climate.\nSeems like it all fell on deaf ears. As usual.\nEmpty shops\nMy business in Cornmarket Street closed it’s doors for the last time after 20 years last year. Despite numerous pronouncements in the press that the city council was eager to support local businesses, we got zip-all support, even after asking on several occasions. Indeed, at one point their planning department were very close to scuppering the only deal we could achieve to sell the store. Had they not done a last minute U-turn there would have been one more empty and un-lettable shop in the city centre.\nCouncillors are also now apparently worried about the growing number of empty shops in the city, despite previous claims that there were queues of businesses eager to take space. Perhaps news has started to filter out that retailing in Oxford is not what it once was?\nIn that context one has to wonder who is going to populate the new cathedral of consumption when it is finally completed, and for those that do take up residence, what kind of trading environment will they find? With 40% of retail leases across the country coming up for renewal at the end of this year, it really does beg the question about how much space will be required when the Westgate centre is completed in 2017. Moreover what will the rest of the city look like once all the remaining viable stores have de-camped into the waiting warmth of a lovely new mall?\nWith council plans to push up the cost of parking YET AGAIN and the negative impact of roadworks, and the city centre looking like a building site, it’s likely most consumers will continue to go elsewhere to shop, surrounded as we are by much more attractive and easily reached locations around the city and the county. And once again, experience tells me that once people find better alternatives, they’re unlikely to return, other than for a quick nose around the new development.\nA committee composed of councillors with absolutely no idea how businesses in Oxford operate, setting out to ‘examine’ how to deal with these issues now, is tantamount to closing the door after the horse has bolted, lived out it’s natural life and ended up in a dog food tin. This project as has been in the planning stages for so many years it’s truly staggering that the implications are only being discussed now.\nOxford is of course known as the city of ‘dreaming spires’. It seems that in terms of strategic planning, many of our councillors have also been asleep on the job.",

It can prevent conflict by helping us see other points of view, whilst informing us of possibilities beyond our immediate experience. It’s also a route out of poverty and a way of realising our dreams. It’s one of the most powerful means of geopolitical change which is why one of the first things oppressive and restrictive governments seek to manipulate and restrict.\nBut it’s not all about formal education. The Green Party would shift the compulsory school age to 7, with earlier years focusing on play, social cohesion and confidence-building. We’d also encourage an increase in outdoor education and physical activity to establish an early relationship with the local environment.\nWe’d abolish SATS and league tables, leaving teachers free to teach instead of filling forms, whilst taking action to reduce their workload and introducing professional pay levels. We’d also ensure the right for every disabled child to a mainstream education\nFor other people, we’d reverse the 20-year dismantling of the lifelong learning sector and provide real support for apprenticeships.\nThe Green Party would ensure education as a human right, giving everyone the opportunity to better themselves and increase their understanding of the world and each other.\nWe’d bring back free higher education and abolish student loans, returning to a grant system and cancelling all outstanding student debt. Education should be available to everyone on the basis of ability, not their bank balances or their willingness to take a crippling debt of up to £45,000 into later life.\nAcademies and Grammar Schools\nForcing schools to opt out of local government leadership to become Free Schools and Academies under the guise of independence and local control is wrong in my opinion. It is a move to wrest control by central government and schools have been bribed by the extra funding initially available to them if they opt out of democratic County Council control. The Conservatives are now insisting than any new school should be runs under one of these schemes.\nThere have been many examples of schools who previously were awarded Excellent or Good OFSTED reports who have recently been “failed” in order to force them to accept Academy status. Academies and Free Schools can appoint untrained, unqualified staff to teach our children! Some Free Schools have come under severe criticism for failing their pupils yet are still allowed to operate as they are not required to follow the National Curriculum.\nSchools now impose entrance criteria with some achieving excellent results but with others less fortunate in their catchment areas becoming “sink” schools. The better off move house in order to be in their chosen school’s catchment area. In one area parents have been reduced to accepting 13th choice of school because of demand.\nTeachers are prevented from inspiring and motivating their students by the straight jacket of a centrally imposed curriculum and precious time is spent on prescribed learning that can be tested. There is no longer time in a hectic school day for individual, personal development through the arts or sport. Empty talk of the Olympic inheritance is replaced by schools selling off sports fields to raise cash for much needed teaching blocks.\nSecondary schools now have to provide between 8 and 12 subjects for GCSE with an increasing dependence on exam results rather than course work – deterring large numbers of teenagers from achieving. We would free teachers from a focus on targets, league tables and form filling, and allow them to teach. We’d give parents a greater role in monitoring and maintaining standards in schools.\nThe Green Party offers radical alternatives including:\nEnsuring schools promote social and emotional well being, equality, inclusion and responsibility. They need more freedom to frame the curriculum around the needs and interests of the young people in their school.\nThere should be an emphasis on pupil-centred learning catering for different learning styles, interests and needs. Inspections should recognise the “added value” achieved by schools bearing in mind the catchment area of each school.\nWe also need to invest much more in special schools and support for children and young people with special education and disability needs. This is a sector that is under increasing pressure and something that the government has consistently under-funded for over a decade.",

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_oxford-to-cambridge-expressway/content_351.html": "Last night we saw the Cherwell Conservatives in their true colours as they waved through some fundamental changes to the council constitution despite the report they were based on being full of errors and inconsistencies.\nThe report itself had not been through the scrutiny and overview process, neither had any councillor, to my knowledge, been previously consulted or invited to comment on it. It was simply dropped on to the December meeting agenda, possibly in the hope that it wouldn’t receive too much attention from councillors in the run up to Christmas.\nThis throws up a fundamental question on how the council is run. Should significant issues of democratic accountability be amended by officers with virtually no input from elected councillors? I’d argue not. Councillors are bound by the constitution and the rules governing meetings. They should at the very least be consulted appropriately on any changes that will affect these rules.\nThe proposals included restrictions on motions and amendments length, shorter notice periods for questions to council, and the ability to reject motions on the basis of heavily subjective assessments of them being ‘vexatious’ or ‘frivolous’. They are arguably designed to limit both the scope of debates and, by implication, the ability of councillors to fully represent their ward residents.\nArguments were put forward that these rules already exist on some local councils, yet in Oxfordshire only one out of 5 district councils have similar rules (although with far greater latitude on things like motion length) and only the County Council has anything approaching this level of restriction. It’s arguable that the County, with usually a far greater number of motions and procedural matters need a more streamlined system, but at district level this has never been an issue in Oxfordshire.\nOne has to ask what the motivations would be for the council agreeing to these proposals so readily. It’s probable that after the recent change in the makeup of the council, with more non-conservative councillors being elected every year, the Tories are simply frightened of public debate.\nThis would appear to be predicated on the Conservatives bare-faced admission that they had already decided how they would vote on issues before any motion was proposed or debate initiated. Barry Wood’s repeated claim in meetings that all his councillors will essentially do as they are told completely undermines the basis of individual councillor representation.\nEven though the report containing these proposals was significantly flawed, it was voted through by the Conservatives on the apparent understanding that it could be re-written or corrected later, without the need for further ratification. That in itself would seem to be a ludicrous approach. How can any such changes be approved in advance of knowing what they are?\nAs we have seen on numerous occasions, this is the reality of democracy in Cherwell, where the dominant follow-my-leader Tories vote en-bloc on everything, regardless of the interests of the people they represent.\nThis was evident during the debate at the same meeting over a second successive motion brought to the council calling on it to oppose the Oxford to Cambridge Expressway. This included claims from Councillor Dan Sames – the council’s lead on green issues – that he is “passionate” about the environment, whilst simultaneously keeping an ‘open mind’ about a huge motorway being built, possibly through environmentally sensitive areas like Otmoor, which he represents. Councillors like this voted for a climate change emergency motion and then somehow reconcile that with building a huge motorway. This shows just how little commitment they really have towards care for the environment.\nCherwell District Council is now the only council in Oxfordshire not to have voted to oppose the Expressway. As a result they are tacitly supporting it subject only to the final route. Any route will be environmentally damaging, but this doesn’t seem to be an issue for the ‘Concreting Conservatives’.\nThe fact that council leader, Barry Wood, is also the Chair of the Arc Leaders Group appointed by the MHCLG to promote the expressway plans, as well as being an OxLEP and Oxfordshire Growth Board member – both organisations with a vested interest in promoting the expressway – seems not to be regarded as significant bias by the council. I’d surmise that that is the only reason why we’re still having this debate in Cherwell – the instruction from Cllr Wood to his poodle councillors appears to be that they should not undermine his position on all these bodies by opposing one of their keynote projects.\nI do not have an open mind about the Expressway and will continue to oppose it at every opportunity in favour of much more sustainable and environmentally sensitive projects such as East/West Rail. We do not need any more massive major road building projects in this part of the county (or arguably anywhere else) regardless of which route they may take. The Green Party’s commitment to tackling climate change cannot be overruled by the imperatives of growth for its own sake that lie at the heart of Conservative proposals in Oxfordshire.\nYou can view a webcast of the entire meeting on the Cherwell District Council website here http://modgov.cherwell.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=114&MId=3240&Ver=4",

I believe it is one of the most serious threats we have ever faced. Yet it’s a threat that many people haven’t even heard of.\nThis proposed agreement has implications on a national and global level, particularly the Investor-State Dispute Settlements clause which allows corporations and private companies to take legal action against governments if they pass laws that are regarded as restricting their ability to make profits.\nThis strikes directly at the heart of our democracy, whilst effectively handing over sovereignty of all signature countries to the whim Amongst other things, TTIP also has the potential to force this country to accept genetically modified organisms into our food supply.\nIt loosens banking regulations (as the more stringent US banking laws could be subject to the lighter laws in the UK) and it could threaten jobs as more companies will be able to base their operations in the USA where labour law, employee protection and health and safety are less strictly applied.\nTTIP could also have very serious implication for the NHS in terms of the penetration of public services by private companies. Indeed TTIP could very easily be used to prevent any future moves to stop the creeping privatisation of the NHS as this may be regarded as restrictive by corporations wanting a piece of the action.\nWhilst the Conservatives, Labour and the Libdems have all stated an ambition to ensure the NHS is excluded from TTIP, we have seen no guarantees on this from any quarter.\nMoreover the extremely secretive nature of the treaty and the way it is being negotiated on our behalf behind firmly closed doors, leads me to distrust the ability or even the will of some of our representatives to ensure such exclusions will be applied.\nThe fact that both Labour and the Conservatives have self evidently displayed an ambition to see large parts of the health service and social care hived off to private companies, amid a culture of marketisation and capitulation to private providers, leaves me with very little confidence in a positive outcome for our cherished NHS.\nThe Green Party is firmly committed to blocking TTIP where we are able to, and our MEPs have already expressed deep concern about what appears to be an unavoidable quiescence to this agreement.\nYou might like to read this article by Molly Scott Cato MEP, who was recently allowed into the inner sanctum where the treaty is being drafted. Although as you will see she was sworn to secrecy and was subject to extreme measures to prevent her from recording and/or reporting what she saw. This alone sounds some very loud alarm bells with me! http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/04/secrets-ttip-corporations-not-citizens-transatlantic-trade-deal\nIf I were to be elected, I would most fervently resist the inclusion of the UK within the TTIP treaty and I would also demand that the secret negotiations now being held in Brussels should be openly and frankly reported.\nHonest and open government is our only guarantee that those trusted to look after our interests do so diligently and effectively.",

So busy I’ve not been able to properly thank everyone who supported and voted for me on May 6th.\nAs the count was delayed until the 9th May and went on until late in the evening, it wasn’t until the 10th that it began to sink in that I’d actually won, beating a long standing councillor who had become something of a fixture in the area.\nIt was a fantastic election for the Greens across the country with us winning nearly 100 new seats. Some of the notable highlights were :\n- Greens in first place across Bristol West and Sheffield Central constituencies\n- Gained representation on 18 councils, bringing the total tally of councils with Green representation to 141.\n- Gained 99 seats – now 445 councillors across England and Wales\n- Won 24 seats on Bristol City Council – now joint largest party with Labour.\nAnd of course in Oxford we won many new seats with an extra seat gained on the city council and 2 new seats on the county council, myself included! After we retained our original seat on the county with Dr Pete Sudbury, that gives us 3 seats along with Robin Bennett who is also the deputy leader of South Oxfordshire District Council. I’m looking forward to working with both of them.\nThe out-turn of all this in Oxfordshire is that the Conservatives have been pushed into being the opposition party on the county for the first time ever! While they are currently showing as having 22 seats on the council, they actually only have 21 as an extra seat was gained due to a mistake made at the count that will be corrected in the high court in the next few weeks. There’s also some exciting news in the pipeline about what that means for the next administration of the council that I can’t reveal at the moment. But look out on Monday evening for an important announcement!\nMeanwhile, the Green surge continues, and thanks to you I am part of that! So a huge thank you goes out to everyone who worked on my campaign, donated money to it and of course to the people who voted for me. I will do my best to not let you down. I will be starting work on the council in the next week or so, after all the dust has settled and I am properly plugged into the systems there. The first part of that is the council AGM which will be held on Tuesday in Banbury.\nIn the meantime, please feel free to contact me with any issues you want me to look at. My first priority is going to be looking at what we can do about the state of the roads in this area. I’ve already been contacted by several people who have raised this with me and I know from my own experience that this is a very important local issue. I hope I can hit the ground running and make some visible progress on this soon.\nIt’s going to be an exciting few years with huge changes afoot in Oxfordshire and you’re all part of that, so thank you all again!",

This gives us 4 members now having grown from the single member we had in 2019 (me).\nAs I reported last year we were poised to take control in 2023 as part of a 4 way alliance with the Lib Dems, Labour and the Independents. That whole project collapsed at the 11th hour when Labour pulled out of the deal because the didn’t want to work with the Greens. So we had to double our efforts this year to gain additional seats, along with the Lib Dems so that we could finish the job of removing the Conservatives from power across the whole of Oxfordshire. This was something both our parties had promised in 2023 but at that point without Labour’s support we couldn’t deliver on that pledge.\nHappily this year we can!\nAlong with our Lib Dem colleagues we had the numbers this year to take minority control of the council. Sadly we are still 3 seats short of an overall majority, but we felt we needed to deliver on our promises and so have formed an administration. The comprises of two groups – the Lib Dems, who now sit as a single group rather than as part of a group with the Greens and the Independents who have now formed their own separate group which I lead. We joined with the single independent who had previously ben part of the Progressive Oxfordshire Group – the alliance I was a founding member of in 2019.\nOur new group is called the Green and Independent Alliance, which neatly forms the acronym ‘GAIA’ which we thought was appropriate for a group of 4 Greens and one Independent, especially as the independent member is a Green in all but name.\nOur two groups have now signed a formal coalition agreement to run the council together with 2 Greens, Myself and To Beckett sitting on the executive in Green and Environment roles.\nThis is a great outcome for us and we hope for the people of Cherwell. We hope to make the district a better place to live and work for everyone as well as improving nature recovery and tackling climate change.\nOf course we have since been overtaken by events when on the very day we agreed our new administration Rishi Sunak called a General Election. I must admit that this rather caught us all on the hop just as we were all starting to get to grips with our new leadership roles on the council. This is even more tricky for me since I am the Green Party Parliamentary candidate for the new constituency of Bicester and Woodstock. There will be more on that in my next post.",

As a result he bears some of the blame for a Conservative majority borne on the backs of the large number of older voters who didn’t see the 2 minutes it took to mark an X on a ballot sheet as so desperately uncool.\nThis time we have Ricky Gervais leaping into the fray with this tweet :\n“OK. I’m not telling you how to vote, but this is a fact. The only vote that will keep Theresa May out is a vote for @jeremycorbyn. Cheers”\nWhilst not quite so devoid of acumen as Brand’s ill-conceived advice, Ricky’s more well meaning call to action could be equally as dangerous.\nEssentially he IS telling his fans how to vote, and his less politically astute followers may not realise the pitfalls of such a binary choice.\nThe reality is that in many constituencies a vote for Corybn will not keep Theresa May out. The real fact is that it may do the exact opposite.\nSadly, even after repeated calls from other parties to enter into an ad-hoc alliance, Labour has resolutely refused to stand aside in any constituency. Whereas, for example, The Green Party has done so now in well over 30 seats.\nIn many of those seats the Libdems have a much better chance of winning than Labour. In some others the Greens or the SNP could have it in the bag. Voting Labour could then very well help the Tories by splitting the opposition.\nBy selling the idea that a vote for Labour is a vote against the Tories, no matter where you are, The Labour party and many of its supporters could be handing another victory to the Conservatives.\nI’m not usually an advocate of tactical voting, but needs must when the devil drives, and I see the devil behind the eyes of the Conservatives. But tactical voting has to be just that. It doesn’t simply mean voting Labour as the only alternative.\nUnder our broken electoral system the only place votes really count are in marginal constituencies. Until we get electoral reform and a system of proportional representation, that won’t change. And let’s not forget that Labour supports our first past the post system just as much as the Tories do.\nBut even in a safe seat your vote can make a real difference. In 2015 UKIP gave the Conservatives a real run for their money. Even though they only won one seat in Parliament they put the Tories on notice that they were there, close behind, snapping at their heels.\nThe result was the delivery of a referendum on EU membership and the subsequent lurch to the right that followed in the footsteps of Theresa May. The Conservative manifesto, such as it is, represents one of the most extreme right outlooks for the UK for many generations. It makes Margaret Thatcher’s vision look like a tie-dyed, rose tinted call to action for the love generation. It has even been compared to the BNP’s warped ideological ramblings from the 1980s, and not without cause.\nThis can be directly traced to UKIP’s influence and its validation of ideals that make a hard line, right wing agenda more palatable to people who wouldn’t dream of dancing to the tune of more overtly hard right parties.\nLikewise the nomination and election of Jeremy Corbyn can, to a large extent, be laid at the feet of the Green Party. There can’t be many Greens who haven’t noticed just how many of our clothes have recently been stolen by Corbyn’s party. And many of us are happy to be standing here in our underwear, glad that so many of our policies have been subsumed into the Labour manifesto. The sincerest form of flattery and all that.\nBut it has to be remembered that the rise of Green membership and our increasing success in both national and local elections is arguably a major driving force behind Labour’s newly rediscovered left wing credentials and a strong Green vote will help them keep that focus.\nVoting for parties that may not be mainstream, and may not have a chance of winning is not a wasted vote. Even less so in constituencies where the seat is safer than a Roy Chubby Brown joke at a UKIP convention. A vote for the party that more closely reflects your views has a demonstrable impact on those do so to a lesser extent.\nIn the case of Labour, voting for them in constituencies they can’t win may not just prevent other parties from doing so, it also reinforces the status quo of a de facto two party state and removes Labour’s incentive to join an alliance or support electoral reform if, as is still being predicted, they don’t have a majority on June 9th.\nEven if Labour were to win, there’s a very good chance that Corbyn could be unseated early on in his reign, by a parliamentary party who still don’t wholeheartedly support him. Without the threat of other left wing alternatives looking over their shoulders, it’s entirely possible that Labour will drift back to the same Tory-lite, neoliberalism that they were so conformable with last time.\nSo unless you have a realistic opportunity of a tactical vote in your constituency, just voting for the ‘other guy’ (or gal) won’t send any sort of message other than a validation of entrenched positions.\nIf you’re not going to see real change this time around. If your vote is only going to be lost in a sea of others who voted forlornly for the a close second, or the next best thing, use it to support those who will affect real change in the longer term by holding toes to the fire in the meantime.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2023_04_12_this-could-be-the-year-that-everything-finally-changes/content_312.html": "In 2019 I became the first ever Green District Councillor in Cherwell. Apart from that being a little bit of personal history for me, it was also the start of a change that would unfold across the county over the next 3 years with Greens playing their part in the removal of Conservative control in every major local authority in Oxfordshire.\nIn 2019, Green colleagues in South Oxfordshire, along with the Lib Dems virtually swept the board, taking control of the District Council from a huge Conservative majority with 5 Greens being elected. Another Green was elected on the Vale of the White Horse Council. Then in 2021 Greens, Lib Dems and Labour took control of the County Council in a three way alliance with the Lib Dems and Greens forming a separate group which I now have the honour of being deputy leader of. Finally in 2022 we took joint control of West Oxfordshire District Council with the Lib Dems and Labour as well as gaining a further seat on CDC.\nThat left CDC as the only remaining Conservative controlled council albeit with a drastically reduced majority of only 2. The group that I and 2 Lib Dems formed in 2019 grew to 12 members by the end of the last municipal year meaning that from 2022 we became the official opposition with me as deputy leader of that group.\nThat’s a huge turnaround in only a few short years which feels even shorter given that for one of those years the elections were cancelled.\nNow with Cherwell as the last remaining bastion of Conservatism in the county, the prize is for the taking. As long as all the currently sitting opposition councillors hang on to their seats (which includes me) in the forthcoming elections, we have a good chance of taking control of CDC. We really need 4 extra seats to be flipped from the Conservatives and the way the country feels about them at the moment that is a very real possibility.\nGreens hope to take one more seat in Bicester where we’ve come a close second 2 years in a row, with the Lib Dems hopefully gaining 2 more. In Banbury there’s a chance that Labour will also gain an extra seat which would then give a 4 way Green/Lib Dem/Labour/Independent alliance a majority. Even if we only gain 2-3 seats the council will fall into no overall control which gives us much more leverage to ensure that areas like Kidlington get a better slice of the district pie.\nFor far too long Kidlington has been the poor relation in Cherwell with the majority of funding and investment going to Banbury – where the council has so far sunk £130M into a failing shopping centre – and Bicester – where they plan to spend £4.25M on upgrading a car park in an events space that no one really seems to want.\nThis year we have an opportunity to see real change and real progress in areas like Kidlington as well as the rest of the district. I hope voters will take that opportunity and we can finally have a clean sweep across the county leaving progressive, forward thinking authorities looking out for the best interests of current residents and those yet to come.\nThis year, more than ever in Cherwell, every vote will count. I won in 2019 with only 72 votes to spare, although last year Fiona Mawson won with a far more convincing majority of over 250. I hope I can emulate here but we can’t afford to be complacent. Everyone needs to use their vote to support the candidate most likely to win against the Toru candidate. In Kidlington East that’s me and I hope I can count on local support.\nLet’s not lose this chance to break the Tory stranglehold and make a better future for everyone. Make sure your vote really counts on May 4th!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_general-election_page_5/content_382.html": "This is a piece I wrote for Huffington Post earlier this week. I think it speaks for itself, although after it was published I thought I should have pointed out that none of the the politicians I refer to in the studio on election night were Greens. As usual we weren’t invited to the BBC party. There were however representatives from Labour, Conservative, Libdems and UKIP. Given that the Greens had a reasonably good showing in the last General Election in Rochester (for a ‘marginal’ party) I’d have thought we’d have been worth a mention at least. But apparently not.\nAnyway I hope this serves as a good first post on my website/blog and you can see the original article here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/westminster-politics_b_6199214.html?utm_hp_ref=tw.\nFeel free to comment below or on the original article on the Huffington Post site.\nI recently became a parliamentary candidate for the Green Party. After years of railing against politicians, the irony, and perhaps the hypocrisy, of becoming one myself has not been lost on me.\nThen again, there were the constant jibes about my complaining a lot but doing nothing positive to make a change. So when my local party group asked me to stand, I said I’d give it a go. And here I am. Feel free to point the finger.\nOne of the first things I’ve noticed about the underbelly of politics is just how strategic it is. Target wards, target seats, candidates standing in constituencies where they don’t live for the sake of political expediency. None of this is new, or unusual, or even un-democratic, but it does take some getting used to.\nBut watching the BBC election special on the Rochester and Strood by-election, you could be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the political world has turned into some kind of wife swapping party from the mid 70s. It seems these days that political manoeuvring between the ruling parties has moved beyond juggling their own family jewels, and has been reduced to chucking their keys into the fruit bowl with anyone who fancies a quick fumble with their majority.\nFirstly we had UKIP’s Deputy Chairperson Suzanne Evans being interviewed about where her party would go after the predicted win in Rochester. This consisted of a serious of nods and winks about who might and might not leap out of their own party bed and sneak into theirs when the neighbours weren’t looking. A sort of Carry-On Westminster, but with less laughs.\nShe then went on to explain, with barely concealed glee, that her fondest ambition was to seduce someone from Labour to join in their little tryst. Nigel is apparently talking to a couple of MPs but she couldn’t reveal more. She did everything but tap the side of her nose, elbow Andrew Neil in the ribs and give a little Babs Windsor giggle.\nThen we had an analysis from a political expert explaining how UKIP’s performance in the by-election would determine how other sitting MPs would behave in the run up to next years general election. His premise was that if UKIP did well in Rochester, many other career politicians would be considering their position in the next few months. The expectation is apparently that if they think UKIP is a better bet for them to hold on to their seat (ooh matron!), then they would switch allegiances in order to do so.\nNow you’ll have to excuse me. I’m quite new to this game. But when one joins a party isn’t there something about ideology written into the contract? Or am I now being ridiculously naive?\nJudging by the behaviour of at least two recent pantheons of British democracy I suppose I am. It seems that standing on a platform with a bunch of like minded individuals in the hope of doing something good for the country isn’t what it’s about any more.\nNo, apparently it’s more about hanging on to the House Of Commons parking place, the expense account, and access to the House of Commons bar, rather than the boring stuff like philosophical conviction. Some back-benchers are evidently more interested in maintaining a comfortable position for themselves, rather than for their constituents. Yet, in true British carry-on style, they still keep getting elected.\nAs a newcomer to this world, I saw with fresh eyes last night these four sombre suited politicians sitting uneasily with each other, smugly carving up the political cake amongst themselves. Like children at birthday party trying to decide who gets the last portion of jelly and ice cream, the polemic was about anything other than the issues that this country and the planet really face.\nIain Duncan Smith spent a good deal of his time justifying a particularly vituperative campaign poster that portrayed the idea of voting for Mark Reckless as on a par with seeking Pol Pot as a spiritual adviser. Reckless used to be an investment banker, he didn’t live in the area, he’d only moved there to take a safe seat. All very salient points for the local electorate, but ones that seemed exquisitely irrelevant when he was the Conservative MP only a few months ago.\nMeanwhile UKIP expounded their claim that they listened to the people, and were offering an alternative to the status quo of careerist politicians who’d never done a days honest labour in their lives. Odd then that their success last night, and in Clacton a few weeks ago, relied on exactly the reverse of those ideals by welcoming with open arms two MPs firmly rooted in the rotten political establishment they claimed to despise.\nOn the point of principle I am in total agreement with them. The current political establishment has reduced democracy to the level of swapping football cards in the playground. But it’s a tawdry game of top trumps that they have just as much of a hand in as all the other entrenched Westminster parties.\nIf this is the future of politics in this country, I’m glad to be a member of a party that currently stands as an exemplar of how it is still possible to operate democratically without playing these cynical games. We may now have one less MP than UKIP, but at least ours is there on merit, rather than because she swapped her rosette for a more appealing colour.\nAnd Caroline Lucas has just won MP of the year, which is something that gives me hope. Even so, she’s now the focus of a campaign to unseat her by the Labour party in Brighton, because, and despite of the fact, that Labour and the Greens share many of the same aims.\nMoreover, if all these people care about is hanging on to their positions at all costs, what really is the point? And if the electorate is so fickle that they can’t see through this charade, maybe we deserve the graceless, flagitious mess they all seem to be making of the world.\nOne apocryphal anecdote from Rochester I heard today was that someone had voted UKIP because the sitting Tory MP hadn’t done enough for the local area. If that’s true, it’s an indictment of the great British voter more demoralising than anything supposedly implied by hanging a flag out of the window of your mock-Georgian semi.\nBut as an accidental politician I have to hope that it isn’t true, or at least typical. I have to trust that people in the UK will see past all the identikit politicos, the vested interests and the horse trading of their democratic heritage, and vote for real change and genuine representation in the next government.\nI am ever the optimist.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_cycling/content_247.html": "I wrote this post back in 2023 and not much has changed since.\nAs we approach another County Council election (probably the last), the Conservatives are declaring a “pothole emergency” presumably reflecting the climate emergency declarations of a few years ago. But it didn’t seem to be that much of an emergency in 2019 when they were in control of the County Council. Back then they were even worse and had been getting that way for decades.\nThe truth is that no council, regardless of political control, ever receives enough funding to fix the roads properly. The reason is that it would cost BILLIONS to do it really well and no government has ever committed to that. Our roads have been allowed to get worse year on year because no government wants to commit to the costs of fixing them properly. Why would they when local councils can take the brunt of the criticisms for them?\nNo council wants to see potholes. They are a very visible problem that nearly everyone experiences and every councillor and council officer would like to see gone. Of course we’d all like to have the unlimited funding that would be required to fix them, but it’s just not there at the moment. That, coupled with fact that we’re all driving much heavier vehicles than the roads were designed for (plus the increase in HGV traffic) means our roads take a hammering 24 hours a day. Add in the weather extremes we see now and it’s little wonder they break up.\nBut it’s not a recent problem. The Tories may say they will fix it, but they didn’t seem to be able to do so in 2019 when Oxfordshire was ranked 5th worse in the country for the number of potholes as can be seen from the attached article in my post from 2023.\nSo let’s get serious about this issue and stop using it as the proverbial political football every time an election rolls around. Potholes are always going to be with us until central government takes proper responsibility for maintaining our road network, rather than insisting on us building even more roads that we won’t be given the money to maintain. The more roads we build, the bigger and more costly the problem will get. Until governments make that connection, there’s not going to be a long-term solution.\nWe all also need to take personal responsibility for the way our roads are treated. High torque acceleration from traffic lights, on corners or near traffic calming areas such as speed humps will simply tear the road surface up. Our roads are not indestructible, certainly not when we’re all driving heavier cars with 4 wheel drive or more and more of us are buying things online that need to be delivered by heavier vans and trucks. Climate change also plays a part as heavier rainfall and sudden cold snaps play havoc with road surfaces.\nYes our roads need to be properly attended to, but until there’s a national political consensus on that, along with an ongoing commitment to proper funding from national governments, potholes will always be with us to a lesser or greater degree, and any political party that tells you different is just avoiding the holes in their own arguments.\nI’ve done my best to get potholes fixed in my division over the past 4 years but it is like playing a game of of whack-a-mole. You get one fixed and another 2 pop up somewhere else. Whilst I agree there needs to be better quality control on the standard of repairs, simply filling the holes will never solve the problem as any hole is always going to be a point of weakness in the future. In reality there are many roads in the county that need to be completely re-laid, but if the money is spent on that, it’s not there to fix areas elsewhere.\nIt’s a juggling act that will be made better over the next 2 years as OCC have committed nearly £39m to a 2 year road improvement programme. That will help matters (and they have been getting better over the past 4 years despite what the Tories might say in their leaflets), But that sort of funding is still small beer compared to what we need to spend, and that need is getting bigger every year.\nWhat I think is really needed is a pothole summit where councils, residents, motoring organisations, haulage and delivery companies, civil engineers and of course, national government can come together to work on a solution. All the time we simply blame each other every time there’s an election, there’s never going to be the long term solution that we desperately need.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2018_04_14_ian-middleton-for-kidlington-east/content_258.html": "I’ve stood in every local election since I joined the Green Party in 2012, but this one feels more special.\nHaving been involved in the recent campaign to try to persuade the District Council to think again about it’s review of the local plan, I feel I really have something extra to fight for in this election.\nI wrote a detailed response to the council plans to tear up large swathes of the green belt between Kidlington. Begbroke and Yarnton and plonk 4400 houses in the middle of an area with overloaded roads and infrastructure. A plan that would see the three communities amalgamated into one sprawling conurbation, created not to serve local affordable housing needs, but to supposedly provide housing for workers in the city, even though most of the jobs are based in the east.\nYou can read the full response here\nAs everyone involved knows the oft-touted claims that this will include so-called ‘affordable’ housing is laughable. Valuable green belt land will become ten times more valuable once it becomes ripe for development and the landowners and luxury house builders will stand to make a fortune.\nI along with several others were allowed a five minute representation to the councillors in the chamber, some of whom it was later reported couldn’t even be bothered to listen to those who had come to plead their case. One was even photographed using a mobile phone during the speeches!\nSeeing the lack of connectedness demonstrated by the predominately Conservative council enraged me more than I imagined it would. If you watch the video footage from the planning meeting a few weeks ago you can hear me heckling quite loudly throughout some of speeches from Barry Wood and Colin Clarke.\nNormally I wouldn’t do something like that. They deserve their time to speak just as I and the other campaigners had. But being the last to have their say (as Cllr Wood ensured he would be) they were able to simply brush aside the very salient points raised by protesters and other councillors.\nTory councillor after Tory councillor stood up and gave no logical reason why these plans should be forced through in the face of what everyone recognised was an historic level of opposition from the people in the district they represent.\nOver 1500 responses were given to the plans, nearly all of them objecting to this wanton and unnecessary destruction of our precious green belt. Yet the council seemed oblivious to them, to the cogent arguments put forward by speakers and even to the legal opinions that were presented by the two main campaigning groups.\nThe cavalier attitude of Barry Wood, who I’d previously challenged for seeming to pre-judge the outcome of the consultation, was amply demonstrated when he and his fellow councillors abdicated their responsibility to the people of Cherwell and threw their objections at the feet of the planning inspector.\nHis closing argument was that it was the inspector who would make the final decision not them, even though they were elected to represent us. As I suspected months ago, the council had already made its mind up, and the consultation was simply a box ticking exercise. The fate of our green spaces, our wildlife habitats, our clean air and the distinctiveness of our communities has been thrown into the lap of an outside agency because the Tories on the council didn’t have the guts or the inclination to properly consider the alternatives.\nSo I hope you’ll forgive me some heckling out of pure frustration at the lack of professionalism and respect for democracy being shown by these people.\nThat’s why I want to win this election. I want a guaranteed voice in that chamber so that I can represent the views of the people in Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke – an area that is so remote from that chamber, way up at the other end of the district that people like Barry Wood and Colin Clarke feel it’s safe to throw us all under the bus for the sake of expediency.\nIt’s also why the Green Party in Kidlington is working with the Liberal Democrats in this election to elect me in Kidlington East and Alaric Rose in Kidlington West. You can see our joint statement about that here.\nI hope you’ll give me and Alaric a chance to be a strong voice for you after May 3rd.\nYou can see the full video of the planning meeting (including the heckling) on the Cherwell District Council Website.

Recognised as one of the most expensive areas of the district to live in, Kidlington does have some affordable housing in areas but the problem is that most of it is owned and allocated by the City Council. Indeed large areas of the village have been given over to the city’s needs, not least Grovelands which was built almost entirely for the City Council’s use.\nAnd soon we’ll have even more, with the local plan partial review, which was adopted in 2020 after 3 years of objection and protest from local residents and pressure groups, providing yet more housing for the City’s needs with the 50% so-called affordable element having been signed over to the City Council’s control in a closed meeting during the first lockdown in 2020.\nWe all know that the term ‘affordable housing’ is virtually meaningless in Oxfordshire, but even so, very little is built in Kidlington. Even when the district council’s policy to to ensure that 30% of all new housing on larger estates is ‘affordable’, we hardly see anything being built that fulfils that criteria.\nThe flats above the Co-op were essentially given over to the flying school for their exclusive use, even though 3 of the apartments were meant to be available for residents needing affordable accommodation. At least 15 of those flats should have been designated affordable, but the district council messed up the planning application and we ended up with just 3 units available, with the rest being let on the open market. The agreement with developer in that case was so badly negotiated that in 3 years only 1 of those flats has been let on an affordable basis. The terms demand that the council must nominate someone within a 28 day window once a year which is almost impossible to do.\nFlats on the old Co-Op car park site now almost exclusively let to a local flying school at market rent\n15 more flats are due to be built on the Kidlington Garage site at the top of the Bicester Road. When the planning application was agreed the developers were supposed to provide £609,000 in lieu of the 5 affordable apartments. But 6 months later they returned to the planning committee with a viability assessment that argued they couldn’t afford to make any contribution at all. Nothing! Zilch!\nThis is because the government mandates that developers should be guaranteed a profit of 20% on all developments (how nice it would be for other businesses to be guaranteed a profit by the government!). This leaves it open for developers to game the system and make claims that they can’t meet this profitability threshold and thereby reduce or, as in this case, completely remove their responsibility to provide any affordable units or money in lieu.\nI and my fellow Green Councillor Fiona Mawson thought this was wrong and we tabled a motion to refuse the planning application if no affordable element was provided. Sadly, as we and our opposition group are outnumbered on the planning committee, the plans were approved by the Conservative majority.\nSubsequently I brought a motion to the council to increase our affordable requirement on larger developments from 30% to 50% to bring us in line with the City policy. As we have agreed to that percentage on the developments being built in and around Kidlington for the City Council, I thought it only fair that we should give our own residents the same consideration. I was pleased to see that the motion was passed almost unanimously.\nIt’s still sobering to think though that out of around 90 apartments that have been built in Kidlington in the past 5 years, only 3 have been designated affordable and as I explained above, out of those 3, only one has actually been let to a family that needed it.\nCherwell is desperately in need of a change of direction in this issue. We need a council who is prepared to stand up to developers and push for better deals for all our residents. Moreover we need to ensure more affordable developments are brought on line that will benefit local families rather than forcing them to split up as grown children need to move away from their area simply because they can’t afford a home of their own. I believe a change of administration next month could see that better direction and I hope to be a part of that.",

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2024_06/content_206.html": "District Councillor for Kidlington East, County Councillor for Kidlington South, Parish Councillor for Kidlington, Yarnton and Gosford & Water Eaton Parish Council – Promoted by Karl Kwiatkowski on behalf of Ian Middleton both at Flat 3, 69 West Street, Banbury OX16 3HB\nI’ve just spent a couple of days in the gorgeous village of Stonesfield researching the state of the river Evenlode which was recently given the unenviable title of the most polluted river in England.\nAnd it’s hardly surprising given that in the past few years the amount of sewage being pumped in to the river has risen from 8000 hours per year to 12000 hours. The river itself is not insubstantial, being deep enough in some areas to swim in, although these days you’d be brave to risk it given the level of E coli and other nasties lurking in its once crystal clear depths.\nI spoke to brilliant local councillor Genny Early about the history of the river that she’s lived near for the past 30 years and the tale was not a happy one. Where once you could look out from the local footbridge at fish swimming amongst the river weeds and watch local dogs play happily in the waters, we now have a soupy grey clag, virtually devoid of life and reputedly toxic to everyone including our canine companions.\nThe cause is toxic dumping from up to 9 different local sewage works, given effective carte blanche by the Conservative government to use this river, and others in the area, as an open sewer to enable companies like Thames Water to pay out record dividends to investors whilst doing next to nothing to fix inadequate infrastructure.\nThis is the starkest example of how privatisation has failed us all with greedy and cynical corporations grabbing every opportunity to make obscene amounts of money by (in this case) quite literally shitting on local communities.\nI made a video with Genny showing just how bad things have got in this area, in sickening contrast to the beautiful local landscape. You can watch it by clicking here.\nWe simply can’t allow this situation to continue and only the Greens have the real solution to take privatised utilities back into public control where they belong. Water is quite literally an essential for life on this planet. If we’ve reached the point where that is simply a commodity to be bartered between corporations on the open market we really have reached the bottom of a very murky barrel.\nGreens would take water and other essential public utilities and services back into public control as the only way to deal with this obscene failure of duty to keep our waterways and rivers clean and accessible for wildlife and recreation. Other parties are suggesting half way houses of fines and extra taxation. None of that will work in an industry that simply doesn’t care any more.\nWe need radical solutions to these unprecedented outcomes and only the Green Party has a vision bold enough to deliver those.\nI’ve been involved in retail for as long as I can remember. From my first proper job as a Saturday boy in a menswear store in Lewisham through my days as a market trader in Camden Lock and Greenwich to being co-founder of a national high street chain that started with a small store in Oxford selling silver jewellery. and grew into a national chain trading in 6 of country’s major retail locations, including London’s prestigious Covent Garden.\nIn that time I saw almost as many ups as I did downs. I’ve half jokingly said that I spent 20 years building the business and then another 10 trying extricating it from the failing high street. Like so many other retailers who entered the high street during the boom years in the early 1990s, I fell foul of the simultaneous boom in commercial property development. So many new malls were opened in the 90s and early 2000s it was difficult to keep up and I opened stores in some of the most iconic examples such as the New Bullring in Birmingham and Bluewater in Kent.\nThe other boom at the time was in business rates, which along with rents skyrocketed through that period as institutional landlords, mostly backed by large pension funds, cashed in on the retail bubble ploughing millions into new shiny malls based on the emerging US model. It was great while it lasted and we all became caught up in the heady days of seemingly limitless opportunities. But we soon discovered there were limits.\nThe Financial crash in 2008 gave us all a pretty sharp reality check and things soon started to become far less buoyant and rents that had been agreed on the back of rude profit margins started to look far less tenable as turnovers started to fall.\nI’ve been fighting for a fairer deal for High Street retail for over 15 years\nThere soon followed a series of frantic rounds of renegotiation with landlords who themselves were facing the prospect of huge hole in their new developments as retailers started to fall over with alarming regularity. In many cases we were able to come to mutual agreements to keep us trading at the shopping malls looking full, but the one thing that couldn’t be re-negotiated were business rates. Set as they were, by the central valuation office, and administered by local authorities, they were completely devoid of any chance of concession unless you had an understanding council. In my experience their understanding was rather limited, and after 5 years as a local councillor myself I now understand more about why that was.\nSo we were all caught in a perfect storm that only a few managed to emerge from. My business was one of the luckier ones as I managed to negotiate deals that gave us breathing space. But I could see the writing on the wall and it was telling me to get out of the high street and decamp to the internet where so many of our competitors were lurking. Thereby hangs another very long story.\nBut suffice to say I have an intimate understanding of the plight of the high street, in fact much more intimate than I would prefer. For that reason one of my personal priorities as a fresh faced new MP would be to push for a new system of business rates or local high street taxation. Other things like rent controls and use classes would also be high on the agenda, but none of this will be an easy fix for an industry in the doldrums after so many years in decline. But I know from my own experience that smaller independents are both the lifeblood of local high streets whilst also being the most vulnerable.\nIn terms of the dreaded business rates, I think I could take elements from the land tax approach of the Green party and add in some aspect of a local purchase tax as seen in the USA. Such a tax would be far more progressive and have more respect for the ability of businesses to pay such an additional tax. That would give a far greater connection between the local community, local authorities and the retailers themselves. If all retailers did well then they would all reap the benefits.\nSpeaking to local councillors and retailers about business rates reform\nI don’t really have the answer to full business rates reform, but I’ve been campaigning for a better system for over 10 years. I would advocate a situation where we involved existing high street retailers in the process of finding a solution. There have been past attempts at doing this, but very few, if any, involved small independent retailers. I think that was a mistake.\nThe Labour Party have boldly announced that they would scrap the current business rates system, but they haven’t said what they would replace it with. I’ve been here before many times, and both Labour and the Tories have frequently promised reform but never delivered on that. One of the biggest reason is that business rates are a virtually guaranteed income for government bringing in over £13bn a year. Even if the premises are empty, the landlord cops for the bill so it’s a win-win for Westminster. So any new system is likely to be just as iniquitous and damaging, especially to smaller operators.\nI think there is a way of developing a system of local high street taxation that could benefit all sides of the equation, including the consumer. Just scrapping the business rates system with no plan for what would replace it is not a solution, yet its the current proposal from the part that is most likely to form the next government in a few weeks. If I was in Westminster I’d hope to be able to provide a far better insight into the problems on the high street and how to engage with the people who face those problems every day.\nI’d like to see genuine consultation with high street stakeholders, including landlords and local councils, about the best way forwards. As a long term retailer, having moved from being a small business, through a larger expansion and back to being a ‘born again independent’, I’d like to be involved in that process. But I guess it remains to be seen what the outcome is on July 4th.\nI’ve just published a video I made during a recent visit to Bicester with some thoughts on how we can work towards a better system of high street business taxation and help to repair our broken high streets and you can watch that by clicking here.\nIf you’re a retailer or just someone who enjoys browsing physical shops, I’d suggest you vote for someone like me who has the experience to make that a viable possibility again. Retail is at the heart of every village, town and city and needs political support to make it vibrant again. Many politicians claim to have the answer but few of them have been on the inside of the industry. I think that needs to change. I’d like to change it.\nSo in the words of Dolly Parton – Here I come again!\nNo sooner had we got past the District Council elections than we were thrown into a General Election that I and most other pundits had assumed would be held in October or even November.\nTheories as to why we’ve been dragged into the whole merry-go-round again at this premature juncture range from speculation about the likely state of the economy and the reduction in inflation, which no political party can realistically take credit for (although the Tories are trying), to the idea that Rishi and his Tory mates needed to get their CVs in for some cushy consultancy gigs before the end of the year.\nThe other likely reason of course is that there was a chance that a vote of no confidence could be called in Mr Sunak and he wanted to leave the political sphere (as he is likely to do) on the high of being the actual PM, if only in terms of his name badge.\nWhatever the reason, here we are having been given only a short 6 weeks to make our case to the electorate, which for parties like the Greens, without the financial and operational reserves of some of the other parties is something of a tall order.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_schools/content_108.html": "I’ve been surprised throughout this election at the lack of questioning during hustings and interviews about education.\nWith cuts being felt right across the county, we really should be more focused on this issue that we are. I was tweeted tonight by a parent led group campaigning against cuts in school funding in Oxfordshire asking if I realised just how bad the situation was.\nAt this point I’m the only candidate to reply. But maybe the others will catch up later.\nBut playing catch-up seems to be the way for our education system, with a report coming out only a few days ago on the dire state of repair of some school buildings. As someone who went to school in the 70s, I find it shocking that we should have let our education system become so under-valued in such a short period of time.\nMy best friend from back in those days keeps in touch with me, and he has just retired as a senior head teacher. He now does consultancy work for schools that are suffering under the same system he battled through. Essentially the privatisation of our education system that does little to help students and puts a lot of money into the pockets of Academy shareholders.\nThe future of our children should not be for sale to the highest bidder, and we should not be seeing a situation where parents have to raise hundreds of pounds to subsidise books or pay for bus passes so their children can actually get to school. Again, I remember free bus passes for school-children, but that seems like a long-lost utopia now.\nWe need an education system that provides opportunity to everyone. Schools that cater for all levels of ability and aspiration. The chance for everyone who wants to move on to further and higher education to do so without saddling themselves with a lifetime of debt.\nWe also need to value our teachers and educators, paying them a decent salary and ensuring they have fair conditions to work in. Like doctors and nurses they are taken far too much for granted and expected to cope with appalling stress simply because they are dedicated people.\nThe Conservative’s promises of extra funding don’t come close to addressing the problems that have been stored up over the past 10 years. Their so-called ‘extra’ spending amounts to nothing more than setting the clock back to the point before they imposed austerity on us all.\nSee the Green Party Manifesto by clicking here. Go to page 55 to see our comprehensive range of proposals and policies about revitalising our education system and bringing schools into the 21sct century, whilst unlocking the potential of students and teachers at all levels.\nA proper education for the next generation should be a priority for all of us.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_yarnton_page_2/content_363.html": "A number of fundamental questions about Oxford City Council’s submission of its local plan have been raised by the planning inspector in his initial questions and comments. These questions are strikingly familiar to anyone who was at the Public Inquiry into Cherwell District Council’s Local Plan Review earlier this year.\nAt the hearing, local campaigners called on Cherwell to delay any further work on the plan to build 4400 houses on prime Green Belt in Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke until the true figures of housing need in Oxford were known.\nCherwell’s local plan review is predicated on a perceived obligation to help meet Oxford City’s housing need. Campaigners against the plans have repeatedly argued that Oxford’s need cannot be quantified until their local plan has been agreed, approved and published. Something the City Council has been slow to progress.\nInstead, District councils have relied on guesswork and a ‘working assumption’ from the Oxfordshire Growth Board (OGB) based on figures in the 2014 Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA). A report that itself has been highly criticised since its publication.\nIn response, the City Council commissioned an update to the SHMA. This demonstrated that the original figures were over-estimates, a conclusion backed by follow up analysis from an independent planning consultant presented to the Cherwell hearing. Both the city and district councils, including Cherwell, have sought to ignore the implications of these reports, but the inconsistencies have not escaped the planning inspector. These include:\n- The fact that figures being used to underpin assumptions of need are now over 8 years old\n- That the 2018 SHMA points to a significantly lower housing need than that shown in the 2014 version and that these figures have not been incorporated into the City’s plan.\n- Inconsistencies in estimated housing capacities in the City’s plan and the ‘Growth Deal’ proposals\n- Suggestions of prescriptive planning policies that preclude development in numerous key areas\n- Concerns over double counting of homeless numbers where new households are ignored\n- Inappropriate market ‘uplifts’ producing around a 30% over-estimate of housing need\nIan Middleton, Cherwell District Council’s new Green councillor said\n“The inspector’s comments are a clear vindication of the position taken by groups opposed to Cherwell’s plans to devastate green spaces in South Cherwell on the basis of an assumed need that has been significantly inflated.\nDuring the public inquiry, Cherwell resolutely refused to listen to calls from myself and MP Layla Moran to delay their plans until the City’s need had been properly established. It’s now clear we were right and the need to suspend Cherwell’s local plan review, regardless of their planning inspector’s verdict, is even more urgent.\nThe assumptions on housing need used by the OGB have now been undermined by 2 independent studies, and a planning inspector. How much more evidence does the council need to admit that their proposals in Kidlington, Begbroke and Yarnton are misguided and woefully unsound?\nIt would be hugely irresponsible for a council to impose such sweeping and irreversible damage on local communities when they know that the data underpinning those plans is at best questionable and at worse completely wrong”\nThe planning inspector is expected to publish his response to the Cherwell Local plan review in the next few weeks.\nYou can see the full text of the planning inspector’s comments and questions on the city council plan here https://www.oxford.gov.uk/downloads/file/6397/ic1_-_inspectors_initial_questions_and_comments_to_occ",

After years of campaigning and complaining, manoeuvring and cajoling, half-truths and good old fashioned British pig-headedness, the moaning masses of middle England have finally got their referendum.\nI say ‘their’ referendum because this isn’t being staged at great expense for those of us who want to stay part of Europe. It’s not even for those who don’t really give a toss either way.\nIt’s certainly not for those more outward looking souls, who appreciate the many advantages of being a member of the European club.

Numerous environmental improvements to beaches, rivers and the countryside, including controls on things like GMOs. Human rights, animal rights, consumer rights. Cheaper phone charges and easier and cheaper travel and currency exchange. Social welfare protection and labour rights, and a panoply of other advantages that most people take for granted and will miss when they’re gone.\nNo, it’s a referendum for misguided and ill-informed little-Englanders, draped in Union flags, firm in the belief of two world wars and one world cup and certain the word ‘Great’ attached to Britain means something other than the first letter on a sticker they slap on the back of their booze cruise charabang, just to remind those envious foreigners that they were unlucky enough to be born on inferior soil.\nBut moreover, it’s a referendum for politicians who have been looking at continental Europe down the wrong end of the telescope for so long now, they just don’t realise how small this country has become on the world stage. A myopic concern about how much money we pay to Europe and a studied ignorance of the huge returns our EU membership generates.\nMost people who focus on our payment to Brussels like to remind us what else we could do with that money. Yet with a growing national debt, and stubbornly high deficit, any such savings would likely fall into the same black hole as most of the rest of our national finances. Either that or it would go towards servicing the country’s circa £50bn annual interest payments, paid in large part to European banks anyway.\nIt’s not 1975. The geo-political landscape has changed around us since the last time we decided if we wanted to be a part of Europe. Yes, back in the swinging 70s it was the ‘Common Market’, but by necessity and common interest it’s become more than that. Those advocating some kind of return to a simple trading relationship are ignoring both the reality of our reduced place in the world and the promiscuity of world markets.\nNeither is it 1938, even though Cameron’s Chamberlain moment was equally as hollow. Just like his pre-war counterpart, the agreement he reached in Brussels was peripheral and disposable, focussing as it did on the false polemic of immigration and border control.\nIt was a pantomime, with Donald Tusk and Angela Merkel as the ugly sisters to Cameron’s Cinderella. Shouts of “they’re behind you” were evident from the likes of UKIP and Front National pointing to the ‘hordes’ or ‘swarms’ or ‘bunches’ of ‘migrants’, ‘refugees’ or ‘immigrants’, depending on which description David Cameron and the BBC have alighted on this week.\nI totally agree that EU democratic and regulatory processes are in desperate need of reform, but these weren’t the points that Cameron argued. Driven by domestic pressures, piled on by a widening xenophobic rhetoric, he was pushed into a rushed and ill-conceived round of negotiations that resulted in him metaphorically claiming ‘peace in our time’ outside Number 10. It was a performance put on to give him a platform to launch the referendum that we all knew was coming, and the critic’s reviews weren’t great.\nSadly for him, us, and the rest of Europe, this was a missed opportunity that could have sparked a trans-national debate about the real future of the EU and brought about radical changes to shape it into something more even-handed and responsive to the needs of all member states.\nBut instead, Cameron wasted what could have been his real place in history for the sake of a thumbs up from the likes of Farage, Gove and Galloway whilst gaining little tangible return for the UK, save for some token restrictions on benefit payments to migrants who rarely claim them anyway.\nIn fact it’s recently been revealed that the UK government has no idea how much immigration costs us, nor how much migrants contribute to our economy. But let’s not let a little thing like lack of facts get in the way of a nicely staked out scapegoat.\nAnd while we’re on the subject of discrimination, we mustn’t forget those hard-pressed city bankers quaking in their handmade brogues, terrified that they may be penalised for being outside the Eurozone. That of course, amid the posturing about immigration, was the main concern for Cameron and his paymasters. Essentially he was in Brussels to fight for the right to discriminate against the poor whilst protecting the interests of the obscenely rich, although of course that wasn’t so eagerly reported.\nAnd there we have it. The crux of all this political, psychological and media-spun mendacity – Corporate interest. Insular businesses seeking to rid themselves of the European interference and regulation that keeps all the rest of us safer and better looked after. The refugee and migrant crises couldn’t have come at a better time for these vested interests to galvanise public opinion in favour of an out vote.\nOn this flimsiest of pretexts, and on evidence largely pulled out UKIP’s collective backside, we’re potentially going to launch ourselves into one of the biggest national disasters for several generations. The ‘Brexit’ silo mentality that is about as relevant in today’s globally connected society as statutes recorded on vellum.\nOne of the greatest achievements and advantages of the EU is freedom of movement between states. It’s a harbinger of a future globalised socio-economic system where borders and statehood will be irrelevant. One where the term ‘economic-migrant’ will no longer be a thinly veiled insult, just as it wasn’t when we and other nations economically migrated across the globe centuries ago, annexing and occupying entire countries as we went. In that context, and in view of the Tories much vaunted ‘on your bike’ ethos, I find it perplexing that we now seem to regard our attraction as place of opportunity as a bad thing.\nAnd while we’re on that subject, if I were a British migrant living on the continent I’d be feeling distinctly uncomfortable right now. Especially those who have lived there for longer than 15 years and are inexplicably denied the right to vote in a referendum that may well decide their future.\nThose whistling tunes in the dark about independent trade agreements with Europe and other global partners will soon find that our status as the 5th richest nation in the world is built on foundations largely stamped with a CE logo. Already Sterling has plummeted on the news that Boris is heading for the lifeboats.\nMuch of our apparent wealth is generated by the financial sector and supported by our membership of the EU. Who will want to trade with us as a small individual nation with a growing national debt and a dwindling economic base? No wonder the city was such a key part of Cameron’s negotiations.\nThe finance sector is pretty much all we have left. We don’t have anything else to trade. China and the USA know this and have already warned us that a UK outside the EU will be of much less interest to them. The US in particular sees our connection with Europe as a valuable conduit into EU financial markets.\nUncoupling ourselves from the EU will be a long, painful and essentially irreversible process. We won’t wake up one day and see bluebirds over the white cliffs and a land of milk and honey for all. It will take years of debate, legal dispute and the unpicking of labyrinthine systems of regulation woven into our own statutory frameworks. A drawn out and retrograde process, during which I believe we’ll slowly come to see the folly of our ways.\nAnd once we’ve closed our borders and thumbed our noses at one of the biggest trading blocs on the planet, it will be too late to realise that we’re now more of a Pekinese than a bulldog. An isle not so much sceptred as septic, poisoned by our own arrogance and bigotry, left entirely at the mercy of a broken political system where wealth goes one way, and protection is only there for those who can afford it.\nAs Britain shrivels into, at best, a tawdry tax haven in perpetual serfdom to a rich elite, we’ll come to the sad realisation that we’ve been sold a Jerusalem built on false promises and false flags. I wonder if border controls and apocryphal straight bananas will seem quite so important then.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_gosford/content_99.html": "At last week’s full council meeting of Cherwell District Council, councillors unanimously passed a climate change emergency motion calling on leader Barry Wood to report back to the council in six months on progress made on several environmental objectives for Cherwell.\nAs Cherwell’s only Green councillor I supported the motion with some reservations about the council’s true commitment to the difficult decisions that will need to be taken if the district is going to become truly carbon neutral by 2030.\nAs if to prove that point the council then went on to debate my motion calling for a rethink on plans to build on green belt in south Cherwell.\nThe motion, seconded by Libdem councillor Conrad Copeland, asked for a temporary pause to allow for new evidence to be taken into account that casts doubt on the number of houses needed to support Oxford’s unmet need – the justification for Cherwell’s partial review of its local plan.\nI also raised concerns about the amount of expansion being tacitly agreed to for the Begbroke Science Park that also encompasses large areas of Yarnton. In my opinion, this has been slipped into the review under false pretences, given that this has nothing to do with housing need in Oxford. As a result there’s mounting local criticism of the university’s ambitions to commandeer at least 1000 of the houses intended to meet Oxford’s needs for its own use as part of a new campus at Begbroke and Yarnton.\nChair of the Cherwell Development Watch Alliance, Giles Lewis, spoke in favour of the motion at the packed meeting and read out emails between the council and the university, obtained under and FOI request, that suggested plans to allow the university to expand in the area were already being supported as long ago as 2016.\nThe Labour group on the council then introduced an amendment which blocked any re-consideration of housing need numbers, even though this might mean more houses that were needed would be built on green belt.\nI pointed out that just to offset the amount of carbon produced in building the unaffordable and unneeded houses in the first place would take 572,000 trees over 10 years, or 200 per house, rather than the 1 tree per building that Cllr Wood had suggested during his address on the climate change emergency motion.\nIt’s clear that neither Labour nor the Conservatives are prepared to take the difficult decisions that are needed to combat the climate emergency. Labour were far more concerned not to be seen to be challenging inflated housing need figures proposed by their colleagues on the city council, whist the Conservatives simply want to be facilitators for large wealthy landowners in the area including the university. The location of the housing clearly has more to do with the university’s ambitions than it does with genuine housing allocation priorities. Either way it ends up with unnecessary and unaffordable housing being built that locals will have no access to on the green spaces at the heart of their community. This is a stitch-up perpetrated on the people of south Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Gosford!\nLibdem Councillor and spokesperson for the Progressive Oxfordshire group, Katherine Tyson said “These plans will simply expand the city’s appalling air quality into our rural community. At one point Labour councillor and vice-chairperson of the council Hannah Banfield seemed to suggest that, as Banbury residents had accepted bad air quality as a result of housing development in their area, the people of south Cherwell should just do the same. The argument that one ward coming to peace with poisoning their residents and children doesn’t mean that another ward should also poison their constituents. That’s not good enough for Cherwell residents. It beggars belief that such a comment could be made from a Labour councillor just after we had voted in favour of a climate change emergency motion”\nThe motion to pause the local review pending the outcome of the examination of the city council local plan and to separately consult on the university’s plans in Begbroke and Yarnton was successfully amended by the Labour group to an undertaking to review the allocation sites for the 4400 houses. It was carried by Labour with Conservatives abstaining on the vote. The subsequent motion was defeated by 16 votes to 23.",

The Banbury Phone Box Library is one such brilliant piece of local engagement which is now garnering international attention as BT looks towards chopping it off at the knees.\nThe red phone box is almost as iconic as the red bus as a national symbol of Britain around the world. You’d think if you were company who owns and operates these highly visible pieces of cultural capital you’d be only too pleased to see them being involved in well supported local campaigns that add value to a service that is perhaps not as loved as it once was.\nIn that context it seems daft to me that BT are hell bent on annoying small and large communities across the country by removing public call boxes where they’re valued for numerous reasons other than a quick natter on the phone. It’s even more self-defeating that they’re erasing some of the very symbols of Britishness that have helped them build a world class multi-national company.\nIt has to be said that the Town Council in Banbury share some of the potential blame if the box is removed, as they are refusing to adopt it (something that BT now allow for the princely sum of £1), if BT go ahead with plans to decommission the phone service in the box. Previously they struck a deal with BT to adopt the box and save the library and a local steel fabrication firm offered to fix permanent shelves in the box to house the books to assuage BT’s prior objections to the library service on health and safety grounds, as they believed the current shelving arrangements could be dangerous.\nBT now claims that it is uneconomic for them to continue to run the service anyway, even though I understand thousands of calls were made from it last year.\nThe under-story seems to be that BT want out of the call box game at any cost, and most of that cost will be borne by local communities using the boxes for a number of vital social services or simply to make a call when other options are not available to them.\nBanbury Town Council now say that they’re not prepared to adopt the box if it is then decommissioned by BT. Whilst I support taking a stance against the loss of the phone service, I think it would be a sad loss to the community of the box were to be removed as a result of the Town Council refusing to adopt the box itself.\nMoreover, If BT are claiming the box is loss making, I think it would be useful for them to provide the figures backing that up. It would at least give us an idea of the likely shortfall which could perhaps be covered in some other way.\nIt’s also crazy that BT are missing this as an opportunity for some very positive PR. It has to be said that they’re not universally loved as a company, so something like this, that is fairly minimal in cost terms, would seem to be a great way for them to connect with the community.\nGoing forward perhaps the government needs to bring in a legal requirement on telecoms companies like this to provide a certain number of public call points in an area. Just because most of us carry mobiles now, doesn’t mean that sometimes they might not fail at a vital time, or have been forgotten when they’re most needed. I know BT used to be obliged to seek permission from local or parish councils in order to remove a box, but it sounds like that requirement has now been watered down. In very rural areas mobile phone reception is also notoriously patchy. In those areas call boxes provide a vital service for emergency calls.\nIn terms of usage statistics, it might also be interesting to track the number of calls made against the minimum price of a call in a phone box, which I understand is now 60p. Perhaps BT need to be reminded of the law of supply and demand.\nIf you’re on Twitter you can follow and support the campaign to save the Banbury Phone Box Library by following the hashtag #SaveOurPhoneboxLibrary",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_author_ianmiddleton99_page_14/content_466.html": "It’s a Thursday so it must be election day! It seems like elections are almost a weekly occurrence now. Brenda of Bristol must furious!\nJoking aside, I must admit I was surprised to find myself thrown into another election so soon after winning 3 local council seats in May.\nBut it seems that our strong and stable government can’t manage to hang on for any longer than a coupe of years at most these days, even with the so-called fixed- term Parliament Act!\nThis just goes to show how desperately we need electoral reform in this country, a system by which more than one party can contribute to the process of government and more than one set of opinions can be taken into account.\nIt seems that, far from our first past the post system giving us a government of unity and decisiveness, when it comes to the most monumental political upheaval in a generation, we simply can’t agree on anything!\nIn those circumstances we have to go back to the country and hope that the numbers stack up differently afterwards. Somehow I suspect they won’t. While we cling to our broken 2 party state, we will just see-saw backwards and forwards between opposing positions.\nOn the key issue of Brexit, Labour are still offering a confused position, saying they would re-negotiate the deal with the EU and then put it to the people. That’s a great in principle, but in practice it means Labour will presumably be rooting for their new deal in any subsequent vote. That, by any sensible definition, makes them a party of leave.\nThe Libdems simply want to ignore the 2016 vote and treat Brexit like it never happened. Whilst that’s an attractive prospect for those of us who would rather remain, it’s not a way to resolve the political schism in our country at the moment.\nThe 2016 result was hardly decisive as it showed a split right down the middle of the argument. We could probably have run the vote again the following day and got a different result!\nThe only way to properly heal this country is with a second referendum as soon as possible after the election. No more deals being negotiated, no more simply pushing the Brexit button out of expediency (as the Tories would have us do), but a properly informed, final say on the direction this country will take and what is in the best interests of everyone.\nPersonally, if that second vote still comes out as leave I’m done on the subject of Brexit. I’m quite happy to let the chips fall where they may and shift my focus to trying to prepare the country for what I think will be the most damaging decade in history since the last war.\nBut to those who say we shouldn’t have a second vote, I’d point to the fact that we’re now having our third national vote since 2015! If ‘the will of the people’ really was the main driving force in our democracy, we’d keep the government we voted for in 2015, regardless of the wishes of the government at the time. But we haven’t.\nSo if we can have 3 general elections in 4 years, why not a confirmatory vote on something that was decided by a small minority three and a half years ago, when we didn’t know what we know now? Something that could impact on all our futures and those of generations to come. Why is that to be decided on just one vote?\nI really don’t know why anyone should object to the idea of a People’s Vote. If the will of the people hasn’t changed, the result will be the same. The only reason I can see that the Brexit contingent would object to another vote, is that they think they will lose it.\nIn which case they know in their heart of hearts that the mood of the country has changed. They know that the vote in 2016 was probably a fluke, and they’re terrified of the genuine will of the people being followed now. they simply want to railroad us all into the abyss before anyone realised what’s happening. That’s no way to run a country!\nSo let’s get on with this election and I hope vote in some more Green MPs who can influence Westminster enough to resolve the national insanity we seem to have thrown ourselves into over Brexit.\nWe don’t need to get Brexit done. We need to do away with it once and for all!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_chicken/content_256.html": "Many people will have heard the absurd comments from Cherwell’s lead councillor for Financial Management and Governance, Tony Ilott, on BBC Oxford breakfast radio on Tuesday. I thought it was worth covering a few of the comments made by the Conservative representative in more detail.\nThe programme featured a running topic on the amount of back rent owed to several councils in Oxfordshire and you can hear it here. This is not a problem unique to this county as so many councils now rely on commercial investment to make ends meet since central government no longer provide enough funding for even the basic services that we all rely on.\nThis problem is exacerbated by the fact that legislation requires local authorities to balance their budgets every year and prevents them from borrowing to cover any shortfalls. This leaves them in the position of trying to operate like private investors without having the same financial flexibility.\nWith many local authorities now heavily invested in commercial property they have all faced a huge shortfall in income from rents that have not been paid throughout the pandemic. To add insult to this injury, even though the Chancellor said he would provide “whatever it takes” to help local government, central government has excluded losses from commercial investments from it’s support payments to councils.\nThe need to balance the books each year results in councils being left with only 2 options when they have a shortfall in rents. Either they increase council tax (which can only be done up to certain limits without a costly referendum) or they cut services.\nthat’s going to be a pretty expensive chicken dinner for the residents of Cherwell!\nThis is what Cherwell District Council did in 2021 when they reported losses in the region of £1.6m against the Castle Quay shopping centre in Banbury. With similar losses predicted for the next financial year, this is likely to put the same pressures on the budget for the following year which will inevitably mean yet more cuts, along with additional charges like we’ve seen this year for things like garden waste collections.\nCommercial landlords would usually carry these sorts of shortfalls over a period of years, often borrowing to cover the gaps, and recover as much of the rent as they could over that time with deferral agreements with tenants. Ultimately some of the losses may have to be written off. But as explained above, councils can’t do this. So as long as these shortfalls are on the books, more cuts or tax increases are the only way to deal with the problem each year.\nIt was clear though from the interview Cllr Ilott really didn’t understand any of the mechanics of this, which is quite staggering considering his role on the council. When he was asked if he thought there should be a change in legislation that would allow councils to deal with these problems, he said he didn’t think so. Instead he chose to make childish personal comments about me and avoided answering the interviewer’s questions about how the council will recover these losses.\nit’s clear that they have no real vision for how to revitalise the development other than the idea that making it bigger will somehow make it better.\nHe did make mention of ‘working with tenants’ which of course is a good plan. As a retail consultant myself I’d always advocate such a move, but due to the limitations imposed on councils, this can only be done on a year by year basis. Any outstanding debts at the end of each year will need to be accounted for and action taken on increased taxation or services cuts.\nCllr Illot suggested that we look at things “in the round” and I agree we should do that. Unfortunately, time restraints on the programme prevented me from laying out the full details, but I’m happy to do so here :\n- Losses in the last financial year attributable to Castle Quay – £1.6m\n- Losses predicted in the next financial year due to Castle Quay – approx £1.6m\n- Rent owed to Cherwell District Council at this point – nearly £2m\n- Loss in value of Castle Quay shopping centre since the council took full ownership – over £30m (it’s now worth less than half what they paid for it 4 years ago)\n- Additional investment being ploughed into expanding the centre – £73m (underwritten by council tax payers)\n- Interest on the loans to finance all this (so far) – £2m+ per year\n- Cuts required to the entire council budget this year – £4.4m\nYes some of this can be blamed on the pandemic, but retail was already on the decline when the council took the frankly bizarre decision to buy the scheme, especially as it’s clear that they have no real vision for how to revitalise the development other than the idea that making it bigger will somehow make it better. That and Cllr Ilott’s head in the sand optimism seems to be the main strategy from our Conservative councillors.\nI don’t see that as good value for the council tax payers of Cherwell. Judging by Cllr Illott’s flippancy and lack of concern he seems to regard massive financial losses along with the associated financial impact on resident’s pockets as fine as long as he can get some chicken.\nI’d say that taking all that into account that’s going to be a pretty expensive chicken dinner for the residents of Cherwell!\nAnd let’s not forget that all this money is going into one town in Cherwell – Banbury. Meanwhile Bicester town centre’s retail area is being hollowed out due to the council’s planning decisions elsewhere, and the whole of the district – every single tax payer – is footing the bill for all this incompetence. As is often the case with Cherwell Council , the south of the district is left to fend for itself and pick up the tab. If I were a cynical soul I might suggest that this is because the majority of support for the councillors who agreed to this whole adventure comes from the north of the district.\nBut I think we should all be able to rely on decent fiscal management from our local councillors, no matter where we live. Sadly it seems clear to me that we can’t expect this as long as the Conservatives are in charge.\nIt’s about time the Tories got a proper grip on council finances and stopped playing chicken with all our money!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2023_02/content_131.html": "I am still trying to remain open-minded about Oxford United Football Club’s proposals to build an 18000 seater stadium on green belt land that forms part of the Kidlington Gap at Stratfield Brake. But as the County and District Councillor for the area that Stratfield Brake sits within, I think the County Cabinet’s agreement to enter into negotiations with OUFC was premature, given that there were still so many unanswered questions a year on from the initial approaches from the club to the council.\nOf course we all want to help the club find a new home, but if we’re talking about using public assets to do that, we need transparency about what they’ve done to help themselves. For example, we still don’t have evidence that they’ve have explored all legal remedies to stay where they are.\nIt also appeared from the club’s own long-awaited report that they hadn’t even started looking at other alternative sites until October last year, after claiming at the beginning of 2022 that they had already explored all other options.\nAfter waiting 8 months for the full report on the club’s plans, it took a further 2 months for it to be circulated to stakeholders in a heavily edited form which doesn’t suggest that they are willing to be as transparent with local residents and stakeholders as they have claimed in the past.\nKidlington Parish Council (KPC) had been waiting for most of last year for the report from the club showing their detailed plans for the main Stratfield Brake site (which they are leaseholders of) so that they could be put out to local consultation. They could not take a decision on relinquishing their lease until they had consulted with the local residents who they represent.\nThe club has tried to blame the council for delays in making a decision on the initial very broad proposals but that was simply not the case. KPC wanted to make a decision on an informed basis and had been working towards a genuine local consultation, but to facilitate that they needed details of what the club were proposing. Thus any delay in the decision by the council are entirely the fault of the football club. Instead of engaging properly with KPC to help them hold a local consultation, they have gone around them by moving their plans to the site known as the Triangle which KPC has no direct control over.\nAs a result, I made a plea to the cabinet to include an amendment to the proposals to enter into negotiations with the club that would also commit the council to a full local consultation on the proposals before any final decision was made which should include the option to accept or reject the proposals. This wasn’t even responded to.\nAs the local county councillor I was disappointed that my call to the County Cabinet for a full local consultation didn’t seem to be endorsed. That would at least have given local residents some comfort that their views, both for and against the proposals, would be properly taken into account.\nThere was a reference to future engagement with stakeholders but it’s not clear who would undertake this and if it would be at a point where the local community would have a chance to say yes or no to the plans once they know what they are. With so many questions still left unanswered, we need a definite assurance that such a consultation will be part of the final decision process, otherwise we may find ourselves overtaken by circumstances as plans progress and positions become embedded”.\nWhilst I’m pleased to see the council took note of local concerns raised in last year’s country-wide engagement exercise, what is being proposed now is a rather different prospect and doesn’t completely deal with local views about having yet another significant development sited on some of Kidlington’s dwindling green spaces.\nIf we’re going to condone building on the green belt we need to ensure there is quantifiable local support for that. There are a range of views, as we saw at the meeting, and I want to make sure I’m fully representing the balance of local opinion, but until we ask the whole community we don’t know what that is.\nMy position as the local councillor for the area is that I have to support the majority view of the residents that will be affected by this development whatever they are. I don’t understand why there is a resistance from both the club and their fans as well as the council to asking local people directly what they think of this idea. There may be opposition, but there may equally be majority support for the plans. If so we can proceed on that basis knowing that the club would be welcomed by the village. Surely that would be a better outcome for all concerned, especially OUFC’s owners who I assume wouldn’t want to impose themselves on to a community that would resent them being there.\nI will continue to advocate for a full local consultation both internally within the council and with other local representatives, particularly the local MP Layla Moran.",

Elections after this one are most likely to be associated with the new Unitary Authority which will be formed in Oxfordshire, although currently exactly what form that will take is unclear.\nThe option preferred by the Greens is one of 2 unitaries formed from Cherwell District, West Oxfordshire District and The City Councils with a second one formed around South Oxon and the Vale plus West Berkshire. We feel that would keep decision making as local as possible as well as ensuring that councillors don’t become too remote from the people they represent. The County Council Cabinet recently voted to push forward their preferred option of one huge council across the whole of the County, while the City Council are proposing they form their own Unitary Council by absorbing areas around them such as Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke. I would certainly strongly oppose that, as, I believe, would most of the residents in those areas!\nThe outcome of all these options could largely be driven by those people elected to the County Council tomorrow, so not only is it important to vote because it may be your last opportunity, it’s also doubly important that you get a councillor who is going to represent your views on what your future council may look like.\nOf course my advice is to vote Green at least in areas where you already have a Green Councillor such as the two new Divisions in Kidlington which make up nearly 80% of the area I currently represent on the County Council. As I can’t be in 2 places at once I have decided to stand in the new East Division because I am involved in several ongoing issues there, Not least the proposed football stadium and the huge Oxford North development. But my fellow Green Councillor Fiona Mawson is standing in the other part, now called Kidlington West even though 2 thirds of it comprises Yarnton and Begbroke. As the only candidate in this election that actually lives in that new division, I’m hopeful that she will get a good reception from voters.\nto show Green and Conservative representation\nCurrently the whole of the Kidlington East area is represented by me as the County Councillor and by me, Fiona and Linda Ward as District councillors. I’d like to think we’ve done a good job of representing the everyone there, we all certainly work hard to achieve that, so I hope I will receive your support in the East whilst Fiona is elected to replace me in the West.\nIt’s a rather complicated scenario , especially given that the whole set up is likely to change in 2 or 3 years so neither of us are likely to see out a full term as County Councillors, but in the meantime it’s important that both areas keep consistent Green representation so that work I and Fiona have started on things like ensuring development proposals are beneficial to the area can continue into the next few years, along with our input into the re-shaping of local government over the next 2 years.\nHowever you vote (and I hope it will be Green) do make sure you vote. It may be the only chance you get to make a decision that affects you and your local community for the next few years.\nIf you need any further information from me or Fiona please let us know. We have knocked on a lot of doors over the past few months, so if we missed you we’d be happy to talk.",

I was only 79 votes short of that figure this time with a final result of 2607 votes, giving me 4.1% of the vote share.\nIn 2015, I received 4.6% with only a slightly higher number of votes, but the turnout was lower then. Sadly this left me about 500 votes short of keeping my deposit this time, which means the Green Party loses £500, but we did our best.\nOn a personal level I’m fairly happy with that result. It was more than double the last time I stood and represented a 2.2% increase in my vote share. That’s the best increase of all the Green Party candidates in Oxfordshire, so that’s nice to have. You have to look for the positives in these things!\nUnfortunately though, positives on a national level are thin on the ground. With a massive swing to the Tories representing such a shift in our national political landscape, I’m far more concerned about that than I am about my own result. This is something I’m still processing at the moment as I’m sure many others are. I have to say I’ve avoided news coverage of the election today as it is just too painful! Maybe sleep deprivation has played a big part in that as well!\nWhere we go from here is difficult to say. I think it’s fairly certain that Brexit will now happen, which I think we will mostly live to regret. The debate around the referendum has become so polarised now that I’m not sure anyone really knows how we got here. It’s become an argument about ‘honouring’ a vote that many people no longer really know the point of. From most of the coverage I’ve seen it’s become about who ‘won’ and who ‘lost’. It should never have been boiled down to such a simplistic argument. Especially as I think most of us will eventually be the losers from Brexit.\nThe “Get Brexit done” slogan is also an absurd reduction of the true impact of one of the most seismic shifts in our fortunes since the second world war. I still don’t think it’s something we should be treating so lightly. With so much new information available to us now compared to 2016, we should have had an opportunity to think again. Just ‘getting it over with’ really isn’t a logical motivation for carrying on with something that I think will be hugely damaging to this country and our economy. Especially as the poor and the disadvantaged will end up feeling the most pain, which makes it doubly frustrating when so many news reports seem to suggest it’s those very people who voted Tory in this election.\nThose of us on the remain side obviously haven’t made a strong enough case to those who seem so eager to jump into the abyss. Boris Johnson’s lies will, I believe, show themselves to be exactly that when we finally push the button on Brexit. Sadly it will be too late then to say I told you so to all those who think this will be a positive move.\nThe climate debate was for me equally as important as Brexit and bound up in the same argument. This also applies to the other burning issues in the UK at the moment, including the NHS and public services. I believe we will spend the next 10 years wasting parliamentary time dealing with the intricacies of extricating ourselves from the EU and negotiating disadvantageous deals with countries like the USA, when we should be dealing with the existential threat of climate change and the collapse of our health services.\nThe other issue exposed by the result is the desperate need for electoral reform. Westminster has still been carved up by the two main parties who need so few votes to get a seat in the big house. Whereas parties like the Greens with over 800,000 votes nationally only get on MP. That really doesn’t make sense and certainly explains why so many people think that voting is a pointless exercise. Moreover we need to have greater co-operation between parties to achieve electoral reform. I hope that the one positive that might come out of Labour’s terrible results might be that they will finally be open to talking to other parties about co-operating towards that end.\nBut I will do what I can to help deal with the worst damage that Brexit and climate change will inevitably do to our society both locally and globally, even though I fear that, with at least another 5 years of majority Conservative government ahead of us, that’s going to be a very difficult task.\nIt’s not one that I will shirk from though, and I will use my position as a local councillor to bring as much influence as I can to bear on what will no doubt be many more Tory excesses and attacks on the weakest in our society. With a Tory dominated District council in Cherwell it’s always an uphill struggle to ‘move the dial’ but that’s not a reason to give up and I won’t be doing that.\nFinally, an enormous thank you everyone who helped in my campaign and to everyone who contacted my directly, and through social media, to give me encouragement and support, and of course thank you for giving me your precious vote. I can assure you that I value it enormously and it was not wasted.\nFor reasons I’ve explained in another post, no vote you believe in is ever wasted, and in terms of the Green Party it will help us carry on campaigning and, most importantly now, hold the national and local government to account on the environment and climate change.\nThe fight continues!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_page_25/content_474.html": "After what seems like centuries of wrangling, planning applications, withdrawn projects, hand shaking and head banging, Oxford is finally set to join other cities with a giant shiny shopping centre nobody really needs any more.\nHaving experienced the damage that these behemoths can do to small local retailers, myself included, this is a moment I and many others have dreaded.\nThe council of course has applied a heavy spin on the whole project, whilst ushering the developers and large multi-nationals into the city with wide-eyed certainty that a new shopping centre will solve all the problems we now have.\nWe know at least one of those problems – that of affordable housing in the city centre – won’t even be dented by this grandiose project. In a move that is frankly baffling from a socialist led council, planners have dashed all hopes that the accommodation element designed into the revamped centre would be for social housing or affordable homes. Whilst Green councillors opposed this move, others apparently felt that poorer people won’t be able to keep the new apartments up to the standards they expect to be demanded.\nSo no comfortable inner-city pied-à-terres for the ordinary folk of Oxford then. Which is a shame considering Oxford City Council provided virtually nothing for that sector last year, despite claims that this was a priority policy.\nJobs are not the only thing to consider\nJudging by the analyses carried out over the past 10 years it looks highly likely that the new Westgate extension in Oxford will have a significant impact on other retail destinations both in the immediate vicinity and county wide.\nThe council has claimed that 3400 jobs will be created by the opening of the new centre, which seems like a rather optimistic number to me. Even if one accepts that figure, previous analyses have suggested that the number of jobs created will be far outweighed by those that will be destroyed elsewhere in the city and the surrounding areas.\nIt’s very easy to focus just on the number of jobs created, but when similar centres have opened there have been many casualties in other areas. This doesn’t even take into account the damage that’s likely to be done to trade during the building and infrastructure works and the impact of additional competition for small retailers that attracting large multi-nationals into the area will provide.\nIn an era where many retail chains are looking to reduce their portfolios, the time for this centre has been and gone. There’s already plenty of retail space in Oxford city centre, some of it lying vacant even now. Until the council addresses the systemic issues with people visiting the city, such as parking, local transport and city centre management, a revamped shopping centre isn’t going to add that much prosperity to a town encircled by much better alternatives.\nThe new shopping centre will likely have some novelty value for a few months, but once the realities of trading in Oxford begin to bite, I doubt it’ll be anything more than another usual-suspect clone-town brand zoo.\nYears of disruption\nAccording to a recent article in the Oxford Mail, a scrutinising committee of city centre councillors are due to meet to discuss ways of keeping businesses alive during the hugely disruptive infrastructure works needed for the new extension.\nSo Oxford City Council wait until AFTER the works have begun to think about how to mitigate the problems that will inevitably be caused by the works?\nAnother great example of the forethought and careful planning we’ve come to expect from our wonderful city council!\nI was at a meeting with both the city and county council leaders over a year ago where I highlighted the potential damage that will be done by the infrastructure works required for the Westgate extension. Having already experienced the same in Bristol a few years before, it was clear to me and many others that the likely upheaval required for the Westgate works were going to do more damage than they were likely to be worth in the current climate.\nSeems like it all fell on deaf ears. As usual.\nEmpty shops\nMy business in Cornmarket Street closed it’s doors for the last time after 20 years last year. Despite numerous pronouncements in the press that the city council was eager to support local businesses, we got zip-all support, even after asking on several occasions. Indeed, at one point their planning department were very close to scuppering the only deal we could achieve to sell the store. Had they not done a last minute U-turn there would have been one more empty and un-lettable shop in the city centre.\nCouncillors are also now apparently worried about the growing number of empty shops in the city, despite previous claims that there were queues of businesses eager to take space. Perhaps news has started to filter out that retailing in Oxford is not what it once was?\nIn that context one has to wonder who is going to populate the new cathedral of consumption when it is finally completed, and for those that do take up residence, what kind of trading environment will they find? With 40% of retail leases across the country coming up for renewal at the end of this year, it really does beg the question about how much space will be required when the Westgate centre is completed in 2017. Moreover what will the rest of the city look like once all the remaining viable stores have de-camped into the waiting warmth of a lovely new mall?\nWith council plans to push up the cost of parking YET AGAIN and the negative impact of roadworks, and the city centre looking like a building site, it’s likely most consumers will continue to go elsewhere to shop, surrounded as we are by much more attractive and easily reached locations around the city and the county. And once again, experience tells me that once people find better alternatives, they’re unlikely to return, other than for a quick nose around the new development.\nA committee composed of councillors with absolutely no idea how businesses in Oxford operate, setting out to ‘examine’ how to deal with these issues now, is tantamount to closing the door after the horse has bolted, lived out it’s natural life and ended up in a dog food tin. This project as has been in the planning stages for so many years it’s truly staggering that the implications are only being discussed now.\nOxford is of course known as the city of ‘dreaming spires’. It seems that in terms of strategic planning, many of our councillors have also been asleep on the job.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_housing/content_238.html": "I have been very vocal on the subject of building on our green belt. Cherwell District Council held a partial review of its local plan which included a massive amount of building in south Cherwell almost exclusively on green belt land. These plans were approved by the council in 2019, despite massive local opposition and repeat attempts by me and other councillors to rethink the flawed polices that lay behind them.\nWhilst I agree that we need more housing in Cherwell, I think that housing should be for the people of Cherwell and it should be genuinely affordable. The Partial Review is pushing to build an extra 4400 houses in Cherwell to meet the needs of Oxford City, even though those needs defined in the City’s local plan are widely viewed as overstated.\nWe have ample space on brown field sites to accommodate that need, and the Labour run city council has time and again ring-fenced those sites for more economic development, rather than prioritising the housing needs of its own people.\nThe Green Party wants to see housing needs met, but with the right houses in the right places. We don’t want to see our green spaces gobbled up by greedy developers looking to build luxury houses on expensive land that will never be truly affordable to the local population. These developments are being driven by quangos like the Local Enterprise Partnership which are all dominated by vested interests.\nGreen belt areas are not just pretty landscapes, they are also vital places that help the planet deal with the emissions being created by growth elsewhere. Concreting them over and siting more roads and more housing on the space where trees and grass once grew not only removes the capacity of those areas to lock up carbon, it also increases emissions, worsens local air quality and increases the likelihood of flooding which is becoming ever more prevalent due to climate change.\nI will continue to fight for more genuinely affordable housing, built to high environmental standards and accessible to the local people and their families who really need it. But I will resist that being done on our precious green spaces unless there is a real and demonstrable need.\nWe need a huge increase in building affordable houses – both to buy and to rent. Conservative and Labour governments have an appalling record regarding housing, with denying local government the ability to build social housing to rent and preventing the building of private homes.\nThe current definition of housing affordability is houses for sale at 80% of the current market value. In Oxfordshire this is a ludicrous proposition, putting houses well out of the reach of anyone on an average salary. It’s time that this calculation was revised. My personal preference would be to reduce it to 50% of market value, but I doubt very much if that would be supported by property developers or the local politicians that hand them the projects to build much needed housing.\nThe policy of Help to Buy has already led to increases in house prices without increasing the supply and new schemes such as shared ownership are condemning people to paying rent as well as mortgage interest on a house they may never fully own. The Conservatives have re-inflated the housing bubble that led to the crash of 2008. Once again using house price inflation and debt to show a false upturn in the economy.\nThe Green Party would resume direct investment in council and other social housing and allow councils to use receipts from sales to fund affordable accommodation. We would also build thousands of new social rented homes renewing the supply of council housing and affordable rented homes that has been devastated by decades of right to buy sell-offs. We would also ensure that housing is built to serve local needs rather than as dormitories for London commuters or as investment opportunities for large scale buy to let landlords.\nWe need to have a realistic conversation about the future of housing in Britain with an acceptance that the idea of owning their won home may be a very dim and distant dream for most first time buyers. Faced with that situation, we need to focus much more on making the private rental sector much fairer and more affordable. We also need to build more council housing and create a national building project where local finance can support the costs of building homes rather than lining the pockets of private developers.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2021_05_04_our-green-spaces-are-worth-fighting-for/content_228.html": "I’ve spoken to hundreds of people during this short election campaign and probably the most important issue on most people’s minds right now is the threat to our local green belt.\nI made a video about it last week which has received quite a bit of attention since it was released. You can watch it here.\nOf course in Yarnton, Begbroke and Gosford (where I’m standing to become the new local County Councillor) it’s in the forefront of everyone’s minds because, if it goes ahead, we’ll be the ones living in the middle of a building site for possibly the next 10 years. We’ll also see our small rural communities destroyed and replaced with a single medium sized town, one that will probably also double up as a university campus for the Begbroke Science Park.\nBut even in Kidlington, (which comprises a large part of the County division) it’s going to have a huge impact. There may not be as many houses built in the area, but the additional strain on our local resources, such as health services, education and leisure facilities will be very detrimental. We’ll also see a noticeable reduction in air quality which is likely to have health impacts on the most vulnerable, as well as increased risks of flooding. The A44 will probably become a car park during busy times, giving us all the chance to sit and admire the 4 storey apartment blocks that will tower over the edge of the dual carriageway.\nThere’s also a good chance that Kidlington will finally lose the argument about hanging on to it’s status as a village. In 10 years time, when the population has possibly tripled, there’s likely to be a much greater push to establish the whole area as a suburb of a Greater Oxford City. Not a prospect I, or anyone else in the area, relishes but something we may have little choice over.\nI for one won’t stop fighting for that until the last blade of grass has fallen under the bulldozer’s tracks.\nAll this might be acceptable to a greater degree if these houses were going to provide affordable accommodation for local families, many of whom are crammed into a single house with perhaps 3 generations under one roof. But these aren’t for the likes of them. These will be expensive luxury executive houses built for investment purposes, with the so-called ‘affordable’ houses reserved for people in Oxford City. The District Council saw to that when they handed control of those houses over to the City Council in a closed meeting at the beginning of the first lockdown. None of these houses will be within reach of local residents.\nA lot of people have told me that all this is inevitable and that the 4400 houses are a ‘done deal’. Well that isn’t the case until we know the outcome of the legal challenge being brought to the high court next month. Until that’s over we have no idea if these proposals will stand up or collapse. There have been reports in other areas recently where challenges have been upheld, and if we get the same result Cherwell District Council will have to think again. In those circumstances we’ll need as much support on the District Council as possible which is why I’m supporting Fiona Mawson to become our second Green Party Councillor on CDC.\nBut even if we fail to stop these devastating plans though the courts, we can at least do our best to limit some of that devastation by having engaged and active councillors at all levels of local government. On the County Council fighting for infrastructure and other important considerations like flood protection, and of course at District and Parish level scrutinising the individual planning proposals themselves. We also have to be vigilant in opposing ‘infilling’ which may become more of an issue as the amount of development space in the area is snapped up by the bigger developers.\nSo I hope I and Fiona can count on the support of our local residents in the elections on Thursday. We’ve seen how our current crop of Conservative councillors have let us down on these issues, and let’s not forget that this whole idea was the brainchild of the Conservatives on Cherwell District Council in the first place, in cahoots with Oxford University, the City Council, the Oxfordshire Growth Board and the Local Enterprise Partnership. After Thursday we may have more leverage to defend our small rural communities against these faceless, unelected and anti-democratic quangos and take back control of our green heritage.\nI for one won’t stop fighting for that until the last blade of grass has fallen under the bulldozer’s tracks. I hope you’ll all support me as your Green Councillor in that long battle.",

Elections after this one are most likely to be associated with the new Unitary Authority which will be formed in Oxfordshire, although currently exactly what form that will take is unclear.\nThe option preferred by the Greens is one of 2 unitaries formed from Cherwell District, West Oxfordshire District and The City Councils with a second one formed around South Oxon and the Vale plus West Berkshire. We feel that would keep decision making as local as possible as well as ensuring that councillors don’t become too remote from the people they represent. The County Council Cabinet recently voted to push forward their preferred option of one huge council across the whole of the County, while the City Council are proposing they form their own Unitary Council by absorbing areas around them such as Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke. I would certainly strongly oppose that, as, I believe, would most of the residents in those areas!\nThe outcome of all these options could largely be driven by those people elected to the County Council tomorrow, so not only is it important to vote because it may be your last opportunity, it’s also doubly important that you get a councillor who is going to represent your views on what your future council may look like.\nOf course my advice is to vote Green at least in areas where you already have a Green Councillor such as the two new Divisions in Kidlington which make up nearly 80% of the area I currently represent on the County Council. As I can’t be in 2 places at once I have decided to stand in the new East Division because I am involved in several ongoing issues there, Not least the proposed football stadium and the huge Oxford North development. But my fellow Green Councillor Fiona Mawson is standing in the other part, now called Kidlington West even though 2 thirds of it comprises Yarnton and Begbroke. As the only candidate in this election that actually lives in that new division, I’m hopeful that she will get a good reception from voters.\nto show Green and Conservative representation\nCurrently the whole of the Kidlington East area is represented by me as the County Councillor and by me, Fiona and Linda Ward as District councillors. I’d like to think we’ve done a good job of representing the everyone there, we all certainly work hard to achieve that, so I hope I will receive your support in the East whilst Fiona is elected to replace me in the West.\nIt’s a rather complicated scenario , especially given that the whole set up is likely to change in 2 or 3 years so neither of us are likely to see out a full term as County Councillors, but in the meantime it’s important that both areas keep consistent Green representation so that work I and Fiona have started on things like ensuring development proposals are beneficial to the area can continue into the next few years, along with our input into the re-shaping of local government over the next 2 years.\nHowever you vote (and I hope it will be Green) do make sure you vote. It may be the only chance you get to make a decision that affects you and your local community for the next few years.\nIf you need any further information from me or Fiona please let us know. We have knocked on a lot of doors over the past few months, so if we missed you we’d be happy to talk.",

It was a worrying time for all of us and as a new County Councillor I had to quickly come to terms with my new responsibilities whilst navigating remote meetings and all the various limitations that were placed on all of us in our day to day lives. I know people who were personally affected by the virus and some that still are. Thankfully I and most of my family came out unscathed, although I did lose a close family member to the virus who I still miss today.\nCovid now seems like a distant memory as we all deal with other issues, not least the cost of living crisis, the ongoing lack of affordable housing and the pressures on our health service. We are also about to see seismic changes in the way local government operates which means that this is likely to be the last County Council election in Oxfordshire.\nWe also have boundary changes to the County Council which sees my current division of Kidlington South split into 2 new divisions – Kidlington East and Kidlington West. This left me with a dilemma about which division to stand in for this election. Ultimately I chose Kidlington East which includes most of the area that is also covered by my District Council Ward. I’ve dealt with a lot of casework in this part of my current division and there are still a number of ongoing issues so I feel I have to try to maintain some contiunity there.\nWe do also have a strong Green candidate in Kidlington West though, which includes Yarnton and Begbroke as well as Roundham ward in Kidlington. My wife and fellow councillor District and Parish Councillor Fiona Mawson is standing there and I hope she will be able to provide some continuity of representation there, as well as building on her 10 years experience as a Yarnton Parish Councillor where she is currently the Deputy Chair.\nOver the next 2-3 years there will also be a further reorganisation of local government which will see a single authority combining the remits of both the District and the County Council. The details of how this will be achieved are still being hammered out but there are concerns that moving to a larger, more remote authority could reduce local engagement.\nThere are also moves being made by the City Council to expand their borders to swallow up areas like Kidlington, Gosford, Yarnton and Begbroke into one larger authority. I don’t think that’s what local residents want. Neither do I think it will be in their best interests. So I will be fighting to maintain the integrity of all our local villages to prevent us becoming just a suburb of Oxford city.\nOn top of this we have to deal with the creation of a new local plan amidst sweeping changes to the planning process which could also see a significant erosion of local democracy. This is likely to lead to even more erosion of our surrounding green spaces, especially if the City Council get their way.\nSo it’s clear that, during the next few years, we will need strong voices at all levels of local government in Oxfordshire to ensure we end up with a workable model that truly represents local residents and responds to their needs. I would like to continue to be that voice for Kidlington East\nWhilst I hope we won’t be facing anything on the scale of Covid again for a very long time, there could be other equally disruptive events on the world stage coming our way. We are now seeing the impacts of climate change on our communities with increased incidents of flooding which has brought misery to many residents. I’m working hard to try to reduce the impact of that and we’ve seen new measures introduced locally to support residents faced with the threat of flooding. I am continuing to push for more.\nSo I hope you will choose to support me again in the County Elections on May 1st to work for you as probably your last county councillor before the changes are made to local government structures. I still feel there’s work to be done in the division, not least in the face of some of the new developments that over the next few years that could have significant impacts on all our lives along with the challenges posed by national government and global events.\nI’m trying to get round to meet as many people on the doorstep as possible, but with all the changes going on at the moment, it’s a huge task. If you’d like me to come and see you to discuss any local issues please contact me and I’ll try to arrange something. Otherwise feel free to email, message or call me.",

Indeed in Oxfordshire as a whole we retained 4 out of 6 deposits and showed voter shares up to 9.2% and in one local result we actually came second! Well done to Jenny Tamblyn!\nIn Banbury itself we knew we were never going to win, but we largely achieved the goal we had set ourselves of raising our profile in the constituency and showing people that the Green Party is the rightful repository of support from anyone concerned about real social justice and progressive politics.\nNationally, The Green Party has seen over a million people demonstrating that voting for what you believe in is never a waste of time. Our share of the vote was nearly 4 times what it was in 2010 and our membership increased by nearly 2000 in the two days after the election. In Oxfordshire we’ve had 56 new members in the last 2 days!\nWe now need to build on that support and engage more than ever with a local and national dialogue about how we want to see our society shaped for the future. The Greens have always been a party with long term vision and I think, as the next 5 years unfold, that vision is going to be needed more than ever.\nIn the meantime I’d like to thank all the Green supporters in the constituency that voted for me, and those who campaigned for me, put up posters, leafleted, knocked on doors and stood in the street with me. You’re some of the unsung heroes of this campaign and you should be rightly proud of your achievement.\nMy gratitude of course also goes out to my dedicated campaign team and members of The Banbury and Cherwell Green Party branch. In particular my agent and campaign manager John Haywood, researcher and adviser Colin Clark, our Chairman Chris Manley, the irrepressible Lisa Miller for her exertions on Facebook, and all those others too numerous to mention who have worked so hard over the last 5 years to get us where we are now.\nA special thank you goes to our press officer and my partner Fiona Mawson, who’s practical and emotional support was invaluable to me throughout the campaign, even though she beat me in the local elections!\nAfter the result of the general election we now more than ever need to see a continuation of the Green surge to offer the people of Britain an alternative to the Conservative agenda of austerity and cuts and the holding of the poor and vulnerable to ransom to pay for the lifestyles of the rich and privileged.\nMoreover we need to re-double our efforts to protect our cherished NHS from the clutches of private healthcare providers that will now be given a free reign by a government ideologically opposed to free and comprehensive state health provision.\nI’ll remain as our Prospective Parliamentary Candidate (PPC) for the foreseeable future, unless my circumstances change or the local branch decide they want or need someone new. So I’ll be keeping this website up and running as a place for me to drop the occasional post about local, national and global Green issues. I hope people will choose to engage with me on them during that time.\nIf you’d like to read more I have two other blogs you might like to follow.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_news_page_2/content_305.html": "So the day is finally here. The chance to vote to end 14 years of Tory misrule and see change. But is it really?\nTwo parties are saying they would provide change, but only one is offering REAL change and REAL hope – The Green Party.\nThe Labour Party slogan ‘Change’ is so reductive and self fulfilling it’s almost worthless as an electoral ambition. Will Labour provide change? Well yes, if they’re elected as the majority government we will see a change by definition. Where there was once Rishi Sunak, there will be Keir Starmer. A clear change of leader and administration, but is that all we want? Will we see REAL change? I rather doubt it.\nLabour’s manifesto suggests otherwise with so many policies seemingly just a continuation of what we have with the Tories. Things like the Bedroom Tax, The Two Child Benefit cap, a continuation of the oil and gas drilling licences granted by the Conservatives, including the highly questionable Rosebank. None of that will change and neither will things like private provision in the NHS or a really progressive tax regime.\nSo what real change will we see with Labour, or any of the other parties for that matter? It looks like the only thing that will be changing will be the climate!\nEven the Liberal Democrats haven’t really committed to change on important things like tax reform or tuition fees which of course they were instrumental in bringing in. Their candidate in Bicester & Woodstock is a well meaning guy, but he was also an adviser to the coalition government during the first period of austerity, as was the Conservative candidate, so not much change for the better there!\nCan I win in Bicester and Woodstock? That depends on you, the voters. It’s a circular argument that Greens can’t win so we don’t get votes, but if we don’t get votes we can’t win. But even if I don’t win my purpose is still to raise more awareness of the Green Party and our values. A party I’ve supported for 12 years and voted for for even longer, back when they were even more unlikely to be elected. Since then there’s been a huge surge in support for Greens, something I’ve seen first hand after being elected to 5 different councils as a Green and re-elected to one of those since.\nIf the Green Party didn’t exist and people hadn’t voted for them, do you think the other parties would have taken any notice of climate change or other Green issues? I very much doubt it and that’s even more obvious now that parties like Labour and the Conservatives are backing away from their climate change commitments because to stick by them is electorally inconvenient.\nSo the Greens have brought about real change over the past decade and will continue to push for more in the coming years, especially as we are looking set to at least triple our representation in Westminster. Change on things like the NHS, social care, social security, justice, equal rights, animal welfare, nature recovery, climate change and so much more.\nI’d of course love to be one of those parliamentarians helping to make those changes, as our new MPs will do through careful lobbying and internal pressure on whomever is in power by the end of this week. But I know that’s unlikely. But every vote for me and every other Green candidate still counts. It counts as part of the message the whole country needs to send to Westminster, even more so as the ruling party is likely to have a majority so large that they probably won’t be in the mood to listen to anyone else.\nBut I have faith that Greens will always find a way to move the needle and work for positive change. And I’ll continue to do that whatever happens in the polls on Thursday. I’m content to play a role, no matter how small in helping to make the future a brighter place for the next generation. Your vote can help me and every other Green candidate to do that, so I hope you’ll give that thought some serious consideration when you mark that cross on the ballot sheet.\nThe polls suggest that the outcome to this election is a foregone conclusion. Labour will comfortably win a huge majority and in Bicester & Woodstock the Lib Dems will romp home. If nothing else people will vote for them just to stop them sending any more leaflets! So you can safely vote Green, knowing it’s extremely unlikely to change that outcome.\nSo more than ever in this election you can vote with your heart to make real change happen. Change that means more than a different name on the House of Commons letterhead. Otherwise we’ll be right back here in 5 or 10 years time, probably with the Conservatives promising the change that we never really seem to get.\nAs someone else said during this election “If you want change you have to vote for it”. If you want REAL change you have to vote Green!",

You can find and comment on the original here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/eu-referendum-immigration_b_9322718.html\nSo here it is. After years of campaigning and complaining, manoeuvring and cajoling, half-truths and good old fashioned British pig-headedness, the moaning masses of middle England have finally got their referendum.\nI say ‘their’ referendum because this isn’t being staged at great expense for those of us who want to stay part of Europe. It’s not even for those who don’t really give a toss either way.\nIt’s certainly not for those more outward looking souls, who appreciate the many advantages of being a member of the European club. The easy movement between states (yes that does apply to us as well as all those annoying refugees and migrants) and the free transport of goods. Funding for urban and industrial renewal. Numerous environmental improvements to beaches, rivers and the countryside, including controls on things like GMOs. Human rights, animal rights, consumer rights. Cheaper phone charges and easier and cheaper travel and currency exchange. Social welfare protection and labour rights, and a panoply of other advantages that most people take for granted and will miss when they’re gone.\nNo, it’s a referendum for misguided and ill-informed little-Englanders, draped in Union flags, firm in the belief of two world wars and one world cup and certain the word ‘Great’ attached to Britain means something other than the first letter on a sticker they slap on the back of their booze cruise charabang, just to remind those envious foreigners that they were unlucky enough to be born on inferior soil.\nBut moreover, it’s a referendum for politicians who have been looking at continental Europe down the wrong end of the telescope for so long now, they just don’t realise how small this country has become on the world stage. A myopic concern about how much money we pay to Europe and a studied ignorance of the huge returns our EU membership generates.\nMost people who focus on our payment to Brussels like to remind us what else we could do with that money. Yet with a growing national debt, and stubbornly high deficit, any such savings would likely fall into the same black hole as most of the rest of our national finances. Either that or it would go towards servicing the country’s circa £50bn annual interest payments, paid in large part to European banks anyway.\nIt’s not 1975. The geo-political landscape has changed around us since the last time we decided if we wanted to be a part of Europe. Yes, back in the swinging 70s it was the ‘Common Market’, but by necessity and common interest it’s become more than that. Those advocating some kind of return to a simple trading relationship are ignoring both the reality of our reduced place in the world and the promiscuity of world markets.\nNeither is it 1938, even though Cameron’s Chamberlain moment was equally as hollow. Just like his pre-war counterpart, the agreement he reached in Brussels was peripheral and disposable, focussing as it did on the false polemic of immigration and border control.\nIt was a pantomime, with Donald Tusk and Angela Merkel as the ugly sisters to Cameron’s Cinderella. Shouts of “they’re behind you” were evident from the likes of UKIP and Front National pointing to the ‘hordes’ or ‘swarms’ or ‘bunches’ of ‘migrants’, ‘refugees’ or ‘immigrants’, depending on which description David Cameron and the BBC have alighted on this week.\nI totally agree that EU democratic and regulatory processes are in desperate need of reform, but these weren’t the points that Cameron argued. Driven by domestic pressures, piled on by a widening xenophobic rhetoric, he was pushed into a rushed and ill-conceived round of negotiations that resulted in him metaphorically claiming ‘peace in our time’ outside Number 10. It was a performance put on to give him a platform to launch the referendum that we all knew was coming, and the critic’s reviews weren’t great.\nSadly for him, us, and the rest of Europe, this was a missed opportunity that could have sparked a trans-national debate about the real future of the EU and brought about radical changes to shape it into something more even-handed and responsive to the needs of all member states.\nBut instead, Cameron wasted what could have been his real place in history for the sake of a thumbs up from the likes of Farage, Gove and Galloway whilst gaining little tangible return for the UK, save for some token restrictions on benefit payments to migrants who rarely claim them anyway.\nIn fact it’s recently been revealed that the UK government has no idea how much immigration costs us, nor how much migrants contribute to our economy. But let’s not let a little thing like lack of facts get in the way of a nicely staked out scapegoat.\nAnd while we’re on the subject of discrimination, we mustn’t forget those hard-pressed city bankers quaking in their handmade brogues, terrified that they may be penalised for being outside the Eurozone. That of course, amid the posturing about immigration, was the main concern for Cameron and his paymasters. Essentially he was in Brussels to fight for the right to discriminate against the poor whilst protecting the interests of the obscenely rich, although of course that wasn’t so eagerly reported.\nAnd there we have it. The crux of all this political, psychological and media-spun mendacity – Corporate interest. Insular businesses seeking to rid themselves of the European interference and regulation that keeps all the rest of us safer and better looked after. The refugee and migrant crises couldn’t have come at a better time for these vested interests to galvanise public opinion in favour of an out vote.\nOn this flimsiest of pretexts, and on evidence largely pulled out UKIP’s collective backside, we’re potentially going to launch ourselves into one of the biggest national disasters for several generations. The ‘Brexit’ silo mentality that is about as relevant in today’s globally connected society as statutes recorded on vellum.\nOne of the greatest achievements and advantages of the EU is freedom of movement between states. It’s a harbinger of a future globalised socio-economic system where borders and statehood will be irrelevant. One where the term ‘economic-migrant’ will no longer be a thinly veiled insult, just as it wasn’t when we and other nations economically migrated across the globe centuries ago, annexing and occupying entire countries as we went. In that context, and in view of the Tories much vaunted ‘on your bike’ ethos, I find it perplexing that we now seem to regard our attraction as place of opportunity as a bad thing.\nAnd while we’re on that subject, if I were a British migrant living on the continent I’d be feeling distinctly uncomfortable right now. Especially those who have lived there for longer than 15 years and are inexplicably denied the right to vote in a referendum that may well decide their future.\nThose whistling tunes in the dark about independent trade agreements with Europe and other global partners will soon find that our status as the 5th richest nation in the world is built on foundations largely stamped with a CE logo. Already Sterling has plummeted on the news that Boris is heading for the lifeboats.\nMuch of our apparent wealth is generated by the financial sector and supported by our membership of the EU. Who will want to trade with us as a small individual nation with a growing national debt and a dwindling economic base? No wonder the city was such a key part of Cameron’s negotiations.\nThe finance sector is pretty much all we have left. We don’t have anything else to trade. China and the USA know this and have already warned us that a UK outside the EU will be of much less interest to them. The US in particular sees our connection with Europe as a valuable conduit into EU financial markets.\nUncoupling ourselves from the EU will be a long, painful and essentially irreversible process. We won’t wake up one day and see bluebirds over the white cliffs and a land of milk and honey for all. It will take years of debate, legal dispute and the unpicking of labyrinthine systems of regulation woven into our own statutory frameworks. A drawn out and retrograde process, during which I believe we’ll slowly come to see the folly of our ways.\nAnd once we’ve closed our borders and thumbed our noses at one of the biggest trading blocs on the planet, it will be too late to realise that we’re now more of a Pekinese than a bulldog. An isle not so much sceptred as septic, poisoned by our own arrogance and bigotry, left entirely at the mercy of a broken political system where wealth goes one way, and protection is only there for those who can afford it.\nAs Britain shrivels into, at best, a tawdry tax haven in perpetual serfdom to a rich elite, we’ll come to the sad realisation that we’ve been sold a Jerusalem built on false promises and false flags. I wonder if border controls and apocryphal straight bananas will seem quite so important then.",

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2019_07/content_54.html": "At last week’s full council meeting of Cherwell District Council, councillors unanimously passed a climate change emergency motion calling on leader Barry Wood to report back to the council in six months on progress made on several environmental objectives for Cherwell.\nAs Cherwell’s only Green councillor I supported the motion with some reservations about the council’s true commitment to the difficult decisions that will need to be taken if the district is going to become truly carbon neutral by 2030.\nAs if to prove that point the council then went on to debate my motion calling for a rethink on plans to build on green belt in south Cherwell.\nThe motion, seconded by Libdem councillor Conrad Copeland, asked for a temporary pause to allow for new evidence to be taken into account that casts doubt on the number of houses needed to support Oxford’s unmet need – the justification for Cherwell’s partial review of its local plan.\nI also raised concerns about the amount of expansion being tacitly agreed to for the Begbroke Science Park that also encompasses large areas of Yarnton. In my opinion, this has been slipped into the review under false pretences, given that this has nothing to do with housing need in Oxford. As a result there’s mounting local criticism of the university’s ambitions to commandeer at least 1000 of the houses intended to meet Oxford’s needs for its own use as part of a new campus at Begbroke and Yarnton.\nChair of the Cherwell Development Watch Alliance, Giles Lewis, spoke in favour of the motion at the packed meeting and read out emails between the council and the university, obtained under and FOI request, that suggested plans to allow the university to expand in the area were already being supported as long ago as 2016.\nThe Labour group on the council then introduced an amendment which blocked any re-consideration of housing need numbers, even though this might mean more houses that were needed would be built on green belt.\nI pointed out that just to offset the amount of carbon produced in building the unaffordable and unneeded houses in the first place would take 572,000 trees over 10 years, or 200 per house, rather than the 1 tree per building that Cllr Wood had suggested during his address on the climate change emergency motion.\nIt’s clear that neither Labour nor the Conservatives are prepared to take the difficult decisions that are needed to combat the climate emergency. Labour were far more concerned not to be seen to be challenging inflated housing need figures proposed by their colleagues on the city council, whist the Conservatives simply want to be facilitators for large wealthy landowners in the area including the university. The location of the housing clearly has more to do with the university’s ambitions than it does with genuine housing allocation priorities. Either way it ends up with unnecessary and unaffordable housing being built that locals will have no access to on the green spaces at the heart of their community. This is a stitch-up perpetrated on the people of south Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Gosford!\nLibdem Councillor and spokesperson for the Progressive Oxfordshire group, Katherine Tyson said “These plans will simply expand the city’s appalling air quality into our rural community. At one point Labour councillor and vice-chairperson of the council Hannah Banfield seemed to suggest that, as Banbury residents had accepted bad air quality as a result of housing development in their area, the people of south Cherwell should just do the same. The argument that one ward coming to peace with poisoning their residents and children doesn’t mean that another ward should also poison their constituents. That’s not good enough for Cherwell residents. It beggars belief that such a comment could be made from a Labour councillor just after we had voted in favour of a climate change emergency motion”\nThe motion to pause the local review pending the outcome of the examination of the city council local plan and to separately consult on the university’s plans in Begbroke and Yarnton was successfully amended by the Labour group to an undertaking to review the allocation sites for the 4400 houses. It was carried by Labour with Conservatives abstaining on the vote. The subsequent motion was defeated by 16 votes to 23.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_cherwell-district-council_page_6/content_408.html": "As I said in the recent election debate on the BBC, in my opinion they shouldn’t.\nThere are many reasons it’s a bad idea, both from a business perspective and as part of local spending priorities.\nI’ve worked in retail nearly all my life. I built and ran a national chain of jewellery stores across the country and traded in several shopping centres, including some of the most prestigious in the country such as Bluewater in Kent and the new Bullring Centre in Birmingham. I write a regular column for Retail week Magazine and comment regularly in the national press on retail issues as well as offering consultancy services. One of my main focusses is independent retail and commercial property. So I know a little bit about what I’m talking about.\nCherwell District Council (CDC) leader Barry Wood claims that buying the Castle Quay Shopping Centre in Banbury is a good deal for the people of Cherwell. This decision was also backed by the Labour group on the council and their leader Sean Woodcock has assured me there’s a good business case for doing it. Unfortunately neither of them have been able to show it to me so far.\nTheir belief is that buying a commercial property like a shopping centre is a good idea as property will always rise in value. This may be the case for domestic property and some kinds of commercial premises, but not always with retail space.\nA Good Investment?\nThe argument for buying the scheme seems to be that if they hadn’t, the centre would have shut down. It has many long term empty units and is generally struggling to compete in an ever crowded marketplace. The council’s decision a few years ago to allow a new shopping park to open on the outskirts of Banbury haven’t helped its plight.\nIt’s extremely unlikely though that it would have closed down. Much more likely that it would have been offloaded by its pension investment owners to another investment company with more experience of running a shopping centre than some local councillors.\nMoreover, if the argument is that the centre was about to collapse, that doesn’t exactly make it an attractive investment for public money does it?\nThere have been some shopping centre failures in the past, but they are few and far between. But when they do go, they tend to go completely. That means an almost total loss for anyone unlucky enough to be the owner at the time. There will be some residual value in the land, but that’s unlikely to reflect the full price paid for the whole development.\nThere have been a growing number of retail failures in recent years with 650 collapses so far this year alone, and we’re not even half way through yet! Some of them very high profile and heavily leveraged operations. Others are busy negotiating partial closures and rent reductions with their landlords. Others are moving more into the online arena and abandoning physical retail space almost altogether.\nNone of this bodes well for an under-let, under-invested and down at heel shopping centre in a struggling town in North Oxfordshire.\nSo essentially CDC are gambling with public money against the odds. And it doesn’t end there.\nOther Costs\nAccording to Barry Wood the scheme is turning a profit at the moment, but as I’ve said previously, I’ve not seen evidence of that. I have seen a large number of long term voids in the centre, and with the potential for these to increase in number I fear the profitability may be marginal or likely to decline.\nThere will also be ongoing running costs for the centre and presumably additional investment to do whatever it is with the place that they feel will revitalise it. Again details on that are sketchy, but I think there’s some talk about dividing the larger units into smaller ones to attract independent retailers. Whilst I support that idea to some extent there are a lot of things to consider about that course of action.\nFirstly the cost of doing the work, which may include major re-modelling of the units due to, amongst other things, fire regulations. I’ve seen at least one shopping centre management come unstuck with similar plans due to rules on access to fire exit routes.\nHelping Smaller Retailers?\nSecondly smaller independents usually don’t have a huge budget for shopfitting, so there will be additional cost in partially fitting out the units, including new shopfronts etc to attract smaller operators and to ensure that their stores fit in with a modern shopping centre scheme.\nBusiness Rates\nThirdly there’s the loss of business rates on the empty units that are there now, and will most likely be there for a while. Considering the current climate in retail there’s also a good chance that voids could increase. At the moment the landlords will be paying rates on those premises even though they’re empty and a good deal of that money goes to CDC. With the council now being the landlords, they’re going to be paying the rates to themselves, effectively wiping out that income.\nDevaluation of the Asset\nFinally there’s the issue of valuation. Shopping developments are broadly valued on their rental potential. This is why landlords will leave units empty rather than let them out at a reduced rent. If the council’s plan is to lower the rent for smaller or other retailers, that will have a knock on effect on the value of those units and then on others when rent reviews come around. Other tenants now paying a higher rent will also push for a reduction when their leases come up for renewal or rent reviews are due or maybe even before.\nThe net effect of this would be to push down rents, not only in the centre but across the town, reducing loan to asset values across the board. In broad terms I’d welcome that. I’ve long argued that retail property values are hugely inflated. But in terms of the Council’s investment exposure in Castle Quay it’s a potentially dangerous situation, not only leading to a potential devaluation of the asset, but also any loans secured on it being partially called in.\nThere may be some balancing in terms of appreciation on the total asset value, but in the current climate and in a falling retail market, there a very good chance that the overall value of the scheme will fall relative to the amount the council has sunk into it, both as an initial investment and any further day to day expenditure.\nAll of this appears to have passed Cherwell Councillors and the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives by. They obviously have a very patchy understanding of how retail property works and the implications and pitfalls they are letting us all as council tax payers in for.\nMoreover there’s the question of if so much money should be focussed in the north of the district while ignoring other areas. Mr Wood commented in the Radio debate on Wednesday that he recognised that there were empty units in Pioneer Square in Bicester and that it was difficult to get them filled. Yet this doesn’t seem to have concerned him over the purchase of Castle Quay. Indeed, having set the precedent in Banbury I asked him during the debate if the council intended to buy Pioneer Square as well. He didn’t reply.\nOther Options\nA more sensible and prudent approach to the problems in both areas would be to work with the landlords rather than bailing them out with public money. Leave them with the risk whilst introducing local initiatives that help smaller retailers get a foothold and would also support the centre.\nThese could include rates reductions, which Barry Wood dismissed out of hand when I challenged him on it during the election debate. Neither he nor Sean Woodcock appeared to know that it has been within the gift of local councils to reduce rates on specific properties at their discretion for several years now.\nIf they wanted to provide smaller, more affordable space for independent retailers, they could lease units from the centres on a medium to long term basis, probably negotiating favourable terms with the landlords as a council will have a very good covenant. These could then be divided up (if required) and then sublet on flexible terms on reduced rents to retailers, although this would have to be agreed beforehand with the landlord for the same reasons discussed above concerning rental levels and valuations.\nThis would achieve the same aim of revitalising schemes both in Banbury and Bicester and would not involve the council in risking large amounts of public money. It would also mean that the bulk of the £60m they are now tying up in one area could be spread across the district.\nThis is the kind of strategic thinking we need, rather that the amateurish speculation of a council who seems to want to play at being shopkeepers with our money. This is why we need a more diverse representation on the council and councillors like me who will challenge these misguided moves before millions of pounds of desperately needed council funds are put at risk.",

This one should be NHS – NHS – NHS.\nThe road to privatisation of the NHS has been a long one and began under the Conservatives in 1992 with the Private Finance Initiative. It’s a neat trick that enables huge amounts of debt to be moved off the national balance sheet whilst still expanding operational infrastructure.\nNew Labour saw it as something too good to be true, as it allowed them to build new hospitals, without borrowing more money or raising taxes. But like most things that seem too good to be true, it was. By the end of their tenure Labour had saddled the NHS with £80Bn in repayments on total capital assets worth around £11Bn, and we’re still paying for it now.\nThen along came the Conservatives again who just love to privatise things. Every time they’ve been in government they’ve privatised something. The trains, electricity, gas, BT, the post office – which they practically gave away.\nBut the Tories have a problem when it comes to the NHS. They can’t flat out privatise it, because that’s politically toxic.\nSo in 2012 – The year that Danny Boyle showed us in his spectacular Olympic opening ceremony what a glorious thing the NHS is – the Conservatives brought in the Health and Social Care Bill.\nA bill that many people didn’t even notice passing through parliament. But a bill that arguably affects all of us more than any other legislation in our lifetime. A bill based on the premise that the NHS was a poorly performing institution that needed reform and another £3Bn top down reorganisation that we’d been promised before the election wouldn’t happen. A bill that ignored the core values of the NHS and characterised it’s staff as a problem to be dealt with rather than it’s greatest asset. A bill that achieved the Tory Nirvana of laying the NHS open to private contractors, furthering their ideology that the state should not be responsible for providing public services.\nIt effectively legislated against free universal comprehensive healthcare and flung the door to privatisation wide open. And private health firms are falling over themselves to come inside.\nJeremy Hunt has just announced £780Million worth of private contracts to 11 firms, many of which have a chequered history. Many of them are also donors to the Tory Party. There are also plans in Staffordshire to privatise cancer care in a £700M contract and ‘End of life care’ worth another £500M\nIn a leaked confidential document it’s proposed that these contractors will be :\n“Given ‘discretion’ to design services they would like to deliver, slash spend per patient and propose the payment structures most beneficial to themselves”.\nIn that one clause we get a glimpse of how private companies will pervert the ethos of the NHS to their own end.\nFirst the add on services will be an extra cost. Then any new treatments, drugs or therapies will be extra\nIn effect we’ll end up with a RyanAir NHS – Your operation will be free, but they’ll charge you £500 for the bed and another fifty for using the toilet.\nThe government consistently claims the NHS budget is protected but in reality, it’s being forced to make cuts dressed up as efficiency savings of £15bn – £20bn by the end of this year. No wonder we’re losing services. And across the country, A&Es, maternity and other services are being closed, with thousands of jobs lost. Competitive tendering also fragments healthcare. Where patients are sent miles to access different care resources around the country based on contractor costs.\nI’m standing as Parliamentary candidate for the Green Party in Banbury, where people are rightfully worried about that fragmentation and the future of their beloved Horton General Hospital. Labour have already tried to close it once, and more recently the coalition began a reduction in the range of services offered there, with the removal of emergency abdominal surgery facilities. This has resulted in some patients being forced to make a 3 or 4 hour, 50 mile round trip to services at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Not only is this extremely inconvenient, it also potentially impairs patient outcome as additional stress is added to their situation.\nBanbury has a long history of returning Conservative MPs, but this time every voter in the constituency has to ask themselves the question – do I still want to have access to a fully free and fully funded NHS in 5 years time?\nIf the answer is yes you have to remember that, no matter how much you might like the Conservative candidate this time (and I’ll admit I like her too), a vote for Victoria Prentis will just make another Tory led government more of a reality. No matter how much she says she’ll fight for the Horton, she’ll be forced to follow her party’s privatisation agenda. Even if she votes against the whip she’ll be a lone voice in a government she helped to put into power.\nI want to see an end to all privatisation of the NHS and I believe the NHS should be brought back entirely into public ownership.\nThe Green Party supports the NHS re-instatement bill, we’d negotiate an exit from PFI and repeal the Health and Social Care Act. We’d also fight TTIP which could have a huge impact on the NHS. We believe that NHS staff deserve a fair deal and that they should be supported and valued rather than treated as a problem to be dealt with\nAneurin Bevan was once asked how long he thought the NHS would survive. He replied: “As long as there are folk left with the faith to fight for it.”\nEvery party is pledging to invest more money into the NHS but the Green Party won’t just invest cash, we’ll also invest our faith. We all have to show that faith now or by the end of the next parliament Danny Boyle’s proud Olympic love letter to our wonderful NHS could become it’s epitaph.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2021_05_page_2/content_306.html": "I’ve spoken to hundreds of people during this short election campaign and probably the most important issue on most people’s minds right now is the threat to our local green belt.\nI made a video about it last week which has received quite a bit of attention since it was released. You can watch it here.\nOf course in Yarnton, Begbroke and Gosford (where I’m standing to become the new local County Councillor) it’s in the forefront of everyone’s minds because, if it goes ahead, we’ll be the ones living in the middle of a building site for possibly the next 10 years. We’ll also see our small rural communities destroyed and replaced with a single medium sized town, one that will probably also double up as a university campus for the Begbroke Science Park.\nBut even in Kidlington, (which comprises a large part of the County division) it’s going to have a huge impact. There may not be as many houses built in the area, but the additional strain on our local resources, such as health services, education and leisure facilities will be very detrimental. We’ll also see a noticeable reduction in air quality which is likely to have health impacts on the most vulnerable, as well as increased risks of flooding. The A44 will probably become a car park during busy times, giving us all the chance to sit and admire the 4 storey apartment blocks that will tower over the edge of the dual carriageway.\nThere’s also a good chance that Kidlington will finally lose the argument about hanging on to it’s status as a village. In 10 years time, when the population has possibly tripled, there’s likely to be a much greater push to establish the whole area as a suburb of a Greater Oxford City. Not a prospect I, or anyone else in the area, relishes but something we may have little choice over.\nI for one won’t stop fighting for that until the last blade of grass has fallen under the bulldozer’s tracks.\nAll this might be acceptable to a greater degree if these houses were going to provide affordable accommodation for local families, many of whom are crammed into a single house with perhaps 3 generations under one roof. But these aren’t for the likes of them. These will be expensive luxury executive houses built for investment purposes, with the so-called ‘affordable’ houses reserved for people in Oxford City. The District Council saw to that when they handed control of those houses over to the City Council in a closed meeting at the beginning of the first lockdown. None of these houses will be within reach of local residents.\nA lot of people have told me that all this is inevitable and that the 4400 houses are a ‘done deal’. Well that isn’t the case until we know the outcome of the legal challenge being brought to the high court next month. Until that’s over we have no idea if these proposals will stand up or collapse. There have been reports in other areas recently where challenges have been upheld, and if we get the same result Cherwell District Council will have to think again. In those circumstances we’ll need as much support on the District Council as possible which is why I’m supporting Fiona Mawson to become our second Green Party Councillor on CDC.\nBut even if we fail to stop these devastating plans though the courts, we can at least do our best to limit some of that devastation by having engaged and active councillors at all levels of local government. On the County Council fighting for infrastructure and other important considerations like flood protection, and of course at District and Parish level scrutinising the individual planning proposals themselves. We also have to be vigilant in opposing ‘infilling’ which may become more of an issue as the amount of development space in the area is snapped up by the bigger developers.\nSo I hope I and Fiona can count on the support of our local residents in the elections on Thursday. We’ve seen how our current crop of Conservative councillors have let us down on these issues, and let’s not forget that this whole idea was the brainchild of the Conservatives on Cherwell District Council in the first place, in cahoots with Oxford University, the City Council, the Oxfordshire Growth Board and the Local Enterprise Partnership. After Thursday we may have more leverage to defend our small rural communities against these faceless, unelected and anti-democratic quangos and take back control of our green heritage.\nI for one won’t stop fighting for that until the last blade of grass has fallen under the bulldozer’s tracks. I hope you’ll all support me as your Green Councillor in that long battle.",

This one should be NHS – NHS – NHS.\nThe road to privatisation of the NHS has been a long one and began under the Conservatives in 1992 with the Private Finance Initiative. It’s a neat trick that enables huge amounts of debt to be moved off the national balance sheet whilst still expanding operational infrastructure.\nNew Labour saw it as something too good to be true, as it allowed them to build new hospitals, without borrowing more money or raising taxes. But like most things that seem too good to be true, it was. By the end of their tenure Labour had saddled the NHS with £80Bn in repayments on total capital assets worth around £11Bn, and we’re still paying for it now.\nThen along came the Conservatives again who just love to privatise things. Every time they’ve been in government they’ve privatised something. The trains, electricity, gas, BT, the post office – which they practically gave away.\nBut the Tories have a problem when it comes to the NHS. They can’t flat out privatise it, because that’s politically toxic.\nSo in 2012 – The year that Danny Boyle showed us in his spectacular Olympic opening ceremony what a glorious thing the NHS is – the Conservatives brought in the Health and Social Care Bill.\nA bill that many people didn’t even notice passing through parliament. But a bill that arguably affects all of us more than any other legislation in our lifetime. A bill based on the premise that the NHS was a poorly performing institution that needed reform and another £3Bn top down reorganisation that we’d been promised before the election wouldn’t happen. A bill that ignored the core values of the NHS and characterised it’s staff as a problem to be dealt with rather than it’s greatest asset. A bill that achieved the Tory Nirvana of laying the NHS open to private contractors, furthering their ideology that the state should not be responsible for providing public services.\nIt effectively legislated against free universal comprehensive healthcare and flung the door to privatisation wide open. And private health firms are falling over themselves to come inside.\nJeremy Hunt has just announced £780Million worth of private contracts to 11 firms, many of which have a chequered history. Many of them are also donors to the Tory Party.

Claiming, as they always do, that they have put ‘record’ levels of funding into education (as they also claim for health and so many other important services). But the devil is in the detail, with funding per pupil actually falling as class sizes increase.\nRegardless of claims to the contrary in their cobbled-together, un-costed manifesto, there are more cuts to come. But you don’t have to take my word for it, just look at the information available on the schools cuts website\nThese bare facts come from the people who know what’s happening to our schools. The teachers at the sharp end of the Conservative agenda. While these backward looking politicians wax lyrical about the good old grammar school days, our schools are being run into the ground and sold off to private companies to asset strip for a quick buck or two.\nThis needs to stop now. Education is too important to be undersold, under-funded, undermined and treated as an optional extra in one of the richest economies in the world.\nRead what The Green Party would do about education in government and then read below what you can expect from another 5 years of Tory rule.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2019_12_11_can-you-vote-tactically-in-banbury-whats-a-green-vote-worth/content_31.html": "As we approach voting day, I thought I should deal with the elephant in the room head on.\nThe two questions I’m being asked are “Is voting Green a wasted vote?” and “Shouldn’t I vote tactically in Banbury to get the Tories out?”\nI’ll take the second question first and I answer that by way of this short video, but the gist is that tactical voting in Banbury is very unlikely to work. The Tories still have a 12000 vote majority after Labour’s strongest performance in 2017. Even if you added together all the non-Tory votes in the 2017 election (including UKIP) the next nearest party (Labour) would still have been 8000 votes short of winning.\nSo you’re free to vote for what you believe in, in Banbury.\nThe first question I’ll answer with 10 reasons why voting Green is not a wasted vote\n1. The national vote share for the Greens will send a message to whomever is in government that we want to see real commitment to climate change issues.\n2. A big swing to the Greens will really shake up the other parties and make them realise this is serious!\n3. Greens have already influenced the national political landscape. Jeremy Corbyn wouldn’t be the leader of Labour if the Greens hadn’t pushed them to be more radical after the 2015 election.\n4. A big Green swing will get a lot of publicity making the point even more strongly. Just another second place for the next nearest party will get virtually no media coverage.\n5. Votes for the Greens help them get funding in the form of Short Money. In Banbury that money is worth several thousand pounds. Remember we don’t take funding from big businesses or institutions like the other parties do.\n6. Greens call ill-afford to lose the £500 deposit in any constituency. They only need to get 5% of the vote to do that. We got 4.6% in 2015 in Banbury. We only needed another 225 votes, so every vote counted.\n7. The number of votes any party gets in a GE determines how much coverage they get on national media, particularly for platforms like the BBC and ITV.\n8. We have been winning seats in Oxfordshire. We doubled our number of MEPs and gained 10 times as many council seats, with joint control of one District Council. More Green votes in all elections mean more people get into the habit of voting Green and we get more Green representatives in government.\n9. Voting Green gives encouragement to your local branch to make the effort each time to put up a candidate so you will always have the chance to vote Green.\n10. If you really care about the environment and the future for generations to come, you’ll be able to tell your children and grandchildren with a clear conscience that you voted for them in years to come. Voting with your heart is never a wasted vote!\nI hope this helps anyone who might be undecided about how they can vote in Banbury. And remember, if you’re a Green at heart, this is the time to vote with your heart. For the planet, for your children and for our future.\nIf not now, then when?\nOne thought on “Can you Vote Tactically in Banbury? What’s a Green Vote Worth? [Video]”",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_tackley/content_73.html": "So in the words of Dolly Parton – Here I come again!\nNo sooner had we got past the District Council elections than we were thrown into a General Election that I and most other pundits had assumed would be held in October or even November.\nTheories as to why we’ve been dragged into the whole merry-go-round again at this premature juncture range from speculation about the likely state of the economy and the reduction in inflation, which no political party can realistically take credit for (although the Tories are trying), to the idea that Rishi and his Tory mates needed to get their CVs in for some cushy consultancy gigs before the end of the year.\nThe other likely reason of course is that there was a chance that a vote of no confidence could be called in Mr Sunak and he wanted to leave the political sphere (as he is likely to do) on the high of being the actual PM, if only in terms of his name badge.\nWhatever the reason, here we are having been given only a short 6 weeks to make our case to the electorate, which for parties like the Greens, without the financial and operational reserves of some of the other parties is something of a tall order. But we’re used to tall orders. In the face of what seems like a deliberate policy of starving us of media attention in favour of far more ratings grabbing pint-swilling politico-celebs like Nigel Farage, we’re still garnering support from credible commentators and respected political analysts for both our economic and social justice proposals.\nFormer Citibank financial trader Gary Stevenson and host of the You Tube Channel Gary’s Economics has analysed the Green Party manifesto and classified it as the most credible and honest in real terms. In a recent video he confirmed that he would be voting Green because we are the only party to be offering a radical and workable alternative to the proposals from every other party.\nTrade Unionist and former General Secretary of the Labour Party Jennie Formby has also announced on Twitter that she would be voting Green in this election along with numerous other high profile political and cultural leaders such as George Monbiot. It’s also reported that more and more young people are turning to the Greens as a real alternative to the ping-pong politics of the past 50 years.\nAs a moderate Green myself I’ve always seen the Greens as a true alternative vote, neither left or right. The Green Party officially rejects the traditional left–right political spectrum, describing it as “something of an anachronism” and that perfectly fits with my view on the world.\nI’m standing as the Parliamentary Candidate for Bicester and Woodstock mainly because it’s my home constituency and the place I’ve made my home for 32 years. But above all that, it’s a place I’ve seen change drastically in that time with even more drastic changes in the pipeline. From the massive development plans in and around Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Bicester with large areas of greenbelt being decimated by ill-conceived local plans to proposals to armour plate 3500 acres of green fields and farmland for hugely unpopular solar farm project in the west. I’m concerned about what these things will do to the place I’ve called home for nearly half my life.\nThere’s obviously going to be a lot more to say on this election in the remaining 2 weeks, much of which I’ve not said so far due to dealing with my new responsibilities on Cherwell District Council after being appointed to the executive on the same night that the General Election was announced (great timing Rishi!). But I’ll be breaking my silence over the next 2 weeks.\nIn the meantime, doors are being knocked, leaflets are being delivered and pollsters are polling. There’s been a huge amount of speculation about who can win in this constituency and I’m not going to add to that with my own obviously biased opinions. But with a newly drawn boundary, every voter has the historic opportunity to vote in a brand new Westminster constituency for the first time where we could all buck the trends and help me and the Greens to show that any prediction in an unknown and untested area could be drastically inaccurate.\nCan I win? Who knows? Am I serious about my candidacy? Absolutely! But then as anyone who knows me and knows my work as a local councillor and activist would tell you, I never do things by half measures. We all know that the Tories are finished, at least for the immediate future. We don’t need to vote tactically on a local basis in this election because after 14 years of chaos the country has finally woken up and are about to consign the current administration to the political skip.\nThat gives every voter in this area new opportunities and new possibilities. You can vote with your heart and for what you believe in. If that’s a better future for you and your family, a fully funded NHS and social care system, public utilities returned to responsible public control (particular water and energy), a better standard of living for all, raising millions out of poverty and protecting climate and nature, voting Green really is the only alternative. Even if I don’t win the seat, a vote for me that would contribute to a large swing to the Greens nationally will strengthen our hand in influencing national politics for the better. It will also put money into the party coffers through Short Money to help us continue the fight for a better, fairer, greener world for you and you family and their families to come.\nI’ll do my best over the next couple of weeks to make my case for your precious vote in this election and I hope you will seriously consider giving me that vote on July 4th. You should shortly be receiving leaflets from me explaining my priorities. You can also browse this website which is being updated with local issues that I think will be important in the upcoming election. I will also be adding new topics in the next few days. If you want hear me speak in the meantime, I was interviewed by Byline Times recently and was able to cover many topics that I think will be important to voters in this election. You can see that here.\nThere are also a number of hustings that you can attend to ask questions of me and the other candidates. These are :\n7.30pm – 24th June – Kidlington Methodist Church (forum on poverty)\n7.30pm – 25th June – St. Mary Magdelene Church, Park St, Woodstock\n7pm – 26th June – St Edburg Church Bicester\n6.30pm – 1st July – CPRE Country side and Environment hustings at Yarnton Village Hall\nI look forward to seeing as many people at those events as possible. If anyone would like to extend other invitations I am more than happy to come along. If any other events come up I will post them here and on my social media channels.\nRemember – this is the election where YOU get to vote FOR what YOU believe in, rather than AGAINST what you don’t.\nIf you’d like to get involved in my campaign please drop me a line at ian.middleton@greenoxford.com\nYou could also contribute to my joint fundraiser to help me and my 2 fellow North and West Oxfordshire candidates reach more voters in this campaign.

They were all all opposed to Cherwell District Council’s illogical and damaging decision to restrict the stalls to the Cornhill end of the Market Place. A plan also supported by the Conservative controlled Town Council.\nI started my own 25 year long retail career on a market stall, and worked it for 7 years with my partner though rain, hail sleet, snow and sunshine. I know how difficult it can be to make a living and how fragile the trading environment can be. Your livelihood can depend on so many variable factors, and one of the major fears is losing your regular pitch, for whatever reason.\nIt may seem silly to anyone who hasn’t traded in a market themselves, but where your stall sits can make all the difference between success and failure. The location of competing trades, the flow of people moving through the market, who your neighbours are, your visibility and prominence in the market as a whole are all desperately important.\nThere appears to have been absolutely no consultation with stall holders or customers about these unpopular changes, and based on what stallholders and visitors told me I foresee them being the death knell for this historic trading post as more and more traders fall by the wayside.\nSo what seems like a minor change to the council, will probably be anything but to the people trying to make a living out of the market. This move could likely kill it off! it’s already become smaller and therefore less popular, especially over the last 20 years. In 1997 there were 120 stalls, now its down to less than 20.\nConsidering it’s reduced pull for consumers it’s completely incongruous that the rents being charged by the private firm managing on behalf of the council are almost double that charged by neighbouring markets such as Abingdon, Aylesbury, Hinkley, Oxford and Thame. And as with most things these days, the rent goes up every year. Meanwhile trade is slowly dwindling away to nothing, leaving regular and loyal traders quite literally out in the cold.\nThe Council’s plan includes opening the Market car park for use on Thursdays and Fridays. There is no evidence to suggest this will increase car park usage and revenue to the Council – people already using other car parks such as that near to the Matalan Store will simply park in the market place instead.\nGovernment initiatives on town centre regeneration called for more emphasis and support for market days and the traders that build and run these vital hubs of trade and local amenity in our towns and cities. The Portas review cited markets as one of the easiest ways that town centres could be revitalised and kept alive. Why then is the Conservative run Cherwell Council ignoring the views of it’s own established market traders? Why are they proposing moves that could potentially irreparably damage trade in such an established and once vibrant local fixture?\nBanbury market should be seen by Cherwell Council as an asset to the town. They should be supporting it actively and engaging with the traders and customers to find ways of safeguarding the it’s future, rather than taking unilateral actions with no consultation.\nThis is a Charter Market, which bestows on Banbury the status of a Market Town. By birthright it should be located in the Market Square.\nI would urge Cherwell councillors to do what I did. Take a walk around the market and speak to the people whose livelihoods are in their hands.

The river itself is not insubstantial, being deep enough in some areas to swim in, although these days you’d be brave to risk it given the level of E coli and other nasties lurking in its once crystal clear depths.\nI spoke to brilliant local councillor Genny Early about the history of the river that she’s lived near for the past 30 years and the tale was not a happy one. Where once you could look out from the local footbridge at fish swimming amongst the river weeds and watch local dogs play happily in the waters, we now have a soupy grey clag, virtually devoid of life and reputedly toxic to everyone including our canine companions.\nThe cause is toxic dumping from up to 9 different local sewage works, given effective carte blanche by the Conservative government to use this river, and others in the area, as an open sewer to enable companies like Thames Water to pay out record dividends to investors whilst doing next to nothing to fix inadequate infrastructure.\nThis is the starkest example of how privatisation has failed us all with greedy and cynical corporations grabbing every opportunity to make obscene amounts of money by (in this case) quite literally shitting on local communities.\nI made a video with Genny showing just how bad things have got in this area, in sickening contrast to the beautiful local landscape. You can watch it by clicking here.\nWe simply can’t allow this situation to continue and only the Greens have the real solution to take privatised utilities back into public control where they belong. Water is quite literally an essential for life on this planet. If we’ve reached the point where that is simply a commodity to be bartered between corporations on the open market we really have reached the bottom of a very murky barrel.\nGreens would take water and other essential public utilities and services back into public control as the only way to deal with this obscene failure of duty to keep our waterways and rivers clean and accessible for wildlife and recreation. Other parties are suggesting half way houses of fines and extra taxation. None of that will work in an industry that simply doesn’t care any more.\nWe need radical solutions to these unprecedented outcomes and only the Green Party has a vision bold enough to deliver those.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_type_gallery_page_11/content_454.html": "So ends my third and final candidacy for the Banbury constituency.\nIn a way I’ve come full circle in that my result this time was almost identical to my first one in 2015. I was only 79 votes short of that figure this time with a final result of 2607 votes, giving me 4.1% of the vote share.\nIn 2015, I received 4.6% with only a slightly higher number of votes, but the turnout was lower then. Sadly this left me about 500 votes short of keeping my deposit this time, which means the Green Party loses £500, but we did our best.\nOn a personal level I’m fairly happy with that result. It was more than double the last time I stood and represented a 2.2% increase in my vote share. That’s the best increase of all the Green Party candidates in Oxfordshire, so that’s nice to have. You have to look for the positives in these things!\nUnfortunately though, positives on a national level are thin on the ground. With a massive swing to the Tories representing such a shift in our national political landscape, I’m far more concerned about that than I am about my own result. This is something I’m still processing at the moment as I’m sure many others are. I have to say I’ve avoided news coverage of the election today as it is just too painful! Maybe sleep deprivation has played a big part in that as well!\nWhere we go from here is difficult to say. I think it’s fairly certain that Brexit will now happen, which I think we will mostly live to regret. The debate around the referendum has become so polarised now that I’m not sure anyone really knows how we got here. It’s become an argument about ‘honouring’ a vote that many people no longer really know the point of. From most of the coverage I’ve seen it’s become about who ‘won’ and who ‘lost’. It should never have been boiled down to such a simplistic argument. Especially as I think most of us will eventually be the losers from Brexit.\nThe “Get Brexit done” slogan is also an absurd reduction of the true impact of one of the most seismic shifts in our fortunes since the second world war. I still don’t think it’s something we should be treating so lightly. With so much new information available to us now compared to 2016, we should have had an opportunity to think again. Just ‘getting it over with’ really isn’t a logical motivation for carrying on with something that I think will be hugely damaging to this country and our economy. Especially as the poor and the disadvantaged will end up feeling the most pain, which makes it doubly frustrating when so many news reports seem to suggest it’s those very people who voted Tory in this election.\nThose of us on the remain side obviously haven’t made a strong enough case to those who seem so eager to jump into the abyss. Boris Johnson’s lies will, I believe, show themselves to be exactly that when we finally push the button on Brexit. Sadly it will be too late then to say I told you so to all those who think this will be a positive move.\nThe climate debate was for me equally as important as Brexit and bound up in the same argument. This also applies to the other burning issues in the UK at the moment, including the NHS and public services. I believe we will spend the next 10 years wasting parliamentary time dealing with the intricacies of extricating ourselves from the EU and negotiating disadvantageous deals with countries like the USA, when we should be dealing with the existential threat of climate change and the collapse of our health services.\nThe other issue exposed by the result is the desperate need for electoral reform. Westminster has still been carved up by the two main parties who need so few votes to get a seat in the big house. Whereas parties like the Greens with over 800,000 votes nationally only get on MP. That really doesn’t make sense and certainly explains why so many people think that voting is a pointless exercise. Moreover we need to have greater co-operation between parties to achieve electoral reform. I hope that the one positive that might come out of Labour’s terrible results might be that they will finally be open to talking to other parties about co-operating towards that end.\nBut I will do what I can to help deal with the worst damage that Brexit and climate change will inevitably do to our society both locally and globally, even though I fear that, with at least another 5 years of majority Conservative government ahead of us, that’s going to be a very difficult task.\nIt’s not one that I will shirk from though, and I will use my position as a local councillor to bring as much influence as I can to bear on what will no doubt be many more Tory excesses and attacks on the weakest in our society. With a Tory dominated District council in Cherwell it’s always an uphill struggle to ‘move the dial’ but that’s not a reason to give up and I won’t be doing that.\nFinally, an enormous thank you everyone who helped in my campaign and to everyone who contacted my directly, and through social media, to give me encouragement and support, and of course thank you for giving me your precious vote. I can assure you that I value it enormously and it was not wasted.\nFor reasons I’ve explained in another post, no vote you believe in is ever wasted, and in terms of the Green Party it will help us carry on campaigning and, most importantly now, hold the national and local government to account on the environment and climate change.\nThe fight continues!",

We don’t need to get brexit done, we need to be done with it, one way or the other, and the only way to decide that is with a vote.\nThe Green Party is now the ONLY party offering this option as a main policy pledge.\nLabour would renegotiate a deal with Europe which we have to assume they would back in any confirmatory referendum (assuming they honour their pledge to give us one). That defines them as a leave backing party. Jeremy Corbyn’s claim that he would be neutral in that campaign shows a continuation of the lack of direction that Labour has had since this whole thing began. If they’re going to back Remain, then why negotiate another deal (assuming that’s even possible), they should be honest with the electorate and get off the fence!\nThe Libdems are standing on a platform of revoke without a second vote, which I regard as deeply undemocratic. We got ourselves into this position democratically, and we have to get out of it the same way. We can’t simply treat the first vote as if it didn’t happen. the claim that an electoral victory that would put them into government goes against their own argument (and the Green Party’s) that our electoral system is broken. Unless they had more than 50% of the electorate voting them into power, that would not be a mandate for a revoking Article 50. As most governments of recent years have been elected on less that 30%, they would not be able to claim they were taking the majority of the country with them.\nAs for the Tories, we know they would throw us off the cliff-edge with or without a deal, without a second thought, let alone a second referendum! Just so that Boris Johnson could claim that he’d “got Brexit done”. Even if that means the majority of the country that now appears to want to remain would get ‘done over’!\nDemocracy did not stop in 2016. We’ve seen over the past three and a half years that the easy Brexit we were told we would get after the referendum has proved anything but. Not only does this suggest that people may have changed their minds, it also means that the demographic of the country has changed and that new population, who will have to deal with the outcome of Brexit, should now get a say. Either way, we know a lot more now about the reality of Brexit than any of us did back in 2016. Surely we should all be able to re-assess our decisions based on this new information.\nMost polls now say the majority would vote to remain in the EU. I don’t know if that’s true, or if that’s how a second vote would pan out. But I think we should find out.\nI also think those who say the ‘will of the people’ is still to leave shouldn’t be scared to find out. If they’re right, the result of the vote will be the same. If they’re worried that it might not be, that suggests they know that the will of the people has changed, and they simply want to ignore that. That’s not democracy. That’s ignoring the will of the people!\nMy personal position is that a second vote should be binding (the first one wasn’t) and after that, the decision is final. If that decision is to leave, I will no longer challenge it. I would instead switch my focus to working towards mitigating the worst of the damage that I think will inevitably be done to the social and economic fabric of this country.\nLeaving the EU by any means will result in at least a decade of economic hardship for everyone, with the poorest in our society suffering the most.\nParliamentary time will be used up on dealing with the fallout from the severing of our membership of the EU rather than tackling urgent business, such as crumbling public services and climate change.\nBusinesses will suffer and investment will fall (except in the case of US drugs companies seeking to buy our NHS!).\nWe must not condemn our citizens to this fate without a fully informed confirmatory vote.",

We are however a broad church with many facets. I was encouraged to become a candidate BECAUSE of my business experience rather than in spite of it, and I saw that as an encouraging aspect.\nI’ve run large companies, and I now run a small one. I’m probably something of a gamekeeper turned poacher. But I’ve seen both sides of this debate and come to realise that the idea of continual economic growth is indeed a myth. And one we have to stop believing before we run out of road.\nI was at the launch of a new book by Naomi Klein a few months ago. She makes some interesting points about the connections between environmental issues and the global economy. The basic tenet is that when resources and commodities are monetised on the kinds of scale they are now, the result is economic and environmental catastrophe. And we’re just getting a taste of that.\nThe direct impacts are of course climate change, which if you ascribe to that view, is starting to bring with it the kinds of drastic changes in weather patterns that we’ve seen in recent years.\nThese are all things we’re having to come to terms with now and they’re all traceable to global economic activity. They affect all our lives, not just personally, but in broader human and economic terms.\nI’m a vocal advocate of social enterprise, and believe that there are many big businesses out there that can be made to take a more ethical and responsible stance if we create the right conditions to encourage it. And happily for me there is already a growing movement within the more enlightened areas of the business world towards ethical business and sustainable capitalism.\nThat might sound like some thing of an oxymoron, but in many sectors of business now there’s a realisation dawning that if we continue to squeeze the pips of the economy, we’ll eventually run out of juice.\nAmidst calls from some people for a revolution against rampant capitalism, I see the future as more of an evolution towards a business ethos that views social justice and connection with local and national communities as an asset, rather than an inconvenience. I’m certainly not anti-capitalist, but I am anti-unfettered capitalism. I agree that the market should be allowed to decide some things. But I believe the state has the job of holding us all to account for our actions and tempering the excesses of marketisation to prevent it working against the common good.\nAnd it’s not just us greeny types taking up this mantra. Many key economists and business commentators are now having similar epiphanies about how business and consumption needs to be managed in a sustainable, responsible and accountable way, if we’re all going to avoid a backlash against the kinds of excesses and irresponsible business practices that became prevalent over the past 20 or 30 years.\nEssentially businesses need to grow up and take responsibility for the societies we’ve helped to create.\nI’ve recently become very interested in something now being called the circular economy, where consumption itself is fed back into the creation of new resources and products. This doesn’t just encompass recycling, but also upcycling and renewable energy as part of the manufacturing process, along with emergent technologies, social media, and the fourth economy, comprising enterprises that not only make a profit for business owners, but also put something back into the social economy.\nThat might all sound a bit hippy and tree-huggy, but it’s something that’s being taken very seriously now by many key figures in the business world. Most notably Bill Gates and Richard Branson. And with good reason.\nIf you can make money with clean conscience, look after your employees, business partners, suppliers, and most importantly the planet AND enjoy what you’re doing, what’s not to like?\nYou also get to sleep pretty well at night too\nSo I hope I can convince you that there is scope within a Green World for enterprise and innovation. Without the need for a constantly growing economy and an ever greater consumption of the worlds finite resources.\nWith the potential for over a million green jobs out there, and an ethical economy that has only scratched the surface of an emerging market, there are plenty of opportunities for business leaders and entrepreneurs in a future Green and pleasant land.",

They’ve lost faith in democracy and I don’t blame them when the same party always wins!\nBut in this election there is the chance for change. I can win this vote in the county elections, as I did in 2019 in the district elections, and Fiona Mawson can win in the district again giving, us 2 Green councillors in the area. But we need everyone to get out there and make their mark.\nI’ve lived in Yarnton for 28 years (along with Fiona) and seen how uninterested our local councils are about what happens to our local villages.

He’s used every opportunity to oppose them and has always looked out for residents. I believe he would make an excellent county councillor and I would trust him to represent my best interests as a resident in the most effective way.”\nKK, Spring Hill resident\n“Ian has been a huge help to us, and really seems to care about issues impacting residents. Very accessible and always willing to lend advice and support.”\nN Donoghue, Kidlington resident\n“Ian has provided valuable help to the residents in our Close by getting involved and by providing ongoing support. It is reassuring to know that when needed, he is approachable and really does take an active interest in his local community”\nG Bishop, Kidlington resident\n“I first met Ian when he was delivering food to my area during lockdown. He didn’t tell me he was a councillor until weeks later. He’s the sort of councillor we need more of. Someone who cares about our community and isn’t out for himself.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2018_04/content_78.html": "As I said in the recent election debate on the BBC, in my opinion they shouldn’t.\nThere are many reasons it’s a bad idea, both from a business perspective and as part of local spending priorities.\nI’ve worked in retail nearly all my life. I built and ran a national chain of jewellery stores across the country and traded in several shopping centres, including some of the most prestigious in the country such as Bluewater in Kent and the new Bullring Centre in Birmingham. I write a regular column for Retail week Magazine and comment regularly in the national press on retail issues as well as offering consultancy services. One of my main focusses is independent retail and commercial property. So I know a little bit about what I’m talking about.\nCherwell District Council (CDC) leader Barry Wood claims that buying the Castle Quay Shopping Centre in Banbury is a good deal for the people of Cherwell. This decision was also backed by the Labour group on the council and their leader Sean Woodcock has assured me there’s a good business case for doing it. Unfortunately neither of them have been able to show it to me so far.\nTheir belief is that buying a commercial property like a shopping centre is a good idea as property will always rise in value. This may be the case for domestic property and some kinds of commercial premises, but not always with retail space.\nA Good Investment?\nThe argument for buying the scheme seems to be that if they hadn’t, the centre would have shut down. It has many long term empty units and is generally struggling to compete in an ever crowded marketplace. The council’s decision a few years ago to allow a new shopping park to open on the outskirts of Banbury haven’t helped its plight.\nIt’s extremely unlikely though that it would have closed down. Much more likely that it would have been offloaded by its pension investment owners to another investment company with more experience of running a shopping centre than some local councillors.\nMoreover, if the argument is that the centre was about to collapse, that doesn’t exactly make it an attractive investment for public money does it?\nThere have been some shopping centre failures in the past, but they are few and far between. But when they do go, they tend to go completely. That means an almost total loss for anyone unlucky enough to be the owner at the time. There will be some residual value in the land, but that’s unlikely to reflect the full price paid for the whole development.\nThere have been a growing number of retail failures in recent years with 650 collapses so far this year alone, and we’re not even half way through yet! Some of them very high profile and heavily leveraged operations. Others are busy negotiating partial closures and rent reductions with their landlords. Others are moving more into the online arena and abandoning physical retail space almost altogether.\nNone of this bodes well for an under-let, under-invested and down at heel shopping centre in a struggling town in North Oxfordshire.\nSo essentially CDC are gambling with public money against the odds. And it doesn’t end there.\nOther Costs\nAccording to Barry Wood the scheme is turning a profit at the moment, but as I’ve said previously, I’ve not seen evidence of that. I have seen a large number of long term voids in the centre, and with the potential for these to increase in number I fear the profitability may be marginal or likely to decline.\nThere will also be ongoing running costs for the centre and presumably additional investment to do whatever it is with the place that they feel will revitalise it. Again details on that are sketchy, but I think there’s some talk about dividing the larger units into smaller ones to attract independent retailers. Whilst I support that idea to some extent there are a lot of things to consider about that course of action.\nFirstly the cost of doing the work, which may include major re-modelling of the units due to, amongst other things, fire regulations. I’ve seen at least one shopping centre management come unstuck with similar plans due to rules on access to fire exit routes.\nHelping Smaller Retailers?\nSecondly smaller independents usually don’t have a huge budget for shopfitting, so there will be additional cost in partially fitting out the units, including new shopfronts etc to attract smaller operators and to ensure that their stores fit in with a modern shopping centre scheme.\nBusiness Rates\nThirdly there’s the loss of business rates on the empty units that are there now, and will most likely be there for a while. Considering the current climate in retail there’s also a good chance that voids could increase. At the moment the landlords will be paying rates on those premises even though they’re empty and a good deal of that money goes to CDC. With the council now being the landlords, they’re going to be paying the rates to themselves, effectively wiping out that income.\nDevaluation of the Asset\nFinally there’s the issue of valuation. Shopping developments are broadly valued on their rental potential. This is why landlords will leave units empty rather than let them out at a reduced rent. If the council’s plan is to lower the rent for smaller or other retailers, that will have a knock on effect on the value of those units and then on others when rent reviews come around. Other tenants now paying a higher rent will also push for a reduction when their leases come up for renewal or rent reviews are due or maybe even before.\nThe net effect of this would be to push down rents, not only in the centre but across the town, reducing loan to asset values across the board. In broad terms I’d welcome that. I’ve long argued that retail property values are hugely inflated. But in terms of the Council’s investment exposure in Castle Quay it’s a potentially dangerous situation, not only leading to a potential devaluation of the asset, but also any loans secured on it being partially called in.\nThere may be some balancing in terms of appreciation on the total asset value, but in the current climate and in a falling retail market, there a very good chance that the overall value of the scheme will fall relative to the amount the council has sunk into it, both as an initial investment and any further day to day expenditure.\nAll of this appears to have passed Cherwell Councillors and the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives by. They obviously have a very patchy understanding of how retail property works and the implications and pitfalls they are letting us all as council tax payers in for.\nMoreover there’s the question of if so much money should be focussed in the north of the district while ignoring other areas. Mr Wood commented in the Radio debate on Wednesday that he recognised that there were empty units in Pioneer Square in Bicester and that it was difficult to get them filled. Yet this doesn’t seem to have concerned him over the purchase of Castle Quay. Indeed, having set the precedent in Banbury I asked him during the debate if the council intended to buy Pioneer Square as well. He didn’t reply.\nOther Options\nA more sensible and prudent approach to the problems in both areas would be to work with the landlords rather than bailing them out with public money. Leave them with the risk whilst introducing local initiatives that help smaller retailers get a foothold and would also support the centre.\nThese could include rates reductions, which Barry Wood dismissed out of hand when I challenged him on it during the election debate. Neither he nor Sean Woodcock appeared to know that it has been within the gift of local councils to reduce rates on specific properties at their discretion for several years now.\nIf they wanted to provide smaller, more affordable space for independent retailers, they could lease units from the centres on a medium to long term basis, probably negotiating favourable terms with the landlords as a council will have a very good covenant. These could then be divided up (if required) and then sublet on flexible terms on reduced rents to retailers, although this would have to be agreed beforehand with the landlord for the same reasons discussed above concerning rental levels and valuations.\nThis would achieve the same aim of revitalising schemes both in Banbury and Bicester and would not involve the council in risking large amounts of public money. It would also mean that the bulk of the £60m they are now tying up in one area could be spread across the district.\nThis is the kind of strategic thinking we need, rather that the amateurish speculation of a council who seems to want to play at being shopkeepers with our money. This is why we need a more diverse representation on the council and councillors like me who will challenge these misguided moves before millions of pounds of desperately needed council funds are put at risk.",

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_business-rates/content_173.html": "As I said in the recent election debate on the BBC, in my opinion they shouldn’t.\nThere are many reasons it’s a bad idea, both from a business perspective and as part of local spending priorities.\nI’ve worked in retail nearly all my life. I built and ran a national chain of jewellery stores across the country and traded in several shopping centres, including some of the most prestigious in the country such as Bluewater in Kent and the new Bullring Centre in Birmingham. I write a regular column for Retail week Magazine and comment regularly in the national press on retail issues as well as offering consultancy services. One of my main focusses is independent retail and commercial property. So I know a little bit about what I’m talking about.\nCherwell District Council (CDC) leader Barry Wood claims that buying the Castle Quay Shopping Centre in Banbury is a good deal for the people of Cherwell. This decision was also backed by the Labour group on the council and their leader Sean Woodcock has assured me there’s a good business case for doing it. Unfortunately neither of them have been able to show it to me so far.\nTheir belief is that buying a commercial property like a shopping centre is a good idea as property will always rise in value. This may be the case for domestic property and some kinds of commercial premises, but not always with retail space.\nA Good Investment?\nThe argument for buying the scheme seems to be that if they hadn’t, the centre would have shut down. It has many long term empty units and is generally struggling to compete in an ever crowded marketplace. The council’s decision a few years ago to allow a new shopping park to open on the outskirts of Banbury haven’t helped its plight.\nIt’s extremely unlikely though that it would have closed down. Much more likely that it would have been offloaded by its pension investment owners to another investment company with more experience of running a shopping centre than some local councillors.\nMoreover, if the argument is that the centre was about to collapse, that doesn’t exactly make it an attractive investment for public money does it?\nThere have been some shopping centre failures in the past, but they are few and far between. But when they do go, they tend to go completely. That means an almost total loss for anyone unlucky enough to be the owner at the time. There will be some residual value in the land, but that’s unlikely to reflect the full price paid for the whole development.\nThere have been a growing number of retail failures in recent years with 650 collapses so far this year alone, and we’re not even half way through yet! Some of them very high profile and heavily leveraged operations. Others are busy negotiating partial closures and rent reductions with their landlords. Others are moving more into the online arena and abandoning physical retail space almost altogether.\nNone of this bodes well for an under-let, under-invested and down at heel shopping centre in a struggling town in North Oxfordshire.\nSo essentially CDC are gambling with public money against the odds. And it doesn’t end there.\nOther Costs\nAccording to Barry Wood the scheme is turning a profit at the moment, but as I’ve said previously, I’ve not seen evidence of that. I have seen a large number of long term voids in the centre, and with the potential for these to increase in number I fear the profitability may be marginal or likely to decline.\nThere will also be ongoing running costs for the centre and presumably additional investment to do whatever it is with the place that they feel will revitalise it. Again details on that are sketchy, but I think there’s some talk about dividing the larger units into smaller ones to attract independent retailers. Whilst I support that idea to some extent there are a lot of things to consider about that course of action.\nFirstly the cost of doing the work, which may include major re-modelling of the units due to, amongst other things, fire regulations. I’ve seen at least one shopping centre management come unstuck with similar plans due to rules on access to fire exit routes.\nHelping Smaller Retailers?\nSecondly smaller independents usually don’t have a huge budget for shopfitting, so there will be additional cost in partially fitting out the units, including new shopfronts etc to attract smaller operators and to ensure that their stores fit in with a modern shopping centre scheme.\nBusiness Rates\nThirdly there’s the loss of business rates on the empty units that are there now, and will most likely be there for a while. Considering the current climate in retail there’s also a good chance that voids could increase. At the moment the landlords will be paying rates on those premises even though they’re empty and a good deal of that money goes to CDC. With the council now being the landlords, they’re going to be paying the rates to themselves, effectively wiping out that income.\nDevaluation of the Asset\nFinally there’s the issue of valuation. Shopping developments are broadly valued on their rental potential. This is why landlords will leave units empty rather than let them out at a reduced rent. If the council’s plan is to lower the rent for smaller or other retailers, that will have a knock on effect on the value of those units and then on others when rent reviews come around. Other tenants now paying a higher rent will also push for a reduction when their leases come up for renewal or rent reviews are due or maybe even before.\nThe net effect of this would be to push down rents, not only in the centre but across the town, reducing loan to asset values across the board.

Brenda of Bristol must furious!\nJoking aside, I must admit I was surprised to find myself thrown into another election so soon after winning 3 local council seats in May.\nBut it seems that our strong and stable government can’t manage to hang on for any longer than a coupe of years at most these days, even with the so-called fixed- term Parliament Act!\nThis just goes to show how desperately we need electoral reform in this country, a system by which more than one party can contribute to the process of government and more than one set of opinions can be taken into account.\nIt seems that, far from our first past the post system giving us a government of unity and decisiveness, when it comes to the most monumental political upheaval in a generation, we simply can’t agree on anything!\nIn those circumstances we have to go back to the country and hope that the numbers stack up differently afterwards. Somehow I suspect they won’t. While we cling to our broken 2 party state, we will just see-saw backwards and forwards between opposing positions.\nOn the key issue of Brexit, Labour are still offering a confused position, saying they would re-negotiate the deal with the EU and then put it to the people. That’s a great in principle, but in practice it means Labour will presumably be rooting for their new deal in any subsequent vote. That, by any sensible definition, makes them a party of leave.\nThe Libdems simply want to ignore the 2016 vote and treat Brexit like it never happened. Whilst that’s an attractive prospect for those of us who would rather remain, it’s not a way to resolve the political schism in our country at the moment.\nThe 2016 result was hardly decisive as it showed a split right down the middle of the argument. We could probably have run the vote again the following day and got a different result!\nThe only way to properly heal this country is with a second referendum as soon as possible after the election. No more deals being negotiated, no more simply pushing the Brexit button out of expediency (as the Tories would have us do), but a properly informed, final say on the direction this country will take and what is in the best interests of everyone.\nPersonally, if that second vote still comes out as leave I’m done on the subject of Brexit. I’m quite happy to let the chips fall where they may and shift my focus to trying to prepare the country for what I think will be the most damaging decade in history since the last war.\nBut to those who say we shouldn’t have a second vote, I’d point to the fact that we’re now having our third national vote since 2015! If ‘the will of the people’ really was the main driving force in our democracy, we’d keep the government we voted for in 2015, regardless of the wishes of the government at the time. But we haven’t.\nSo if we can have 3 general elections in 4 years, why not a confirmatory vote on something that was decided by a small minority three and a half years ago, when we didn’t know what we know now? Something that could impact on all our futures and those of generations to come. Why is that to be decided on just one vote?\nI really don’t know why anyone should object to the idea of a People’s Vote. If the will of the people hasn’t changed, the result will be the same. The only reason I can see that the Brexit contingent would object to another vote, is that they think they will lose it.\nIn which case they know in their heart of hearts that the mood of the country has changed. They know that the vote in 2016 was probably a fluke, and they’re terrified of the genuine will of the people being followed now. they simply want to railroad us all into the abyss before anyone realised what’s happening. That’s no way to run a country!\nSo let’s get on with this election and I hope vote in some more Green MPs who can influence Westminster enough to resolve the national insanity we seem to have thrown ourselves into over Brexit.\nWe don’t need to get Brexit done. We need to do away with it once and for all!",

These questions are strikingly familiar to anyone who was at the Public Inquiry into Cherwell District Council’s Local Plan Review earlier this year.\nAt the hearing, local campaigners called on Cherwell to delay any further work on the plan to build 4400 houses on prime Green Belt in Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke until the true figures of housing need in Oxford were known.\nCherwell’s local plan review is predicated on a perceived obligation to help meet Oxford City’s housing need. Campaigners against the plans have repeatedly argued that Oxford’s need cannot be quantified until their local plan has been agreed, approved and published. Something the City Council has been slow to progress.\nInstead, District councils have relied on guesswork and a ‘working assumption’ from the Oxfordshire Growth Board (OGB) based on figures in the 2014 Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA). A report that itself has been highly criticised since its publication.\nIn response, the City Council commissioned an update to the SHMA. This demonstrated that the original figures were over-estimates, a conclusion backed by follow up analysis from an independent planning consultant presented to the Cherwell hearing. Both the city and district councils, including Cherwell, have sought to ignore the implications of these reports, but the inconsistencies have not escaped the planning inspector. These include:\n- The fact that figures being used to underpin assumptions of need are now over 8 years old\n- That the 2018 SHMA points to a significantly lower housing need than that shown in the 2014 version and that these figures have not been incorporated into the City’s plan.\n- Inconsistencies in estimated housing capacities in the City’s plan and the ‘Growth Deal’ proposals\n- Suggestions of prescriptive planning policies that preclude development in numerous key areas\n- Concerns over double counting of homeless numbers where new households are ignored\n- Inappropriate market ‘uplifts’ producing around a 30% over-estimate of housing need\nIan Middleton, Cherwell District Council’s new Green councillor said\n“The inspector’s comments are a clear vindication of the position taken by groups opposed to Cherwell’s plans to devastate green spaces in South Cherwell on the basis of an assumed need that has been significantly inflated.\nDuring the public inquiry, Cherwell resolutely refused to listen to calls from myself and MP Layla Moran to delay their plans until the City’s need had been properly established. It’s now clear we were right and the need to suspend Cherwell’s local plan review, regardless of their planning inspector’s verdict, is even more urgent.\nThe assumptions on housing need used by the OGB have now been undermined by 2 independent studies, and a planning inspector. How much more evidence does the council need to admit that their proposals in Kidlington, Begbroke and Yarnton are misguided and woefully unsound?\nIt would be hugely irresponsible for a council to impose such sweeping and irreversible damage on local communities when they know that the data underpinning those plans is at best questionable and at worse completely wrong”\nThe planning inspector is expected to publish his response to the Cherwell Local plan review in the next few weeks.\nYou can see the full text of the planning inspector’s comments and questions on the city council plan here https://www.oxford.gov.uk/downloads/file/6397/ic1_-_inspectors_initial_questions_and_comments_to_occ",

Claiming, as they always do, that they have put ‘record’ levels of funding into education (as they also claim for health and so many other important services). But the devil is in the detail, with funding per pupil actually falling as class sizes increase.\nRegardless of claims to the contrary in their cobbled-together, un-costed manifesto, there are more cuts to come.

Indeed in Oxfordshire as a whole we retained 4 out of 6 deposits and showed voter shares up to 9.2% and in one local result we actually came second! Well done to Jenny Tamblyn!\nIn Banbury itself we knew we were never going to win, but we largely achieved the goal we had set ourselves of raising our profile in the constituency and showing people that the Green Party is the rightful repository of support from anyone concerned about real social justice and progressive politics.\nNationally, The Green Party has seen over a million people demonstrating that voting for what you believe in is never a waste of time. Our share of the vote was nearly 4 times what it was in 2010 and our membership increased by nearly 2000 in the two days after the election. In Oxfordshire we’ve had 56 new members in the last 2 days!\nWe now need to build on that support and engage more than ever with a local and national dialogue about how we want to see our society shaped for the future. The Greens have always been a party with long term vision and I think, as the next 5 years unfold, that vision is going to be needed more than ever.\nIn the meantime I’d like to thank all the Green supporters in the constituency that voted for me, and those who campaigned for me, put up posters, leafleted, knocked on doors and stood in the street with me. You’re some of the unsung heroes of this campaign and you should be rightly proud of your achievement.\nMy gratitude of course also goes out to my dedicated campaign team and members of The Banbury and Cherwell Green Party branch. In particular my agent and campaign manager John Haywood, researcher and adviser Colin Clark, our Chairman Chris Manley, the irrepressible Lisa Miller for her exertions on Facebook, and all those others too numerous to mention who have worked so hard over the last 5 years to get us where we are now.\nA special thank you goes to our press officer and my partner Fiona Mawson, who’s practical and emotional support was invaluable to me throughout the campaign, even though she beat me in the local elections!\nAfter the result of the general election we now more than ever need to see a continuation of the Green surge to offer the people of Britain an alternative to the Conservative agenda of austerity and cuts and the holding of the poor and vulnerable to ransom to pay for the lifestyles of the rich and privileged.\nMoreover we need to re-double our efforts to protect our cherished NHS from the clutches of private healthcare providers that will now be given a free reign by a government ideologically opposed to free and comprehensive state health provision.\nI’ll remain as our Prospective Parliamentary Candidate (PPC) for the foreseeable future, unless my circumstances change or the local branch decide they want or need someone new. So I’ll be keeping this website up and running as a place for me to drop the occasional post about local, national and global Green issues. I hope people will choose to engage with me on them during that time.\nIf you’d like to read more I have two other blogs you might like to follow. One on specific retail matters\nfiftyshadesofretail.wordpress.com\nand another on general political and human and animal rights issues\nwavinganddrowning.wordpress.com\nI also write regularly for Huffington Post\nwww.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton\nI hope we can keep the conversations going through what I think will be some very challenging years to come\nRegardless of our differing ideologies I’m never one to miss an opportunity to quote Churchill in circumstances like these, so I’ll leave you with his well known words –\n“This isn’t the end, it isn’t even the beginning of the end, but it might just be the end of the beginning”\nThanks again\nIan",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_2014_11_25_carry-on-westminster-the-tops-trumps-of-british-democracy/content_165.html": "This is a piece I wrote for Huffington Post earlier this week. I think it speaks for itself, although after it was published I thought I should have pointed out that none of the the politicians I refer to in the studio on election night were Greens. As usual we weren’t invited to the BBC party. There were however representatives from Labour, Conservative, Libdems and UKIP. Given that the Greens had a reasonably good showing in the last General Election in Rochester (for a ‘marginal’ party) I’d have thought we’d have been worth a mention at least. But apparently not.\nAnyway I hope this serves as a good first post on my website/blog and you can see the original article here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/westminster-politics_b_6199214.html?utm_hp_ref=tw.\nFeel free to comment below or on the original article on the Huffington Post site.\nI recently became a parliamentary candidate for the Green Party. After years of railing against politicians, the irony, and perhaps the hypocrisy, of becoming one myself has not been lost on me.\nThen again, there were the constant jibes about my complaining a lot but doing nothing positive to make a change. So when my local party group asked me to stand, I said I’d give it a go. And here I am. Feel free to point the finger.\nOne of the first things I’ve noticed about the underbelly of politics is just how strategic it is. Target wards, target seats, candidates standing in constituencies where they don’t live for the sake of political expediency. None of this is new, or unusual, or even un-democratic, but it does take some getting used to.\nBut watching the BBC election special on the Rochester and Strood by-election, you could be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the political world has turned into some kind of wife swapping party from the mid 70s. It seems these days that political manoeuvring between the ruling parties has moved beyond juggling their own family jewels, and has been reduced to chucking their keys into the fruit bowl with anyone who fancies a quick fumble with their majority.\nFirstly we had UKIP’s Deputy Chairperson Suzanne Evans being interviewed about where her party would go after the predicted win in Rochester. This consisted of a serious of nods and winks about who might and might not leap out of their own party bed and sneak into theirs when the neighbours weren’t looking. A sort of Carry-On Westminster, but with less laughs.\nShe then went on to explain, with barely concealed glee, that her fondest ambition was to seduce someone from Labour to join in their little tryst. Nigel is apparently talking to a couple of MPs but she couldn’t reveal more. She did everything but tap the side of her nose, elbow Andrew Neil in the ribs and give a little Babs Windsor giggle.\nThen we had an analysis from a political expert explaining how UKIP’s performance in the by-election would determine how other sitting MPs would behave in the run up to next years general election. His premise was that if UKIP did well in Rochester, many other career politicians would be considering their position in the next few months. The expectation is apparently that if they think UKIP is a better bet for them to hold on to their seat (ooh matron!), then they would switch allegiances in order to do so.\nNow you’ll have to excuse me. I’m quite new to this game. But when one joins a party isn’t there something about ideology written into the contract? Or am I now being ridiculously naive?\nJudging by the behaviour of at least two recent pantheons of British democracy I suppose I am. It seems that standing on a platform with a bunch of like minded individuals in the hope of doing something good for the country isn’t what it’s about any more.\nNo, apparently it’s more about hanging on to the House Of Commons parking place, the expense account, and access to the House of Commons bar, rather than the boring stuff like philosophical conviction. Some back-benchers are evidently more interested in maintaining a comfortable position for themselves, rather than for their constituents. Yet, in true British carry-on style, they still keep getting elected.\nAs a newcomer to this world, I saw with fresh eyes last night these four sombre suited politicians sitting uneasily with each other, smugly carving up the political cake amongst themselves. Like children at birthday party trying to decide who gets the last portion of jelly and ice cream, the polemic was about anything other than the issues that this country and the planet really face.\nIain Duncan Smith spent a good deal of his time justifying a particularly vituperative campaign poster that portrayed the idea of voting for Mark Reckless as on a par with seeking Pol Pot as a spiritual adviser. Reckless used to be an investment banker, he didn’t live in the area, he’d only moved there to take a safe seat. All very salient points for the local electorate, but ones that seemed exquisitely irrelevant when he was the Conservative MP only a few months ago.\nMeanwhile UKIP expounded their claim that they listened to the people, and were offering an alternative to the status quo of careerist politicians who’d never done a days honest labour in their lives. Odd then that their success last night, and in Clacton a few weeks ago, relied on exactly the reverse of those ideals by welcoming with open arms two MPs firmly rooted in the rotten political establishment they claimed to despise.\nOn the point of principle I am in total agreement with them. The current political establishment has reduced democracy to the level of swapping football cards in the playground. But it’s a tawdry game of top trumps that they have just as much of a hand in as all the other entrenched Westminster parties.\nIf this is the future of politics in this country, I’m glad to be a member of a party that currently stands as an exemplar of how it is still possible to operate democratically without playing these cynical games. We may now have one less MP than UKIP, but at least ours is there on merit, rather than because she swapped her rosette for a more appealing colour.\nAnd Caroline Lucas has just won MP of the year, which is something that gives me hope. Even so, she’s now the focus of a campaign to unseat her by the Labour party in Brighton, because, and despite of the fact, that Labour and the Greens share many of the same aims.\nMoreover, if all these people care about is hanging on to their positions at all costs, what really is the point? And if the electorate is so fickle that they can’t see through this charade, maybe we deserve the graceless, flagitious mess they all seem to be making of the world.\nOne apocryphal anecdote from Rochester I heard today was that someone had voted UKIP because the sitting Tory MP hadn’t done enough for the local area. If that’s true, it’s an indictment of the great British voter more demoralising than anything supposedly implied by hanging a flag out of the window of your mock-Georgian semi.\nBut as an accidental politician I have to hope that it isn’t true, or at least typical. I have to trust that people in the UK will see past all the identikit politicos, the vested interests and the horse trading of their democratic heritage, and vote for real change and genuine representation in the next government.\nI am ever the optimist.",

We have very ambitious plans and yes they will require a huge investment, both in terms of finance and resources.\nBut the existential threat to all of us from climate collapse demands urgent and ambitious action. We have 10 years to deal with these issues before we could be at a tipping point. If that happens, whatever we do won’t be enough https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/09/tipping-points-could-exacerbate-climate-crisis-scientists-fear\nWe have to push forward boldly now to make up for all those years when we did nothing.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_brexit/content_77.html": "We should have a second referendum on Brexit with a properly informed and unbiased debate on all the issues surrounding our relationship with the EU.\nThis has to happen immediately after the election to allow parliament to get back to dealing with the serious challenges facing this country. We don’t need to get brexit done, we need to be done with it, one way or the other, and the only way to decide that is with a vote.\nThe Green Party is now the ONLY party offering this option as a main policy pledge.\nLabour would renegotiate a deal with Europe which we have to assume they would back in any confirmatory referendum (assuming they honour their pledge to give us one). That defines them as a leave backing party. Jeremy Corbyn’s claim that he would be neutral in that campaign shows a continuation of the lack of direction that Labour has had since this whole thing began. If they’re going to back Remain, then why negotiate another deal (assuming that’s even possible), they should be honest with the electorate and get off the fence!\nThe Libdems are standing on a platform of revoke without a second vote, which I regard as deeply undemocratic. We got ourselves into this position democratically, and we have to get out of it the same way. We can’t simply treat the first vote as if it didn’t happen. the claim that an electoral victory that would put them into government goes against their own argument (and the Green Party’s) that our electoral system is broken. Unless they had more than 50% of the electorate voting them into power, that would not be a mandate for a revoking Article 50. As most governments of recent years have been elected on less that 30%, they would not be able to claim they were taking the majority of the country with them.\nAs for the Tories, we know they would throw us off the cliff-edge with or without a deal, without a second thought, let alone a second referendum! Just so that Boris Johnson could claim that he’d “got Brexit done”. Even if that means the majority of the country that now appears to want to remain would get ‘done over’!\nDemocracy did not stop in 2016. We’ve seen over the past three and a half years that the easy Brexit we were told we would get after the referendum has proved anything but. Not only does this suggest that people may have changed their minds, it also means that the demographic of the country has changed and that new population, who will have to deal with the outcome of Brexit, should now get a say. Either way, we know a lot more now about the reality of Brexit than any of us did back in 2016. Surely we should all be able to re-assess our decisions based on this new information.\nMost polls now say the majority would vote to remain in the EU. I don’t know if that’s true, or if that’s how a second vote would pan out. But I think we should find out.\nI also think those who say the ‘will of the people’ is still to leave shouldn’t be scared to find out. If they’re right, the result of the vote will be the same. If they’re worried that it might not be, that suggests they know that the will of the people has changed, and they simply want to ignore that. That’s not democracy. That’s ignoring the will of the people!\nMy personal position is that a second vote should be binding (the first one wasn’t) and after that, the decision is final. If that decision is to leave, I will no longer challenge it. I would instead switch my focus to working towards mitigating the worst of the damage that I think will inevitably be done to the social and economic fabric of this country.\nLeaving the EU by any means will result in at least a decade of economic hardship for everyone, with the poorest in our society suffering the most.\nParliamentary time will be used up on dealing with the fallout from the severing of our membership of the EU rather than tackling urgent business, such as crumbling public services and climate change.\nBusinesses will suffer and investment will fall (except in the case of US drugs companies seeking to buy our NHS!).\nWe must not condemn our citizens to this fate without a fully informed confirmatory vote.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_real-estate/content_121.html": "I’ve been involved in retail for as long as I can remember. From my first proper job as a Saturday boy in a menswear store in Lewisham through my days as a market trader in Camden Lock and Greenwich to being co-founder of a national high street chain that started with a small store in Oxford selling silver jewellery. and grew into a national chain trading in 6 of country’s major retail locations, including London’s prestigious Covent Garden.\nIn that time I saw almost as many ups as I did downs. I’ve half jokingly said that I spent 20 years building the business and then another 10 trying extricating it from the failing high street. Like so many other retailers who entered the high street during the boom years in the early 1990s, I fell foul of the simultaneous boom in commercial property development. So many new malls were opened in the 90s and early 2000s it was difficult to keep up and I opened stores in some of the most iconic examples such as the New Bullring in Birmingham and Bluewater in Kent.\nThe other boom at the time was in business rates, which along with rents skyrocketed through that period as institutional landlords, mostly backed by large pension funds, cashed in on the retail bubble ploughing millions into new shiny malls based on the emerging US model. It was great while it lasted and we all became caught up in the heady days of seemingly limitless opportunities. But we soon discovered there were limits.\nThe Financial crash in 2008 gave us all a pretty sharp reality check and things soon started to become far less buoyant and rents that had been agreed on the back of rude profit margins started to look far less tenable as turnovers started to fall.\nThere soon followed a series of frantic rounds of renegotiation with landlords who themselves were facing the prospect of huge hole in their new developments as retailers started to fall over with alarming regularity. In many cases we were able to come to mutual agreements to keep us trading at the shopping malls looking full, but the one thing that couldn’t be re-negotiated were business rates. Set as they were, by the central valuation office, and administered by local authorities, they were completely devoid of any chance of concession unless you had an understanding council. In my experience their understanding was rather limited, and after 5 years as a local councillor myself I now understand more about why that was.\nSo we were all caught in a perfect storm that only a few managed to emerge from. My business was one of the luckier ones as I managed to negotiate deals that gave us breathing space. But I could see the writing on the wall and it was telling me to get out of the high street and decamp to the internet where so many of our competitors were lurking. Thereby hangs another very long story.\nBut suffice to say I have an intimate understanding of the plight of the high street, in fact much more intimate than I would prefer. For that reason one of my personal priorities as a fresh faced new MP would be to push for a new system of business rates or local high street taxation. Other things like rent controls and use classes would also be high on the agenda, but none of this will be an easy fix for an industry in the doldrums after so many years in decline. But I know from my own experience that smaller independents are both the lifeblood of local high streets whilst also being the most vulnerable.\nIn terms of the dreaded business rates, I think I could take elements from the land tax approach of the Green party and add in some aspect of a local purchase tax as seen in the USA. Such a tax would be far more progressive and have more respect for the ability of businesses to pay such an additional tax. That would give a far greater connection between the local community, local authorities and the retailers themselves. If all retailers did well then they would all reap the benefits.\nSpeaking to local councillors and retailers about business rates reform\nI don’t really have the answer to full business rates reform, but I’ve been campaigning for a better system for over 10 years. I would advocate a situation where we involved existing high street retailers in the process of finding a solution. There have been past attempts at doing this, but very few, if any, involved small independent retailers. I think that was a mistake.\nThe Labour Party have boldly announced that they would scrap the current business rates system, but they haven’t said what they would replace it with. I’ve been here before many times, and both Labour and the Tories have frequently promised reform but never delivered on that. One of the biggest reason is that business rates are a virtually guaranteed income for government bringing in over £13bn a year. Even if the premises are empty, the landlord cops for the bill so it’s a win-win for Westminster. So any new system is likely to be just as iniquitous and damaging, especially to smaller operators.\nI think there is a way of developing a system of local high street taxation that could benefit all sides of the equation, including the consumer. Just scrapping the business rates system with no plan for what would replace it is not a solution, yet its the current proposal from the part that is most likely to form the next government in a few weeks. If I was in Westminster I’d hope to be able to provide a far better insight into the problems on the high street and how to engage with the people who face those problems every day.\nI’d like to see genuine consultation with high street stakeholders, including landlords and local councils, about the best way forwards. As a long term retailer, having moved from being a small business, through a larger expansion and back to being a ‘born again independent’, I’d like to be involved in that process. But I guess it remains to be seen what the outcome is on July 4th.\nI’ve just published a video I made during a recent visit to Bicester with some thoughts on how we can work towards a better system of high street business taxation and help to repair our broken high streets and you can watch that by clicking here.\nIf you’re a retailer or just someone who enjoys browsing physical shops, I’d suggest you vote for someone like me who has the experience to make that a viable possibility again. Retail is at the heart of every village, town and city and needs political support to make it vibrant again. Many politicians claim to have the answer but few of them have been on the inside of the industry. I think that needs to change. I’d like to change it.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_votegreen2017/content_179.html": "I love a bit of comedy as much as the next person, but I do sometimes wish comedians would stay out of politics.\nIn 2015 Russell Brand advised young people not to vote as part of his personal philosophy of half-baked revolution. As a result he bears some of the blame for a Conservative majority borne on the backs of the large number of older voters who didn’t see the 2 minutes it took to mark an X on a ballot sheet as so desperately uncool.\nThis time we have Ricky Gervais leaping into the fray with this tweet :\n“OK. I’m not telling you how to vote, but this is a fact. The only vote that will keep Theresa May out is a vote for @jeremycorbyn. Cheers”\nWhilst not quite so devoid of acumen as Brand’s ill-conceived advice, Ricky’s more well meaning call to action could be equally as dangerous.\nEssentially he IS telling his fans how to vote, and his less politically astute followers may not realise the pitfalls of such a binary choice.\nThe reality is that in many constituencies a vote for Corybn will not keep Theresa May out. The real fact is that it may do the exact opposite.\nSadly, even after repeated calls from other parties to enter into an ad-hoc alliance, Labour has resolutely refused to stand aside in any constituency. Whereas, for example, The Green Party has done so now in well over 30 seats.\nIn many of those seats the Libdems have a much better chance of winning than Labour. In some others the Greens or the SNP could have it in the bag. Voting Labour could then very well help the Tories by splitting the opposition.\nBy selling the idea that a vote for Labour is a vote against the Tories, no matter where you are, The Labour party and many of its supporters could be handing another victory to the Conservatives.\nI’m not usually an advocate of tactical voting, but needs must when the devil drives, and I see the devil behind the eyes of the Conservatives. But tactical voting has to be just that. It doesn’t simply mean voting Labour as the only alternative.\nUnder our broken electoral system the only place votes really count are in marginal constituencies. Until we get electoral reform and a system of proportional representation, that won’t change. And let’s not forget that Labour supports our first past the post system just as much as the Tories do.\nBut even in a safe seat your vote can make a real difference. In 2015 UKIP gave the Conservatives a real run for their money. Even though they only won one seat in Parliament they put the Tories on notice that they were there, close behind, snapping at their heels.\nThe result was the delivery of a referendum on EU membership and the subsequent lurch to the right that followed in the footsteps of Theresa May. The Conservative manifesto, such as it is, represents one of the most extreme right outlooks for the UK for many generations. It makes Margaret Thatcher’s vision look like a tie-dyed, rose tinted call to action for the love generation. It has even been compared to the BNP’s warped ideological ramblings from the 1980s, and not without cause.\nThis can be directly traced to UKIP’s influence and its validation of ideals that make a hard line, right wing agenda more palatable to people who wouldn’t dream of dancing to the tune of more overtly hard right parties.\nLikewise the nomination and election of Jeremy Corbyn can, to a large extent, be laid at the feet of the Green Party. There can’t be many Greens who haven’t noticed just how many of our clothes have recently been stolen by Corbyn’s party. And many of us are happy to be standing here in our underwear, glad that so many of our policies have been subsumed into the Labour manifesto. The sincerest form of flattery and all that.\nBut it has to be remembered that the rise of Green membership and our increasing success in both national and local elections is arguably a major driving force behind Labour’s newly rediscovered left wing credentials and a strong Green vote will help them keep that focus.\nVoting for parties that may not be mainstream, and may not have a chance of winning is not a wasted vote. Even less so in constituencies where the seat is safer than a Roy Chubby Brown joke at a UKIP convention. A vote for the party that more closely reflects your views has a demonstrable impact on those do so to a lesser extent.\nIn the case of Labour, voting for them in constituencies they can’t win may not just prevent other parties from doing so, it also reinforces the status quo of a de facto two party state and removes Labour’s incentive to join an alliance or support electoral reform if, as is still being predicted, they don’t have a majority on June 9th.\nEven if Labour were to win, there’s a very good chance that Corbyn could be unseated early on in his reign, by a parliamentary party who still don’t wholeheartedly support him. Without the threat of other left wing alternatives looking over their shoulders, it’s entirely possible that Labour will drift back to the same Tory-lite, neoliberalism that they were so conformable with last time.\nSo unless you have a realistic opportunity of a tactical vote in your constituency, just voting for the ‘other guy’ (or gal) won’t send any sort of message other than a validation of entrenched positions.\nIf you’re not going to see real change this time around. If your vote is only going to be lost in a sea of others who voted forlornly for the a close second, or the next best thing, use it to support those who will affect real change in the longer term by holding toes to the fire in the meantime.",

This gives us 4 members now having grown from the single member we had in 2019 (me).\nAs I reported last year we were poised to take control in 2023 as part of a 4 way alliance with the Lib Dems, Labour and the Independents. That whole project collapsed at the 11th hour when Labour pulled out of the deal because the didn’t want to work with the Greens. So we had to double our efforts this year to gain additional seats, along with the Lib Dems so that we could finish the job of removing the Conservatives from power across the whole of Oxfordshire. This was something both our parties had promised in 2023 but at that point without Labour’s support we couldn’t deliver on that pledge.\nHappily this year we can!\nAlong with our Lib Dem colleagues we had the numbers this year to take minority control of the council. Sadly we are still 3 seats short of an overall majority, but we felt we needed to deliver on our promises and so have formed an administration. The comprises of two groups – the Lib Dems, who now sit as a single group rather than as part of a group with the Greens and the Independents who have now formed their own separate group which I lead. We joined with the single independent who had previously ben part of the Progressive Oxfordshire Group – the alliance I was a founding member of in 2019.\nOur new group is called the Green and Independent Alliance, which neatly forms the acronym ‘GAIA’ which we thought was appropriate for a group of 4 Greens and one Independent, especially as the independent member is a Green in all but name.\nOur two groups have now signed a formal coalition agreement to run the council together with 2 Greens, Myself and To Beckett sitting on the executive in Green and Environment roles.\nThis is a great outcome for us and we hope for the people of Cherwell. We hope to make the district a better place to live and work for everyone as well as improving nature recovery and tackling climate change.\nOf course we have since been overtaken by events when on the very day we agreed our new administration Rishi Sunak called a General Election. I must admit that this rather caught us all on the hop just as we were all starting to get to grips with our new leadership roles on the council. This is even more tricky for me since I am the Green Party Parliamentary candidate for the new constituency of Bicester and Woodstock. There will be more on that in my next post.",

It was a worrying time for all of us and as a new County Councillor I had to quickly come to terms with my new responsibilities whilst navigating remote meetings and all the various limitations that were placed on all of us in our day to day lives. I know people who were personally affected by the virus and some that still are. Thankfully I and most of my family came out unscathed, although I did lose a close family member to the virus who I still miss today.\nCovid now seems like a distant memory as we all deal with other issues, not least the cost of living crisis, the ongoing lack of affordable housing and the pressures on our health service. We are also about to see seismic changes in the way local government operates which means that this is likely to be the last County Council election in Oxfordshire.\nWe also have boundary changes to the County Council which sees my current division of Kidlington South split into 2 new divisions – Kidlington East and Kidlington West. This left me with a dilemma about which division to stand in for this election. Ultimately I chose Kidlington East which includes most of the area that is also covered by my District Council Ward. I’ve dealt with a lot of casework in this part of my current division and there are still a number of ongoing issues so I feel I have to try to maintain some contiunity there.\nWe do also have a strong Green candidate in Kidlington West though, which includes Yarnton and Begbroke as well as Roundham ward in Kidlington. My wife and fellow councillor District and Parish Councillor Fiona Mawson is standing there and I hope she will be able to provide some continuity of representation there, as well as building on her 10 years experience as a Yarnton Parish Councillor where she is currently the Deputy Chair.\nOver the next 2-3 years there will also be a further reorganisation of local government which will see a single authority combining the remits of both the District and the County Council. The details of how this will be achieved are still being hammered out but there are concerns that moving to a larger, more remote authority could reduce local engagement.\nThere are also moves being made by the City Council to expand their borders to swallow up areas like Kidlington, Gosford, Yarnton and Begbroke into one larger authority. I don’t think that’s what local residents want. Neither do I think it will be in their best interests. So I will be fighting to maintain the integrity of all our local villages to prevent us becoming just a suburb of Oxford city.\nOn top of this we have to deal with the creation of a new local plan amidst sweeping changes to the planning process which could also see a significant erosion of local democracy. This is likely to lead to even more erosion of our surrounding green spaces, especially if the City Council get their way.\nSo it’s clear that, during the next few years, we will need strong voices at all levels of local government in Oxfordshire to ensure we end up with a workable model that truly represents local residents and responds to their needs. I would like to continue to be that voice for Kidlington East\nWhilst I hope we won’t be facing anything on the scale of Covid again for a very long time, there could be other equally disruptive events on the world stage coming our way. We are now seeing the impacts of climate change on our communities with increased incidents of flooding which has brought misery to many residents. I’m working hard to try to reduce the impact of that and we’ve seen new measures introduced locally to support residents faced with the threat of flooding. I am continuing to push for more.\nSo I hope you will choose to support me again in the County Elections on May 1st to work for you as probably your last county councillor before the changes are made to local government structures. I still feel there’s work to be done in the division, not least in the face of some of the new developments that over the next few years that could have significant impacts on all our lives along with the challenges posed by national government and global events.\nI’m trying to get round to meet as many people on the doorstep as possible, but with all the changes going on at the moment, it’s a huge task. If you’d like me to come and see you to discuss any local issues please contact me and I’ll try to arrange something. Otherwise feel free to email, message or call me.",

Emergency measures call for committed and ambitious actions, not vague aspirations and get-out clauses. The climate takes no prisoners. It doesn’t care what we think is possible, it only responds to what is needed. We need to move faster and be more ambitious in our climate change mitigation measures and take into account the impact of all council policies on climate change\nMy amendment was supported by Labour and Independent members, but was blocked by the Conservatives (as usual).\nAs if to prove the point, in a later debate on the main modifications to the local plan partial review, campaigners from North Oxford Golf Club pleaded with the council to protect their 103-year-old club grounds from proposed development. This would include the destruction of a large number of trees. The Council’s proposals also call for the release of yet more green belt land and the virtual erasure of the previously sacrosanct ‘Kidlington Gap’.\nLabour and Libdem councillors opposed the motion along with me for the Greens. The proposals were agreed with all but one Conservative voting them through.\nYet again we see Cherwell’s Conservatives talking the talk on climate change, but when it comes to positive action they default to business as usual\nIt makes no sense to anyone other than Cherwell’s Tories to propose a measure to increase tree numbers in the district in one motion and then vote in the very same meeting to destroy hundreds of mature trees in the face of massive opposition from local residents and environmental campaigners.\nIt’s clear from this, and from the lack of any solid progress on the climate emergency proposals 6 months on from passing them, that Cherwell’s Conservatives simply want to box-tick the climate change issue, whilst pursuing broader policies on unnecessary growth that will be hugely damaging to the environment.",

The City Council chooses not to meet that need and instead pushes it on to the surrounding districts such as Cherwell and South Oxfordshire.\nI joined the protest as Wolvercote directly abuts my district council ward in Cherwell and is likely to impact heavily on Kidlington, especially on top of the extra development that is planned for the area around Kidlington, Gosford and Water Eaton, Yarnton and Begbroke, assuming that goes ahead.\nI made a short video giving some of the context which you can watch using this link below.\nThe people of Wolvercote and North Oxford send a message to St Johns College Oxford University\nWe need to stand up against the same brazen greed that is motivating the concreting over of our precious green spaces before it’s too late. You’ll have a chance to send a message to those councillors who backed these projects in the election in May.\nIn Cherwell the plans were promoted and pushed through by the Conservative ruling group in the face of massive opposition from local residents which they completely disregarded and continue to ignore. In Oxford the Labour run City Council continues to apply pressure on other districts to deal with the housing need the city is making worse by using spaces like these to build more economic development rather than affordable housing,\nGreens have always stood against this sort of opportunistic expansionism for profit and we always will.",

Areas near the kerbside are heavily damaged making for an uncomfortable and dangerous ride for cyclists and other road users. Yet repeated requests to the council and reports on Fix My Street have gone unheeded.\nNow, in the wake of increased cycling as a result of the pandemic, cycle lane symbols have appeared on this road on top of the cracks and potholes, with no attempt to repair the long-standing degradation of the road surface.\nOther roads, such as the Bicester Road, have had painted cycle lanes on the main carriageway for some time, but there are also poorly maintained and often blocked by parked cars meaning cyclists have to face oncoming traffic to navigate them. This is particularly bad given that this road has a local school and is also subject to an air quality management area.\nBut I was gobsmacked when I saw the cycling symbol on Yarnton Road. This is a road that I regularly cycle down and it’s a real bone shaker. It’s no exaggeration to say that you have to hang on for dear life as you bounce along the road near the curbs, dodging potholes and cracks. It’s especially dangerous at night.\nThe road forms part of a national cycling route, but you’d never know it to look at the surface of the carriageway. It’s certainly not for the faint-hearted! I couldn’t believe they just slapped a cycle symbol on the road without any attention to its terrible condition.\nIt takes more than a pot of paint and a stencil to create a cycle path. The road surface has to be fit for riders if they are to be encouraged to use it. Even motorists complain about the state of this road. How does the council expect cyclists to cope as they rattle across these severely damaged and uneven surfaces? This is just pure tokenism!\nIt just goes to show how little the council knows or cares about the plight of cyclists in the county. If they really want to encourage more sustainable transport, especially post COVID, they have to take cyclists needs into proper account when carrying out road maintenance rather than literally just painting over the cracks!\nWe need more Green councillors on the county council to take these sorts of issue seriously and deliver real improvements for cyclists, pedestrians and other road users, rather than these half-hearted token gestures from a council devoid of real leadership and direction.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_cherwell-district-council_page_2/content_83.html": "In Kidlington affordable housing is not just difficult to find, it’s pretty much impossible. Recognised as one of the most expensive areas of the district to live in, Kidlington does have some affordable housing in areas but the problem is that most of it is owned and allocated by the City Council. Indeed large areas of the village have been given over to the city’s needs, not least Grovelands which was built almost entirely for the City Council’s use.\nAnd soon we’ll have even more, with the local plan partial review, which was adopted in 2020 after 3 years of objection and protest from local residents and pressure groups, providing yet more housing for the City’s needs with the 50% so-called affordable element having been signed over to the City Council’s control in a closed meeting during the first lockdown in 2020.\nWe all know that the term ‘affordable housing’ is virtually meaningless in Oxfordshire, but even so, very little is built in Kidlington. Even when the district council’s policy to to ensure that 30% of all new housing on larger estates is ‘affordable’, we hardly see anything being built that fulfils that criteria.\nThe flats above the Co-op were essentially given over to the flying school for their exclusive use, even though 3 of the apartments were meant to be available for residents needing affordable accommodation. At least 15 of those flats should have been designated affordable, but the district council messed up the planning application and we ended up with just 3 units available, with the rest being let on the open market. The agreement with developer in that case was so badly negotiated that in 3 years only 1 of those flats has been let on an affordable basis. The terms demand that the council must nominate someone within a 28 day window once a year which is almost impossible to do.\nFlats on the old Co-Op car park site now almost exclusively let to a local flying school at market rent\n15 more flats are due to be built on the Kidlington Garage site at the top of the Bicester Road. When the planning application was agreed the developers were supposed to provide £609,000 in lieu of the 5 affordable apartments. But 6 months later they returned to the planning committee with a viability assessment that argued they couldn’t afford to make any contribution at all. Nothing! Zilch!\nThis is because the government mandates that developers should be guaranteed a profit of 20% on all developments (how nice it would be for other businesses to be guaranteed a profit by the government!). This leaves it open for developers to game the system and make claims that they can’t meet this profitability threshold and thereby reduce or, as in this case, completely remove their responsibility to provide any affordable units or money in lieu.\nI and my fellow Green Councillor Fiona Mawson thought this was wrong and we tabled a motion to refuse the planning application if no affordable element was provided. Sadly, as we and our opposition group are outnumbered on the planning committee, the plans were approved by the Conservative majority.\nSubsequently I brought a motion to the council to increase our affordable requirement on larger developments from 30% to 50% to bring us in line with the City policy. As we have agreed to that percentage on the developments being built in and around Kidlington for the City Council, I thought it only fair that we should give our own residents the same consideration. I was pleased to see that the motion was passed almost unanimously.\nIt’s still sobering to think though that out of around 90 apartments that have been built in Kidlington in the past 5 years, only 3 have been designated affordable and as I explained above, out of those 3, only one has actually been let to a family that needed it.\nCherwell is desperately in need of a change of direction in this issue. We need a council who is prepared to stand up to developers and push for better deals for all our residents. Moreover we need to ensure more affordable developments are brought on line that will benefit local families rather than forcing them to split up as grown children need to move away from their area simply because they can’t afford a home of their own. I believe a change of administration next month could see that better direction and I hope to be a part of that.",

But it’s no worse now than it was under the last Conservative controlled administration. In fact it’s probably a bit better in terms of how responsive our road management team are.\nI appreciate that seeing so many potholes is frustrating. I’m reporting them every day and they have become more numerous recently after the changeable weather. Crews are out every day fixing them but it’s a battle to try to get the worst ones prioritised and everyone understandably wants to see those in their area fixed first. But the problem with repairing them is not lack of willingness by the council, it’s lack of money/resources.\nNot a new problem\nDuring the last year of the Tory run administration on OCC a story was run in the Oxford Mail which reported that an insurance company had ranked Oxfordshire fifth worst for the number of potholes reported between 2015 and 2018. Figures showed 93,112 potholes were reported during that period amounting to 19.6 potholes per km of road.\nThe figures, from The Insurance Emporium, showed other areas worse than Oxfordshire include East Riding of Yorkshire, Northamptonshire, Edinburgh and in top spot Devon as the worst for potholes. From personal experience I’d add our sister county Buckinghamshire to that list having driven though there recently, their roads make ours look like billiard tables!\nBut the current state of the roads is something that has been building up for years due to lack of investment by successive governments. I’m not even going to blame the Conservatives for it (as they are trying to do to us now) except to say that, as a Conservative administration themselves, they could probably have leant on the government a bit more to stump up some extra cash for repairs instead of borrowing their way out of the problem and saddling us with yet more debt that taxpayers will carry for years. Even then they still didn’t sort the problem out, because quite frankly it’s not sortable without massive investment.\nOxfordshire’s highways need about £45m a year just to stop them getting any worse. The council get less than a third of that from government and another third from local taxation. Some of the remaining third is covered by borrowing that was taken out by the previous administration that will run out in 2025 (although we’ll be paying millions in interest for many years to come). No one really knows where the funding will come from to cover that when that happens. A good chunk of that funding also goes on bridge repairs, and as many of you will have noticed, our bridges are also falling apart as well and if we have a catastrophic bridge failure the result could be a lot more serious than a puncture!\nOur existing roads, are essentially worn out due to lack of proper maintenance for decades. The main cause of this is lack of central government funding made worse by the austerity measures during the last 10 years. It would now cost billions across the county to bring them all up to a decent standard and that doesn’t include pathways.\nIn the meantime the government forces local authorities to build more roads through “growth schemes” tied to essential housing that they won’t provide enough funding to maintain in the future. So the deficit continues to widen.\nPlaying politics\nLets stop playing politics over potholes. Every party blames the other for the state of the roads , but ultimately it’s a matter of investment. We all hate potholes and we all know they shouldn’t be there, but it’s daft to suggest that not fixing them is a deliberate choice for any controlling administration. If we had the spare money, don’t you think we’d spend it just to get the problem off our desks? And before people jump on the usual “if you didn’t spend it on this or that, you could fix X number of potholes” remember that government is all about making those decisions. A few £100K here or there is never going to fix the problems we have with road maintenance now we need billions if we’re going to sort this mess out.\nAs an administration we are absolutely focussed on doing the best with what we have on pothole repairs. The response time on repairs is now much better, but I accept there’s still room for improvement, particularly in terms of the longevity of some of the repairs. But we are going to need serious cash if we’re going to meet residents’ expectations and any politician who tells you otherwise is just using this issue as a campaigning tool. The only ways to get those funds is an increase in council tax, a reduction in other vital services or a very significant injection of funding from the government – and I don’t mean the paltry £3m or so that they recently announced for Oxfordshire coincidentally just before the local elections!\nSo if you really want to see a longer term systemic improvement you need to lobby the government to properly support local authorities. While you’re at it, you could mention a similar situation with health and social care, especially as they’ve just cut promised funding for carers in half!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_nick-clegg/content_359.html": "The government announced plans today for a new ‘Garden City’ to be built on ex-MOD land on the outskirts of Bicester in Oxfordshire. The proposals will be backed by £100M of government funds and will include ‘sustainable’ transport infrastructure, green spaces and new local amenities.\nOn the face of it this could be a boost for Bicester, but I suspect the devil will be in the details.\nMuch of the announcement seems to cover projects that are already in planning or underway. The new railway station for example. There’s also some confusion over if this is to be a re-imagining of the much vaunted eco-village or an entirely new project.\nIt is encouraging however to see that the project is to be built on a brown field site.\nConfusingly, the definition of a ‘garden city’ is being left to the developer’s imaginations with the government saying it doesn’t want to “impose any definition of what garden cities are”. This could likely mean we’ll end up with another estate full of either ‘luxury homes’ that ordinary people can’t afford, or shoe-boxes crammed together to generate maximum profit. That would probably mean any aspirations to provide gardens and green space will go right out the window.\nIf Nick Clegg really wants this to be development different from all the other clone estates thrown up around the country, I’m afraid he’s going to have to nail his colours to some sort of mast and properly define his intentions. But that might prove more difficult than a glib press release full of utopian imagery.\nThere would also need to be a clear vision that the people living in this new ‘city’ will be contributing to the local economy and society as well as working in it. With a train station on the doorstep, such a development could easily become a dormitory for London commuters or a sink hole of buy-to-let properties.\nAffordability will be the key. If these homes are intended for people on middle and lower incomes, then I’d support the idea. But I suspect such values won’t be compatible with what Nick Clegg sees as a ‘garden city’.\nPersonally I’d like to see more genuine thinking along these lines, subject to the above caveats. But ultimately this may all just come to nothing.\nSo many of these big legacy projects either evaporate into the ether once they’ve generated enough headlines, or turn into something very different once the realities of cost, demand and political will begin to bite.\nThere’s a veritable tsunami of these grandiose announcements coming out from government at the moment though. Like the spurious claims for new spending on road infrastructures announced earlier this week, many of them are just old or existing projects being re-launched as new spend to give the impression of a go-ahead administration full of exciting possibilities for the future.\nAnyone would think there was an election round the corner!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_page_5/content_239.html": "I am still trying to remain open-minded about Oxford United Football Club’s proposals to build an 18000 seater stadium on green belt land that forms part of the Kidlington Gap at Stratfield Brake. But as the County and District Councillor for the area that Stratfield Brake sits within, I think the County Cabinet’s agreement to enter into negotiations with OUFC was premature, given that there were still so many unanswered questions a year on from the initial approaches from the club to the council.\nOf course we all want to help the club find a new home, but if we’re talking about using public assets to do that, we need transparency about what they’ve done to help themselves. For example, we still don’t have evidence that they’ve have explored all legal remedies to stay where they are.\nIt also appeared from the club’s own long-awaited report that they hadn’t even started looking at other alternative sites until October last year, after claiming at the beginning of 2022 that they had already explored all other options.\nAfter waiting 8 months for the full report on the club’s plans, it took a further 2 months for it to be circulated to stakeholders in a heavily edited form which doesn’t suggest that they are willing to be as transparent with local residents and stakeholders as they have claimed in the past.\nKidlington Parish Council (KPC) had been waiting for most of last year for the report from the club showing their detailed plans for the main Stratfield Brake site (which they are leaseholders of) so that they could be put out to local consultation. They could not take a decision on relinquishing their lease until they had consulted with the local residents who they represent.\nThe club has tried to blame the council for delays in making a decision on the initial very broad proposals but that was simply not the case. KPC wanted to make a decision on an informed basis and had been working towards a genuine local consultation, but to facilitate that they needed details of what the club were proposing. Thus any delay in the decision by the council are entirely the fault of the football club. Instead of engaging properly with KPC to help them hold a local consultation, they have gone around them by moving their plans to the site known as the Triangle which KPC has no direct control over.\nAs a result, I made a plea to the cabinet to include an amendment to the proposals to enter into negotiations with the club that would also commit the council to a full local consultation on the proposals before any final decision was made which should include the option to accept or reject the proposals. This wasn’t even responded to.\nAs the local county councillor I was disappointed that my call to the County Cabinet for a full local consultation didn’t seem to be endorsed. That would at least have given local residents some comfort that their views, both for and against the proposals, would be properly taken into account.\nThere was a reference to future engagement with stakeholders but it’s not clear who would undertake this and if it would be at a point where the local community would have a chance to say yes or no to the plans once they know what they are. With so many questions still left unanswered, we need a definite assurance that such a consultation will be part of the final decision process, otherwise we may find ourselves overtaken by circumstances as plans progress and positions become embedded”.\nWhilst I’m pleased to see the council took note of local concerns raised in last year’s country-wide engagement exercise, what is being proposed now is a rather different prospect and doesn’t completely deal with local views about having yet another significant development sited on some of Kidlington’s dwindling green spaces.\nIf we’re going to condone building on the green belt we need to ensure there is quantifiable local support for that. There are a range of views, as we saw at the meeting, and I want to make sure I’m fully representing the balance of local opinion, but until we ask the whole community we don’t know what that is.\nMy position as the local councillor for the area is that I have to support the majority view of the residents that will be affected by this development whatever they are. I don’t understand why there is a resistance from both the club and their fans as well as the council to asking local people directly what they think of this idea. There may be opposition, but there may equally be majority support for the plans. If so we can proceed on that basis knowing that the club would be welcomed by the village. Surely that would be a better outcome for all concerned, especially OUFC’s owners who I assume wouldn’t want to impose themselves on to a community that would resent them being there.\nI will continue to advocate for a full local consultation both internally within the council and with other local representatives, particularly the local MP Layla Moran.",

I was tweeted tonight by a parent led group campaigning against cuts in school funding in Oxfordshire asking if I realised just how bad the situation was.\nAt this point I’m the only candidate to reply. But maybe the others will catch up later.\nBut playing catch-up seems to be the way for our education system, with a report coming out only a few days ago on the dire state of repair of some school buildings. As someone who went to school in the 70s, I find it shocking that we should have let our education system become so under-valued in such a short period of time.\nMy best friend from back in those days keeps in touch with me, and he has just retired as a senior head teacher. He now does consultancy work for schools that are suffering under the same system he battled through. Essentially the privatisation of our education system that does little to help students and puts a lot of money into the pockets of Academy shareholders.\nThe future of our children should not be for sale to the highest bidder, and we should not be seeing a situation where parents have to raise hundreds of pounds to subsidise books or pay for bus passes so their children can actually get to school. Again, I remember free bus passes for school-children, but that seems like a long-lost utopia now.\nWe need an education system that provides opportunity to everyone. Schools that cater for all levels of ability and aspiration. The chance for everyone who wants to move on to further and higher education to do so without saddling themselves with a lifetime of debt.\nWe also need to value our teachers and educators, paying them a decent salary and ensuring they have fair conditions to work in. Like doctors and nurses they are taken far too much for granted and expected to cope with appalling stress simply because they are dedicated people.\nThe Conservative’s promises of extra funding don’t come close to addressing the problems that have been stored up over the past 10 years. Their so-called ‘extra’ spending amounts to nothing more than setting the clock back to the point before they imposed austerity on us all.\nSee the Green Party Manifesto by clicking here. Go to page 55 to see our comprehensive range of proposals and policies about revitalising our education system and bringing schools into the 21sct century, whilst unlocking the potential of students and teachers at all levels.\nA proper education for the next generation should be a priority for all of us.

But we’re used to tall orders. In the face of what seems like a deliberate policy of starving us of media attention in favour of far more ratings grabbing pint-swilling politico-celebs like Nigel Farage, we’re still garnering support from credible commentators and respected political analysts for both our economic and social justice proposals.\nFormer Citibank financial trader Gary Stevenson and host of the You Tube Channel Gary’s Economics has analysed the Green Party manifesto and classified it as the most credible and honest in real terms. In a recent video he confirmed that he would be voting Green because we are the only party to be offering a radical and workable alternative to the proposals from every other party.\nTrade Unionist and former General Secretary of the Labour Party Jennie Formby has also announced on Twitter that she would be voting Green in this election along with numerous other high profile political and cultural leaders such as George Monbiot. It’s also reported that more and more young people are turning to the Greens as a real alternative to the ping-pong politics of the past 50 years.\nAs a moderate Green myself I’ve always seen the Greens as a true alternative vote, neither left or right. The Green Party officially rejects the traditional left–right political spectrum, describing it as “something of an anachronism” and that perfectly fits with my view on the world.\nI’m standing as the Parliamentary Candidate for Bicester and Woodstock mainly because it’s my home constituency and the place I’ve made my home for 32 years. But above all that, it’s a place I’ve seen change drastically in that time with even more drastic changes in the pipeline. From the massive development plans in and around Kidlington, Yarnton, Begbroke and Bicester with large areas of greenbelt being decimated by ill-conceived local plans to proposals to armour plate 3500 acres of green fields and farmland for hugely unpopular solar farm project in the west. I’m concerned about what these things will do to the place I’ve called home for nearly half my life.\nThere’s obviously going to be a lot more to say on this election in the remaining 2 weeks, much of which I’ve not said so far due to dealing with my new responsibilities on Cherwell District Council after being appointed to the executive on the same night that the General Election was announced (great timing Rishi!). But I’ll be breaking my silence over the next 2 weeks.\nIn the meantime, doors are being knocked, leaflets are being delivered and pollsters are polling. There’s been a huge amount of speculation about who can win in this constituency and I’m not going to add to that with my own obviously biased opinions. But with a newly drawn boundary, every voter has the historic opportunity to vote in a brand new Westminster constituency for the first time where we could all buck the trends and help me and the Greens to show that any prediction in an unknown and untested area could be drastically inaccurate.\nCan I win? Who knows? Am I serious about my candidacy? Absolutely! But then as anyone who knows me and knows my work as a local councillor and activist would tell you, I never do things by half measures. We all know that the Tories are finished, at least for the immediate future. We don’t need to vote tactically on a local basis in this election because after 14 years of chaos the country has finally woken up and are about to consign the current administration to the political skip.\nThat gives every voter in this area new opportunities and new possibilities. You can vote with your heart and for what you believe in. If that’s a better future for you and your family, a fully funded NHS and social care system, public utilities returned to responsible public control (particular water and energy), a better standard of living for all, raising millions out of poverty and protecting climate and nature, voting Green really is the only alternative. Even if I don’t win the seat, a vote for me that would contribute to a large swing to the Greens nationally will strengthen our hand in influencing national politics for the better. It will also put money into the party coffers through Short Money to help us continue the fight for a better, fairer, greener world for you and you family and their families to come.\nI’ll do my best over the next couple of weeks to make my case for your precious vote in this election and I hope you will seriously consider giving me that vote on July 4th. You should shortly be receiving leaflets from me explaining my priorities. You can also browse this website which is being updated with local issues that I think will be important in the upcoming election. I will also be adding new topics in the next few days. If you want hear me speak in the meantime, I was interviewed by Byline Times recently and was able to cover many topics that I think will be important to voters in this election. You can see that here.\nThere are also a number of hustings that you can attend to ask questions of me and the other candidates. These are :\n7.30pm – 24th June – Kidlington Methodist Church (forum on poverty)\n7.30pm – 25th June – St. Mary Magdelene Church, Park St, Woodstock\n7pm – 26th June – St Edburg Church Bicester\n6.30pm – 1st July – CPRE Country side and Environment hustings at Yarnton Village Hall\nI look forward to seeing as many people at those events as possible. If anyone would like to extend other invitations I am more than happy to come along. If any other events come up I will post them here and on my social media channels.\nRemember – this is the election where YOU get to vote FOR what YOU believe in, rather than AGAINST what you don’t.\nIf you’d like to get involved in my campaign please drop me a line at ian.middleton@greenoxford.com\nYou could also contribute to my joint fundraiser to help me and my 2 fellow North and West Oxfordshire candidates reach more voters in this campaign.

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_housing/content_335.html": "In Kidlington affordable housing is not just difficult to find, it’s pretty much impossible. Recognised as one of the most expensive areas of the district to live in, Kidlington does have some affordable housing in areas but the problem is that most of it is owned and allocated by the City Council. Indeed large areas of the village have been given over to the city’s needs, not least Grovelands which was built almost entirely for the City Council’s use.\nAnd soon we’ll have even more, with the local plan partial review, which was adopted in 2020 after 3 years of objection and protest from local residents and pressure groups, providing yet more housing for the City’s needs with the 50% so-called affordable element having been signed over to the City Council’s control in a closed meeting during the first lockdown in 2020.\nWe all know that the term ‘affordable housing’ is virtually meaningless in Oxfordshire, but even so, very little is built in Kidlington. Even when the district council’s policy to to ensure that 30% of all new housing on larger estates is ‘affordable’, we hardly see anything being built that fulfils that criteria.\nThe flats above the Co-op were essentially given over to the flying school for their exclusive use, even though 3 of the apartments were meant to be available for residents needing affordable accommodation. At least 15 of those flats should have been designated affordable, but the district council messed up the planning application and we ended up with just 3 units available, with the rest being let on the open market. The agreement with developer in that case was so badly negotiated that in 3 years only 1 of those flats has been let on an affordable basis. The terms demand that the council must nominate someone within a 28 day window once a year which is almost impossible to do.\nFlats on the old Co-Op car park site now almost exclusively let to a local flying school at market rent\n15 more flats are due to be built on the Kidlington Garage site at the top of the Bicester Road. When the planning application was agreed the developers were supposed to provide £609,000 in lieu of the 5 affordable apartments. But 6 months later they returned to the planning committee with a viability assessment that argued they couldn’t afford to make any contribution at all. Nothing! Zilch!\nThis is because the government mandates that developers should be guaranteed a profit of 20% on all developments (how nice it would be for other businesses to be guaranteed a profit by the government!). This leaves it open for developers to game the system and make claims that they can’t meet this profitability threshold and thereby reduce or, as in this case, completely remove their responsibility to provide any affordable units or money in lieu.\nI and my fellow Green Councillor Fiona Mawson thought this was wrong and we tabled a motion to refuse the planning application if no affordable element was provided. Sadly, as we and our opposition group are outnumbered on the planning committee, the plans were approved by the Conservative majority.\nSubsequently I brought a motion to the council to increase our affordable requirement on larger developments from 30% to 50% to bring us in line with the City policy. As we have agreed to that percentage on the developments being built in and around Kidlington for the City Council, I thought it only fair that we should give our own residents the same consideration. I was pleased to see that the motion was passed almost unanimously.\nIt’s still sobering to think though that out of around 90 apartments that have been built in Kidlington in the past 5 years, only 3 have been designated affordable and as I explained above, out of those 3, only one has actually been let to a family that needed it.\nCherwell is desperately in need of a change of direction in this issue. We need a council who is prepared to stand up to developers and push for better deals for all our residents. Moreover we need to ensure more affordable developments are brought on line that will benefit local families rather than forcing them to split up as grown children need to move away from their area simply because they can’t afford a home of their own. I believe a change of administration next month could see that better direction and I hope to be a part of that.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_politics_page_9/content_441.html": "I love a bit of comedy as much as the next person, but I do sometimes wish comedians would stay out of politics.\nIn 2015 Russell Brand advised young people not to vote as part of his personal philosophy of half-baked revolution. As a result he bears some of the blame for a Conservative majority borne on the backs of the large number of older voters who didn’t see the 2 minutes it took to mark an X on a ballot sheet as so desperately uncool.\nThis time we have Ricky Gervais leaping into the fray with this tweet :\n“OK. I’m not telling you how to vote, but this is a fact. The only vote that will keep Theresa May out is a vote for @jeremycorbyn. Cheers”\nWhilst not quite so devoid of acumen as Brand’s ill-conceived advice, Ricky’s more well meaning call to action could be equally as dangerous.\nEssentially he IS telling his fans how to vote, and his less politically astute followers may not realise the pitfalls of such a binary choice.\nThe reality is that in many constituencies a vote for Corybn will not keep Theresa May out. The real fact is that it may do the exact opposite.\nSadly, even after repeated calls from other parties to enter into an ad-hoc alliance, Labour has resolutely refused to stand aside in any constituency. Whereas, for example, The Green Party has done so now in well over 30 seats.\nIn many of those seats the Libdems have a much better chance of winning than Labour. In some others the Greens or the SNP could have it in the bag. Voting Labour could then very well help the Tories by splitting the opposition.\nBy selling the idea that a vote for Labour is a vote against the Tories, no matter where you are, The Labour party and many of its supporters could be handing another victory to the Conservatives.\nI’m not usually an advocate of tactical voting, but needs must when the devil drives, and I see the devil behind the eyes of the Conservatives. But tactical voting has to be just that. It doesn’t simply mean voting Labour as the only alternative.\nUnder our broken electoral system the only place votes really count are in marginal constituencies. Until we get electoral reform and a system of proportional representation, that won’t change. And let’s not forget that Labour supports our first past the post system just as much as the Tories do.\nBut even in a safe seat your vote can make a real difference. In 2015 UKIP gave the Conservatives a real run for their money. Even though they only won one seat in Parliament they put the Tories on notice that they were there, close behind, snapping at their heels.\nThe result was the delivery of a referendum on EU membership and the subsequent lurch to the right that followed in the footsteps of Theresa May. The Conservative manifesto, such as it is, represents one of the most extreme right outlooks for the UK for many generations. It makes Margaret Thatcher’s vision look like a tie-dyed, rose tinted call to action for the love generation. It has even been compared to the BNP’s warped ideological ramblings from the 1980s, and not without cause.\nThis can be directly traced to UKIP’s influence and its validation of ideals that make a hard line, right wing agenda more palatable to people who wouldn’t dream of dancing to the tune of more overtly hard right parties.\nLikewise the nomination and election of Jeremy Corbyn can, to a large extent, be laid at the feet of the Green Party. There can’t be many Greens who haven’t noticed just how many of our clothes have recently been stolen by Corbyn’s party. And many of us are happy to be standing here in our underwear, glad that so many of our policies have been subsumed into the Labour manifesto. The sincerest form of flattery and all that.\nBut it has to be remembered that the rise of Green membership and our increasing success in both national and local elections is arguably a major driving force behind Labour’s newly rediscovered left wing credentials and a strong Green vote will help them keep that focus.\nVoting for parties that may not be mainstream, and may not have a chance of winning is not a wasted vote. Even less so in constituencies where the seat is safer than a Roy Chubby Brown joke at a UKIP convention. A vote for the party that more closely reflects your views has a demonstrable impact on those do so to a lesser extent.\nIn the case of Labour, voting for them in constituencies they can’t win may not just prevent other parties from doing so, it also reinforces the status quo of a de facto two party state and removes Labour’s incentive to join an alliance or support electoral reform if, as is still being predicted, they don’t have a majority on June 9th.\nEven if Labour were to win, there’s a very good chance that Corbyn could be unseated early on in his reign, by a parliamentary party who still don’t wholeheartedly support him. Without the threat of other left wing alternatives looking over their shoulders, it’s entirely possible that Labour will drift back to the same Tory-lite, neoliberalism that they were so conformable with last time.\nSo unless you have a realistic opportunity of a tactical vote in your constituency, just voting for the ‘other guy’ (or gal) won’t send any sort of message other than a validation of entrenched positions.\nIf you’re not going to see real change this time around. If your vote is only going to be lost in a sea of others who voted forlornly for the a close second, or the next best thing, use it to support those who will affect real change in the longer term by holding toes to the fire in the meantime.",

Holding the council to account on local services, defending our green spaces and making sure Kidlington gets a fair hearing at council meetings.\nI will also be focussing on climate change, as you’d expect from a Green councillor.\nMy thanks go to everyone who voted for me and believed in me, as well as my dedicated team of helpers and supporters, many of whom went the extra mile for me in the final days, working tirelessly in the run up to what was a very close election.\nIt’s been a very hard 10 weeks of campaigning and I’m only just coming to terms with actually winning after 7 years of being a runner-up.\nEverything we did during the campaign counted towards that result. Just missing out one step or one person not being there could have cost us the win.\nMy thanks also go out to my partners on the Libdem side without whom none of this would have been possible. Special thanks to Neil Fawcett, Alaric Rose, Doug Williamson, Conor McKenzie, Katherine T. Tyson, and of course my superb MP Layla Moran. Congratulations also go to Conrad and Katherine who both also won their seats in Kidlington West and on Kidlington Parish Council. I’m very happy not to be the only newbie on both counts!\nMy congratulations also go out to all those other Oxfordshire Greens who won yesterday, especially Robert Nixon in Bicester, Cheryl Briggs in Abingdon, Robin Bennett in Berinsfield and Sue Roberts in Wallingford.\nIt’s all been a massive team effort and I feel very honoured to have been given so much help to get to this place. I hope I can justify your faith in me.\nI’ll be sending out personal thanks to everyone in the coming days, but for now I hope you’ll enjoy basking in the glow of what has been a great few days for the Greens and will hopefully go on to be a sign of things to come!",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_european-union/content_30.html": "This is a copy of a piece I wrote for Huffington Post this week. You can find and comment on the original here http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-middleton/eu-referendum-immigration_b_9322718.html\nSo here it is. After years of campaigning and complaining, manoeuvring and cajoling, half-truths and good old fashioned British pig-headedness, the moaning masses of middle England have finally got their referendum.\nI say ‘their’ referendum because this isn’t being staged at great expense for those of us who want to stay part of Europe. It’s not even for those who don’t really give a toss either way.\nIt’s certainly not for those more outward looking souls, who appreciate the many advantages of being a member of the European club. The easy movement between states (yes that does apply to us as well as all those annoying refugees and migrants) and the free transport of goods. Funding for urban and industrial renewal. Numerous environmental improvements to beaches, rivers and the countryside, including controls on things like GMOs. Human rights, animal rights, consumer rights. Cheaper phone charges and easier and cheaper travel and currency exchange. Social welfare protection and labour rights, and a panoply of other advantages that most people take for granted and will miss when they’re gone.\nNo, it’s a referendum for misguided and ill-informed little-Englanders, draped in Union flags, firm in the belief of two world wars and one world cup and certain the word ‘Great’ attached to Britain means something other than the first letter on a sticker they slap on the back of their booze cruise charabang, just to remind those envious foreigners that they were unlucky enough to be born on inferior soil.\nBut moreover, it’s a referendum for politicians who have been looking at continental Europe down the wrong end of the telescope for so long now, they just don’t realise how small this country has become on the world stage. A myopic concern about how much money we pay to Europe and a studied ignorance of the huge returns our EU membership generates.\nMost people who focus on our payment to Brussels like to remind us what else we could do with that money. Yet with a growing national debt, and stubbornly high deficit, any such savings would likely fall into the same black hole as most of the rest of our national finances. Either that or it would go towards servicing the country’s circa £50bn annual interest payments, paid in large part to European banks anyway.\nIt’s not 1975. The geo-political landscape has changed around us since the last time we decided if we wanted to be a part of Europe. Yes, back in the swinging 70s it was the ‘Common Market’, but by necessity and common interest it’s become more than that. Those advocating some kind of return to a simple trading relationship are ignoring both the reality of our reduced place in the world and the promiscuity of world markets.\nNeither is it 1938, even though Cameron’s Chamberlain moment was equally as hollow. Just like his pre-war counterpart, the agreement he reached in Brussels was peripheral and disposable, focussing as it did on the false polemic of immigration and border control.\nIt was a pantomime, with Donald Tusk and Angela Merkel as the ugly sisters to Cameron’s Cinderella. Shouts of “they’re behind you” were evident from the likes of UKIP and Front National pointing to the ‘hordes’ or ‘swarms’ or ‘bunches’ of ‘migrants’, ‘refugees’ or ‘immigrants’, depending on which description David Cameron and the BBC have alighted on this week.\nI totally agree that EU democratic and regulatory processes are in desperate need of reform, but these weren’t the points that Cameron argued. Driven by domestic pressures, piled on by a widening xenophobic rhetoric, he was pushed into a rushed and ill-conceived round of negotiations that resulted in him metaphorically claiming ‘peace in our time’ outside Number 10. It was a performance put on to give him a platform to launch the referendum that we all knew was coming, and the critic’s reviews weren’t great.\nSadly for him, us, and the rest of Europe, this was a missed opportunity that could have sparked a trans-national debate about the real future of the EU and brought about radical changes to shape it into something more even-handed and responsive to the needs of all member states.\nBut instead, Cameron wasted what could have been his real place in history for the sake of a thumbs up from the likes of Farage, Gove and Galloway whilst gaining little tangible return for the UK, save for some token restrictions on benefit payments to migrants who rarely claim them anyway.\nIn fact it’s recently been revealed that the UK government has no idea how much immigration costs us, nor how much migrants contribute to our economy. But let’s not let a little thing like lack of facts get in the way of a nicely staked out scapegoat.\nAnd while we’re on the subject of discrimination, we mustn’t forget those hard-pressed city bankers quaking in their handmade brogues, terrified that they may be penalised for being outside the Eurozone. That of course, amid the posturing about immigration, was the main concern for Cameron and his paymasters. Essentially he was in Brussels to fight for the right to discriminate against the poor whilst protecting the interests of the obscenely rich, although of course that wasn’t so eagerly reported.\nAnd there we have it. The crux of all this political, psychological and media-spun mendacity – Corporate interest. Insular businesses seeking to rid themselves of the European interference and regulation that keeps all the rest of us safer and better looked after. The refugee and migrant crises couldn’t have come at a better time for these vested interests to galvanise public opinion in favour of an out vote.\nOn this flimsiest of pretexts, and on evidence largely pulled out UKIP’s collective backside, we’re potentially going to launch ourselves into one of the biggest national disasters for several generations. The ‘Brexit’ silo mentality that is about as relevant in today’s globally connected society as statutes recorded on vellum.\nOne of the greatest achievements and advantages of the EU is freedom of movement between states. It’s a harbinger of a future globalised socio-economic system where borders and statehood will be irrelevant. One where the term ‘economic-migrant’ will no longer be a thinly veiled insult, just as it wasn’t when we and other nations economically migrated across the globe centuries ago, annexing and occupying entire countries as we went. In that context, and in view of the Tories much vaunted ‘on your bike’ ethos, I find it perplexing that we now seem to regard our attraction as place of opportunity as a bad thing.\nAnd while we’re on that subject, if I were a British migrant living on the continent I’d be feeling distinctly uncomfortable right now. Especially those who have lived there for longer than 15 years and are inexplicably denied the right to vote in a referendum that may well decide their future.\nThose whistling tunes in the dark about independent trade agreements with Europe and other global partners will soon find that our status as the 5th richest nation in the world is built on foundations largely stamped with a CE logo. Already Sterling has plummeted on the news that Boris is heading for the lifeboats.\nMuch of our apparent wealth is generated by the financial sector and supported by our membership of the EU. Who will want to trade with us as a small individual nation with a growing national debt and a dwindling economic base? No wonder the city was such a key part of Cameron’s negotiations.\nThe finance sector is pretty much all we have left. We don’t have anything else to trade. China and the USA know this and have already warned us that a UK outside the EU will be of much less interest to them. The US in particular sees our connection with Europe as a valuable conduit into EU financial markets.\nUncoupling ourselves from the EU will be a long, painful and essentially irreversible process. We won’t wake up one day and see bluebirds over the white cliffs and a land of milk and honey for all. It will take years of debate, legal dispute and the unpicking of labyrinthine systems of regulation woven into our own statutory frameworks. A drawn out and retrograde process, during which I believe we’ll slowly come to see the folly of our ways.\nAnd once we’ve closed our borders and thumbed our noses at one of the biggest trading blocs on the planet, it will be too late to realise that we’re now more of a Pekinese than a bulldog. An isle not so much sceptred as septic, poisoned by our own arrogance and bigotry, left entirely at the mercy of a broken political system where wealth goes one way, and protection is only there for those who can afford it.\nAs Britain shrivels into, at best, a tawdry tax haven in perpetual serfdom to a rich elite, we’ll come to the sad realisation that we’ve been sold a Jerusalem built on false promises and false flags. I wonder if border controls and apocryphal straight bananas will seem quite so important then.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_thanks_page_2/content_374.html": "Another election fought and another campaign behind us n Cherwell\nIt was very solid result for the Greens in Kidlington East with a convincing second place well above Labour and a tripling of our 2016 vote. Moreover a spectacular win for my electoral partner, Libdem candidate Alaric Rose in Kidlington West who nearly doubled the Libdem vote and completely wiped the floor with the Conservatives!\nIt would have been great to have won my seat as well, but with such a short campaign it was hard to get the message out to enough people. Ultimately it was a total validation for both of us of our decision to work together for the common good.\nSlightly galling that the Carmen Griffiths kept her seat as I understand she was hardly seen on the campaign trail. She wasn’t at the count, didn’t make an appearance on polling day (to my knowledge) and instead sat back and let local Tory cult figures like Maurice Billington do all the campaigning for her.\nJudging by her attendance record at council meetings this seems to be a pattern of behaviour for a pretty lacklustre councillor. I think many of the voters in the ward didn’t actually know which blue candidate they were voting for and seemed oblivious to the fact that there were more dedicated candidates on offer who would much more effectively represent them in Cherwell.\nPerhaps when Carmen and her remaining Tory colleagues fail to turn up at other key planning meetings and the green belt is concreted over, bringing with it traffic chaos, pollution, and the collapse of local infrastructure, all those that trooped into the polling station to dutifully put a cross in the Tory box, regardless of the candidate, will realise their mistake. It might be a bit late then though.\nOne other stark reality from the results is that if Labour had endorsed me (as we suggested) and we had endorsed them in one of the North Oxfordshire wards (as we offered) we would both have easily won our seats, meaning a new Labour, Green and Libdem seat on the council and 3 Tory losses instead of 1. Just imagine what sort of message that would have sent out! Especially on important and urgent local issues like the building on green belt in the area.\nLabour really need to wake up to the reality of fractured left politics in this country and work with other parties like the Greens and the Libdems. We need to stop living in the past and embrace the future. There’s more that unites us than divides us and if we’re going to stop yet another Conservative government in 2022 we must start building alliances. If anyone from Labour wants to talk, I’m all ears.\nIn the meantime I intend to go on being a thorn in the side of Cherwell’s complacent Tory leadership and will be working closely with Alaric as part of our pre-election co-operative agreement. I may not be able to vote on council matters, but I can certainly speak up in the council chamber and outside in the media. I’ll be fighting hard on local green belt and conservation issues and keeping a wary eye on the attendance record of my Tory opponent. The Greens will be fighting the elections in the ward once again next year and I hope that will again be in partnership with the Liberal Democrats.\nFinally a big thank you to everyone who voted for me and to the dedicated people who helped us pull together such a professional campaign in such a short time. the Greens made historic gains across the country yesterday and I think it’s a credit to all our members that we can do this stuff on such a small budgets and with small teams. Just think what we could do in government!\nStay tuned and follow this website/blog for updates on what I and the Green Party will be doing between now and the next elections.\nVoteGreen#2019",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_page_6/content_268.html": "I’ve spoken to hundreds of people during this short election campaign and probably the most important issue on most people’s minds right now is the threat to our local green belt.\nI made a video about it last week which has received quite a bit of attention since it was released. You can watch it here.\nOf course in Yarnton, Begbroke and Gosford (where I’m standing to become the new local County Councillor) it’s in the forefront of everyone’s minds because, if it goes ahead, we’ll be the ones living in the middle of a building site for possibly the next 10 years. We’ll also see our small rural communities destroyed and replaced with a single medium sized town, one that will probably also double up as a university campus for the Begbroke Science Park.\nBut even in Kidlington, (which comprises a large part of the County division) it’s going to have a huge impact. There may not be as many houses built in the area, but the additional strain on our local resources, such as health services, education and leisure facilities will be very detrimental. We’ll also see a noticeable reduction in air quality which is likely to have health impacts on the most vulnerable, as well as increased risks of flooding. The A44 will probably become a car park during busy times, giving us all the chance to sit and admire the 4 storey apartment blocks that will tower over the edge of the dual carriageway.\nThere’s also a good chance that Kidlington will finally lose the argument about hanging on to it’s status as a village. In 10 years time, when the population has possibly tripled, there’s likely to be a much greater push to establish the whole area as a suburb of a Greater Oxford City. Not a prospect I, or anyone else in the area, relishes but something we may have little choice over.\nI for one won’t stop fighting for that until the last blade of grass has fallen under the bulldozer’s tracks.\nAll this might be acceptable to a greater degree if these houses were going to provide affordable accommodation for local families, many of whom are crammed into a single house with perhaps 3 generations under one roof. But these aren’t for the likes of them. These will be expensive luxury executive houses built for investment purposes, with the so-called ‘affordable’ houses reserved for people in Oxford City. The District Council saw to that when they handed control of those houses over to the City Council in a closed meeting at the beginning of the first lockdown. None of these houses will be within reach of local residents.\nA lot of people have told me that all this is inevitable and that the 4400 houses are a ‘done deal’. Well that isn’t the case until we know the outcome of the legal challenge being brought to the high court next month. Until that’s over we have no idea if these proposals will stand up or collapse. There have been reports in other areas recently where challenges have been upheld, and if we get the same result Cherwell District Council will have to think again. In those circumstances we’ll need as much support on the District Council as possible which is why I’m supporting Fiona Mawson to become our second Green Party Councillor on CDC.\nBut even if we fail to stop these devastating plans though the courts, we can at least do our best to limit some of that devastation by having engaged and active councillors at all levels of local government. On the County Council fighting for infrastructure and other important considerations like flood protection, and of course at District and Parish level scrutinising the individual planning proposals themselves. We also have to be vigilant in opposing ‘infilling’ which may become more of an issue as the amount of development space in the area is snapped up by the bigger developers.\nSo I hope I and Fiona can count on the support of our local residents in the elections on Thursday. We’ve seen how our current crop of Conservative councillors have let us down on these issues, and let’s not forget that this whole idea was the brainchild of the Conservatives on Cherwell District Council in the first place, in cahoots with Oxford University, the City Council, the Oxfordshire Growth Board and the Local Enterprise Partnership. After Thursday we may have more leverage to defend our small rural communities against these faceless, unelected and anti-democratic quangos and take back control of our green heritage.\nI for one won’t stop fighting for that until the last blade of grass has fallen under the bulldozer’s tracks. I hope you’ll all support me as your Green Councillor in that long battle.",
  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_shopping-centres/content_174.html": "As I said in the recent election debate on the BBC, in my opinion they shouldn’t.\nThere are many reasons it’s a bad idea, both from a business perspective and as part of local spending priorities.\nI’ve worked in retail nearly all my life. I built and ran a national chain of jewellery stores across the country and traded in several shopping centres, including some of the most prestigious in the country such as Bluewater in Kent and the new Bullring Centre in Birmingham. I write a regular column for Retail week Magazine and comment regularly in the national press on retail issues as well as offering consultancy services. One of my main focusses is independent retail and commercial property. So I know a little bit about what I’m talking about.\nCherwell District Council (CDC) leader Barry Wood claims that buying the Castle Quay Shopping Centre in Banbury is a good deal for the people of Cherwell. This decision was also backed by the Labour group on the council and their leader Sean Woodcock has assured me there’s a good business case for doing it. Unfortunately neither of them have been able to show it to me so far.\nTheir belief is that buying a commercial property like a shopping centre is a good idea as property will always rise in value. This may be the case for domestic property and some kinds of commercial premises, but not always with retail space.\nA Good Investment?\nThe argument for buying the scheme seems to be that if they hadn’t, the centre would have shut down. It has many long term empty units and is generally struggling to compete in an ever crowded marketplace. The council’s decision a few years ago to allow a new shopping park to open on the outskirts of Banbury haven’t helped its plight.\nIt’s extremely unlikely though that it would have closed down. Much more likely that it would have been offloaded by its pension investment owners to another investment company with more experience of running a shopping centre than some local councillors.\nMoreover, if the argument is that the centre was about to collapse, that doesn’t exactly make it an attractive investment for public money does it?\nThere have been some shopping centre failures in the past, but they are few and far between. But when they do go, they tend to go completely. That means an almost total loss for anyone unlucky enough to be the owner at the time. There will be some residual value in the land, but that’s unlikely to reflect the full price paid for the whole development.\nThere have been a growing number of retail failures in recent years with 650 collapses so far this year alone, and we’re not even half way through yet! Some of them very high profile and heavily leveraged operations. Others are busy negotiating partial closures and rent reductions with their landlords. Others are moving more into the online arena and abandoning physical retail space almost altogether.\nNone of this bodes well for an under-let, under-invested and down at heel shopping centre in a struggling town in North Oxfordshire.\nSo essentially CDC are gambling with public money against the odds. And it doesn’t end there.\nOther Costs\nAccording to Barry Wood the scheme is turning a profit at the moment, but as I’ve said previously, I’ve not seen evidence of that. I have seen a large number of long term voids in the centre, and with the potential for these to increase in number I fear the profitability may be marginal or likely to decline.\nThere will also be ongoing running costs for the centre and presumably additional investment to do whatever it is with the place that they feel will revitalise it. Again details on that are sketchy, but I think there’s some talk about dividing the larger units into smaller ones to attract independent retailers. Whilst I support that idea to some extent there are a lot of things to consider about that course of action.\nFirstly the cost of doing the work, which may include major re-modelling of the units due to, amongst other things, fire regulations. I’ve seen at least one shopping centre management come unstuck with similar plans due to rules on access to fire exit routes.\nHelping Smaller Retailers?\nSecondly smaller independents usually don’t have a huge budget for shopfitting, so there will be additional cost in partially fitting out the units, including new shopfronts etc to attract smaller operators and to ensure that their stores fit in with a modern shopping centre scheme.\nBusiness Rates\nThirdly there’s the loss of business rates on the empty units that are there now, and will most likely be there for a while. Considering the current climate in retail there’s also a good chance that voids could increase. At the moment the landlords will be paying rates on those premises even though they’re empty and a good deal of that money goes to CDC. With the council now being the landlords, they’re going to be paying the rates to themselves, effectively wiping out that income.\nDevaluation of the Asset\nFinally there’s the issue of valuation. Shopping developments are broadly valued on their rental potential. This is why landlords will leave units empty rather than let them out at a reduced rent. If the council’s plan is to lower the rent for smaller or other retailers, that will have a knock on effect on the value of those units and then on others when rent reviews come around. Other tenants now paying a higher rent will also push for a reduction when their leases come up for renewal or rent reviews are due or maybe even before.\nThe net effect of this would be to push down rents, not only in the centre but across the town, reducing loan to asset values across the board. In broad terms I’d welcome that. I’ve long argued that retail property values are hugely inflated. But in terms of the Council’s investment exposure in Castle Quay it’s a potentially dangerous situation, not only leading to a potential devaluation of the asset, but also any loans secured on it being partially called in.\nThere may be some balancing in terms of appreciation on the total asset value, but in the current climate and in a falling retail market, there a very good chance that the overall value of the scheme will fall relative to the amount the council has sunk into it, both as an initial investment and any further day to day expenditure.\nAll of this appears to have passed Cherwell Councillors and the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives by. They obviously have a very patchy understanding of how retail property works and the implications and pitfalls they are letting us all as council tax payers in for.\nMoreover there’s the question of if so much money should be focussed in the north of the district while ignoring other areas. Mr Wood commented in the Radio debate on Wednesday that he recognised that there were empty units in Pioneer Square in Bicester and that it was difficult to get them filled. Yet this doesn’t seem to have concerned him over the purchase of Castle Quay. Indeed, having set the precedent in Banbury I asked him during the debate if the council intended to buy Pioneer Square as well. He didn’t reply.\nOther Options\nA more sensible and prudent approach to the problems in both areas would be to work with the landlords rather than bailing them out with public money. Leave them with the risk whilst introducing local initiatives that help smaller retailers get a foothold and would also support the centre.\nThese could include rates reductions, which Barry Wood dismissed out of hand when I challenged him on it during the election debate. Neither he nor Sean Woodcock appeared to know that it has been within the gift of local councils to reduce rates on specific properties at their discretion for several years now.\nIf they wanted to provide smaller, more affordable space for independent retailers, they could lease units from the centres on a medium to long term basis, probably negotiating favourable terms with the landlords as a council will have a very good covenant. These could then be divided up (if required) and then sublet on flexible terms on reduced rents to retailers, although this would have to be agreed beforehand with the landlord for the same reasons discussed above concerning rental levels and valuations.\nThis would achieve the same aim of revitalising schemes both in Banbury and Bicester and would not involve the council in risking large amounts of public money. It would also mean that the bulk of the £60m they are now tying up in one area could be spread across the district.\nThis is the kind of strategic thinking we need, rather that the amateurish speculation of a council who seems to want to play at being shopkeepers with our money. This is why we need a more diverse representation on the council and councillors like me who will challenge these misguided moves before millions of pounds of desperately needed council funds are put at risk.",

  "https_middletongreen_org_/https_middletongreen_org_tag_investment/content_140.html": "I’ve been involved in retail for as long as I can remember. From my first proper job as a Saturday boy in a menswear store in Lewisham through my days as a market trader in Camden Lock and Greenwich to being co-founder of a national high street chain that started with a small store in Oxford selling silver jewellery. and grew into a national chain trading in 6 of country’s major retail locations, including London’s prestigious Covent Garden.\nIn that time I saw almost as many ups as I did downs. I’ve half jokingly said that I spent 20 years building the business and then another 10 trying extricating it from the failing high street. Like so many other retailers who entered the high street during the boom years in the early 1990s, I fell foul of the simultaneous boom in commercial property development. So many new malls were opened in the 90s and early 2000s it was difficult to keep up and I opened stores in some of the most iconic examples such as the New Bullring in Birmingham and Bluewater in Kent.\nThe other boom at the time was in business rates, which along with rents skyrocketed through that period as institutional landlords, mostly backed by large pension funds, cashed in on the retail bubble ploughing millions into new shiny malls based on the emerging US model. It was great while it lasted and we all became caught up in the heady days of seemingly limitless opportunities. But we soon discovered there were limits.\nThe Financial crash in 2008 gave us all a pretty sharp reality check and things soon started to become far less buoyant and rents that had been agreed on the back of rude profit margins started to look far less tenable as turnovers started to fall.\nThere soon followed a series of frantic rounds of renegotiation with landlords who themselves were facing the prospect of huge hole in their new developments as retailers started to fall over with alarming regularity. In many cases we were able to come to mutual agreements to keep us trading at the shopping malls looking full, but the one thing that couldn’t be re-negotiated were business rates. Set as they were, by the central valuation office, and administered by local authorities, they were completely devoid of any chance of concession unless you had an understanding council. In my experience their understanding was rather limited, and after 5 years as a local councillor myself I now understand more about why that was.\nSo we were all caught in a perfect storm that only a few managed to emerge from. My business was one of the luckier ones as I managed to negotiate deals that gave us breathing space. But I could see the writing on the wall and it was telling me to get out of the high street and decamp to the internet where so many of our competitors were lurking. Thereby hangs another very long story.\nBut suffice to say I have an intimate understanding of the plight of the high street, in fact much more intimate than I would prefer. For that reason one of my personal priorities as a fresh faced new MP would be to push for a new system of business rates or local high street taxation. Other things like rent controls and use classes would also be high on the agenda, but none of this will be an easy fix for an industry in the doldrums after so many years in decline. But I know from my own experience that smaller independents are both the lifeblood of local high streets whilst also being the most vulnerable.\nIn terms of the dreaded business rates, I think I could take elements from the land tax approach of the Green party and add in some aspect of a local purchase tax as seen in the USA. Such a tax would be far more progressive and have more respect for the ability of businesses to pay such an additional tax. That would give a far greater connection between the local community, local authorities and the retailers themselves. If all retailers did well then they would all reap the benefits.\nSpeaking to local councillors and retailers about business rates reform\nI don’t really have the answer to full business rates reform, but I’ve been campaigning for a better system for over 10 years. I would advocate a situation where we involved existing high street retailers in the process of finding a solution. There have been past attempts at doing this, but very few, if any, involved small independent retailers. I think that was a mistake.\nThe Labour Party have boldly announced that they would scrap the current business rates system, but they haven’t said what they would replace it with. I’ve been here before many times, and both Labour and the Tories have frequently promised reform but never delivered on that. One of the biggest reason is that business rates are a virtually guaranteed income for government bringing in over £13bn a year. Even if the premises are empty, the landlord cops for the bill so it’s a win-win for Westminster. So any new system is likely to be just as iniquitous and damaging, especially to smaller operators.\nI think there is a way of developing a system of local high street taxation that could benefit all sides of the equation, including the consumer. Just scrapping the business rates system with no plan for what would replace it is not a solution, yet its the current proposal from the part that is most likely to form the next government in a few weeks. If I was in Westminster I’d hope to be able to provide a far better insight into the problems on the high street and how to engage with the people who face those problems every day.\nI’d like to see genuine consultation with high street stakeholders, including landlords and local councils, about the best way forwards. As a long term retailer, having moved from being a small business, through a larger expansion and back to being a ‘born again independent’, I’d like to be involved in that process. But I guess it remains to be seen what the outcome is on July 4th.\nI’ve just published a video I made during a recent visit to Bicester with some thoughts on how we can work towards a better system of high street business taxation and help to repair our broken high streets and you can watch that by clicking here.\nIf you’re a retailer or just someone who enjoys browsing physical shops, I’d suggest you vote for someone like me who has the experience to make that a viable possibility again. Retail is at the heart of every village, town and city and needs political support to make it vibrant again. Many politicians claim to have the answer but few of them have been on the inside of the industry. I think that needs to change. I’d like to change it.",

This one should be NHS – NHS – NHS.\nThe road to privatisation of the NHS has been a long one and began under the Conservatives in 1992 with the Private Finance Initiative. It’s a neat trick that enables huge amounts of debt to be moved off the national balance sheet whilst still expanding operational infrastructure.\nNew Labour saw it as something too good to be true, as it allowed them to build new hospitals, without borrowing more money or raising taxes. But like most things that seem too good to be true, it was. By the end of their tenure Labour had saddled the NHS with £80Bn in repayments on total capital assets worth around £11Bn, and we’re still paying for it now.\nThen along came the Conservatives again who just love to privatise things. Every time they’ve been in government they’ve privatised something. The trains, electricity, gas, BT, the post office – which they practically gave away.\nBut the Tories have a problem when it comes to the NHS. They can’t flat out privatise it, because that’s politically toxic.\nSo in 2012 – The year that Danny Boyle showed us in his spectacular Olympic opening ceremony what a glorious thing the NHS is – the Conservatives brought in the Health and Social Care Bill.\nA bill that many people didn’t even notice passing through parliament. But a bill that arguably affects all of us more than any other legislation in our lifetime. A bill based on the premise that the NHS was a poorly performing institution that needed reform and another £3Bn top down reorganisation that we’d been promised before the election wouldn’t happen. A bill that ignored the core values of the NHS and characterised it’s staff as a problem to be dealt with rather than it’s greatest asset. A bill that achieved the Tory Nirvana of laying the NHS open to private contractors, furthering their ideology that the state should not be responsible for providing public services.\nIt effectively legislated against free universal comprehensive healthcare and flung the door to privatisation wide open. And private health firms are falling over themselves to come inside.\nJeremy Hunt has just announced £780Million worth of private contracts to 11 firms, many of which have a chequered history. Many of them are also donors to the Tory Party. There are also plans in Staffordshire to privatise cancer care in a £700M contract and ‘End of life care’ worth another £500M\nIn a leaked confidential document it’s proposed that these contractors will be :\n“Given ‘discretion’ to design services they would like to deliver, slash spend per patient and propose the payment structures most beneficial to themselves”.\nIn that one clause we get a glimpse of how private companies will pervert the ethos of the NHS to their own end.\nFirst the add on services will be an extra cost. Then any new treatments, drugs or therapies will be extra\nIn effect we’ll end up with a RyanAir NHS – Your operation will be free, but they’ll charge you £500 for the bed and another fifty for using the toilet.\nThe government consistently claims the NHS budget is protected but in reality, it’s being forced to make cuts dressed up as efficiency savings of £15bn – £20bn by the end of this year. No wonder we’re losing services. And across the country, A&Es, maternity and other services are being closed, with thousands of jobs lost. Competitive tendering also fragments healthcare. Where patients are sent miles to access different care resources around the country based on contractor costs.\nI’m standing as Parliamentary candidate for the Green Party in Banbury, where people are rightfully worried about that fragmentation and the future of their beloved Horton General Hospital. Labour have already tried to close it once, and more recently the coalition began a reduction in the range of services offered there, with the removal of emergency abdominal surgery facilities. This has resulted in some patients being forced to make a 3 or 4 hour, 50 mile round trip to services at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Not only is this extremely inconvenient, it also potentially impairs patient outcome as additional stress is added to their situation.\nBanbury has a long history of returning Conservative MPs, but this time every voter in the constituency has to ask themselves the question – do I still want to have access to a fully free and fully funded NHS in 5 years time?\nIf the answer is yes you have to remember that, no matter how much you might like the Conservative candidate this time (and I’ll admit I like her too), a vote for Victoria Prentis will just make another Tory led government more of a reality. No matter how much she says she’ll fight for the Horton, she’ll be forced to follow her party’s privatisation agenda. Even if she votes against the whip she’ll be a lone voice in a government she helped to put into power.\nI want to see an end to all privatisation of the NHS and I believe the NHS should be brought back entirely into public ownership.\nThe Green Party supports the NHS re-instatement bill, we’d negotiate an exit from PFI and repeal the Health and Social Care Act. We’d also fight TTIP which could have a huge impact on the NHS. We believe that NHS staff deserve a fair deal and that they should be supported and valued rather than treated as a problem to be dealt with\nAneurin Bevan was once asked how long he thought the NHS would survive. He replied: “As long as there are folk left with the faith to fight for it.”\nEvery party is pledging to invest more money into the NHS but the Green Party won’t just invest cash, we’ll also invest our faith. We all have to show that faith now or by the end of the next parliament Danny Boyle’s proud Olympic love letter to our wonderful NHS could become it’s epitaph.",

We are however a broad church with many facets. I was encouraged to become a candidate BECAUSE of my business experience rather than in spite of it, and I saw that as an encouraging aspect.\nI’ve run large companies, and I now run a small one. I’m probably something of a gamekeeper turned poacher. But I’ve seen both sides of this debate and come to realise that the idea of continual economic growth is indeed a myth. And one we have to stop believing before we run out of road.\nI was at the launch of a new book by Naomi Klein a few months ago. She makes some interesting points about the connections between environmental issues and the global economy. The basic tenet is that when resources and commodities are monetised on the kinds of scale they are now, the result is economic and environmental catastrophe. And we’re just getting a taste of that.\nThe direct impacts are of course climate change, which if you ascribe to that view, is starting to bring with it the kinds of drastic changes in weather patterns that we’ve seen in recent years.\nThese are all things we’re having to come to terms with now and they’re all traceable to global economic activity. They affect all our lives, not just personally, but in broader human and economic terms.\nI’m a vocal advocate of social enterprise, and believe that there are many big businesses out there that can be made to take a more ethical and responsible stance if we create the right conditions to encourage it. And happily for me there is already a growing movement within the more enlightened areas of the business world towards ethical business and sustainable capitalism.\nThat might sound like some thing of an oxymoron, but in many sectors of business now there’s a realisation dawning that if we continue to squeeze the pips of the economy, we’ll eventually run out of juice.\nAmidst calls from some people for a revolution against rampant capitalism, I see the future as more of an evolution towards a business ethos that views social justice and connection with local and national communities as an asset, rather than an inconvenience. I’m certainly not anti-capitalist, but I am anti-unfettered capitalism. I agree that the market should be allowed to decide some things. But I believe the state has the job of holding us all to account for our actions and tempering the excesses of marketisation to prevent it working against the common good.\nAnd it’s not just us greeny types taking up this mantra. Many key economists and business commentators are now having similar epiphanies about how business and consumption needs to be managed in a sustainable, responsible and accountable way, if we’re all going to avoid a backlash against the kinds of excesses and irresponsible business practices that became prevalent over the past 20 or 30 years.\nEssentially businesses need to grow up and take responsibility for the societies we’ve helped to create.\nI’ve recently become very interested in something now being called the circular economy, where consumption itself is fed back into the creation of new resources and products. This doesn’t just encompass recycling, but also upcycling and renewable energy as part of the manufacturing process, along with emergent technologies, social media, and the fourth economy, comprising enterprises that not only make a profit for business owners, but also put something back into the social economy.\nThat might all sound a bit hippy and tree-huggy, but it’s something that’s being taken very seriously now by many key figures in the business world. Most notably Bill Gates and Richard Branson. And with good reason.\nIf you can make money with clean conscience, look after your employees, business partners, suppliers, and most importantly the planet AND enjoy what you’re doing, what’s not to like?\nYou also get to sleep pretty well at night too\nSo I hope I can convince you that there is scope within a Green World for enterprise and innovation. Without the need for a constantly growing economy and an ever greater consumption of the worlds finite resources.\nWith the potential for over a million green jobs out there, and an ethical economy that has only scratched the surface of an emerging market, there are plenty of opportunities for business leaders and entrepreneurs in a future Green and pleasant land.",

Otherwise we’ll be right back here in 5 or 10 years time, probably with the Conservatives promising the change that we never really seem to get.\nAs someone else said during this election “If you want change you have to vote for it”. If you want REAL change you have to vote Green!"
