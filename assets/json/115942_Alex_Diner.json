His overwhelming sense of social justice was a major influence in Andy’s trade union activities and his role in public life. The future of the railways is important to Harwich and it is fitting that ASLEF creates closer links with Harwich Branch Labour Party in Andy’s memory.”\nLocal Labour Party members then listened to a talk by Mick Whelan in which he referred to the growing issue of ‘transport poverty’, a situation which is very relevant to Harwich with high levels of unemployment and the cost of travelling to work outside of the area rising dramatically.\nBranch chairman, Charlie Powell, says\n“Mick Whelan’s talk certainly struck a chord with our members and we are very pleased both with the donation and also with the opportunity to forge closer links with ASLEF. Andy Morrison was very special to us and we will use these closer links to campaign for the values he believed in.”\nPam Morrison, who herself was a Harwich Town Councillor and who served as mayoress on three occasions, also addressed the meeting and received a very warm reception from her Labour Party colleagues.\nPam Morrison says\n“Outside of his family Andy’s great pride was in ASLEF and Harwich. The family is immensely proud of everything that Andy achieved and we are delighted that further achievements may come about in Andy’s memory because of the links between ASLEF and the local Labour Party.”\nFor further information please contact\nJames Mc Gowan, ASLEF’s head of Policy and Communications on\n0207 324 2438 or mobile 07932 749095\nPam Morrison on 01255 240381\nGarry Calver on 01255 551940",

Will he further advise the council whether or not he intends to allocate additional funding to this budget and, if so, how much and when?’\nCllr Maria Fowler says, “It is not good enough that this Conservative/Independent administration has allowed the available funds in the Big Society Fund to fall so low and I am disappointed that it is necessary to bring this matter to their attention. Someone has taken their eye off the ball and it needs addressing urgently.”\nAt present there are Town councils within the Tendring District with larger grant budgets than that of the District council itself and the Labour Group considers this totally unacceptable. The voluntary sector is being asked to take on more and more as the government and local authorities cut back on services and the least that local authorities can do is ensure that financial support is available to assist the voluntary sector.\nLeader of the Labour group, Cllr Ivan Henderson, says, “There was no delay in increasing the budget for cabinet members by £20,000 but no one has considered ensuring grant aid to the voluntary sector is adequately funded. I question the priorities of an administration that increases its own allowances before it thinks about the needs of the voluntary sector.”\nFor further information please contact\nIvan Henderson on 07889 367822",

Instead, the 21 strong block Conservative vote was used to vote down the amendment making it extremely difficult for the wide range of sports and leisure facilities to be saved for public use.\nCllr. Ivan Henderson says, “Anyone watching the recording of the TDC Budget meeting will see how hard we tried to persuade the Conservative led administration to allow more time to save these local facilities for the local community but will also see how, one by one, they all voted to slam the door in our face. It seems to us that they are only interested in their major investment project into Clacton Leisure Centre.”\nAs a result of this shock action Cllr. Maria Fowler tabled an emergency motion at Wednesday’s meeting of Harwich Town Council which received unanimous support.\nThe motion reads:\nPropose that, Harwich Town Council writes to the CEO of Tendring District Council to advise him of the anger and concern being expressed by residents and shared by this council resulting from the decision by TDC to withdraw from the joint user agreement with the Sigma Trust, effectively ending public use of the Harwich Sports Centre.\nThe council also wishes to remind TDC of its stated assurance in its recently adopted Local Plan that:\n• ‘The Council will work with partners and sports providers across the district to maintain, expand and improve the quality and accessibility of public open space, sports and recreational facilities of different types.’ (p51) and calls on TDC to fulfil its obligation resulting from this commitment.\nCllr. Maria Fowler, who tabled the emergency motion on behalf of the Labour Group on Harwich Town Council, says\n“It is important that we show those running TDC that there is genuine anger amongst local residents over this dreadful decision. I am very pleased though not surprised that the motion had unanimous support and we can only hope that it makes TDC take a step back to think about how it is treating the residents of the Harwich Peninsula and surrounding villages.”\nFor further information please contact\nPress Officer, Garry Calver on 01255 551940",

It now calls upon ECC to abandon the failed scheme and restore full night street lighting as, since part night street lighting has been introduced, criminal activity has been made easier, the fear of crime has increased, accidents due to poor visibility have increased and the ability of the Emergency services to function effectively has been seriously reduced.’\nThe motion will be on the agenda for the meeting of the council on Tuesday, 1st July.\nIvan Henderson says, “There is a clear sense of frustration among TDC councillors that the Tories at County Hall are not listening. It is obvious to everyone that part night street lighting has been a shambles but they won’t admit they’ve got it badly wrong. This motion will send a clear message on behalf of the residents of Tendring – It’s time to swallow your pride and switch the lights back on!”\nFor further information please contact:\nIvan Henderson on 07889 367822\nUseful info – LINK -> TDC: Meeting Dates, Agendas and Minutes",

  "https_www_harwichlabourparty_org_uk_clp_/https_www_harwichlabourparty_org_uk_2012_02_tdc-budget-meeting/content_1055.html": "At the TDC Budget meeting the Labour group sought funding to boost local regeneration and economic development, a re allocation of the so called ‘Big Society Fund’ to enable more voluntary organisations to benefit, a reversal of the 48% increase in pitch hire charges that now means that many local sports clubs cannot afford to use council run facilities, the continuation of ‘Disabled Go’ and the investigation into establishing a Foyer in Tendring to provide a safe location for young homeless people to sleep and to receive support and training. Labour also called for the project to upgrade and refurbish Dovercourt Swimming Pool and Sports Hall to go ahead without delay. This project was agreed by the council in 2010 and the funding for the swimming pool is still held ready to pay for the work. The Tories simply refuse to do it.\nAll of Labour’s suggestions were fully costed, accepted as legitimate amendments by the TDC Finance officers and could have been achieved without any council borrowing and without touching the £4 million in uncommitted council reserves. All were voted down by the Tories.\nIn the case of the swimming pool Harwich Tories Ricky and Clare Callender refused to support the amendment even though they had voted in favour of it at Harwich Town Council last year. We expected them to stand up for Harwich when it actually mattered but they didn’t. Labour’s amendment was supported by councillors representing Clacton, Jaywick, St Osyth, Brightlingsea and Arlesford but our two Harwich Tories would not raise their hands. Ramsey and Parkeston’s councillor, Tony Colbourne, actually voted against the work going ahead.\nLabour ended the evening by voting against the budget. There are, undoubtedly, things in it which Labour hopes are achieved. However, there was no priority given to helping businesses, increased local employment and inward investment and It denied available assistance for the disabled, the homeless and the vulnerable. The budget also funded nine cabinet members to oversee five departments and the insult of a 0.5% council tax reduction that will not buy a household a single loaf of bread each year and will jeopardise local services in future years. This being the case, your local Labour councillors voted against it.\nThere was an opportunity to do so much good and to do it without any additional funding. It was very sad and very frustrating that the Tories put more effort into blocking Labour’s proposals than they put into preparing a budget that would have been a benefit to the district.",

I believe that a hard working and dedicated county councillor can make a big difference on issues such as highway matters, policing, education and the fire brigade and Harwich needs a strong voice representing our needs at County Hall.”\nIvan has been very unhappy about how Harwich appears to have been ignored on many issues for which Essex County Council is responsible and believes that Harwich deserves better.\n“Whether it is stinging nettles overhanging footpaths, potholes or bidding for growth funding to provide jobs we have been receiving a very poor service from Essex County Council,” continued Ivan Henderson. “The local county councillor should provide a strong voice on such issues and I do not feel Harwich has had this over the last three years.”\nFor further information please contact",

It is costly, unsightly and unnecessary and local residents are fed up with it.”\nCllr. Smith represents Harwich and Dovercourt Kingsway Ward on Harwich Town Council and he is having reports of fly tipping reach him constantly from all over his ward. He is aware that his colleagues are experiencing similar problems throughout the town and believes a strategic approach is needed to counter the tipping.\n“It was obvious that the decision to go to two weekly refuse collections and to limit how much waste will be collected was going to increase fly tipping but there doesn’t appear to have been any thought given to combating the problem,” continued Cllr. Smith. “TDC officers are doing their best but it is time that they were given some political leadership and support from the portfolio holder.

We worked extremely hard throughout the campaign and I believe that the people of West Central ward realise that Harwich needs hard working councillors who are prepared to speak up on the town’s behalf.”\nWith a majority of over 250 the outcome was decisive with the voters of West Central ward sending a clear message that the people of Harwich believe they are being let down at all levels by the Tories.\nLeader of the Labour group on Harwich Town Council, Les Double, says\n“Maria worked tirelessly throughout the campaign and she will work tirelessly as a Labour councillor on Harwich Town Council. When you take into consideration this election was fought before the Tory recycling fiasco hit Harwich it could have been even more decisive.”",

The outcome of this review will provide evidence to lobby Central Government to give future adequate funding of Adult Social Care\n3) To carry out an independent review of Highways covering the quality of the contract and repairs at a cost of £105,000.\nThis will all be funded from the current Innovation Fund Reserve.\nLabour Group leader Councillor Ivan Henderson stated “We have grave concerns in all these 3 areas of council activities.\nFrom our own residents we know that there have been big negative impacts on Social Care ever since the Conservative council introduced the new charging policy, asking people to pay for their own care. In addition, they are recommending a £30M cut in adult social care and this is even with the chiefs at county hall implementing a 5% council tax rise this year .”\n“In recent years we have seen an end to elderly fall prevention services and an end to Meals on Wheels. We urgently need a review and need to lobby central government for more resources. “\nNationally Children’s services face a £2 billion funding gap by 2020 and is now the immediate pressure for councils and Essex County Council is no different. The council have a £5. 3M overspend in children’s services which is why Labour are asking for a review to ascertain the impact of budget cuts on early intervention and prevention measures.\nEssex Labour councillors want a thorough review of the Highways contract focusing on quality of the work done. Central government is investing £1.1M for every mile on Motorways but local roads in Essex are only getting £21K per mile in comparison. It is essential that local roads are being looked after and maintained efficiently and properly.\nCouncillor Ivan Henderson says “After nearly eight years of Conservative government, councils have lost over 40 per cent of their funding. And as a result, Essex County Council will increase borrowing to £350M over the next 3 years. The Leader of the Council has stated there will be a funding gap of £94 million for ECC when Government funding comes to an end in 2020.\nAnd actually, we do not know how local government will even work post 2020, because the government is giving no assurances around how local government will be funded after March 2020. This is astonishing and shows the ineptitude of this current Conservative government.”\nENDS\nEssex Labour Group Leader contact details:\nCouncillor Ivan Henderson\nMobile: 07889 367822\nSource- http://www.essexlabour.org.uk/labour_demands_openness_and_transparency_in_budget",

When he did not there was a responsibility among the Tendring Conservatives to take a firm stance and show that they will not tolerate such views by expelling him from their group. What does it say about the Tendring Tories if they are willing to welcome him back with open arms as soon as Christmas is over?!”\nThe Labour Group believes that Cllr Mayzes should resign his seat. The fact that his views were not considered ‘criminal’ does not alter the fact that they are totally unacceptable and Labour believes that his continued presence as a TDC councillor does nothing to enhance the good name of the council.\n“It is sad for the good name of Tendring District Council that Danny Mayzes remains one of its members and it is a stain on the reputation of the Tendring Conservatives that he is to remain a Conservative councillor,” continued Cllr Calver. “His expressed views have no place in mainstream politics and he should accept this and resign.”\nFor further information please contact Garry Calver on 01255 551940",

We had a cruise ship in and they would have seen all this.\n“It’s a conservation area for goodness sake.”\nMr Henderson said not only do the weeds look untidy for residents, but it gives a bad impression to tourists.\nHe added: “We are trying to do things for the next year for the Mayflower 400 celebrations and no-one seems to be getting a grip.\n“We had a meeting of councillors the other day and everyone was bringing up how fed up they are of seeing weeds and grass growing out of the footpaths.\n“I looked in West Street and it’s even worse.\n“We pay our council tax to keep our streets clean and tidy and it’s not happening.\n“They need to put the resources in place to tidy up our streets.”\nMr Henderson also complained about a council flat in Church Street left with a boarded up window for at least a month.\nIt comes after his concerns the road is sinking and being left with a crumbling road surface and large potholes, which he first raised in 2017.\nEssex County Council is now set to close the road from June 10 for nine days to carry out patching work. A surface treatment is set to be done at a later date.\nChurch Street, in Harwich, is one of the town’s oldest streets and is home to the Grade I listed Guildhall and Forester’s, a building dating back to 1450.\nA Tendring Council spokesman said: “These areas are maintained by Tendring Council on behalf of Essex County Council. Weed spraying is undertaken in this area twice annually, the first of which is due to take place early June 2019.”\nSource https://www.harwichandmanningtreestandard.co.uk/news/17689204.plea-to-tidy-up-historic-harwich-of-overgrown-weeds/",

Labour is furious at the tactics being employed by the Conservatives to prevent the restoration of full night street lighting and is seeking to ensure that the council’s Budget includes the necessary funding to allow it to go ahead.\nLeader of the Labour Group of TDC councillors, Ivan Henderson, says “We shouldn’t have to pay twice for our street lights but until the Tories accept that this dreadful policy is increasing crime, increasing accidents and is having a negative impact on pubs and restaurants we have little choice. People are suffering because the Tories won’t admit they’ve got it wrong.”\nThe Labour amendment to the Budget will read:\n‘In accordance with the figure of £127,000 quoted by Essex County Council in 2014 as the amount saved by ECC by switching off the lights in the Tendring District between midnight and 5AM,\nfunding of up to £150k is set aside in the Revenue Commitments Reserve in 2014/15, the cost of which to be met from the Fit for Purpose Budget, to allow TDC to fund the restoration of full night street lighting throughout the Tendring District in 2015/16.’\nTDC is presently sitting on over £12 million in available funds so full night street lighting can easily be funded without any increase to council tax.\n“The Tories at County Hall have switched off our street lights and the Tendring Tories seem determined to try to stop us switching them back on,” continued Ivan Henderson. “It’s time they all stopped trying to defend the indefensible and listened to the people who elected them.”\nFor further information please contact Ivan Henderson on 07889 367822",

I have to assume from all I know of it that either yourself, Cllr Calver, or someone acting on behalf of the Labour Group has been hacking Conservative Group e-mails.’\nGarry Calver has repeatedly asked Cllr Stock to either provide his evidence for this very serious allegation or to withdraw it but instead he has chosen to repeat and, indeed, extend the allegation, even after an internal TDC investigation confirmed that there had been no breach of TDC systems.\nCllr Garry Calver says\n“The allegation made by Cllr Stock is entirely untrue and he cannot be allowed to smear the reputation of other councillors in such a manner without being held to account for his actions. This man is the leader of the council and should be setting an example in terms of behaviour.”\nThe Labour Group has been in correspondence with the chief executive of TDC, Ian Davidson, and Cllr Stock since Cllr Stock made his allegation and finally sought advice when it became clear that Cllr Stock was not prepared to withdraw his allegation.\nLeader of the Labour Group, Ivan Henderson, says\n“Cllr Stock has left us with no choice but to lodge formal complaints. He has continued to make the allegation which is completely untrue and, to be honest, extremely distasteful. Garry Calver is totally blind and to accuse him of computer hacking is beyond belief. It does nothing to promote the reputation of the council.”\nFor further information please contact\nGarry Calver on 01255 551940\nIvan Henderson on 07889 367822\n‘Complaint lodge over email hacking allegations’ East Anglian Daily Times\n‘Essex voters hacked off with scheming Tories’ – Daily Mirror\n‘Hacking Case Complain Thrown Out’ – East Anglian Daily Times",

Concerns were raised recently when a list of S106 allocations was issued and this particular contribution was shown as being allocated towards an ‘affordable housing’ project in Clacton.\nAt a meeting in Harwich on Wednesday, assurances were given that the sum in question was no longer allocated for the Clacton project and is available to be used in the Harwich area. The money can only be used for the provision of affordable housing and must be used before December 2015.\nHarwich’s Labour councillors made it clear that they want the money spent on a project in the Harwich area and that they wish council officers to actively seek a local project for this purpose.\nCllr. Dave McLeod, who raised the issue at a meeting of TDC, says, “It is good to know that the £100,000 is still available to be spent on an affordable housing project in Harwich. It’s a shame that the legal agreement limits the use of the money to this specific purpose but the important thing is that it can still be spent in Harwich.”\nThe Capital House development is in Harwich East Central Ward and the two ward councillors, Dave Mcleod and Garry Calver, were also assured that they would be consulted on the use of the funds prior to the money being allocated to a project. Ward councillors are entitled to be consulted although they do not have a veto on the use of S106 funds and do not have the final say on how such funding is allocated.\nCllr. Garry Calver says, “Dave and I made it absolutely clear that we would oppose any use of this money outside of the Harwich area. We understand that the £100,000 can only be used for affordable housing and that at present there is no identified project in the Harwich area that meets this criteria. We have asked officers to actively seek such a project in the 14 months available.”\nFor further information please contact Garry Calver on 01255 551940",

A previous policy review of the Meals On Wheels service carried out in 2011 by the Community Wellbeing and Older People Committee found that well over 80% of residents that used the Meals On Wheels service were aged 76 and over.\n2. Current delivery partner, Sodexo, has continued provision of the Meals On Wheels service, which includes the delivery of hot meals directly to residents with the addition of a ‘safe and well’ check where delivery drivers check on the well-being of customers.\n3. These checks can act as an ‘early warning system’ as it means vulnerable people receive frequent visits allowing for a preventative measure to be in place to ‘avoid more costly admissions to hospital’.\n4. In response to the announcement, Deputy Leader of the County Labour Group, Cllr Ivan Henderson, said;\n“If the 84p subsidy for each hot meal were to be passed on to the resident, a user who receives a meal 5 days a week all year round from this service would need to find an extra £218 a year to continue receiving meals. This is on top of careful spending of winter fuel payments which are vital for the most vulnerable elderly residents in Essex.\n“If adopted by the Conservative Administration, this cruel policy could force pensioners to make a choice in some cases of whether to pay the increase for a hot meal or to break into their annual heating allowances which would take a large chunk of their heating money. It could be a stark choice of whether they eat or heat their home in winter months.”\n“There are revenue spends such as free Members lunches which could be used to help reduce the burden of passing the cost on to this vulnerable group of residents (5). The annual spend (£31,198) by the council on Member lunches alone could easily subsidise every user of Meals On Wheels in the Tendring District who receives a hot meal 5 times a week (6).\n“It was only last week that the council had stated publicly that they were in a better position financially to stop the school patrol crossing cuts – I urge the Conservative Administration to think carefully about carrying out this painful policy”.\n(1) Consultation with service users ends 7th July 2014.\n(2) Service Review June 2011 (page 8)\n(3) Cabinet Report Sodexo contract (page 2/3)\n(4) Cabinet Report Sodexo contract (page 2/3)\n(5) ECC045508-14 (FOI – annual spend of free Member lunches)\n(6) Table below shows Meals On Wheels service user distribution\n| Basildon | 131 |\n| Braintree | 102 |\n| Brentwood | 71 |\n| Castle Point | 79 |\n| Chelmsford | 137 |\n| Colchester | 97 |\n| Epping Forest | 58 |\n| Harlow | 27 |\n| Maldon | 42 |\n| Rochford | 73 |\n| Tendring | 104 |\n| Uttlesford | 82 |\n| TOTAL | 1003 |\nFor further information contact:\nCllr Ivan Henderson, Deputy Leader of County Labour Group – TEL: 07889 367822",

The Tories crazy thinking is to create a system under which no one has to travel more than 10 miles to dispose of their rubbish and the residents of Harwich, Dovercourt, Ramsey and Parkeston could do this at Lawford.\nThe suggestion from County Hall is our Dovercourt Recycling Centre is under used which indicates no one involved in the decision has visited the site to see the long queues in West End Lane which can often result in a half hour wait to get rid of rubbish and garden waste.\nHarwich Labour’s immediate reaction was one of incredulity and then anger. Once we had talked to the journalists to confirm what we were hearing was accurate the Harwich Branch Labour Party immediately started making plans to fight the closure, in doing so, we are not in competition or conflict with other local political parties. We believe everyone locally sees this as an outrageous and a counterproductive proposal. We hope everyone will join with us in fighting against the proposed closure plans.\nWe have launched a petition via a Facebook page ‘Petition to Save Dovercourt Tip’ which can be signed on hard copies or online click HERE. So far the response has been fantastic; at Friday’s Dovercourt Street Market we collected over 350 signatures in under two hours. Everyone who signed was saying the same things:\n“What’s the point of cleaning up the town if they close the tip and encourage fly tipping?”\n“No one is going to drive 10 miles to Lawford just to get rid of grass cuttings.”\n“How much more are they going to take away from Harwich?”\n“Good luck in trying to stop this. It’s ridiculous!”\nWe can’t promise to stop this closure but we do promise to try. With your support we will make sure that Essex County Council sees the error of its ways. We hope Essex County Council will do the right thing.\nLINKS:\nPDF download for printing: Petition to SAVE Dovercourt Tip – Cover sheet.\nPDF download: Continuation sheets\nCompleted sheets can be collected by arrangement email HarwichLabourParty@gmail.com or please deliver to 73, Ashley Road, Dovercourt.\nFor further information please contact:\nHarwich Branch Labour Press Officer, Garry Calver on 01255-551940",

At the following meeting of Harwich Town Council Labour’s Garry Calver informed members that he had found the representatives of the Trust to be aggressive, rude and unsympathetic and that he now felt the only route to protecting existing maternity services at Harwich Hospital was to seek the direct involvement of Bernard Jenkin. He proposed that Harwich Town Council seek a meeting with the MP to express its concerns and his proposal was seconded by Labour colleague, Pam Morrison before being passed by the council.\nSince the meeting was arranged, Ivan Henderson has become aware of further short notice closures to Harwich’s maternity unit and has written to the Trust seeking assurances and clarification as to the situation.\nThe Labour group on Tendring District Council proposed a motion to ensure that TDC adopted a policy of opposing any reduction to maternity services at either Harwich or Clacton hospitals and, although the Conservatives attempted to weaken this stance, sufficient members supported our motion to the point where we were able to ensure a wording was passed that met Labour’s demand.\nAll local Labour councillors are committed to doing everything possible to retain all existing services at Harwich’s maternity unit and wish to place on record our thanks and support to all of its staff for the wonderful work they are doing.\nFor further information contact: Harwich Labour Press Officer Garry Calver",

We do not believe that local residents should go through the winter with the lights out at night and this is a way of switching them back on at a cost of only 4p per household per week. It’s wrong that people will have to pay twice but their safety and peace of mind is too important not to take immediate action.”\nThe Labour Group on Harlow District Council has tabled a similar motion and has the support of the Conservative Group on its council and the Labour Group on TDC expects the Tendring Tories to put political differences aside and to support Labour’s motion in the best interest of local residents.\n“We must keep the pressure on the Tories running Essex County Council to reverse the policy but until they do I expect all TDC councillors to support our motion and get our lights switched back on,” continued Ivan Henderson. “This is achievable and affordable and, while it shouldn’t be necessary, we cannot let this situation continue.”\nFor further information please contact\nIvan Henderson on 07889 367822",

In particular, Labour believes the proposed 0.5% reduction in council tax is nothing more than a party political gesture. If the administration fails to accept any of the Labour amendments then Labour councillors will vote against the proposed reduction in council tax although the group will reconsider its position if amendments are accepted which will result in a greater benefit to the district being achieved than is lost under such a council tax reduction.\nLeader of the Labour group, Councillor Les Double, says\n“This Tory budget does nothing to improve the lot of residents while risking future finances through a meaningless cut in council tax. The four unnecessary Tories sitting in the cabinet cost more than the entire council tax reduction.”\nLabour’s three amendments to the budget proposal are\nThat economic development and regeneration across the District be significantly enhanced at this most difficult time for families by the provision of additional funding of £500,000, to be taken from the Fit for Purpose budget, and to be spent on a programme of work/activity to be agreed by the Cabinet within the next 3 months in consultation with all Group Leaders.\nLes Double says\n“At a time of increasing unemployment it is beyond belief that the Tories are not focussing on local regeneration and economic development. We need successful businesses and more jobs locally and the budget should be recognising this.”\nFunding be provided to:\na. Reverse the 48% increase in the hire charges for sports pitches imposed in 2011;\nb. Continue the Disabled Go scheme for a further 3 years; and\nc. Carry out a full feasibility study for the development of a Foyer in the district to support young people all to be funded from the reduction in number of Cabinet Members, including the Leader of the Council, to 6 and/or from the revenue surplus for 2012/13.\nLes Double says\n“It is obscene that four Tory cabinet members are receiving a total of £40,000 a year without having departments to run. For this amount we can continue to fund ‘Disabled Go’, thoroughly investigate establishing a Foyer for Tendring that would assist the homeless and most vulnerable in our community and reverse the crazy pitch hire charges that now mean that sports clubs can no longer afford to use council owned facilities.”\nThat the decision taken by the council on 18th February 2010 be implemented without further delay and that work be completed during 2012/2013 to upgrade and refurbish Dovercourt Swimming Pool and Sports Hall in accordance with a substantial scheme to be agreed within the next 3 months by the Cabinet In consultation with all Group Leaders, to be funded from the existing budgeted provision for the swimming pool and an additional £800,000 in respect of the sports hall to be funded from the Fit for Purpose budget.\nLes Double says\n“It is now two years since the council voted for this project and yet the Tories still refuse to deliver it. The neglect is shameful and avoidable. The money is still available and there are no excuses for Harwich being treated like this.”\nLabour will also support a Tendring 1st amendment calling for £120,000 to be taken from the ‘Big Society’ fund in order to re establish personal budgets for councillors to fund small schemes within their own wards.\nLes Double says\n“The Tories ‘Big Society Fund’ has proved to be little more than a private pot for senior Tories to use to aid pet projects. The voluntary sector is being squeezed across the district and we need to go back to the system that ensures available funding is spread more widely and fairly.”\nThe three Labour amendments can all be achieved without any borrowing by the council and would still leave the £4 million in uncommitted reserves. Each amendment has been scrutinised by TDC’s Finance officers and has been accepted as legitimate.\n“Labour’s budget amendments are affordable and beneficial,” continued Les Double. “In our view they are of a far greater priority than a council tax cut which would not buy each household a single loaf of bread per year and a desire by the Tories to keep nine Tory councillors in a cabinet that is only overseeing five council departments.”\nFor further information please contact\nLes Double on 01255 242645\nIvan Henderson on 07889 367822",

TDC had been one of only 26 councils in the country which still took child maintenance into consideration when calculating this benefit and its policy was contradictory to the guidance provided by the Government on the subject.\nInitially, the Conservative administration had opposed Labour’s amendment to end this practise even though it only cost the council £4,000 per year but, at a special meeting of the council held last night, the Conservative leader of the council confirmed that he had listened to the case made by the Labour Group and recommended that the council adopt Labour’s position.\nSome hard liners within the Conservative ranks refused to follow their leader’s call and only four of his cabinet voted in line with his recommendation but the motion was carried to the delight of the Labour Group.\nDeputy leader of the Labour Group, Cllr John Hawkins, who had led Labour’s campaign to remove child maintenance from the calculation, welcomed the Conservative about turn and explained that Tendring had child poverty levels running at 29% and that the government considered excluding child maintenance from such calculations as an aid to reducing child poverty.\nSpeaking after the meeting the leader of the Labour Group, Cllr Ivan Henderson, said, “There are only a handful of hard line councils who still use child maintenance in this inappropriate way and I am very pleased that Labour has persuaded TDC that it should no longer be one of them. John Hawkins was quite brilliant in putting the Labour case and his legal expertise and experience has won an important victory for vulnerable families in the Tendring District.”\nFurther information contact Harwich Labour Press Officer Garry Calver\nTEL: 01255 551940 email garrycalver@btinternet.com",

  "https_www_harwichlabourparty_org_uk_clp_/https_www_harwichlabourparty_org_uk_2013_02_facts-about-the-bedroom-tax/content_96.html": "What is changing?\nThe new rules will affect housing benefit, which is paid to less well-off tenants to help with rent. Typically claimants receive between £50 and £100 a week.\nBut from April 2013 families deemed to have too much living space by their local authorities will receive a reduced payment. Under the government’s so-called “size criteria”, families will be assessed for the number of bedrooms they actually need.\nWho will be affected?\nThis change affects council tenants, and those who rent from housing associations. It does not affect private sector tenants.\nThe government estimates that 660,000 households will have their benefit cut, roughly a third of social sector claimants. Only those of working age will see reduced payments.\nHow much will people lose?\nIf tenants are deemed to have one spare room, the amount of rent eligible for housing benefit will be cut by 14%. If they have two or more spare rooms, the cut will be 25%.\nThe government says that will mean an average loss of about £14 a week for council tenants. Those who rent from housing associations are facing an average loss of about £16 a week.\nHow many bedrooms are you allowed?\nThe new rules allow one bedroom for each adult or couple. Children under the age of 16 are expected to share, if they are the same gender. Those under 10 are expected to share whatever their gender.\nDisabled tenants will be allowed a bedroom for full-time carers. The number of bedrooms in the property will be determined by the landlord’s tenancy agreement, so you cannot claim a bedroom is actually a living room.\nCan I keep a spare bedroom?\nNot without losing benefit. Parents who are separated are not allowed to keep a vacant bedroom for a child who visits. Foster children are not counted as permanent members of a household.\nWhat about students?\nFrom April, parents will not be penalised if a student is away, as long as he or she sleeps at home for at least two weeks a year. But when universal credit comes in from this autumn, students will need to be at home for at least six months to avoid a benefit cut.\nWhat about lodgers?\nFrom April, claimants with a paying lodger will be allowed to keep the first £20 of weekly rent. But housing benefit will be then be cut, pound for pound, on the rest of the rent they receive.\nHowever, after universal credit is established, housing benefit will be cut, but tenants will be allowed to keep all the rental income (although only the first £4,250 of annual rent is free of income tax).\nAre pensioners exempt?\nFrom April 2013, if either half of a couple are of pensionable age, they will not suffer reductions to housing benefit.\nUnder universal credit, both will need to be over pensionable age, or one will need to be in receipt of pension credit, in order to qualify for the maximum benefit.",

We want to know what this 5 year claim is based on.”\nAfter reading the Standard’s front page article Ivan Henderson immediately contacted Essex County Council’s Portfolio Holder for Transport, Cllr Rodney Bass, who confirmed that there was no agreed funding, that he had no idea what the claim was based on and that he was not aware of a design brief having been drawn up by the Highways Agency.\n“Local Labour councillors have been campaigning for improvements to the A120 for years and would be overjoyed if the claims made in last week’s Standard were true,” continued Ivan Henderson. “However, the people of Harwich have been let down too many times for us to believe this claim without evidence to back it up.

How is it possible to argue that what is safe for those other communities is somehow not safe for Harwich and Dovercourt?’\nThese are statements included in Bernard Jenkin MP’s response to Harwich Town Council after the council unanimously expressed its disgust at his support for the options put out to public consultation by the Essex Fire Authority.\nThe Labour Group on Harwich Town Council believes that Mr Jenkin’s response further shows that he is completely out of touch with what is happening in his own constituency and, what is worse, has not bothered to find out.\nLeader of the Labour Group of Harwich Town Councillors, Ivan Henderson, says, “All of the options could leave the Harwich Peninsula 15 minutes away from its nearest available fire engine when fire-fighters know that 10 minutes is the ‘golden time’ to save a life. How dare Bernard Jenkin ask why we should be treated differently? He should be ashamed of himself!”\nMr Jenkin also states in his letter:\n‘I am sorry to say that the Town Council is not representing the best interests of Harwich and Dovercourt by insisting that it will not accept anything less than full time crews when we already have on call at night.’\nThis statement is totally untrue. Harwich Town Council is fully aware that the town’s 2nd fire engine is already crewed by retained fire-fighters and at no time has the council suggested that this should be upgraded to a full time crew. Also, Mr Jenkin is clearly unaware that the ‘on call’ service at night is provided by the full time fire-fighters thus ensuring an immediate response. All of the options supported by Mr Jenkin would remove that guaranteed response.\n“Bernard Jenkin is accusing Harwich Town Council of using scare stories when he hasn’t even bothered to visit Dovercourt Fire Station to find out the facts,” continued Ivan Henderson. “His breathtaking arrogance is endangering the safety of those living and working on the Harwich Peninsula.”\nClick image to read Bernard Jenkin’s letter.\nFurther information please contact Press Officer Garry Calver Tel 01255 551940",

Campaigning costs money and it’s great to be speaking at this sell-out event to raise funds for the party as we prepare for another round of crucial elections”.\nThe election in May for the Police and Crime Commissioner and the EU referendum vote takes place the following month. Local elections for Essex County Council take place in 2017.\nASLEF General Secretary, Mick Whelan, is also speaking at the dinner which has attracted Labour members from across North Essex and beyond.\nWatson added: “The local Tories are fighting each other and even UKIP is split. It is only the Labour Party that is offering a strong, united voice on behalf of ordinary people across the Tendring District”\n“Whether it is fighting to keep local full time fire-fighters or campaigning for the UK to stay stronger, safer and better off by remaining in the EU, Labour is on the side of local people”.\nPrior to the dinner Tom Watson will be visiting the Alma Inn in Harwich which is Tendring CAMRA’s Pub of the Year for 2016. This weekend is a special weekend in Harwich for lovers of real ale as the Harwich Ale Trail is taking place in the local pubs and Tom is keen to show his support for this community event.\n“The community in Harwich is well known for pulling together and making things happen and the Harwich Ale Trail is a great example of this,” Tom Watson said. “Ivan has told me that the Alma Inn is a fine example of Harwich’s centuries-old pubs and I am looking forward to having a pint there on Friday.”\nFor further information please contact Ivan Henderson on 07889 367822",

Not only did he fail to do so but three of his cabinet then produced shambolic performances under questioning which suggested that they are not fit to be in the cabinet anyway.\nDeputy leader of the Labour Group Councillor Ivan Henderson, says\n“Councillor Stock’s ‘State of Tendring’ speech was weak, indecisive and lacked any detail. The one area he could have immediately acted with some decisiveness was over the size of his own Tory cabinet but he said nothing. There are still four Tory councillors being paid £42,000 a year between them to oversee departments that no longer exist.”\nTo add to the Tory embarrassment, three members of his cabinet then failed miserably to answer questions put to them on issues they should have been aware of.\nCouncillor Stephen Mayzes could not provide a decisive answer on whether or not TDC was providing any funding for a project in Jaywick, Councillor Sarah Candy suggested that she would need ideas from the opposition before she could begin to address rising youth unemployment and Councillor Pam Sambridge, when asked for details on the council’s flood defence plans for Holland on Sea could only say, “There’s lots going on”.\n“Neil Stock has paid four of his Tory colleagues over £23,000 of council tax payers money since September 6th to oversee departments that no longer exist,” continued Ivan Henderson. “If that wasn’t bad enough we were treated last night to a pathetic display from members of his cabinet which suggests they are not up to it anyway. Action is long overdue.”\nFor further information please contact\nIvan Henderson on 07889 367822",

The Conservative Government has massively reduced its funding of local councils over the past thirteen years, and this has had a large impact on the services that residents need and are entitled to. This award will in no way make up for the amount that has been removed but is certainly good news and is to be welcomed.\n£6.7m Levelling Up Fund grant awarded for Dovercourt town centre schemes in Budget",

To Labour’s amazement and fury, not only did the Tories close ranks to prevent the suspension of standing orders, local Tory councillors Ricky Callener, Claire Callender and Tony Colbourne voted with their Tory colleagues against the best interests of Harwich.\nSpeaking after the meeting Ivan Henderson could barely control his anger as he explained how important it was that the motion was heard last night.\n“The full weight of TDC needed to be used to ensure that the options put out for consultation include retaining Harwich’s maternity unit and I had the evidence in my hand to prove that the consultation as it now stands is flawed. We were gagged by the Tories who used procedure rules to prevent a vital debate. To make matters worse three Tories elected to represent the people of Harwich, Dovercourt, Ramsey and Parkeston put their allegiance to the Conservative Party before their allegiance to our maternity unit. That was unforgivable!”\nDeputy leader of the Labour Group, Garry Calver, was full of praise for Ivan Henderson’s determined effort.\n“The Tories’ refusal to allow a debate meant that Ivan was the only person allowed to put our case and he was fantastic,” said garry Calver. “I sat next to him as he took them on, leaving them in no doubt as to why they should be putting the needs of our maternity services first. I don’t think I have ever seen him so angry and frustrated but he could not have done any more. The Tories had clearly made up their minds and were not going to allow the debate.”\nIt is now absolutely clear that Labour is the only party that will fight to retain the maternity unit at Harwich Hospital. Labour cannot believe that there is not cross party support on this issue and accepts that it will be harder to save Harwich’s maternity unit without everyone pulling together but the residents who wish to see local maternity services protected can be assured that Labour councillors will do everything possible to prevent a reduction in maternity services at Harwich Hospital.\nSIGN the PETITION organised by the H&M Standard and the Gazette -> https://submissions.epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/51825\nFor further information contact: Ivan Henderson or\nHarwich Labour Press Officer Garry Calver",

Dylis Miles, used her authority as chairman to refuse to hear a motion asking for the decision to be considered by the entire council.\nAfter that, the five Tory councillors on the committee voted down a motion asking the cabinet to re consider the decision.\nLastly, the five Tory councillors, three of whom did not utter a single word during the two and a half hour meeting, voted to allow the decision to stand.\nIvan Henderson, a member of the committee and one of the callers in, says\n“It appeared that the five Tory councillors were acting on instructions. Three of them didn’t say a word at the meeting but all voted in line with the cabinet decision. As a result, many community groups will face full market rents in three years time and may go out of business as a result.”\nThe five Conservative councillors sitting on the committee:\nDylis Miles (Walton), Mathew Patten (Wix Wrabness and Bradfield), Claire Callender (Harwich West Central), Chris Amos (St Johns) and Amthony Pugh (Walton)\nFor further information please contact Cllr.

This proposal was not only voted down by the Tory administration but one Tory cabinet member actually ripped up his copy of the proposal and flung it on the floor.\nLabour was pleased, therefore, when the leader of the council, Councillor Neil Stock, responded to a written question from Labour councillor, Graham Caines, at last night’s meeting of TDC by confirming that a small working party has been established to consider the proposal.\nDeputy leader of the Labour group, Councillor Ivan Henderson, says\n“We are very pleased that this Labour proposal is being taken seriously after all. The way some of the Tories reacted when we tabled this budget amendment it did not look promising.”\nLabour is disappointed that, having put forward the proposal, no Labour councillors have been included on the working party but is pleased that Councillor Irene Tracey of Tendring 1st is sitting on it. Councillor Tracey seconded Labour’s original proposal and is extremely knowledgeable on the subject.\n“This proposal is fundamental to helping the most vulnerable in our community and we were very disappointed when it was originally voted down,” continued Ivan Henderson. “This is good news and we look forward to quick and genuine progress.”",

Because the General Election takes place on the same day local issues are not going to get the attention they usually would and your local Labour councillors have worked tirelessly over the last four years on behalf of our town.\nWe are aware that you vote by post and, therefore, may have voted before your local Labour team visits your street. This being the case we are writing to you to ask you to use your votes in all three elections for your local Labour candidates.\nIt has been the Labour councillors who have been fighting to get the street lights switched back on at night, who have worked to stop the Conservatives closing our tip and who have upgraded our CCTV coverage to assist the police as local crime rates soar. Instead of helping us on such issues the Conservatives have denied crime is rising, voted to keep the street lights switched off and accused us of scaremongering over the tip. In the case of the tip it was the Standard who revealed the Conservative plan to close it and yet the Tories still played politics by blaming Labour rather than getting behind our campaign to keep it open.\nEven more worrying, the constant in fighting and back stabbing among the Tendring Tories has resulted in TDC’s new Local Plan being delayed. This means that we risk having thousands of houses built in our area without the power to stop it happening, all because the local Conservatives are arguing amongst themselves.\nWhile all this has been going on UKIP have done nothing. Our town needs more from its councillors than a leaflet through the door at election time and only Labour is offering more.\nWhether it is about the Maternity Unit, Town Centre improvements, encouraging cruise ship passengers and crews into our town, fighting TDC to get our swimming pool refurbished or stopping the Tories from imposing crippling rent increases on local clubs, societies and organisations it has been Labour councillors working shoulder to shoulder with the local community.\nUnder Labour Harwich Town Council has also provided grant aid to projects such as the Mayflower Project, the LV18 lightship, the New Year’s Eve fireworks and the Harwich Festival of the Arts along with many other local good causes.\nNo other party has shown the dedication and commitment that Labour councillors have given over the last four years and, quite simply, no other party will.\nWe enclose a copy of a recent local leaflet and would ask that you support your local Labour candidates in the General, District and Town Council elections when casting your votes.\nKind regards\nHarwich Labour Candidates\nIvan Henderson, Charlie Powell, Alan Todd and Geoff Smith.\nLabour’s team for East Ward.\nJohn McAllister, John Hawkins, Pam Morrison, Malcolm Nicholson, Mell Parkin\nLabour’s team for West Ward.\nMaria Fowler, Jo Henderson, Dee King, Fiona Powell\nLabour’s team for West Central Ward\nGarry Calver, Anne Hines, Dave McLeod, Wayne Tearle\nLabour’s team for East Central Ward\nCharlie Powell\nLabour’s candidate for Ramsey and Parkeston",

We cannot speak for the three other local councillors but I would hope that all of Harwich’s TDC councillors would support the Harwich Society in making Harwich in Bloom 2008 a success.”\nFor further information please contact Garry Calver on: 01255 551940",

Like 25-year-old opponent Mr Quince, Mr Newell is still in the early stages of his career, aged just 24. “Regardless of party preference, having young people in politics can only be a good thing,” he said. “I am very pleased that the Labour party is supporting me as their prospective parliamentary candidate.”\nMr Newell, who grew up in Harwich, attended Mayflower Primary School and Manningtree High School. He studied politics at Colchester Sixth Form College before spending five years working with former Clacton MP Ivan Henderson as a parliamentary assistant. Now living in Tufnell Way, Colchester, he works for Volunteering England in London and is currently the youth officer for the Colchester Labour Party.\nWhile Mr Newell’s selection as prospective parliamentary candidate will not be official until the first week of December, he has already had the backing of Gordon Brown.\nThe prime minister said:\n“In Jordan Newell, Colchester has a strong, determined and effective candidate who will put local needs first. “He lives in Colchester, believes in Colchester and will give all of his efforts for Colchester.\n“His commitment to his town is exactly what the people of Colchester need from their MP.”\nHe has now made it to the Council cabinet and seems to pushed some changes in policies such as the 9am start on buses for OAPs.",

Turner’s statement made to the meeting of Tendring District Council yesterday evening.\nAs Cllr. Turner read his statement to the meeting it had clearly been pre prepared and researched so Cllr. Turner cannot claim to have spoken as he did as a result of having become angry in the heat of debate and used phrases that he did not mean. This being the case, to have taken sole personal credit for the £36 million investment in coastal defence and to insist that the reduction in the SRA paid to portfolio holders would inevitably result in less work being undertaken and work being performed more slowly is both unworthy of and unacceptable from a portfolio holder serving Tendring District Council.\nAs you are aware, I responded to Cllr. Turner’s statement by advising him that he should be sacked and my group is firmly of that opinion.\nIt would be a slap in the face to every dedicated and hard working officer serving TDC if Cllr. Turner was allowed to remain in post having publicly and deliberately expressed such views.\nFurthermore, Cllr. Turner’s continued presence as a portfolio holder would undermine public confidence in your entire cabinet. If he is allowed to remain having created the perception that the commitment of a portfolio holder is directly proportional to the financial rewards available then the motivation of every portfolio holder will be equally questionable.\nI am copying this letter to Cllr. Turner in the hope that he may accept that he has made his position untenable and resign but, should he fail to do so, I believe that you have no choice but to dismiss him from your cabinet if it is to retain any credibility.\nFor the sake of clarity, I wish to make it perfectly clear that the Labour group will not be referring this matter to the Monitoring Officer as, whilst we do believe that Cllr. Turner’s words have damaged the integrity of the council, we believe that his position as a member of your cabinet is entirely at your discretion and so we believe it is for you to take the action necessary to mitigate any reputational damage caused by his words.\nYours sincerely Ivan Henderson\nLeader of the Labour group of Tendring District Councillors",

This left Labour councillors with only one way of getting the motion heard and this was a procedure vote to suspend standing orders. Every Conservative councillor including the three representing Harwich, Dovercourt, Ramsey and Parkeston voted against Labour to ensure that the motion could not be heard.\nLeader of the Labour Group, Ivan Henderson, said after the meeting, “It was a cynical blocking move by the Tendring Tories because they knew they were going to lose the vote. They were on the run but still determined to have their own way in spite of public opinion. I’m sure that no one who was in the public gallery witnessing their behaviour will ever say that all parties are the same. I was very proud of the Labour Group who put up a tremendous fight for our residents.”\nThe Labour councillors swamped the chair with countless procedure points trying to get the motion heard but it was clear that this was a pre determined strategy led by Council leader, Mick Page, himself one of the Conservative County Councillors who introduced the Part Night Street Lighting policy. In the end, all that Labour could do was to force through a motion insisting that the vote was recorded which means that it is a matter of public record how every councillor voted. Those voting to prevent Labour’s motion being heard included Ricky Callender, Claire Callender and Tony Colbourne.\nSpeaking after the meeting the Chair of Harwich Branch Labour Party, Charlie Powell, who was in the public gallery alongside local residents said, “I have sat in the public gallery before and been disgusted by the behaviour of Cllr Mick Page’s Tory group but last night was truly beyond belief. Ivan Henderson had written to the council Chairman asking her to confirm that she would ensure the motion was heard but had received no reply. Now we know why. The anger in the public gallery was understandable and, to make matters worse, there were Tory councillors sitting there laughing. They clearly have no respect for the people they are supposed to represent.”\nMembers of the public, many who had travelled from Harwich just to hear the motion debated, became understandably angry at what they were witnessing and, in an unprecedented move, the Chair had to adjourn the meeting to allow order to be restored following the vote. It was over 20 minutes before the meeting could resume by which time Lights campaigners had left Clacton Town Hall feeling angry and let down.\nDeputy leader of the Labour Group and Harwich West Ward councillor, John Hawkins, says “We were very grateful for such strong public support and were only sorry that so many had travelled so far to be treated so poorly. We did everything we could but it is clear that the Tories were determined that our street lights would not be switched back on throughout the winter. Labour’s motion had the full support of every opposition group on TDC but the Tories were not interested in anyone’s view but their own.”\nFor further information please contact Press Officer Garry Calver on 01255 551940",

I am sure that the other parties would have been welcome on the coach but they chose not to take part. Likewise, it was very disrespectful that the local MPs knew their constituents were protesting outside but declined to come out to speak to them.”\nA number of prominent Labour MPs came out to show their support for the protest and those taking part were particularly delighted when Dennis Skinner crossed Parliament Square to show his support.\n“Labour has consistently supported the public on this issue and will continue to do so,” continued Ivan Henderson. “The other parties should stop playing politics and simply admit that the lights should be switched back on.”\nFurther information contact Harwich Labour Press Officer Garry Calver on 01255 551940",

He submitted four witness statements to support his allegation, all referring to a physical assault by Councillor Ian Beckett on Councillor Rutson.\nOn 22nd May, during an interview with the investigating solicitor, Mr Patrick Dempsey, Councillor Rutson finally had to admit that no such assault had taken place.\nCouncillor Ian Beckett, the victim of this extremely serious false allegation, now intends to submit a formal complaint to the Standards Board for England on the grounds of malicious allegation.\nCouncillor Ian Beckett says:\n“I have spent the last few days talking to my family, friends and colleagues and they all tell me that they would not wish to see anyone else go through what I have been through. Now that I have been totally exonerated we all feel that Councillor Rutson should account for his actions. He submitted four witness statements knowing them to be untrue and only came clean four months later when being questioned by the investigating solicitor. No one deserves to be treated like that.”\nThe four witness statements submitted by Councillor Rutson were provided to him by Conservative councillors Charles Sambridge, Peter Halliday, Michael Skeels and Sarah Candy and it is Ian Beckett’s intention to submit complaints against each of these councillors as well.\nCouncillor Sambridge’s witness statement states that Ian Beckett ‘physically pushed you and sent you staggering.’\nCouncillor Halliday states that he witnessed ‘aggressive jostling’.\nCouncillor Skeels states that Ian Beckett ‘pushed him on his left shoulder in an aggressive manner’.\nCouncillor Candy states ‘Whilst in the Chairman’s Parlour other councillors were discussing how appalling Councillor Beckett’s behaviour had been and that he had pushed and/or punched Councillor Rutson.’\nIn his interview with the investigating solicitor, Patrick Dempsey, Councillor Rutson finally admitted that Councillor Beckett ‘did not touch me’. This being the case, three councillors claim to have witnessed an assault that had not taken place and a fourth claimed to have heard councillors discussing an assault that had not taken place.\n“These are signed witness statements submitted by Councillor Rutson to support a complaint form signed by him,” continued Ian Beckett. “He cannot hide from what he has done and it is now time for him to account for it.”\nThe documents referred to in this statement can be viewed on Tendring District Council’s web site at http://www.tendringdc.gov.uk/",

Firstly, please accept my apologies for the delay in responding to your original\nenquiry dated 21 May 2014.\nI can advise that there are no individual risk assessment reports for each District. The exception criteria was applied to each District and reviewed during\nThe consultation process and this was published in the Key Decisions for each District. The knowledge gained during the Part Night Lighting trials in\nUttlesford and Maldon reinforced the use of the exception criteria.\nIvan Henderson says\n“Cllr Bass was speaking to the people of Essex and he misled them. It is bad enough that the safety of residents was put at risk by not having the risk assessments carried out but to then claim that they had been shows a level of desperation that cannot continue. He should resign immediately and the lights should go back on immediately. Every Essex County Councillor now knows that this policy was introduced without the necessary safety checks and no county councillor should allow this to continue.”\nFor further information please contact\nIvan Henderson on 07889 367822",

A Freedom of Information request tabled by Cllr. Morrison has revealed that only 15% of level 2 emergency calls resulted in an ambulance reaching the Harwich Peninsula within 18 minutes during November 2019, December 2019 and January 2020 with an average response time of over 40 minutes, more than double the expected arrival time.\nCllr. Pam Morrison says\n“I tabled my FOI request after an item on the national news reported that winter response times in some areas had been poor. I was shocked when I received the figures but the arrival of the data coincided with the NHS pandemic crisis so then was not the time to pursue the matter. The time is now right to seek assurances that the necessary action is being taken to ensure that the Harwich Peninsula is better served on such a critical emergency issue during the coming winter.”\nDuring the 3 months covered by the FOI request there were 582 level 2 ambulance requests to the Harwich Peninsula with only 88 arriving within the 18 minute prescribed response time. The average response time was 40 minutes and 55 seconds, more than double what it should have been.\n“As with our local fire-fighters, I have the utmost respect for the commitment and professionalism of those working for the East of England Ambulance Service and this is in no way an attack on them. The problem is that our emergency services are under resourced and those in charge are not taking into consideration the remote nature of the Harwich Peninsula. This cannot continue.”\nCllr Pam Morrison has tabled this issue for the September 1st meeting of Harwich Town Council and will be tabling it for the September 15th meeting of Tendring District Council. At both meetings she will be asking fellow councillors to put their weight behind a call for better service.\n“This really could be a matter of life and death and it cannot be left to chance,” continued Pam Morrison. “We need to know that those responsible have taken note of last winter’s figures and have taken the necessary action to ensure a much better service for the Harwich Peninsula for the coming winter.”\nFor further information please contact\nCllr.

The Labour Group believes that the 3% increase will not solve the problems and will be proposing that the council tax is raised by 1.99% in addition to the 3% levy to allow the council to make a real difference on the issues that affect people’s lives.\nThe headline Labour amendments targeted to address the current crisis are:\n1/ An additional £3,000,000 to reverse part of the All Age Increasing Independence savings planned for Adult Social Care and to restore and protect services to Vulnerable Adults, subject to increasing the\nBudget for Adult Social Care portfolio by £3,000,000.\n2/ An additional £3,000,000 to reverse part of the Health Investment in Prevention savings planned for Adult Social Care and to restore and protect services to Vulnerable Adults, subject to increasing the\nbudget for Adult Social Care portfolio by £3,000,000\n3/ An additional £1,413,549 to reverse part of the Older People Intermediate Care Pathway saving and to restore and protect service to Vulnerable Adults, subject to increasing the budget for Adult Social Care portfolio by £1,413,549\n4/ An additional £934,000 to reinstate the funding for community equipment and reverse the Community Equipment Retail Pathway saving, subject to increasing the budget for Adult Social Care portfolio by\n£934,000\nDeputy leader of the Labour Group, Cllr. Mike Danvers, says\nThe crisis in Adult Social Care is crippling the NHS and so affects every resident in Essex. It is wrong that the Tory government has shunted the responsibility for dealing with this to Essex County Council but it is equally wrong that the Tories running the council are burying their heads in the sand instead of taking action.\nThe Labour budget amendments will also include an amendment to end Part Night Street Lighting and reads:\nAn additional £1,474,000 to switch street lighting on across ECC from 1am to 5am, subject to increasing the budget for Highways & Transportation portfolio by £1,474,000.\nAnother key amendment will be to fund a complete review of the council’s policy on potholes to enable the farcical and dangerous situation that presently exists to be replaced by a policy that is fit for purpose and meets the needs of those using the roads and pavements within Essex. This amendment reads:\nAn additional £20,000 to have a complete review of the funding formula and the intervention level of highway maintenance to readdress the pothole and foot path crisis in Essex. Subject to increasing the budget for Highways and Transportation portfolio, funded by a necessary adjustment to the earmarked revenue Innovation Fund reserve being recommended to the Council.\nLeader of the Labour Group, Cllr. Ivan Henderson, says\n“We have a Conservative government that is creating the problems in Essex and a Conservative administration at County Hall that has no idea how to deal with the issues. We need strong and decisive leadership and, as the Conservatives are clearly incapable of providing this, the Labour Group will table the necessary amendments to do the job for them.”",

This is disingenuous and they should come clean with the residents of Walton. If they have expelled her then they should have advised TDC and if they haven’t then they should not have told the people of Walton that they have. This needs sorting out.”\nFor further information please contact:\nGarry Calver on 01255 551940",

This will benefit shoppers and businesses alike.”\nThe reduced rate for the Milton Road car park was one of Labour’s items agreed when Labour entered into the administration and the Labour Group is grateful to Councillor Harry Sheering for his cooperation in securing this much needed boost for Dovercourt Town Centre.\nLikewise, the Labour Group has lobbied alongside the Beach Hut Association to prevent the introduction of charges at the West End car park and is very pleased that this campaign has also been successful.\nGarry Calver says:\n“We have been working very closely with Betty Holloway and her colleagues to put forward the case for the West End car park to remain free. Once again, Harry Sheering listened carefully to the points we were making and agreed with us. It is another example of how cooperation within the administration is bringing benefits to our town.”",

The decision follows a public consultation conducted by TDC that made no mention of ending the agreement.\nLeader of the Labour Group of Tendring District councillors, Cllr. Ivan Henderson, says, “The anger that has been voiced since the announcement shows that the response to the consultation would have been very different had TDC been straight with residents and made their intentions known. We are working with other opposition parties to try to get this decision looked at again. It is outrageous that the Conservative led administration running TDC is removing its financial support for Harwich Sports Centre at the same time that it has announced a £500,000 refurbishment of Clacton leisure centre and a new £250,000 investment into a new skate park for Clacton.”\nHarwich Branch Labour Party fully supports the efforts of the Labour TDC councillors and is launching the petition to enable residents to show their support.\nChair of Harwich Branch Labour Party, Cllr. Charlie Powell, says, “We are very grateful to our Labour councillors on TDC who are working extremely hard to get this terrible decision looked at again. Local Labour Party members are always keen to work alongside our local community and this petition offers the opportunity to send a strong message to the Conservatives running TDC.”\nThe petition reads:\nThe undersigned believe that the consultation undertaken by Tendring District Council (TDC) regarding the future of Harwich Sports Centre was both flawed and misleading, in that it gave no indication that TDC might withdraw from its operation. We believe that public access to this important local recreational facility should be maintained at its present level and call upon TDC to reconsider its decision to withdraw support.\nSign the petition here https://www.change.org/harwichsportscentre\nPaper copies of the petition will be available soon from petitions@harwichlabourparty.org.uk",

This means that the cost per household is only 62 pence per week.\nThe budget has been constructed in a manner that will allow Harwich Town Council to continue to offer a £40,000 budget for grant aid to local organisations and good causes. Labour was particularly keen to ensure this support was available as the Conservative/Independent administration running TDC is set to withdraw all such grant aid leaving the voluntary sector with nowhere to turn.\nThe recent £16,000 investment that has resulted in the town owning its own Christmas lights is backed up in this budget with the funding to guarantee their installation so the days when there was annual uncertainty over Christmas lights are well and truly over. The budget also includes the necessary funding for the Town centre hanging baskets which are a very popular feature throughout the summer.\nThe council’s focus on promoting local tourism is also reflected in the budget with funding available to continue with the shuttle bus service for cruise ship crews, funding towards a new tourism related web site along with the opportunity to support other tourism related initiatives as they are developed.\nThe budget includes the necessary financial support requested by the council’s committees to allow them to fulfil their functions and ensures that there is sufficient in reserves to allow for unforeseen issues or emergencies.\nChairman of the council’s Finance committee, Labour’s Pam Morrison, says, “This budget will not add a penny to the council tax and will ensure that we have the opportunity to offer support to local groups, organisations and good causes. People are very surprised that Harwich Town Council only costs them 62 pence per week per household and yet offers so much to the local community. This budget will enable that good work to continue.”\nFor further information please contact Harwich Labour Press Officer, Garry Calver on 01255-551940",

I believe it is wrong to impose a four-storey building adjacent to existing two storey houses. The committee agreed with me and refused the application and now the Planning Inspector has dismissed the appeal for the same reason. It is very good news for local residents.”\nA second application is still to be determined and Garry Calver intends to address the committee asking them to refuse this application as well.\n“I welcome the fact that the developer has accepted the need to reduce the building to two storeys in height nearest to the road but there is still part of the new proposal that is four storeys in height,” continued Garry Calver. “My views have not changed and residents can be assured that I will be putting forward the same argument against the new proposal as I did against the original application.”",

The venue is: Kingsway Hall, 54 Kingsway, Harwich CO12 3JR.\nPlease note Registration will begin at 10.00 am.\nThe conference aims to celebrate International Women’s Day by exploring women’s issues, and hearing their voices at a local level, so that they are engaged and involved in politics. The theme of the event will be Empowering and building confidence of women across our constituency. The day will consist of speakers and workshops as follows:\n‘Frowning at Potholes’ – talk by Rosalind Scott about what it’s like to be a local woman Councillor.\nGet Women Organised at Workplace – Rebecca Rocket from Unite Community will talk about how women can organise themselves at workplace and benefits of joining unions.\nFollowing workshops will explore:\nHow to win a community campaign – India Thorogood, Coordinator of the Community Organising branch of the Labour Party will explore offline and online community campaigns which will give practical skills to empower women to campaign.\nAccessing and Exploring Adult Education Opportunities – Clare Hawkins and Sally Wilcox have worked in adult further and higher education for many years, with a particular interest in pre course educational and career guidance. This session will provide opportunities to find out about courses for adults locally and most importantly, to discuss how to turn initial ideas about what to do next into realistic and achievable plans.\nVictims and survivors of sexual violence – CARA (Centre for Action on Rape and Abuse) works with victims and survivors of sexual violence and child sexual abuse, providing independent, specialist support and promoting and representing their rights and needs. Alongside a wide range of specialist support services, CARA also delivers workshops, training, events and activism to raise awareness of sexual violence and push for change.\nWomen and care – Susan Hollinrake has worked in the field of social work and education. Women are more likely than men to work as paid carers or to offer their time as an unpaid carer for family or friends. The session will provide an opportunity for those involved in providing care, or considering becoming a carer – either paid or unpaid – to consider the effects caring has on them, how they manage the demands and to think in more depth about the way care is valued in this country.\nThis conference is the beginning of what we plan to take place around empowering women so we will be hoping to work with you the next steps at the end of the day. We are also hoping to close the event with a song from Katy Bingham-Best “The March of the Women” by Cecil Hamilton and Ethal Smyth.\nThere will be some refreshment provided at the event. There will also be some Indian vegetarian lunch available to purchase at £3.50 per person but you’re welcome to bring your own lunch if you want to. Also any contribution/donation towards the event would be welcomed.\nContact: Solma Ahmed – solmaahmed@yahoo.co.uk\nAnja Lyons – anjalyons@sky.com",

However, three months later there is no sign of the Conservative administration reducing the number of portfolio holders sitting within its cabinet to reflect the new streamlined structure.\nThe Labour group is, therefore, tabling a motion calling for the cabinet to be reduced from executive Leader and nine portfolio holders to Executive Leader and five portfolio Holders, the change coming into effect at the next meeting of the council after the tabling of the motion.\nProposer of the motion, Councillor Ivan Henderson, says:\n“Every month that passes sees cabinet members receiving payment for portfolios that no longer exist. This should have been dealt with at the same time that the new structure came into effect. If times are as hard as we are being told this surely should have been identified as an immediate saving.”\nThe Labour group has also entered into correspondence with officers to ensure that the motion is taken on the night and not referred to cabinet for consideration which would cause further unnecessary delay. It is Labour’s belief that, as every cabinet member receives a large additional allowance for being part of the cabinet, they are automatically prejudiced from considering a reduction in its number.\n“This needs to be dealt with immediately by the members of the council,” continued Ivan Henderson. “ Not only is it inefficient but every week that passes sees more council tax payers money paid to cabinet members who no longer need to be at the table.”\nFor further information please contact Ivan Henderson on: 07889 367822",

Ivan had reminded Cllr Bass of his statement that crime figures reduced in areas where the lights were switched off and how this incident called that statement into question. Remarkably, Cllr Bass replied with the single sentence,\n‘I do not believe that this is a justification for street lights which are to facilitate road safety to remain on all night.’\nIvan was shocked by the response as throughout the period of implementation of the Conservatives’ part night street lighting policy they had stated that street lights would remain on in areas covered by publicly funded CCTV, areas around banks and building societies and areas identified as crime hotspots by the police.\nIvan Henderson says, “The Conservatives made exemptions of areas where crime was a key consideration and the majority of the places where the lights remain on fall into this category. Suddenly, Cllr Bass is moving the goalposts and suggesting that road safety is the only criteria.”\nThis shift in Cllr Bass’ previously stated position is so dramatic and so sudden Labour fears that having switched off the majority of our street lights at night the Conservatives at County Hall are now seeking to turn off even more by insisting that only the lights required for road safety purposes need to stay on.\n“I am very concerned that Cllr Bass has let the cat out of the bag with his response to me and that the plan is to plunge our town centres into darkness as well,” continued Ivan Henderson. “If public opinion means anything to the Conservatives at County Hall then they should be planning to turn the lights back on rather than planning to turn more of them off.”\nFor further information please contact\nIvan Henderson on 07889 367822",

Labour fought tooth and nail to prevent this from happening and is delighted that the TDC cabinet has finally agreed to retain the scheme.\nLeader of the Labour Group on TDC, Ivan Henderson, says “CAROS was the brainchild of our late Labour colleague, Les Double, and held down the financial overheads of many community based clubs, societies and organisations who do so much good locally. The Conservatives were determined to axe the scheme and we have had to fight them all the way to retain it. This is great news!”\nLabour councillors have opposed the axing of CAROS in committee, throughout a review of the scheme and in every election fought since the Conservatives announced their intention to axe it.\n“It’s been a bruising and bitter struggle but we have finally seen the Conservatives see sense and retain this important initiative,” continued Ivan Henderson. “The axing of CAROS threatened the very existence of many community based groups and this is great news for their hard working volunteers and the local people they assist.”\nFor further information please contact Ivan Henderson on 07889 367822",

Talbot,\nI am writing to voice concern about the words attributed to you in the Harwich and Manningtree Standard published 12th June and the Gazette published 15th June.\nSpeaking on the subject of Essex County Council continuing to refuse to open all of its Waste and Recycling sites and quoted as the portfolio holder for Environment at Tendring Council, you are quoted as saying:\n“Throughout Covid 19 we have maintained a full, kerbside collection service and the vast majority of households are having no problems. We appreciate it has been difficult when recycling centres were closed and with restrictions now in place but we wholly support Essex County Council in its decision which protects both the public and staff.”\nMay I ask when Tendring District Council took the decision to ‘wholly support’ Essex County Council on this matter and, if I am correct in believing that no such decision has been taken, what authority you have to speak on behalf of the council?\nMay I also ask what evidence you have to support your statement that ‘the vast majority of households are having no problems’?\nThere are many councillors from across the political spectrum who are ‘wholly unimpressed’ by Essex County Council’s decision to leave their communities unsupported in terms of waste and recycling and I would suggest that just because you represent a ward that is served by a site that is open does not give you good reason to speak on behalf of the numerous communities whose sites remain closed and whose residents are experiencing great inconvenience.\nThe Labour Group on TDC is extremely grateful for the efforts of officers and contractors who are doing everything possible to provide a service under very challenging conditions. We believe, however, that the actions of ECC in keeping sites closed is making their task unnecessarily difficult and, as the TDC portfolio holder, we believe that you should be supporting your officers and contractors by joining us in trying to persuade ECC to see reason and to reopen all of its sites.\nYours sincerely\nCllr.

We should do everything we can to support local businesses as much as possible but we need to have a coherent strategy in place.”\nCllr. Stock went on to say, “I completely agree with what Cllr. Henderson is saying. If we can support British jobs then we are going to want to do that. If we can support even more localised jobs by employing local contractors we should be doing that every time.”\nIn his speech during the debate Ivan had told the meeting, “When we give out these contracts in the future, I would like the council to start looking at putting conditions on to make sure we either support local business or national business within this country.”\nThe Labour group is extremely pleased that the Conservative led administration supports Labour’s position and is agreeing to develop the council’s policy accordingly.

Angry Labour councillors have written to the Prime Minister, David Cameron, after a grant application from the local Salvation Army was rejected because their scheme did not offer ‘quantifiable savings’ to the council.\nLeader of the Labour group, Councillor Les Double, says:\n“The Tories running Tendring removed £1.6 million in funding to the local voluntary sector and replaced it with a single pot of £500,000. Now they are saying that local charities have to save the council further money before they can have any of this funding. It is outrageous.”\nThe Labour group has written direct to the Prime Minister at 10, Downing Street, to ask if this cold and ruthless approach to the voluntary sector was what he intended when he first established the concept of the ‘Big Society’.\n“Either David Cameron has been misleading the country in what he means by ‘the Big Society’ or his Tory colleagues running Tendring District Council are perverting his intentions,” continued Councillor Double. “Either way, the public has a right to know the truth of what the ‘Big Society’ really means to hard pressed voluntary organisations.”\nFor further information please contact Councillor Les Double on: 01255 242645\nor Councillor Ivan Henderson on: 07889 367822",

Whilst no-one denies that volunteer, retained fire-fighters do a great job it is impossible for them to provide the level of cover or speed of response necessary to ensure the safety of those living and working on the Harwich Peninsula in the event of a fire, road accident or incident. Fire-fighters know that the first 10 minutes are vital if someone is trapped by a fire and these proposals would mean that there would be times when the Harwich Peninsula is 20 minutes from its nearest fire engine.\nHarwich Town Councillor, Ivan Henderson, says, “There has been tremendous support from local people for keeping our full time fire-fighters but we are still not convinced that the people who matter are listening. The march in Dovercourt will offer a timely reminder that we are taking this matter very seriously and those making the decisions need to listen. This could genuinely be a matter of life or death.”\nThe march is being arranged for Saturday, June 4th meeting in Cliff Park at 10AM and moving off at 10.30AM. The march will pass through Dovercourt High Street and along the Main Road to the Upper Dovercourt war memorial where it will turn into Fronks Road and end in front of Dovercourt Fire Station.\n“Some people have tried to politicise this campaign by attacking the Labour Party but this is not about politics,” continued Ivan Henderson. “A fire doesn’t ask which way you vote before it traps you. We hope that everyone will join the march to show their support for our full time fire-fighters and the fantastic job that they do.”",

If they try to hang on to their home and fail after 12 months they would be left without support by this cruel policy. It is totally unacceptable.”\nLabour councillors believe that the ever growing unemployment rate means that local residents are increasingly vulnerable to being made redundant and it is often a year or so before the ultimate tragedy of having their home repossessed occurs. Someone who has worked all their life and lost their job through no fault of their own deserves better from the council than Cllr Honeywood’s heartless proposal.\n“Either Cllr Honeywood has not thought this through or he is being remarkably heartless,” continued Ivan Henderson. “The hard working people of Tendring deserve protection under such circumstances and the council should be there for them.”\nFor further information please contact\nIvan Henderson on 07889 367822",

Ivan’s plan was adopted and the new Economic Development Strategy announced at last week’s meeting of TDC’s cabinet is the outcome.\nIvan Henderson says, “It is a shame that so much time was wasted but we are pleased that the Conservative administration listened to us and accepted that what we were saying was the best way forward.”\nThe one area of concern is the statement by Cllr Candy that they will now have to look at their budget in regard to the delivery strategy.\n“The leader of the council, Cllr. Peter Halliday, announced to the council that the New Homes Bonus would be used for the purpose of regeneration and that this would amount to £1 million,” continued Ivan Henderson. “This should mean that there is no need to look for a budget and that we should be able to expect immediate action in terms of delivery.

We have no concerns about members of the public seeking or being provided with information or with journalists following up on such information in order to confirm its accuracy. Our concerns relate to the fact that elected TDC councillors representing Harwich are still being told that this information is not available which, I am sure you would agree, is a genuine concern.\nWith regard to your suggestion that the Labour Group was in some way responsible for the manner in which the HTC councillors elected to represent the CRP in 2007 discharged their duties, I fear that we must agree to disagree. I would further suggest that it would be difficult for any objective individual to examine what occurred between May 2007 and May 2011 and share your opinion. However, as I said in my previous email, we all see things differently and are entitled to our own opinions.\nWith regard to your expressed opinion on the present council I must advise you that I personally consider your views to be very offensive and extremely inaccurate. As I have previously advised you, there is a level of co-operation between councillors that has not been present for a considerable length of time and it is a pleasure to be part of a council that is focussed on the tasks for which it has been elected. As you have widened your remarks to include the entire council I will, as a matter of courtesy, advise all councillors of this correspondence.\nFinally, I am sure that you are very proud of your late wife’s connection to Harwich Borough Council. My great uncle, George Calver, was elected as an Alderman of the Borough in the 1930s and it is something of which I am extremely proud.\nKind regards\nGarry\n—– Original Message —–\nFrom: David Smith\nTo: Garry Calver\nSent: Friday, February 08, 2013 7:12 PM\nSubject: Re: 106 money\nDear Garry,\nI am disappointed that you failed to understand my e-mail and have assumed things that are wrong.I advised HMS of this information not Peter Halliday who was just rersponding to questions put to him by the reporter.\nI still don’t understand how you found it so difficult to get this information when I found it so easy.You were obviously not going about it the right way.If you go on the TDC website you can also obtain-as a collegue of mine has done-all the 106 money available to every town and village in Tendring.I just sent a letter asking about Harwich and Dovercourt-nothing more complicated than that.There should be no concerns about how this information is being released-as usual you and your collegue see conspiracy where none exists!\nI was very disappointed but not surprised by the comments in your final vitriolic paragraph.As I recall events of the era you quote it was you and your collegues who took it upon yourselves to do everything you could to tear the CRP apart rather than trying to work with it for the good of the town.I suppose bickering was perhaps the wrong word to use as most of todays councillors just sit there like zombies unable or unwilling to utter anything while the Ivan and Garry show is in full flow.No constructive imput from most of them and an ineffectual chair who lets you two get away with rambling on for ages.What I did detect was an undercurrent of distrust that will sooner rather than later erupt.\nYou are probably too young to remember the old Harwich Borough Council but I attended a lot of meetings with my late wife’s father councillor Harper-the last elected Alderman in the town-and he always told me,”Whatever our politics at the council we are all independent.We leave politics at home”.\nA good lesson for todays bunch.\nTony Blair uttered those immortal words,education,education,education.Your words should be,Harwich,Harwich,Harwich.There is no room for politics in local government.\nRegards,\nDavid\nFri, Feb 8, 2013 at 3:53 PM,\nGarry Calver wrote:\nDear David\nI am disapointed that you are willing to regard your assumptions as fact without waiting for my response but that is a minor concern.\nI can assure you that an e mail trail exists via which it can be proved that we have been seeking this information from TDC officers for a considerable length of time. Following Helen’s phone call on Wednesday afternoon a further e mail was sent politely pointing out that HMS had been advised by Cllr Halliday of the information and could officers please now provide us with the confirmation of its accuracy. A response was received this morning apologising for the fact that they could not and that the information we are requesting will not be available until, at the earliest, next week. I would hope that, now you are aware of this, you will appreciate that we have genuine concerns as to how information is being released.\nI am extremely surprised by your suggestion that ‘bickering’ on Harwich Town Council is interfering with its ability to conduct its business. Indeed, after enduring the four years between 2007 and 2011 during which the council was torn apart by the in fighting between the councillors elected in 2007 to represent the Community Representatives Party, it is now a genuine pleasure to sit on a council which is mature, constructive and united in its endeavour to do its best for Harwich and Dovercourt. I have been advised that you were present in the public gallery during the last meeting of the council and, if this is true, you will have personally witnessed that every vote was unanimous and that constructive input was put forward and accepted by all members, irrespective of political persuasion. This being the case, it is hard for me to imagine what evidence you would have to substantiate your suggestion but everybody sees things differently and, of course, are entitled to their own opinions.\nKind regards\nGarry\n—– Original Message —–\nFrom: David Smith\nTo: Garry Calver\nSent: Friday, February 08, 2013 12:39 PM\nSubject: 106 money\nDear Garry,\nI am mystified by your comments in today’s Standard concerning the 106 money for Harwich.You say you have been seeking information through official council channels about this money.Well then you must have been using the wrong channels as I just wrote to TDC and asked for the figures and back they came supplied by that nice Councillor Guglielmi.I then contacted the Standard as I felt the public had the right to know about all this available money and Helen obviously asked Peter Hallidayfor a quote.I see no reason for you to criticise Peter Halliday when you failed to look for or find this information yourself! Perhaps Harwich Town council should stop the bickering and do the job the public expects it to do.\nRegards,\nDavid Smith",

Because of this, they gave apologies and did not attend mayor making. Dave Mcleod did attend as it was important that the retiring mayor was present and Labour had no wish to disrupt the mayor making ceremony.\nIt was the leader of the Community Representatives Party, Steven Henderson, who chose to make a highly political speech praising his own party and attacking Labour. This is, to our knowledge, the first occasion when mayor making has been used in a party political manner. Indeed, his own CRP councillors, Jacky Wares and Pat Burke, publicly criticised him for making a political event out of mayor making.\nIt should also be remembered that Steven Henderson and David Rutson refused to attend mayor making two years ago because the incoming mayor, John Thurlow, had left the CRP to join the Labour Party. No one at John’s mayor making sought to politicise the day by making reference to their boycott.\nYour Labour councillors believe that anyone who aspires to the honour of being mayor of Harwich should promote and support Harwich at all times and should do nothing that might bring the office of the mayor into disrepute. Your local Labour councillors have remained faithful to those beliefs and regret that the Community Representatives Party, by their actions, do not appear to share those beliefs.",

All it needed was for the Tendring Local Highways Panel to sign off the additional £100,000 required and the work would have begun. The funding was available, everyone who had worked so hard to bring this about was happy and the residents of Pattrick’s Lane and everyone else affected by the terrible state of the lane’s surface were about to see an end to the problem. Unfortunately, we had forgotten what the Conservative leader of TDC, Cllr Peter Halliday, is like when it comes to spending money in Harwich.\nWhen the meeting of the Local Highways Panel took place he refused to allow the additional funding to be allocated and his Conservative colleagues voted with him to prevent the scheme going ahead. Ivan Henderson argued strongly against them but could do nothing about the Conservative majority on the committee who simply followed their leader.\nAs a result, Essex County Council can only use their portion of the funding to do another temporary patch up instead of dealing with the age old problem once and for all.\nIt brings back memories of Cllr Halliday’s ‘Over my dead body’ statement when Labour fought to get the swimming pool upgraded and, although we finally succeeded, it took far longer than it should have done. Labour cannot explain why Peter Halliday has acted in the manner that he has and he must take full responsibility for his actions. Once again, it has been Labour fighting for Harwich and Dovercourt and the Conservatives preventing progress.\nFor further information contact: Harwich Labour Press Officer Garry Calver",

However, in a speech supporting Labour’s amendment, the Group’s Deputy Leader, Cllr Garry Calver, destroyed this myth by explaining that the reason that the Planning Inspector had ruled against that application was because the site was not designated as Employment land in TDC’s Local Plan. Garry Calver argued that Horsley Cross needed to be in the Local Plan to avoid TDC being placed in a similar position again.\nLabour’s case was powerfully supported by the leaders of the three other opposition groups on the council and won a number of Conservatives over enabling the amendment to be passed.\nAt this point, the Conservative cabinet became so desperate to avoid the amended Local Plan being adopted that it actually voted against its own Local Plan. 3 Conservatives voted with the opposition and a further 9 abstained allowing the Local Plan with Horsley Cross included to be approved by 30 votes to 18. It will now go out to public consultation before being submitted by TDC officers to the Secretary of State for final approval.\nIvan Henderson says “Horsley Cross offers the only immediately available opportunity to create significant jobs close to Harwich and it is baffling why the Conservative administration is so opposed to it. Their desperation reached new heights last night but the strength of our argument was overwhelming. Labour’s amendment offers employment hope to the people of the Tendring District.”\nFor further information please contact: Harwich Labour Press Officer Garry Calver Tel: 01255 – 551940 Email garrycalver@btinternet.com",

Ideas I put forward were not taken up by the Portfolio Holder at that time. Enforcement and progress has not happened within this department and complaints have increased.\nI urge again, that our dog wardens be supplied with fold up bicycles, as this will help to enable them to patrol our seafronts in a more environmentally friendly and efficient way. The current driving in vans does not get any enforcement results on dog fouling and is not environmentally friendly. Does the Portfolio Holder agree with me that more enforcement is now needed, as his current soft approach has failed?”\nRESPONSE: From Councillor Michael Talbot, Portfolio Holder for Environment & Public Space:\n“Thank you for your question Councillor Jo Henderson and as you rightly say I organised a meeting for you at Weeley on the afternoon of 8th September 2017, following a series of reports from you that the ‘Dog Poo’ problem in Dovercourt was out of control and not receiving either a clean-up or the prosecution of offenders. The meeting included the Head of Service, accompanied by Darren O’Neil and one of our two Dog Wardens.\nYou spoke then about high visibility jackets and a suggestion of having fold up bikes for the patrol to use. We spoke about notices, and I suggested using stencils on the sea wall and pathways. A good meeting with no answers but lots of suggestion, but with a warning from the Head of Service that there was no pool of money waiting to be spent on this.\nI was conscious at that meeting that Dovercourt Councillors had consistently complained that many of their residents do not pick-up their Dog waste, and long standing Members may remember special attention given to this by Council, highlighted on Tuesday 29th June 2004 when we gave a number of radio interviews reporting the relative success of some unique dog mess signs in Dovercourt, whereas the owners took no notice of signs encouraging them to pick-up after their pets these signs, written underneath the request to Dog Owners to pick-up their waste, was apparently addressed to their dogs. The footnote said, “For Dogs” GRRR; BARK; WOOF WOOF – good dog! These unique signs were the brainchild of Bill Smith, our officer at the time, and had been reported in the National Press, giving rise to a lot of publicity.\nI report these background notes so that newer Members realise that Dovercourt Dog Poo is not a new issue!\nOne of the first things to mention is of course that people need to take personal responsibility for their dogs and their waste. I think that must be the primary message that we as the District Council as well as local members and Town, Parish and the District Council need to be spreading, rather than criticising. My Cabinet colleagues and I would much rather that dogs were cared for and controlled, and that waste was cleared up without a single enforcement action.\nI thank Councillor Henderson again for her suggestion, but as four years ago, after examination by the team, I’m afraid that portable bicycles are not found to be of practical use for dog wardens, who’s primary role as a dog warden is the collection and transportation of stray dogs and although the vans themselves may look large from the outside the storage space inside is very limited and is for equipment such as, graspers, shields, sprays, and other items that are kept securely in the van and would not be able to be carried whilst riding a bicycle. When our dog warden conducts a foot patrols, they will carry very limited equipment and will never venture to far from the van.\nHaving said that for example let us just say a dog warden parks his van in West End Lane car park and sets off on patrol on a bicycle and as he/she arrives in old town Harwich they discover a stray dog. The warden would then need to transport that dog back along the prom whilst carrying a foldable bicycle too. I think you will already guess that I do not support the suggestion that Dog Wardens be supplied with bikes!\nOur wardens travel in marked vehicles, and I feel that visible presence would be lost if the wardens were riding bicycles. The dog wardens have to cover a very large area throughout Tendring and work to the corporate enforcement principles of the 4 E’s – Engage, Explain, Educate and Enforce.\nRecording of live stream.

These are occasions when a lot of people choose to walk and well lit streets are even more important than usual.”\nHarwich County Councillor, Ivan Henderson, had repeatedly asked for the county’s streets to remain lit on Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve and was becoming increasingly angry at the length of time it was taking for a decision to be reached.\nCllr Ivan Henderson says, “It has taken far too long to reach a decision that was obvious and it was having a big impact on those arranging events over the festive season.

But the trust vehemently refutes the claims.\nThe row follows the publication of a report by North East Essex Clinical Commissioning Group (NECCG) last month looking at the reorganisation of maternity services.\nThe report, submitted by the CCG’s children’s and maternity commissioner Helen Kershaw, puts forward a number of options which recommend either the midwife centre in Harwich’s be closed or becomes a birthing centre on reduced opening hours. There are also proposals to reorganise maternity services in Clacton.\nMr Henderson made his claims after receiving a document from a staff member at Harwich maternity unit, which accuses CHUFT of being “incorrect with their facts and figures” regarding the pregnant population accessing services at Harwich.\nThe document, seen by the EADT, claims CHUFT has only been publicising figures for pregnant women living in the CO12 postcode area which includes Harwich and not taking into consideration the pregnant population in surrounding communities, such as Ardleigh, Gt Manningtree and Thorpe.\nThe document reads: “With all these communities included, the pregnant population on the books of Harwich maternity unit is approx 500 women, each having 10 or more postnatal appointments throughout their pregnancy. This figure has been the case for several years.”\nMr Henderson said: “Staff at Harwich can’t speak out for fear of reprisals but I fear managers are making the unit look under-used so they can close it more easily.”\nHowever, when approached, CHUFT said it didn’t recognise these figures. According to CHUFT’s figures, the pregnant population for the Harwich maternity unit is 328 -– made up of 232 women living in the CO12 postcode area, which includes Harwich, and 96 who live in the C011 postcode area, which covers the surrounding area. CHUFT says of 328 women living in C011 and CO12 who had babies in the financial year 2012/13, around a third – 104 babies – were born at The Fryatt Hospital in Harwich. The previous year 118 babies were born at the unit.\nA spokesman for CHUFT said: “The suggestion that we have in some way been fiddling the figures is not accurate.\n“We believe that some members of the public think that having skilled staff 24/7 at a unit where on average one baby is born about every three days is not the most effective use of limited NHS resources.\n“If we did not need to staff the unit round-the-clock, the midwives would be able to care for women in labour when needed and also provide antenatal and postnatal care more locally to where the women live.\n“We look forward to all of these issued being discussed fully during the public consultation.”\nA spokesman for NECCG said all views would be taken into consideration when the consulation begins.\nHe said; “We wish to reassure Cllr Henderson and others who have expressed concerns that we are listening to their views. We have already had a conversation with Cllr Henderson around the reasons behind the proposed maternity consultation and we are taking every opportunity to clarify any further concerns he may have directly with him.\n“We have agreed to meet with Tendring District Council leaders and with Harwich Town Council before we produce any public consultation proposal, so that we can take their views fully into account.",

Members placed on record their thanks to Maison Urwin for co-ordinating the Labour led campaign that was successful in keeping the unit open and reflected on how devastating it would have been for local residents had it have closed.\n“Government cuts and the failure of our local Conservative MP to stand up for the Harwich Peninsula mean that Labour is constantly battling to protect our local services and facilities and our successful campaign to keep our Minor Injuries Unit was a major triumph and a great relief,” continued Charlie Powell. “With the closure of our rail ticket offices, the continued threat hanging over local full time fire-fighters and the dreadful state of the A120 there are still many battles ahead but our AGM proved that Harwich Labour remains strong and determined to do our best for our local community.”\nFor further information please contact Harwich Labour Branch Press Officer Garry Calver on 01255 551940",

This has obvious benefits for disabled residents and visitors alike and, in addition to the important improvements in equality and diversity, enables visitors with disabilities to come to Tendring with more confidence which also assists our local economy.\nAs a result of Labour’s initiative, Tendring District Council was among the earliest local authorities to sign up and many more have followed suit with the list ever growing.\nYour local Labour councillors are, therefore, appalled that the present Conservative administration running TDC shows no sign of continuing to support ‘Disabled Go’ and, in spite of our calls for them to do so, seem likely to refuse to provide the £6,800 necessary to continue the initiative.\nLabour finds it hard to believe that the local Tories consider it appropriate to pay £44,000 a year to four Tory cabinet members who no longer have departments to oversee rather than pay £6,800 for ‘Disabled Go’ but they must be answerable for this decision.",

It begs the question why over £50,000 has been paid out to Tory cabinet members during that time when, as the new setup confirms, it wasn’t necessary.”\nLabour has serious issues with whether it is possible for one councillor to devote sufficient time to both lead the council and oversee its finances and questions whether Cllr Halliday is showing good judgement in insisting on holding both posts. However, Labour’s main concern over his judgement is his decision to reward failure by retaining Cllr Sarah Candy and Cllr Stephen Mayzes within his cabinet.\n“Cllr Candy has shown no initiative as Regeneration Portfolio holder for the last three years. I have described Regeneration as the engine room of the district and this vehicle badly needed a new engine. Changing the name of her department does not alter the fact that what is required is a change in the name of the councillor leading it,” continued Ivan Henderson.\nAs recently as last week Cllr Mayzes was forced to admit that he had got it badly wrong over the fiasco of increased prices in pitch hire charges and his previous insistence that it was wrong to spend money refurbishing Dovercourt swimming pool has also been proved wrong with the announcement that refurbishment is finally going to take place.\n“The policy decisions taken by Cllr Mayzes will take years to recover from and yet he is being retained in Cllr Halliday’s cabinet. This does not suggest that Cllr Halliday realises that the old guard badly failed the people of Tendring,” added Ivan Henderson.\nFurther evidence of this is the baffling decision to retain Cllr Nick Turner and give him the additional responsibility of coastal defence. It was Cllr Turner who sent the leaked e mail suggesting that the funds allocated for Holland on Sea coastal protection should be re allocated if the Tories failed to win a by election and, nine months later, he is being put in charge of that area of policy.\n“Cllr Turner’s e mail implied that coastal defence funding should be determined on political expediency and he is now being made responsible for coastal defence in Cllr Halliday’s new cabinet. I don’t think I will be the only person questioning the new leader’s judgement with this appointment,” said Ivan Henderson.\nFor further information please contact\nIvan Henderson on 07889 367822\nThis website uses cookies to improve your experience.

These ‘personal identifiers’ are checked against those you provided on your original postal vote application form, to ensure that they match. This is to prevent someone else from using your vote. If they do not match, your vote cannot be counted. Your personal identifiers are always kept separate from your ballot paper, so no-one knows how you have voted.\nAn important part of these security measures is providing a fresh specimen signature every 5 years, since people’s signatures and circumstances can change over time. The legislation requires the Electoral Registration Officer to carry out the first annual refresh of signatures by 31 January 2012 in order to ensure that the signatures for as many absent voters as possible are refreshed, producing as accurate a record as possible and potentially limiting the number of postal votes that are rejected due to mismatched identifiers.\nThis Absent Vote signature refresh exercise will be undertaken every January for those absent voters whose applications are 5 years old and, therefore, due to expire.\nIf you are one of the absent voters who receives a signature refresh form, please make sure you sign and return it promptly as public authorities are obligated to send reminders to anyone who does not respond.\nIf you have a disability which means that you either cannot provide a signature or sign in a consistent and distinctive way, please indicate this on the form and make sure the name and address of your helper is provided.\nIf you no longer want to vote by post you must respond by ticking the relevant box on the form and return it as soon as possible, in order to avoid any unncessary reminders.\nIf you do not return the signature refresh form by the deadline your existing absent vote facility will be cancelled and you will have to vote in person or make a new application.\nContact Details\nElectoral Services\nWestleigh House\nCarnarvon Road\nClacton on Sea\nEssex\nCO15 6QF\nTelephone: 01255 686586 or 01255 686587\nEmail: elections@tendringdc.gov.uk\nFURTHER INFORMATION: Voting by Post or Proxy",

Home owners will also be allowed to build towering extensions up to two storeys high, invading their neighbours’ privacy and blocking out light – but neighbours will be banned from objecting.\nThe Conservative Government tried to push through the controversial new laws without going to the House of Commons, but Labour MPs demanded a debate and a vote in a bid to stop local residents’ losing their say.\nCommunities will now be silenced so developers’ can change the character of local neighbourhoods against residents’ wishes. The Conservatives are planning to bring forward further draconian new measures allowing developers to bulldoze and concrete over local communities, with boards of developers appointed by Whitehall given full control over decisions instead of local people.\nHarwich Labour Cllr. Ivan Henderson, said: “Conservative MPs are selling out local communities.

All 27 believe that he has so damaged the reputation of the council that it is inconceivable that he can remain as the council’s Deputy Leader without his presence in the post further demeaning TDC’s name both within the district and beyond.\nAt a packed emergency meeting of opposition councillors held last night to discuss the situation it was unanimously decided that Cllr Halliday’s resignation from his post should be demanded.\nCllr Michael Talbot, leader of the Independent Group, says\n“I was in the chamber when the incident occurred and I was present at the hearing of the Conduct committee which exonerated him. I am not sure which shocked me more as both incidents were quite disgraceful.”\nPierre Oxley, leader of Tendring First, says\n“Tendring First had remained on the Conduct committee in the hope that this hearing would go some way to restoring it’s reputation but it has made it worse. Tendring First has now joined the other opposition groups in withdrawing its representative from the committee.”\nHarry Shearing, leader of the Liberal Democrats, says\n“Cllr Halliday has been found guilty by an independent panel following an independent investigation. That alone warrants his resignation even before his Tory colleagues combined to throw out the complaint.”\nIvan Henderson, leader of the Labour Group, says\n“I have never witnessed anything quite like it and naturally assumed the Conduct committee would act upon the findings of the independent inquiry. Cllr Halliday should have resigned the morning after the incident without any need for an inquiry.

The Tories have also pulled the plug on Brightlingsea Sports Centre so we have been working with Brightlingsea’s three independent councillors who are equally angry at the way Brightlingsea is being treated. The report recommending TDC’s withdrawal from the facilities was only published seven days before the decision was taken and it was dealt with in a way that offered no vote to the council on the decision.\nLast night, the entire TDC opposition united behind the Labour and Brightlingsea Independents’ attempt to buy time for a rescue package through an amendment to the TDC Budget but the twenty one Tories on the council used their block vote to prevent this lifeline being available.\nEvery one of the twenty one Tories were present and every one of them voted against the amendment. Unfortunately, the entire opposition only totalled twenty councillors.\nPlease take a few minutes to watch what happened via this link, from 40 mins: https://fb.watch/bdhq6CuuNe/\nPlease sign the petition against this dreadful decision at: https://www.change.org/harwichsportscentre\nWe are still trying hard to keep these much-valued facilities open to the public but it is not looking good.

The proposal was fiercely opposed by the Conservative administration under its previous two leaders but, having forced through an amendment to TDC’s proposed Local Plan to include Horsley Cross, the way was open for the approval of the application if the committee considered it appropriate and last night saw this occur.\nLeader of the Labour Group on TDC, Ivan Henderson, says\n“We will never understand why the Conservatives fought so hard to prevent this great opportunity to create a lot of jobs but the important thing is that Labour didn’t give up and things are now looking far more positive. We need local job creation and the Horsley Cross site is only 10 minutes away from Harwich.”\nThe outline proposal includes a bus depot and regular bus services linking Harwich, Manningtree and Clacton with the site and Labour believes this means that no one would be excluded from seeking employment.”\n“A job opportunity is only realistic if you can get to work and the Horsley Cross proposal includes bus services,” continued Ivan Henderson. “The proposal as outlined last night offers real hope for local people seeking work and we are pleased that the committee decided to approve it.”\nFor further information please contact\nIvan Henderson on 07889 367822",

The unanimous decision of the committee was to ask the portfolio holder to reconsider the decision offering new hope to the food bank.\nGarry Calver says, “The committee did not have the power to overturn the portfolio holder’s decision but it could not have sent a clearer message. When a cross party scrutiny committee unanimously asks a portfolio holder to reconsider his decision then it would be extremely disappointing if the portfolio holder chose not to listen.”\nAll aspects of the decision were closely scrutinised by the committee with detailed questions being asked on the financial implications to the council, the community need and potential community benefit and the need for a discreet location for the food bank.\nIvan Henderson says, “The committee was made up of councillors from across the district and they all voted for the portfolio holder to reconsider his decision. It was refreshing to see everyone putting political differences aside and voting as one. It was a very strong message to the portfolio holder and we must now await his final decision.”\nFor further information please contact\nGarry Calver on 01255 551940 or Ivan Henderson on 07889 367822",

These councillors are exploiting the wording of the legislation and, by so doing, are undermining the public’s respect for the hard working councillors in all parties who put in the hours and attend all of the meetings. All three of them should be ashamed of themselves.”\nFor further information please contact: Garry Calver on 01255 551940\nLabour Group of Tendring District Councillors",

The plans he was holding were drawn up, brought forward and funded by our previous administration and would have been followed by multi million pound improvements to our swimming pool and sports hall had the Tories and Community Reps not cancelled the projects after taking control of the council in May.\nWe are delighted that we were able to achieve these new toilets for Dovercourt but feel it is important to note that Councillor Rutson voted against the new toilets at the West End of the promenade (see TDC minutes 19/02/08) and also voted against our budget which funded the other two blocks (see TDC minutes 19/02/09).\nWe would also like to remind Councillor Rutson of what the Community Reps said in the Standard of 18th April 2007, two weeks before the last local elections. ‘We will support policies that come from whatever quarter if they benefit our communities’.

I accept that nothing can be done that interferes with any police investigation into the activities of individual Conservative councillors but the acting leader should not have left the council without a Finance Portfolio Holder. It is totally unacceptable.”\nLabour believes that the announcement of an intention to cut council tax by 0.5% in the forthcoming budget was a decision taken by Peter Halliday without the knowledge of council officers and was only made public immediately prior to his resignation announcement. If this is the case it is possible that it was a personal decision in which case his subsequent resignation leaves it requiring immediate review.\n“It is hard to believe that the local Conservatives could create such a mess and if it wasn’t so serious for the residents of Tendring then it would be laughable,” he continued. “We really do need someone steering the ship now while they argue over who should do it in the future.”\nFor further information please contact:\nIvan Henderson on 07889 367822",

His words were backed up by Labour’s Garry Calver, Charlie Powell and Pam Morrison with Labour District Councillor for West Ward, John Hawkins, suggesting from the public gallery that the consultation process was so seriously flawed that the entire process should be withdrawn.\nThe meeting was courteous and respectful and, although initially cautious in what he said, as Labour expanded on its case, Bernard Jenkin confirmed that he supported the retention of all existing services and agreed to visit the unit again. He suggested that Ivan Henderson join him on the visit which Ivan immediately agreed to do in order to ensure that the MP had talks with the staff actually carrying out the day to day work within the unit.\nMembers of staff and members of the public were present at the council meeting and gave their support to the unit both during the public question time and after the meeting.\nHarwich’s Labour councillors have promised to do everything possible to retain the existing services presently available at Harwich’s Maternity Unit and this meeting was another occasion when they were able to put the case for this to happen.\nFor further information please contact: Harwich Labour Press Officer Garry Calver Tel:01255 – 551940 Email garrycalver@btinternet.com",

We desperately need Bernard Jenkin to step in on this one. As the local MP he can demand information and assurances on behalf of his constituents”\nLabour councillors became extremely worried after hospital bosses attended a meeting of Harwich Town Council and, in the opinion of Labour, treated the council with contempt and behaved rudely and aggressively. It was after this meeting that Harwich Town Council sought the support of Bernard Jenkin and, although he assured councillors that he supported Harwich Town Council’s position, the Labour Group is not convinced that his actions are matching his words.\nCouncillor Garry Calver says, “I was part of Ivan Henderson’s team when he was our local MP and I witnessed how much he put in to keep our maternity unit open. He showed total commitment and, working alongside local campaigners, he kept our maternity unit open. I am not seeing the same commitment from Bernard Jenkin and we need him working with us. It’s time for him to lead this campaign in the same way that Ivan did in the mid 1990s.”\nFor further information please contact:\nHarwich Labour Press Officer Garry Calver on 01255 551940",

This is a dreadful and dangerous proposal that could leave Harwich and Dovercourt without a fire engine within 20 minutes of our town and your Labour councillors are totally against the plan. We know that we have the support of the local community in our efforts to make the Conservatives reverse this terrible decision and I will continue to lead this fight if re elected as your local Essex County Councillor.\nI hope you will agree that I have worked hard on your behalf over the last four years and, with the support of my Labour colleagues, I have had a number of successes. It was good news when we got the pedestrian crossing installed between the café and the beach on Dovercourt seafront and the installation of the signs requesting vehicles to respect a 20MPH speed limit in Historic Harwich have made it a safer place for residents and tourists alike. It was a long and hard struggle to get the road surface improved in Patrick’s Lane and, while the maintenance of our roads and pavements is still very poor, I keep the pressure on to have potholes filled in a lot quicker than would often be the case.\nWe are still suffering from the Conservatives’ ridiculous decision to turn our street lights off at night and this is still making things unnecessarily difficult for the emergency services, shift workers and those using and working in our local pubs and restaurants. The Conservatives bulldozed this decision through without carrying out the required risk assessments and without listening to the genuine concerns of the community and they show no signs of admitting that they got it badly wrong. This doesn’t mean they should be allowed to get away with what they have done and we continue to keep the pressure on to make them think again.\nOn issues such as our local bus services, our fire station, children’s centres, Sure Start and the Careers Advice Service for our local school leavers the Conservatives at County Hall continue to treat Harwich and Dovercourt as the ‘poor relation’ and we are always at the top of their list when it comes to cuts. Without a strong voice standing up for our town things would certainly be a lot worse as it is only Labour insisting that we are treated fairly.\nAs a local person who has lived here all of my life I am passionate about our town and its people and, if re elected, I promise that I will do everything possible to ensure that we get the services and opportunities that we need and that we deserve.\nKind regards\nIvan Henderson",

On 1st April 2011 Essex County Council transferred this role to North Essex Parking Partnership who immediately outlawed the use of parking cones and began a vigorous campaign of ticketing.\nFreedom of Information requests submitted by Garry Calver have revealed that the first five months of the market were policed by TDC without a single parking ticket being issued but a staggering 531 have been issued on market days in the Kingsway and Station Road, Dovercourt by North Essex Parking Partnership in the nine months since they took over.\nCllr Garry Calver says “This is a massive problem but no one is taking responsibility for sorting it out. Harwich Town Council has done all that it can but it is a County Council issue and we are getting no help from them. It is now two months since our last letter but no response has been received.”\nEach parking ticket is for a minimum fine of £35, which means that at least £18,585 worth of tickets have been issued in these two short roads on Fridays in just nine months. Throughout this time the matter has received a lot of local publicity and has been brought to the attention of Essex County Council and Bernard Jenkin MP by Harwich Town Council.\n“The different approach adopted by the North Essex Parking Partnership has not improved the situation but it has certainly been a money-spinner for them,” continued Garry Calver. “Essex County Council is fully aware of the problem and must now deal with it.”\nFor further information please contact\nGarry Calver on 01255 551940",

He contacted Harwich Police after receiving complaints about drunks spending all day on the benches in Dovercourt town centre drinking heavily.\n“This is not what people want to see when they are out shopping and many are crossing the road rather than pass close to the drinkers,” he said. “A dispersal order was put in place a number of years ago covering the town centre box between Orwell Road and Cliff Road. I have asked the police to enforce this and move the drinkers on and they have agreed to do so.”\nSince the story was published in the Standard Garry has been contacted by many residents agreeing with his action and it has also received support from High Street traders.\n“I am getting the impression that everyone has been thinking the same thing but have not wished to speak out,” he continued. “We are working very hard to improve the image and quality of Dovercourt town centre and it is important that this problem is nipped in the bud.”\nFor further information please contact: Garry Calver",

Despite Boris Johnson’s “apology” at Prime Minister’s Questions many things remain unanswered.\nCommenting on the letter, Ivan said: “People across Tendring pulled together to protect lives and livelihoods as we came through some of the darkest months of the pandemic. Bereaved families, our key workers and all those that diligently followed the rules have been mocked by Boris Johnson. Local Conservative Councillors must choose – are they on the side of those who followed the rules to protect the NHS and save lives, or the out of touch Tory Government who treat them with contempt.”\nEnds\nFor further information contact:\nCouncillor Ivan Henderson\nLeader of the TDC Labour Group\nTel 07889367822",

The Tories running TDC blocked the motion at the time and have delayed its return to council for determination but have finally had to allow it to be placed on the agenda for Tuesday’s meeting.\nLeader of the Labour group, Cllr Ivan Henderson, says: “The Tendring Tories did not want to hear this motion and have forced residents to go right through the winter with their lights switched off but it will now be voted on at Tuesday’s meeting. When Labour tabled the motion in November the Tories were all happy to block it but it will be interesting to see how many panic now that an election is close to hand.”\nOne major concern is the news that the Conservative county councillor overseeing the PNSL policy, Cllr Rodney Bass, has described a similar proposal by Harlow District Council as ‘bizarre’ and has immediately refused to act upon it. The Labour group at TDC is concerned that some Tendring Tories may vote for Labour’s motion because they expect their Tory colleagues at County Hall to prevent it from becoming a reality and that is why Labour is seeking assurances at Tuesday’s meeting.\n“We have written to the five TDC Tories who are also Essex County Councillors asking them to each give an assurance during Tuesday’s debate that they will ensure that the Tory administration running Essex County Council does not block TDC’s request if TDC votes for the lights to be switched back on. Everyone will be watching these five councillors very closely during Tuesday’s debate. They owe it to the residents they are elected to represent to make their position clear.”\nThe five Conservative councillors on TDC who are also Essex County Councillors are the leader of the council, Mick Page, TDC Cabinet members Carlo Guglielmi, Paul Honeywood and Allan Goggin along with Andy Wood.\nFor further information please contact Ivan Henderson on 07889 367822",

The leader of the Conservative Group, Cllr Neil Stock, has offered to meet with representatives of the Labour group but has been thanked for his courtesy and advised that such a meeting will not be necessary.\nLeader of the Labour Group, Cllr Ivan Henderson, says, “It is clear that the political make up of TDC means that the addition of Labour’s four votes would make life easier for any coalition but we are fundamentally opposed to many of the policies introduced by the local Conservatives and, along with the Lib Dems, Independents and Tendring 1st, have fought for more fairness over the last four years. It is unthinkable that we could now adopt such policies.”\nThe Labour Group will also be voting against the appointment of Cllr Stock when the election of the leader of the council takes place at the first meeting of the new council. Cllr Stock led the Conservative administration which raised pitch hire charges by 48%, sought to impose market rents on local clubs and organisations, refused to refurbish Dovercourt’s swimming pool and sports hall, ignored the need for a comprehensive Regeneration strategy to create local jobs and retained four places in his cabinet for Conservative colleagues when the departments they were overseeing no longer existed. It is the opinion of the Labour group that Cllr Stock’s record as leader of the council indicates that his returning to the post would be a backward leap for Tendring and, therefore, will oppose his appointment.\n“So many opportunities were missed during Cllr Stock’s time as leader of TDC and we saw other districts take full advantage and prosper,” continued Ivan Henderson. “Many of his own Tory colleagues shared the combined frustration of the opposition during this time and it is frightening to think that those days may be about to return.”\nFor further information please contact Ivan Henderson on 07889 367822\nEmail ivanhenderson4labour@yahoo.co.uk",

There have been calls to make the A120 safer following several accidents – so why hasn’t it been spent on something like this?” Mr Henderson said.\n“The Local Government Association has described it as inexcuseable when there is such a need for that kind of investment at the moment.”\nThe money, which is gained under the Section 106 Agreement, is sought from developers by local authorities to fund new infrastructure which is needed when new developments are built.\n“It is a lot of money that is not being spent so we want to know if any of that £42million will eventually be used. ECC have said they are in the process of spending it but to think how much of that cash could help our district – places like Jaywick – and it’s just sitting there,” Mr Henderson added.\n“I am just wondering if it’s down to a squeeze in resources at the council which hasn’t left enough staff to keep an eye on the 106 Agreements and making councillors aware that money is not being spent.”\nMr Henderson, who sits on Harwich Town and Tendring District councils, said he would be writing to ECC and asking if these areas had lost out on funding.\n“I’m sure people within the Harwich area and Tendring have some ideas about how the council could spend the money,” he added.\nA spokeswoman from ECC said: “Essex is one of the largest counties and therefore it is unsurprising that we are holding around 25 per cent of the regional total of unspent developer contributions as it represents Essex’s approximate share of population in the local government Eastern region.\n“The County Council is legally obliged to return any monies left over when we have completed a job, projects are no longer required, or are no longer technically or financially feasible.\n“The amount of our returns to developers over the five years from 2006 is around 3.5 per cent which is comparable with other authorities.\n“The Council continues to seek value for money through all its activities and the small sum returned demonstrates the commitment to spending contributions on the specific projects for which they have been designated.”",

Leader of the Labour Group, Les Double, says “Harwich in Bloom brightens up our town in the summer months and the Harwich Society do a great job in arranging it. Our four Labour TDC councillors are happy to support Harwich in Bloom 2008 and have pledged £200 each from their personal budgets.” The four Labour councillors, Les Double, Lawrie Payne, Dave Mcleod and Garry Calver hope that the three other local TDC councillors agree to a similar contribution to ensure that Harwich in Bloom receives the level of funding that it requires for 2008.\nThe original project was the idea of Harwich’s Mayor, Dave Mcleod, who started the project with just six hanging baskets. Dave Mcleod says “I am very pleased at how Harwich in Bloom has grown and I hope that everyone who is in a position to assist does so to make Harwich in Bloom 2008 another great success. Well done to the Harwich Society.”",

It is a sign of how active and strong Harwich Branch Labour Party is at present. It is a shame that Keith has had to withdraw but he will be delighted to know that his place has been taken by such an able candidate.”\nGeoff Smith joins Ivan Henderson, Charlie Powell and Alan Todd as Labour’s candidates for East Ward in the May Local elections for Harwich Town Council and he is very much looking forward to the campaign.\nGeoff Smith says, “The Part Night Lighting campaign resulted in me attending council meetings and I was amazed by what I saw. The Labour councillors were the only people standing up for Harwich and it persuaded me that I wanted to do more to help. I am very grateful to now have this opportunity to stand for council as part of a great Labour team.”\nFor further information please contact: Press Officer Garry Calver on 01255 551940",

Harwich’s Labour councillors had been seeking these much needed improvements and, having secured the backing of fellow administration councillors from right across the district, expected to see the motion passed with the support of every councillor elected to represent our town. Lawrie Payne seconded the motion and used his speech to explain how much of a difference this would make to leisure facilities in Harwich and Dovercourt.\nThe Conservatives made it clear that they would oppose the motion which meant that its success or failure depended on the votes of the three Community Reps. All three voted with the Tories to prevent the refurbishment being approved. We now have a situation where the Mayor of Harwich, David Rutson, the Deputy Mayor of Harwich, John Brown, Steven Henderson and Conservative Ricky Calender, are voting against everything that Labour is doing to improve facilities in our town.\nThe CRP and Tories voted against the 10p rate in the Milton Road car park, new seafront toilets, the re-planting of the cliff slopes etc and now they have voted against doing up our swimming pool. Unfortunately, we can do nothing to stop this. It appears that there is an agreement between the Tories and the CRP and that the CRP is putting the wishes of the Tories before the best interests of our town. Our local Labour councillors will continue giving 100% for Harwich. It is time the others started to do the same.",

The Labour councillors on Harwich Town Council had tabled the issue for discussion at the meeting of the council on Tuesday 23rd November but prior correspondence with the North East Essex Clinical Commissioning Group has confirmed that the unit is not operating an ‘appointment only’ system and anyone can walk in off the street for assistance.\nA statement issued by the CCG for public consumption reads:\nThe Urgent Treatment Service at Fryatt Hospital, Harwich, is a nurse-led service which is open\nbetween 9am and 5pm every day including weekends and public holidays, for assessment and\ntreatment of minor injuries such as:\nwounds\nsprains\nstrains\nminor dislocations\nsuspected fractures\nremoval of foreign bodies\nburns and scalds\nbites and stings\nminor head injuries\nPlease note that in busy periods, in order to ensure that we maintain safe infection control\nrequirements, you may be given an appointment to return later in the day, if your injury does not\nrequire immediate treatment.\nFor any emergency needing urgent or immediate treatment, such as chest pain, severe\nuncontrolled pain or bleeding, acute shortness of breath or severe injury, you should call 999 or go\nto the nearest Emergency Department. For residents of Harwich, this is located at Colchester\nHospital.\nThe Labour Group of Harwich Town Councillors is leaving the item on the agenda for the meeting but only to ask that everyone shares this statement as widely as possible in order to ensure that all residents know that they can walk into the Minor Injuries Unit at Harwich Hospital without an appointment if they need assistance.\nLeader of the Labour Group of Harwich Town Councillors, Cllr. Maria Fowler, says, “It was both worrying and dangerous that local residents believed that they had to have an appointment before they could attend our local Minor Injuries Unit and the Labour Group is very pleased to be able to confirm that this is not the case. We do not know how this belief arose but the important thing is that the Clinical Commissioning Group has stated publicly that anyone can walk into the MIU for help without an appointment. It is important that everyone knows this.”\nFor further information please contact\nCllr. Maria Fowler",

  "https_www_harwichlabourparty_org_uk_clp_/https_www_harwichlabourparty_org_uk_2011_08_update-on-labour-activity/content_1073.html": "BRIEF UPDATE on LABOUR ACTIVITY\nHi All,\nA fair bit has been going on since my last unofficial update so here goes.\nThe East Ward team has been very active and, having carried out a successful clean up on Bathside, carried out another clean up on Harwich beach. David Flavell has been achieving good things with seeking to get improvements to neglected buildings and Ivan has been tackling the on going situation re Harwich Quay. The team is particularly concerned about the fact that there is no protection for people using the benches on the quay from cars. This has been reported to ECC but with no action to date. Ivan and Dave Flavell finally got the portfolio holder with responsibility for parking to visit East Ward and showed her the issues.\nThanks to Les, the Labour group managed to alter the terms of the grant of £20,000 to the Electric Palace for their digitisation project which has made a big difference to their funding. Lawrie and I worked with a Conservative county councillor, Mike Page, to secure a further £15,000 which means that TDC is the only council that has failed to make a contribution.\nJo and Ivan foiled a silly game that the Community Reps tried to play over Hospital Lane. The CRP claimed that the lane was so overgrown that people could not use it and arranged a clean up, allegedly supported by residents. When the Standard photographer turned up the only people there were five members of the CRP. The only people, that is, apart from Dave Mcleod, Dee, Ivan, Jo and Joseph who had all turned up to assist. The entire thing was a publicity stunt and, in the end, Labour gained most of the publicity. For the record, the lane was perfectly passable and when Jo asked to be shown the pothoes they had a job to find one to point at.\nJo has been making life very difficult for TDC over the state of the swimming pool and also the situation regarding Pound Farm. An application has been submitted to demolish the rear of the property but Labour is insisting that this be linked to an immediate restoration of the house itself.\nDave Mcleod and I are working closely with TDC in an attempt to bring about a resolution to the derelict Starlings site and the issues that now exist following the fire at the Queens Hotel.\nI have lit a fuse under Colchester Parking Services after a Freedom of Information request showed that they issued 103 parking tickets in the Kingsway alone on the five Friday’ market days in July. We are hopeful that this will result in the re introduction of no parking cones to show motorists where they cannot park.\nLes is to be congratulated for his efforts which have resulted in big improvements in the park around the bandstand.\nLabour is pushing very hard at TDC to hold the Tory administration to account but this is not proving easy as they are extremely evasive and finding out exactly what they are doing is hard work. Ivan has been studying the constitution which might make future meetings a lot of fun.\nLabour now has over 1,000 signatures on our petition to maintain our local police station and local levels of policing.\nIn addition, everyone is settling into their various committees and getting on with the work.\nWe are becoming increasingly frustrated with Ricky Callender who appears to be one councillor who has no intention of doing any work. The reports of his failures to respond when asked to do something are incredibly high and we have evidence of him not taking action on issues he has been asked to take up.\nThanks to you all for your continued support.\nBest wishes\nGarry",

Labour recognises and supports the fantastic effort put in by unpaid volunteers to ensure that local sports clubs, scouts and brownies, luncheon clubs and self help groups flourish and Les’ brilliant initiative made a big difference in allowing them to do so.\nLabour was, therefore, particularly angry when the Tories running TDC decided to scrap CAROS and place such organisations and clubs on market rents. This nasty and short sighted policy threatened the very existence of some groups and proved that the TDC Tories had no concept of the words ‘amenity’ and community’.\nLabour promised to fight this cause all the way and have held it up for a considerable amount of time but, at this week’s meeting of TDC’s Community Leadership and Partnerships Committee, the Conservative majority forced through a recommendation to cabinet that the scheme is not fit for purpose and should end in 2015.\nLabour’s West Ward TDC councillor, John Hawkins, led the opposition and tried to win a motion stating that the scheme should remain in place but the Tories simply voted this down before voting to scrap CAROS. This is a bitter pill to swallow and is even more upsetting as a Harwich councillor, Clare Callender, was one of the Tories who betrayed local clubs by voting to end the rent cap.\nFor further information please contact: Harwich Labour Press Officer Garry Calver",

At the same meeting of the cabinet the Tory leader, Neil Stock, announced that he would be continuing to pay four of his Tory colleagues £11,000 a year to oversee departments that no longer exist.\nLeader of the Labour group on TDC, Les Double, says\n“I’m sure that many residents will think it a misprint when they read that the council tax cut is 75p per year for a Band D household. How can they play gesture politics at a time when they are paying nine Tory councillors to oversee five departments? This council tax cut is nothing more than a political stunt that will not be enough to buy a household a single loaf of bread during the coming year.”\nThe £38,000 reduction in council tax across the district is less than the £44,000 being paid to four Tory cabinet members who no longer have departments to oversee.\n“The Tories are giving 75p a year to residents and £11,000 a year to Tory cabinet members who no longer have a job. Is this what they mean by we are all in this together?” continued Les Double.\nFor further information please contact\nLes Double on 01255 242645",

A chance conversation with Labour colleagues from Suffolk at a recent meeting has now revealed that Cllr Callender has been living in Ipswich for at least a year although she is still showing Mayes Lane in Ramsey as her address on the TDC web site and in the newly published TDC diary.\nIpswich Labour Party encountered Cllr Callender whilst conducting street canvassing and mentioned to colleagues in Harwich that they were surprised to find a councillor for Harwich West Central Ward living in Ipswich.\nWhilst Harwich’s Labour councillors acknowledge that there is nothing illegal in remaining on Tendring District Council having moved to Suffolk, they do believe that Cllr Callender should not be hiding the fact from the residents she has been elected to represent.\nLeader of the Labour Group on TDC, Cllr Ivan Henderson, says, “If Cllr Callender believes she can represent the residents of West Central Ward from Ipswich then she is legally entitled to do so. However, she should be open about the fact that she is doing so and not be showing a Ramsey address for council purposes.”\nFor further information please contact Ivan Henderson on 07889 367822",

But this project has been delayed for years leaving the road to deteriorate. Harwich councillor Ivan Henderson, said: “We’ve got more than 2,000 signatures for the petition, which is great. “It shows drivers really want improvements to the A120 and are now demanding that urgent action is taken to improve this important road. “It’s not acceptable that drivers are having to foot the bill for damage to their cars and that the main road in and out of Harwich, the home of an international port, is in such a poor state of repair and is only a single carriageway. “Drivers and Harwich deserve better.” The petition says with an ever increasing population and more lorries using Harwich International Port the road is under strain.\nIt added: “It is also in need of complete relaying. The road should be dualled now rather than relaying it as a single carriageway.” Harwich councillor John Brown has been calling for improvements on the road for a decade and believes a dual carriageway will bring jobs to the town. He said: “That road was laid 40 or 50 years ago and they used all different concretes to work out what would be the best to dual that road with. It was a test road. “It’s come to the end of it’s lifespan now and the concrete is lifting up. “There is only one way to repair that road now and that is to dig it all up. “Dualling it at that point would be brilliant, it really needs to be dualled. “Business would come to the town and it would create jobs.” Mr Brown added: “It’s a main road from Europe, you can follow the route to Liverpool and it meets with the docks in Ireland – why don’t we have money for it?” Both online and paper petitions have collected 2,484 signatures, which Harwich and North Essex MP Bernard Jenkin has agreed to take to the Minister for Transport.\nSource: https://www.harwichandmanningtreestandard.co.uk/news/17567339.residents-join-campaign-to-dual-a120/",

Two of his own councillors, Jackie Wares and Pat Burke, publicly criticised him and the turmoil began.\nLabour councillors have watched in amazement as, instead of working for the benefit of our town, those leading the CRP have put their energy into launching bitter attacks on their own colleagues. Something had to give and when it did it all happened very quickly.\nFirstly, Steven Henderson announced that he wasn’t, and never had been, the leader of Harwich Town Council. This was news to everyone else on the council but his words came as no surprise. It would appear that he was happy to be leader when a photo was being taken but didn’t want to know when a difficult decision had to be taken.\nWe then heard that three CRP councillors, Mick Gardiner, Steph Tyrer and Jackie Wares had left the party because they were fed up with the fact that the CRP were more interested in stopping other parties from doing things for Harwich than they were doing things themselves. This now offers an explanation as to why CRP councillors tried to stop Labour’s Nine Items earlier this year.\nLastly, the CRP Deputy Mayor, John Brown, launched a scathing public attack on his CRP colleague, David Rutson, for going on holiday while being mayor. This, to our knowledge, is the first time that a deputy mayor has ever publicly attacked the mayor and does nothing to help the council or the town.\nIn the meantime, as a result of working with everyone prepared to focus on helping our town, Lawrie Payne was able to show Harwich Town Council’s latest meeting the plans for a £100,000 project for a new play area and multi use games area on the Mace Park behind Ray Avenue.\nIt’s yet another example of Labour giving 100% for Harwich while the CRP fight amongst themselves.",

And now it’s the turn of working people like you to decide who is going to speak up for you in Parliament.\nIn the last 13 years of Labour government, the 600,000 workers I represent have experienced real change. I remember the bad old days under the Tories, when kids had to wear their coats into school because the government wouldn’t pay for heating. But things have changed since then. I want to make sure my grandchildren continue to get the first class education they are receiving at their newly built local school.\nGoverning is difficult, and we know that over the last 13 years Labour hasn’t always lived up to all our expectations. They haven’t given union members everything we’ve asked for. But, when it comes down to it, Labour has changed Britain for the better.\nAnd what about the Tories? Make no mistake, we know what they stand for: greed. Big cuts to public spending, soaring unemployment, scrapping rules that give mums and dads time off – and tax cuts for millionaires. The Tories would wreck Britain. No wonder they have 63 bankers standing as their candidates in this election. They don’t speak for ordinary people.\nUnion members face a choice. The day after the election, we are either going to wake up with a Labour government, or a Tory government – it’s as simple as that. Labour or Tory. Fairness or greed.\nIt’s a choice we all have to make. If you don’t cast your vote, you will still have to live with the consequences of the election – and that could be 5 long years of Tory rule. The consequences of that Tory rule will be dire for everyone except the wealthiest few, which is why we need to do everything we can to stop it happening. We need to make sure people are voting Labour, and where possible are getting active and helping campaign for Labour too.\nThat’s why we are calling a weekend of action on 17th and 18th April. We are asking you to give up just an hour or two of your time, to help prevent 5 long years of the Tories. I’ll be out campaigning that weekend, and I hope to see as many union activists as possible joining me – letting other people know the truth about the choice we all face on polling day. Click here to find out the nearest event to you:\nhttp://www.unionstogether.org.uk/weekend-of-action\nThis election is a choice for all of us – do we want a government that cares for the majority, or one that just protects the narrow interests of a wealthy minority? To me, the choice this election remains clear, which is why I’ll be casting my vote for Labour.\nPaul Kenny\nGeneral Secretary, GMB",

Which is why we are acting to counter as many of these\neffects as we can.\nBecause in these extraordinary times, it is these bold and just actions which will help us build the fair society and make sure that Britain emerges from this downturn as quickly and strongly as possible.\nFor me, this is an issue that goes right to the heart of why a Labour\nGovernment is worth fighting so hard for, and the differences between us and David Cameron’s “do nothing” Party.\nBecause David, the Conservatives really haven’t changed. They were\nwilling to turn their backs on the people of Britain in the last\ndownturn and watch homes being repossessed and lives being destroyed. And today, senior members of the Tories still call for the recession “to run its course.”\nThe scars of repossession are still borne by too many of our citizens\nfrom the 1990s. It is a moral imperative for our party to give each\nand every one of us the opportunity to fulfil their talents – and we\nwill not turn from these values when the going gets tough.\nWhere people genuinely need help, we will be where we always have been – on their side.\nBest wishes,\nGordon",

He announced his intention to the other members of the group at a meeting last week and will cease to be the group leader from the annual meeting of Tendring District Council on Tuesday 8th May.\nLes Double says\n“I intend to remain active within the group and as a ward councillor but 12 years is a long time and I feel it would be nice for someone else to take over the reins. I will, of course, offer every assistance and support to the new group leader and my fellow Labour councillors.”\nThe Labour group expressed its gratitude for everything that Les has done for Labour and for the Tendring District, not only during his 12 years as the group leader but also over his 17 years as a TDC councillor for Harwich West Ward. The group was very relieved to have Les’ confirmation that he wishes to remain as an active Labour councillor but simply feels it is the right time for someone else to assume the responsibility of leading the Labour group on TDC. The Labour group elected Ivan Henderson as the new leader of the Labour group with Garry Calver taking up the post of Deputy leader.\nIvan Henderson says\n“Les has been a strong voice for the Labour group and for the residents of the Tendring District throughout his time as leader of the Labour group and his advice and experience will be invaluable as Labour seeks to hold the present Tory administration to account for its actions. We are very grateful for everything that Les has done over the years and very thankful for all that he will do in the future.”\nFor further information please contact\nLes Double on 01255 242645\nIvan Henderson on 07889 367822",

The Shadow Transport Secretary will consult port staff on their customs facilities and discuss the port’s capacity to take ‘roll on, roll off’ traffic if this has to be rerouted from Dover after 29 March.\nMcDonald will also meet Harwich Labour councillors to discuss the potential impact of additional lorry traffic on the town’s transport system. On the agenda for the meeting are the poor state of the A120 trunk road.\nAndy McDonald MP, Labour’s Shadow Transport Secretary, said:\n“This port has been starved of investment for years, the A120 has been left to rot because the Conservatives have cut both council and central spending, and now suddenly the Tories are demanding Harwich save them from the effects of their disastrous ‘no deal’ plans.\n“We need a jobs first Brexit – and you can’t get that on the cheap.

They recognise that the road is in a bad way.\n“It’s really good news they are going to spend a substantial amount of money to alleviate the ongoing issues road users face on a daily basis. And the news is that work is going to happen very soon, which is really good – people won’t have to wait long.”\nSource https://www.harwichandmanningtreestandard.co.uk/news/17644873.a120-resurfacing-work-set-for-september/",

It was at this point that Neil Stock gave in and accepted our amendment rather than suffer a defeat in the vote.”\nConservative cabinet members Carlo Guglielmi and Paul Honeywood had led the Tory attack on Labour’s amendment ridiculing it and laughing at the Labour members as they put the case on behalf of the elderly and vulnerable within the district. Every Labour councillor spoke in favour of the amendment and, as the cracks began to appear in the Conservative led administration’s ranks, Cllr Neil Stock finally gave in.\nDeputy leader of the Labour Group, Garry Calver, says, “When you are trying to stand up for the elderly and vulnerable in Tendring it is not nice to be jeered and laughed at by Conservative cabinet members but you just have to keep thinking about what is important. The entire TDC opposition backed Labour and we managed to have this dreadful lifting charge thrown out. We have done it by allocating funds that were just sitting there available to be used so it will not cost council tax payers an extra penny.”\nFurther information please contact Press Officer Garry Calver Tel 01255 551940\nAlso see Clacton Gazette ‘Campaigners hail U-turn on plans to charge to pick up elderly fall victims’",

With more than 16 members seeking nomination it was necessary to hold ballots to select the final team and the branch is very pleased to have a good mix of experience and new blood along with a wide variety of backgrounds and skills.\nLabour regained control of Harwich Town Council in 2011 after four years of turmoil under the Community Representatives Party and, working in a positive and constructive manner with all elected councillors, is pleased to have rebuilt the reputation of the council and repaired the damage caused during the previous four years.\nBranch chairman, Charlie Powell, says, “Since 2011 the Labour group has worked extremely hard to rebuild Harwich Town Council’s reputation which had been badly tarnished under the previous administration. The first two years were spent returning the council to where it should have been and the last two years have seen a lot achieved by everyone working together.”\nThe Labour team for the 2015 elections to Harwich Town Council includes a former MP, 3 former mayors, 2 former mayoresses, 2 candidates each with 20 years’ service to the council and 4 first time candidates. It also has 7 women in the 16 strong team, the most female candidates ever fielded by any party in Harwich Town Council elections.\n“We believe it is a strong and capable team that, if elected, will serve Harwich well,” continued Charlie Powell. “We are particularly pleased that 7 of our 16 candidates are female as we believe women have been under represented in local elections over the years.”\nThe Labour Party candidates are as follows:\nEast Ward\nIvan Henderson\nCharlie Powell\nAlan Todd\nKeith Todd\nEast Central Ward\nGarry Calver\nAnnie Hines\nDave McLeod\nWayne Tearle\nWest Central Ward\nMaria Fowler\nJo Henderson\nDee King\nFiona Powell\nWest Ward\nSimon Collis\nPam Morrison\nMalcolm Nicholson\nMell Parkin\nFor further information please contact\nHarwich Labour Press Officer Garry Calver on 01255 551940",

It will receive £237,000 to spend by March 2025; this will enable the forum to get established, set a vision and deliver projects agreed by it.\nThe partnership will also be able to apply for specific government funding for some schemes.\nIvan Henderson, (Lab) TDC Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Economic Growth, Regeneration and Tourism, said he welcomed the funding and intervention.\n“Dovercourt has been chosen in recognition of what fantastic potential it has, and that with a little bit of help it can be even better than it already is,” Cllr Henderson said.\n“This funding is specifically for the High Street, but we hope that will complement our existing work being carried out through the £9million Dovercourt Capital Regeneration Project around Kingsway, Milton Road and more widely in the town.\n“We look forward to working with local businesses and charity groups to deliver some really focused interventions to improve the Dovercourt High Street.”\nThe new forum will set the vision and projects to be delivered; suggestions from the Accelerator Programme include those which will increase footfall, make an area feel safer, re-purpose spaces or improve energy efficiency.\nRunning at pace, the pilot is due to end in March 2025 – though with the hope the Accelerator partnership will continue beyond that and evolve into a long-term sustainable team. As a pilot, the forum will be encouraged and empowered to try new and exciting things.\n6/12/23\nNEWSDESKS\nFor more information on this news release, contact Tendring District Council’s Communications Manager Will Lodge on 01255 686338.\nThe government press release on the High Street Accelerators Pilot can be found here: High streets levelled up with £7 million funding boost – GOV.UK (www.gov.uk).",

Maria Fowler\nSent: 07 August 2019 09:06\nTo: Cllr. Michael Talbot, Portfolio Holder for Environment and Public Spaces\nSubject: Refuse Collection Service\nDear Cllr. Talbot,\nAs shadow to the portfolio holder for the Environment and Public Spaces I was both amazed and furious at your failure to offer a statement to the members of Tendring District Council on the new refuse collection services at last night’s meeting of TDC.\nThere is genuine concern amongst members on both sides of the chamber that you have forced in Tendring’s first ever ‘amount restricted’ refuse collection service and reduced collections to two weekly without ever allowing a debate or vote on the issue. You have now compounded your failings by not making a statement on the implementation in spite of the fact that it is causing outrage amongst residents across the entire Tendring District. Your response to a closed question at last night’s meeting allowed only one supplementary question from one councillor and did not in any way remove your requirement to allow the entire council to question you following a portfolio holder’s statement.\nYour actions have resulted in a wholly inadequate refuse collection service for the residents of Tendring and it is unacceptable that you have not made yourself publicly accountable to the councillors who represent these residents.\nI am now formally requesting that you make a statement on this subject at the next ordinary meeting of the council on Tuesday 10th September and would ask that you confirm to me in writing of your willingness to do so.\nYours sincerely,\nCllr. Maria Fowler.\nShadow to the portfolio holder for the Environment and Public Spaces.\nWard Member for Dovercourt All Saints Ward – Tel 07761 343771\nTendring District Council – email cllr.mfowler@tendringdc.gov.uk",

Likewise, anyone planning a day trip to Harwich is unlikely to be arriving late in the afternoon. This is a total nonsense.”\nHarwich’s Labour councillors are still furious that the popular scheme which allowed people to park for the first hour in the Milton Road car park for just 10p was scrapped by the TDC Tories and that a charge of 80p per hour was put in its place. Labour believes that, if the present Tory administration is serious about encouraging town centre shopping, it would admit they got it wrong and re introduce the 10p charge for the first hour.\n“Allowing people to park free at a time when they don’t wish to is hardly going to help our town centre,” continued Les Double. “Labour’s ‘10p for the first hour’ initiative genuinely encouraged people to shop locally and the Tories should never have scrapped it.”\nFor further information please contact\nLes Double on 01255 242645\nAlso see Harwich & Manningtree Standard -> Scheme to bring shoppers to Dovercourt is criticised",

The location is very convenient for those using the train and bus and is much nearer than the existing recycling centre in Barrack Lane.\nCouncillor David Flavell (East Ward) said: “Thanks to an idea from a local resident and excellent work by Bill Smith at Tendring District Council, Harwich now has its own recycling centre.

I understand your concerns for this particular section of road but please be assured that our network is inspected on a weekly basis. If our safety inspectors identify safety critical defects, such as pot holes, these are rectified within 24 hours, ensuring the A120 remains in a safe and operational condition. As you will be aware, we are restricted by budgets and cannot simply deliver these resurfacing schemes sooner, ahead of those areas in more pressing need.\nIf residents are still contacting you about the condition of the road, please direct them to our Customer Contact Centre where details of the individual issues can be reported and actioned as necessary. The contact number is 0300 123 5000 or they can email info@highwaysengland.co.uk\nYour sincerely\n14 December 2017 11:18\nDear\nI am sorry but I cannot accept that we are going to have to wait until 2019/20 to get something done to deal with the present dangerous condition of the road surface between Wix and Horsley Cross.\nResidents are contacting me on a daily basis complaining about the considerable damage to their cars caused by the unacceptable state of disrepair on this section of road.\nThis road is used by a very large number of heavy goods vehicles on a daily basis arriving and exiting from Harwich International Port, which as you can imagine increases the need for these repairs to be completed as a matter of urgency.\nCould you please indicate if there is any possibility of emergency repairs being undertaken as soon as possible.\nKind regards.\nIvan\nSubject: FW: Kier response to A120 Ramsey road surface concern (ref: 18413404)\n13 December 2017 15:58\nDear Cllr Henderson\nThank you for your email of 23 November to Kier, our maintenance contractor, regarding the A120 road repairs between Ramsey Village and Horsley Cross roundabout. Your enquiry has been passed to me for reply as the Asset Development Administrator for the strategic road network for Suffolk and Essex.\nI am sorry that the concerns raised by yourself and your constituents have not been addressed sooner, but I can confirm we have carried out essential drainage repairs at Wix and during 2018 we have a scheme to repair joints and cracks. During 2019/20 we have a scheme to repair the road surface between Horsley Cross roundabout and Wix, which will ensure the road remains operational and safe.\nTo enable us to make informed decisions when programming future resurfacing works we carry out a rolling programme of mechanical and visual road condition surveys. By adopting this approach, we aim to prioritise our available resources to maintain the network in a safe and serviceable condition, whilst minimising whole life costs. We recognise that in the future larger scale improvements to the road surface will be needed. However, a scheme of this scale is not affordable within our current maintenance allocations. Over the winter we will be undertaking further surveys in order to determine the larger solution for this section of concrete carriageway, as it is important to ensure we have enough data to make an informed decision when developing and prioritising funding for the future works programme.\nI understand that this may not be the reply you had hoped for but thank you again for contacting us. If you need anything further, please feel free to contact me or our Customer Contact Centre at info@highwaysengland.co.uk or telephone 0300 123 5000.\nWe are keen to improve the service we provide and identify where we have done well. To help with this we would be grateful if you could take our short feedback survey by clicking here.\nYours sincerely\n: 23/11/2017 15:10 (GMT+00:00)\nSubject: Kier response to A120 Ramsey road surface concern (ref: 18413404)\nDear\nI have once again been contacted by several members of public asking for an update as to when the repairs to the seriously deteriorating road surface will be carried out.\nCould you please respond to this request for information at your earliest convenience.\nKind regards.\nIvan\nDate: 24 May 2017 at 12:46:09 BST\nTo: “cllr.ivan.henderson@essex.gov.uk” <cllr.ivan.henderson@essex.gov.uk>\nSubject: Kier response to A120 Ramsey road surface concern (ref: 18413404)\nDear Councillor Henderson\nThank you for contacting Highways England on 6 May 2017 to request an update on previously planned A120 works to restore the road surface between Ramsey Village and Horsley Cross roundabout. Your concern has been passed over to me to respond to, as since ! April 2017 Kier have been working with Highways England across the east to maintain its roads, including the A120 through Essex. Sincere apologies for the delay in replying to you, I am now in a position to be able to provide some feedback.\nHaving spoken to colleagues who were with Amey earlier this year, I understand that a resurfacing scheme was planned for this location to be achieved in January 2017, but that adverse weather prevented this scheme happening as planned and could not be achieved before April 2017 when Kier took over the maintenance contract for this area.\nSince 1 April 2017 as part of our weekly inspections of the network we have been closely monitoring this section of road and taking any interim action on potholes of concern within 24 hours of identification until the planned scheme to restore the road surface at this location can be delivered. I understand that current ongoing works on the A120 at Wix (drainage maintenance), the A12 (Ewell Bridge repairs) plus the A120 between Marks Tey and Marks Farm roundabout (road resurfacing and street lighting restoration) are taking priority over other works required in the area, but the Ramsey area re-surfacing works will be re-scheduled to take place as soon as we are able to during the milder weather this summer. Until that time temporary signs to warn road users of the uneven road surface here will remain in place, so that motorists can adjust their driving according to the current conditions.\nSorry that I am not able to provide an exact date for these works at present, but should you require any further update on this matter, please do contact the Highways England Customer Contact Centre on 0300 123 5000 or use the email link here quoting the reference 18413404so that your correspondence can be effectively managed for further reply.",

Labour’s candidate for the West Ward vacancy on Harwich Town Council is Pam Morrison, a Harwich Town councillor in the 1990’s and Mayoress to her late husband, Andy, on the three occasions he was the Mayor of Harwich. Labour’s candidate for the vacant East Ward seat on Harwich Town Council is Charlie Powell, a former chairman of Harwich Branch Labour Party.\nBranch chair, Dee King, says “We needed special meetings of the branch to come to our final decision which shows the strength in depth within the local Labour Party. We are delighted with our choice of candidates and will now work alongside them to show that Labour is the choice that gives Harwich its strongest voice.”\nJohn Hawkins knows Harwich very well. He should do as he was the Chief Executive of Tendring District Council from 1997 until his retirement in 2011. John read law at university and is a qualified solicitor. He is a trustee of St Helena Hospice, a director of the East of England Co-op and a director of Harwich Connexions Community Transport Service. Unusually for a chief executive, John maintained his trade union membership throughout his local government career.\nJohn has two grown up children and a young grandson. He is a volunteer for the National Trust and, along with his partner, Lin, became a member of the Labour Party as soon as he retired from local government. If elected, John will use his knowledge of local government in general and Tendring District Council in particular to ensure that Harwich has the strong voice it needs in West Ward.\nPam Morrison will be another strong voice in Labour’s team. Pam was a Harwich Town councillor in the 1990’s and served as Mayoress on the three occasions her late husband, Andy, was mayor of Harwich. Pam has served as a school governor at Spring Meadow Primary School, the committee of the Park Pavilion and the fund raising committee of Harwich RNLI.\nPam has three grown up step children and six grandchildren. She worked at Nor Systems (Sato) for sixteen years where she was a trade union rep. Pam is immensely proud of Harwich and puts being Mayoress to Andy on the day of the Queen’s visit in 2004 as one of her proudest moments. If elected she will always put Harwich first.\nCharlie Powell has worked out of the Bus Station at Harwich for the last 35 years so he knows East Ward and its people. For the last six years he has been Depot Controller and is a lifelong trade unionist. A long standing Labour Party member, Charlie is a former chairman of Harwich Branch Labour Party.\nMarried to Fiona, he has four children, three step children and three grandchildren. Working with the public Charlie knows people are the most important aspect of any community and if elected he will put the needs of the people of East Ward first. Through his work within Harwich Branch Labour Party Charlie has strongly supported the efforts of the local Labour councillors and he would be proud to become a member of Labour’s team on Harwich Town Council.\nFor further information please contact\nGarry Calver on 01255 551940",

This means that Labour now has 13 of the 16 seats on Harwich Town Council and holds all 4 seats in West Central Ward which, as recently as May 2007, had 4 Community Representative Party councillors.\nLabour’s victories mean that Labour has now enjoyed 6 by- election wins in Harwich in the last 16 months along with taking the previously held Conservative seat in May’s elections to Essex County Council.\nLeader of the Labour Group on Harwich Town Council, Ivan Henderson, expressed his thanks to the people of Harwich and his congratulations to Labour’s two new councillors.\n“It is clear that the people of Harwich are responding to the work, commitment and achievements of our local Labour councillors and are turning to Labour every time they have the chance to vote.
