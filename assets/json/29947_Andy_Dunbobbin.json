Diolch o galon.\nThe past three years have gone quickly, with policing – quite rightly – facing immense scrutiny.\nHowever, despite national and local challenges, I believe I have effectively led and represented our communities well. As I look again for your support in this election, I will continue to put you, your families and our communities at the heart of my endeavours.\nNeighbourhood policing is – and always will be – my top priority. With my focus firmly on preventing crime – the benefits are becoming evident.\nIn North Wales, overall crime is down 13.5% and performance is up. The recent ONS survey has your police force as the best in England and Wales for public confidence. The second lowest figure nationally for rates of recorded crime per 1000 population.\nAnd this doesn’t happen on its own. With Welsh Labour, we have strong, effective and collaborative arrangements in place. The Policing Partnership Board for Wales and Violence Against Women and Girls are excellent examples that support our communities well.\nI am rooted in the community and we have achieved so much, but there is more I want us to do.\nMy community orientated police service approach (COPS) has been successful, developing my vision into four strategic pillars:\nA LOCAL NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICING PRESENCE\nSUPPORTING VICTIMS, COMMUNITIES AND BUSINESSES.\nA FAIR AND EFFECTIVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM\nA VISABLE AND RESPONSIBLE POLICE AND CRIME COMMISSIONER.\nMy knowledge and experience have resulted in holding responsibilities such as Chair of Policing in Wales and PCC lead for several technology initiatives.\nI would be delighted if re-elected and to continue in making our home the safest place to live, work and visit.\nMy Manifesto\nGet In Touch\nFollow Me\nFollow Me\nPromoted by Andy Dunbobbin on behalf of himself, at Hillside Avenue, Connah's Quay, CH5 4XL.",

You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.\nRequest restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.\nRequest the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.\nWithdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.\nLast updated: 3 February 2020\nGet In Touch\nFollow Me\nFollow Me\nPromoted by Andy Dunbobbin on behalf of himself, at Hillside Avenue, Connah's Quay, CH5 4XL.",
