This isn’t the only case where planning applications have received a number of fake/fraudulent objections, its becoming ever more frequent across Northumberland and the UK.\nI have recently had a few cases where my constituents have either had their property used as an objecting address with false names and in one case using the property of recently deceased relative. This can cause major distress to residents who didn’t objected but have been listed as doing so or in extreme cases the use of property of deceased relatives obviously causes great distress. Vulnerable people receive letters relating to the objections made in the name of their property etc....and they have no idea what it's about. This causes major distress.\nNCC needs to act to ensure that a more robust system is put in place that allows the objections of communities to be hear without what can often be damaging additional comments from fake people. Planning Committees see the details of objections and numbers, how many of those that haven't been detected nobody knows.\nIt is also the case I suspect that this can happen with letters and expressions of support too, the Council needs to robustly manage how they accept objections and support to ensure of the authenticity.\nIt is now more important than ever given the removal of the only protections Northumberland Communities had which was the Core Strategy, that communities are able to express their views. What we want to ensure is that communities are genuinely heard and not clouded by false objections.\nNow as we’ve seen many Land Agents are asking land bank developers to come forward as they recognise the vulnerabilities placed on communities, leaving the Council almost powerless to protect Communities. That’s why the planning department needs a structured approach to register objections and ensure that planners are supported in identifying fraudulent objections.\nMany Communities will soon see many applications begin to be presented following the Conservatives desire to remove a document that took 10yrs to make in a cross party format. Yes disagreements about housing growth numbers thrust upon the County by Government were always a hot topic. However housing numbers can be altered through a modification process rather than whole scale removal.\nI sincerely hope that the removal of the Core Strategy and the trend of increased fake / fraudulent objections does not make the perfect cocktail for a developers paradise riding roughshod over the top of communities.",

The work we do is municipal socialism in action. Labour councillors have been at the frontline of the fight against Tory cuts since austerity began Austerity has forced Labour councillors to make hellish choices - but we have listened to communities and worked to stretch every pound left available. Labour councillors have organised protests, attended marches, and spoken out against Tory cuts every year since 2010 We’ve been attacked by Tory ministers for making sure that people understand that council cuts are Tory cuts In 2017 over 100 Labour council leaders wrote to the Chancellor demanding a decent pay rise for council workers – and Labour councillors voted for a public sector pay cap-busting 4% pay increase for local government workers despite opposition from Tory councils It doesn’t have to be like this – ‘On Day One’, a radical manifesto for local government from the LGA Labour Group, set out the case for significant re-investment in local government by the next Labour government. Now all Labour councillors are coming together to demand that Prime Minister Theresa May and Chancellor Philip Hammond immediately reverse the £1.3bn cut to next year’s council budgets, make an emergency £4bn investment in services to protect vulnerable children and adults, and pledge to use the Spending Review to restore council funding to 2010 levels.

Here in Northumberland we have seen figures that could see Northumberland schools collectively lose £16million pounds.\nThis weekend we read Ian Lavery calling for a fair funding deal for Wansbeck schools that could see up to £4.9million lost from his constituency alone.\nLast week Cllr Jackson the new Tory Leader in Northumberland said the County would benefit from £2.2million extra which simply isn’t the case. Whichever way you look at it and calculate it Northumberland loses money. Its quite concerning that the Leader of the Council doesn’t know that.\nIn North Northumberland schools across the area are set to see thousands vanish from already cash strapped rural schools. Scott fears that many of these schools will simply have to close and see boards on windows of what are generally the hearts of communities.\nScott has asked that the Government recognise the rural nature of education and the pressures that can often bring to schools and the additional costs often incurred from schools in rural areas.\nOver the last few months we have seen the unprecedented actions from headteachers in Northumberland asking parents for contributions, considering merging to save more money and closures out for consultation. On all these things Tory MP’s remain silent, hoping that no action will come.\nIf they can find £1billion to buy in votes they can find the money to provide the next generation with the right level of funding to help them achieve.\nScott said: “ Small rural schools cannot sustain this attack on their funding, we will see many schools close and children being asked to travel unacceptable distances. Currently protections are in place for smaller children about travelling but I fear these protections will be lost as the County will struggle to meet them.”\n“This is a blatant attack on young people, removing the opportunities for young people to access good education. We see schools having to spend much of their budgets on repairing schools since the building programs were scrapped to make them safe. Questions are being asked as to whether part of this is about forcing schools into a position of educational decline through lack of funding and suitable buildings to then Ofsted can rate them inadequate and hand the assets over to the Academy Chains. This does nothing apart from Privatise children’s education and puts at risk our valued and committed staff.”\n“I would urge the government to look again at it’s plans and back down from these austerity cuts to education that are risking the future of young people.”\nNotes of additional information:\nSchools with the most deprived intakes would face the greatest average losses in real terms - £579 per pupil in primary schools, and £784 in secondaries.\nThe average real terms loss for primary schools would be £96,481, or £401 per pupil.\nThe average real terms loss for secondary schools would be £290,228, or £365 per pupil.\nIn addition:\nNine in ten schools in England (92%) could face budget cuts in real terms over the next four years.\nNo local authority area is likely to see a real terms funding increase for its schools and academies, even after the redistributive impact of a new formula.\nAverage budget cuts could be 6.5% in primary schools and 9% in secondary schools.\nRecent media coverage:",

I am receiving complaints from residents on a daily basis and I should have been given the opportunity to represent their views before a decision was taken.\n“I understand that people are being allowed out to exercise once a day during this lockdown but the clear instruction from government is no travelling unless for work, essential shopping or child care.\n“I have had it explained to me that the decision to keep Druridge Bay and all other beauty spot car parks open is in line with government guidance to keep these places open for the public and enable people who live nearby to use them for exercise. The council has told me that closing the car parks would only move the traffic to residential areas, causing inconvenience and disruption for local people. I've also been told that these open spaces allow for adequate social distancing and help people's mental wellbeing.\n“I know the police would prefer the council to close the car parks to stop people from travelling during the lockdown but they have told the council it is up to them. I would prefer limitations on the opening should they be insistent on keeping them open. I am aware local people often need to drive to the location so that would accommodate them too and not disadvantage, even some gate marshalling if they don’t want to restrict access.\n“My concerns are the disregard for the views of people living in the area and me as their representative on the council. I understand people are travelling some distance to visit Druridge, even though this is not allowed under the lockdown. At the very least I would expect to be consulted about an issue which concerns the people I represent.\n“The council tell me they will be monitoring the situation. So, will I and I urge residents to contact me if they still have concerns after having heard the council's reasoning for not shutting the car parks.\n“I have also raised the multiple issues of visitors using local amenity and using the supplies that many local people rely on access to as transport to bigger shops and pharmacies mean they need to use public transport which many are avoiding.\n“Not to mention that Druridge Bay has been at the top of the Northumberland local infection table on a number of occasions.”",

This year the figure is 22.5 per cent; a staggering 1.9m of the nine million children in this country.\n“Parents and families hardly need telling that this is a government that simply doesn’t care about the next generation.\n“Twelve years of Tory rule have chipped and chipped away at living standards for all but the very rich. Their polices have created this situation. As a country we should be ashamed of a government that is letting down the future generation in this callous way.\n“It’s not even true anymore that people who work hard can be properly rewarded and earn enough to look after a family; costs are going up, wages are standing still, millions of people are relying on food banks and thousands more have been plunged into poverty.\n“The Tory government seems to have no will to get unscrupulous employers to provide appropriate pay and conditions for employees, so individuals and and families rely on benefits (funded by us, the tax payer) and the charitable sector to help them make ends meet. So these companies can get you and me to bail them out while they make obscene profits.\n“You might have expected to read this in Victorian Britain but surely we deserve better than this in 2022.\n“The highest taxing government for generations is quite happy to allow children to be the casualties of its callous policies. This cannot be right in 2022.\n“We need a government which is on the side of ordinary people who simply want the dignity to be able to provide for themselves and their families.”",

The findings come from a report commissioned by MP for Wansbeck, Ian Lavery and reveals places in Northumberland with the highest levels of child poverty include parts of Newbiggin (46%), Seaton (44%), Berwick (42%) and Bedlington (42%), where nearly half the children are living in poverty. This compares to wards in more affluent areas such as Cramlington North (16.2%), Corbridge (18.6%) and Ponteland West (19.2%). The report also shares anecdotal evidence from teachers about children going hungry in the school holidays, not having winter coats for the colder months and one child coming to school in their grandmother’s shoes as they didn’t have their own pair. Scott Dickinson, Deputy Leader of the Labour Group in Northumberland Councillor for Druridge Bay, said: “This report reveals the growing divide in Northumberland under the Tories. It’s a scandal that you can travel from Cramlington to Newbiggin, a distance of less than 10 miles, and see an increase of a nearly a third more children living in poverty. The Tories have a lot to answer for, their savage cuts will be felt for generations to come and as always the poorest will take the brunt. “MP Ian Lavery's Wansbeck Child Poverty Report makes grim reading. In all cases the North East fares worse than the national average with 35 per cent of children in the North East living in poverty compared to a UK-wide figure of 30 per cent. “Labour councillors have been standing up for the many and not the few in Northumberland against a tide of Tory cuts. These child poverty statistics highlight Tory failings on a huge scale. Children are the future of Northumberland and we need to give them every opportunity we can.” The report highlights that in the Wansbeck constituency has a higher proportion of children who go hungry in the school holidays, have higher rates of tooth decay. Dedicated and concerned teachers are stepping in to provide the things that parents can't, and the state - for some reason - chooses not to. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Problems in areas such as Druridge Bay in Berwick-upon-Tweed, include hundreds of children are living below the breadline. The Tories under Boris have promised spending as a sweetener to get us to vote for them in the next election. In actual fact they are returning some, but by no means all of the money they took away in a decade of swingeing cuts.",

We need to achieve a balance where employers can staff and run their businesses appropriately and staff are rewarded and recognised fairly for the work they do. It makes sense to reward employees fairly. The more secure a well rewarded people feel, the more they can spend in the economy. It’s not rocket science.\n“Under a Labour-led council and Labour government we would strive to redress the balance that has resulted in employers have little or no job security or say in how they do their job.\n“It’s unfair that employees currently have to wait until two years into their employment to gain their full rights, including protections against unfair dismissal, and that so many are restricted from achieving a better work-life balance and miss out on valuable time at home with their families because of these qualifying periods.\n“Twenty six percent or 7.2 million workers in this country have been in their job for less than two years, so they have no protection against unfair dismissal or redundancy. No worker should be allowed to be without the protection against being unfairly dismissed, which leaves the most vulnerable workers exposed, and all workers should be able to enjoy the benefits of flexible working. Almost two million (7%) of employees in the UK have been working for their employer for less than 26 weeks and are therefore currently unable to request flexible working arrangements.\n“We want to see full employment rights and protections from day one, scrapping the qualifying periods that deny millions the security and dignity they deserve.”",

Many vital projects, started under Labour, have been kicked into the long grass or abandoned altogether since the Tories took control of Northumberland Council in 2017. The list of Tory failures includes: - The abandoned Ashington Council HQ site, which instead of housing a cinema and shops, is home to a giant hole. - Canceled plans for new schools and car park infrastructure in places like Amble, which could help the local economy thrive and create income for the Council. - Turning down income and investment plans for Blyth and turning away tourism. - Demolishing Invest to Save schemes across Northumberland, leaving a long-term black hole. - Failing to get the Government to recognise the challenges faced by Northumberland and its residents. - Spending over £17million on old County Hall with no Invest to Save schedule for the future. - Spending huge proportions of money serving the interests of Tory voters while areas in real need of investment with significantly higher populations go without. Commenting on the Tories inability to deliver on projects or follow through on their promises, Councillor Scott Dickinson Northumberland Labour Group Chair said: “Peter Jackson and his cronies talk a good fight but they have huge questions to answer over the astonishing lack of progress since they took control of the Council. “They've completley clocked off on projects like the Ashington, Bedlington, Blyth and Newbiggin developments. The lies they continue to peddle that Labour got them into this mess is complete myth. Their excuses are running thin and the public is losing patience. “Instead of trying to blame Labour, the Tories need to put their promises into action. People in Northumberland deserve better.” On 20 February Labour will be voting on the 2019-20 budget plans of our Tory-led county council. The Northumberland Labour group has been working on a costed, alternative budget, pledging to: Use your money properly, dealing with the swingeing Tory cuts in Northumberland.\nWe would prioritise money where it’s most needed;\nOur costed plan is different to the Tories, we would protect our most vulnerable by not increasing care charges and restore the Council Tax Support for those that need it;\nWe would protect the Youth Services for young Northumbrians;\nMaintain the cost of waste collection to reduce fly tipping and encourage recycling;\nBuild low cost rental homes in areas of need through Advance Northumberland;\nSupport those in need by ensuring proper investment is provided to support low paid workers and families claiming Universal Credit We want to make sure everyone living in our county can be sure their council is working for them, not just a chosen few. Ends Background information Since the Tories took control in 2017 they have attempted to pin the blame on Labour for their own financial mismanagement. They will claim they ‘inherited’ a financial mess left by Labour. The county council itself produced a document to show the Labour council did not leave the council in a mess. The council’s report has been externally verified by auditors Ernst and Young. The Labour-led council, as it was legally obliged to do so, balanced its books. It’s the decisions made by the Tories since they came to power that have resulted in a financial back hole.",

You could be forgiven for thinking that every child in our rich country would be properly clothed, housed, educated and fed. But nothing could be further from the truth.\nMP Ian Lavery's Wansbeck Child Poverty Report makes grim reading. In all cases the North East fares worse than the national average with 35 per cent of children in the North East living in poverty compared to a UK-wide figure of 30 per cent.\nJust think of that. In 2019, in one of the world's richest countries, one in three children are living in poverty. These children are the innocent victims of a government which has heartlessly and ruthlessly taken away resources. Children do not end up living in poverty by accident.\nWhat makes it worse is many of the families affected are those with no connections, clout or say in their future. This is the worst type of bullying imaginable. Pick on the most vulnerable and wear them down until they feel powerless to do anything about it.\nPoverty affects health. And poverty affects life expectancy. The Wansbeck constituency has a higher proportion of children who go hungry in the school holidays, have higher rates of tooth decay. Dedicated and concerned teachers are stepping in to provide the things that parents can't, and the state - for some reason - chooses not to. In his report Ian highlights children whose parents keep them off school because they don't have coats and one child even turned up for school in her grandmother's shoes. Those of you with elderly relatives will tell you what is was like when families couldn't afford to put shoes on their children's feet and food in their bellies. Surely, in 2019, this is not a place where a country like ours should be.\nWe're being promised spending by our current government as a sweetener to get us to vote for them in the next election. In actual fact they are returning some, but by no means all of the money they took away in a decade of swingeing cuts. I sincerely hope there is no one going to the ballot box thinking the Tories have their interests at heart. Quite clearly in terms of our children and the North east, they don't.\nIn my role as Shadow Cabinet member for Children's Services I would like to pay tribute to Ian for the considerable amount of work and research he and others have done to produce this report. It presents a stark reality, but we do not have to live in this reality. A Labour government would work tirelessly for a world where all children are clothed, housed, fed and educated properly.

They have given no commitment on the number of new homes and no promise of new funding. The Tories should be judged on their record on housing and it's a record of seven years of failure: • The level of new affordable housebuilding is now at a 24-year low. • The number of government funded social rented homes being built has fallen to fewer than 1,000 last year from almost 40,000 under Labour in 2009-10. • The number of home-owners has fallen by 200,000, homelessness has more than doubled and new affordable housebuilding is at a near-record low. Labour will back first-time buyers and build the homes we need, including 100,000 genuinely affordable homes to rent and buy a year by the end of the next Parliament.\nScott said: \"where Labour control Councils housing supply and standards have improved\"\n\"Ronnie Campbell clearly demonstrates that at these new properties in Blyth\"\n\"I fear Council housing is now over for Northumberland following the shock win of the Northumberland Tories.\"",

We very much welcome the £15,000 funding from the Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner which enable this work to take place.\n“We are pleased to see that Kim McGuinness, the Police and Crime Commissioner is working with the police, council officials and other agencies to tackle this issue but it's clear that more needs to be done. Covid-19 lockdown is likely to have increased the numbers of children suffering sexual exploitation and online sexual exploitation will have increased because children are confined to the house.\n“Our children and young people need to be protected from every type of abuse.\n“Sadly, Northumberland is not immune from this damage to our children. It must be tackled and measures put in place to protect children and young people from this dreadful harm.”",

Most of us take this for granted. But in our county in 2019, 15 people had no roof above their head and no bed to sleep in. They slept rough. In 2018 this figure was zero in Northumberland.\nWhile most people agree that the way we count who's sleeping rough on our streets is not perfect, currently it's the only way we can measure what's happening. It's done by estimating who's sleeping rough on a single night between 1 October and 30 November every year. In a rural county like ours, counting who's sleeping rough is more challenging.\nThe figure of 15 is more than double the number recorded in any of the years since this way of counting rough sleepers was brought in 10 years ago. And the figures don't take account of sofa surfers; people who've got no home, but rely on the kindness of friends for shelter.\nIn my view the rise in rough sleepers and a Conservative government is not a coincidence. Since 2010 we have seen the harshest and most cruel changes in welfare; the system that is supposed to act a safety net for people who find themselves without the basics of human life. Remember, homelessness could happen to any of us. A marital breakup, unemployment, the death of parents who were living in social housing\nOur council has a strategy to tackle homelessness. It was 'refreshed' last year and will be reviewed at the end of the Conservative council's five year term in 2021. I expect the council is questioning why its rough sleeping numbers have actually gone up, even though they have strategy to tackle it.\nThe council's head of housing and public protection (the clue's in the job title) Phil Soderquest, tells us the council can't tackle homelessness on its own and they are working with partners.\nThat might be true but they, as a local authority, should be leading the charge to tackle an issue that simply should not be happening in 2020.",

Project organisers plan to install electricity in order to host exhibitions among a range of events.\nThe development phase of the project, supported by a £93,200 development grant from HLF, is now underway which will involve a more detailed structural survey, producing a range of business and management plans, commissioning an ecology survey and developing a new website.\nIn addition, the community archaeology project which includes excavation in the large field to the east of the tower, is ready to start. The work will take place over the coming weeks, culminating in an open day at the tower on February 19.\nAssistant Project Manager and local resident Barry Mead is delighted with the number of people who have volunteered to help with the archaeology scheme.\nHe said: “We’ve had a fantastic response to calls for volunteers to help with the archaeology project and it really shows how much interest there is in this important Northumberland landmark.\n“All the volunteer places are now filled and we’re looking forward to seeing what we discover during this phase of the scheme.”\nCounty councillor Scott Dickinson, ward member and business chair, has supported the project with £3,000 from his council capital allowance, matched by a further £3,000 of heritage funding.\nHe added: \"It’s great news that we’re now entering the next phase of this exciting project. The tower has the potential to be a major draw for the increasing number of visitors to the county, and I’m delighted the local community is playing such a key role.”\n\"This work is another example of the council working to boost economic growth in towns and villages across Northumberland.\"\nOnce the development phase is complete and approved, the project team will apply for the full HLF grant with the final delivery phase scheduled to get underway in May 2018 and complete by summer 2019.",

It was excellent that our schools adapted to online learning, but it did not help children without access to a computer or at the very least, a phone. This situation was exacerbated in homes with one laptop or computer where parents were also working from home.\nThe Department for Education said it would step in and provide 230,000 laptops for disadvantaged children by 30 June. This it has failed to do.\nI agree with Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green when she says that, once again, the government gives grand announcements, instead of following through on delivery.\nIt's very concerning that disadvantaged children without access to IT have now spent nearly a term without adequate access to education.\nMinisters need to get the remaining laptops to the families who need them immediately, and provide proper support for children who will be catching up over the summer.\nThe necessary closure of libraries, schools and community centres has cut off many deprived children from the wider world around them and seriously damaged their ability to carry on learning during the pandemic. If something isn't done it will further disadvantage their education and ability to catch up.\nIt is a real problem that many think doesn't exist.",

I'm absolutely distraught at the imagery of what's happening up there. Massive respect to the staff who work there, I had mountains of respect for you before but now I have masses of respect and deep concern for you all.\nI hope that the exposure makes the powers that be take action, deal with the issues and support the staff who are trying to keep us all safe but also keep themselves safe in impossible situations at their daily workplace.\nThe prison has always operated prior to privatisation as part of our community, I've visited been round the prison, visited cells, education and lots of other departments. I was always impressed with the level of control and professionalism of the staff. I felt safe at all times during my visits but now I doubt I'd accept the invite, I'd be concerned.\nWhen you reduce the levels of staff to the amount currently there, remove their support mechanisms such a drug dogs how on earth are they expected to maintain control.\nThe government have realised that the reduction of 6,000 officers was a mistake and have pledged more. But these will surely be for state run prisons so where does that leave Privatised Prisons and the good staff who work there.\nThere was an article released by me some months ago about the pressures on services relied on by outside communities such as the ambulance service with those limited services being absorbed by the prison while local people have difficulty getting access. Something that was never a problem to this extent previously. Tonight they mentioned the levels of Ambulances attending the Prison which proves my point.\nWhen I visited the Prison the education and rehabilitation on offer was of much better standards, not having heard of the current company and wasn't impressed with what was viewed tonight. This removes the abilities to rehabilitate and use Prison to change the direction of people's lives.\nIt's all about the money and the profit margins it would seem, total disregard for the safety and welfare of Prison staff and in turn the immediate communities.\nI know some great people who are part of the management team who must be frustrated with the room for manoeuvre that the company offers them when it comes to the finances.\nI really hope that following this the staff get the support they need and order is restored to HMP Northumberland and it is returned to the pre privatisation standards. Yes drugs and violence will always be a problem in a prison but not to this extent.\nJust my opinion of course.........",

A\n- Scott Dickinson\n- Jan 11, 2017\n- 2 min read\n11 January 2017\nDear Mr Parry\nNorthumberland County Council, at their meeting in December, considered the Motion initiated by Wigan MBC and circulated to Alliance Member Local Authorities on the matter of mIners’ pension fund surpluses. Members viewed with concern the injustice whereby the Treasury receives 50% of surpluses from the Mineworkers Pension Scheme, accumulating so far over £3bn, a sum taken from people and communities that are least able to afford it. They believed that this is out of all proportion to the risk covered, and fully support the Alliance’s call for independent scrutiny by the Public Accounts Committee to address this unfair arrangement.\nMany retired members suffered terrible health conditions and painful deaths in this region because of exposure to coal dust,without any compensation Successive governments have continued to take huge amounts from the fund, which was set up with miners’ money to help miners. Since 1994, £3.3bn has been paid into the Treasury from surpluses in the miners pension fund.\nMembers were advised that, in 1994 the miners’ pension scheme had become a stand-alone trust and was closed to new members. The government guaranteed that the pension entitlements would rise in line with inflation and in return the government would receive 50% of any surpluses, with the other 50% used by trustees to improve benefits. The Coal Industry Act 1994 stipulated that the government was entitled to no more than half of the surpluses; they could have taken less, but never did.\nSince then, spectacular surpluses have been made with no further money paid in by the taxpayer and the scheme had recently been extended to 2029. The total gross payments to the government are expected to be £8bn within this period, with no contribution from the government. The Council agreed that this benefit was out of proportion to the insurance cover it provided.\nAccordingly, Northumberland County Council fully supports the call for independent scrutiny by the Public Accounts Committee to address this injustice and seek answers to the four questions posed :\n1) The scheme had covered its own liabilities every year without call on the taxpayer. 2) Was the financial risk underpinning this agreement much lower than expected? 3) Given the Treasury had received a large windfall from the mineworkers pension scheme, should not more be returned to the coalfield communities which suffered from deprivation? 4) There were no new members who would claim, so if retired miners weren’t to get full benefit, who would? 5) Was the mineworkers’ pension scheme paying too much to the government, given the very small risk?\nYours sincerely\nCouncillor Grant Davey Leader of the Council",

The county council has purchased the site for an ‘undisclosed sum.’\n“I am not against the purchase if that is what’s needed to improve the prospects of the town in the long run and I’m pleased the county council shared their decision with the town council, but to ignore the other county councillors by having no risk appraisal panel, no full council, and no cross-party discussion on the decision-making is not acceptable. They weren’t even informed before the news went public.\n“This risk contained within this business deal needed to be debated cross-party. In 2016 the then Labour-led council bought Manor Walks at Cramlington. The risk was debated at a panel with all parties invited and a plan was unfurled and followed which has made Manor Walks the most successful shopping experience in the county if not the North East.\n“Blyth residents who have made contact are horrified by this gamble with their cash. This comes at a time when the county council has admitted it can’t deliver on its social services mandate, expect parish and town councils to foot most of the bill to keep streets clean and tidy and your grass cut while charging householders one of the highest rates of council tax in the UK. People are right to ask if these Conservative councillors have lost the plot or are they simply playing the lottery with local people’s lives.\n“Both the Max Caller report into the dreadful shortcomings of the county council and the improvement board set up to drive change insisted that all risk-related issues needed to be openly discussed and debated at regularly held risk appraisal panels. In the last six years, we’ve had two panel called and that was to discuss a parish council finance matter.\n“It would be good to understand the plans moving forward. The figure the site was bought for is all very cloak-and-dagger decision-making with public funds. I get buy-in, trust and support information needs to be shared on strategic things like this; Caller said it, the challenge board said it and I’ve said it time and time again. It’s clear the county council leaders are not listening.”",

Who's next is it the North?\nUnder-subscription, funding pressures and the withdrawal of sponsors have cast doubt over the long term viability of schools in the Hexham, Haltwhistle and Haydon Bridge areas. Yet rather than lobbying the government for a Fair Funding formula to recognise pressures on small rural schools the Tories plan closure.\nThree restructuring options have been proposed by the council, all of which involve major changes to Haydon Bridge High School, although the council has stressed that the final plan could be a combination of the three.\nA total of sixteen school are identified as being contenders for mergers and closures across the three plans, with as many as ten of them facing the axe.\nTory Deputy council leader Wayne Daley said:\n\"Unfortunately the current structure, with the high number of small and very small schools, together with no sign of significant growth in pupil numbers means the current education system appears not to be financially or educationally viable in the long term.\"\nHowever, councillor Grant Davey, leader of the Labour opposition, said he was \"extremely disappointed\" with the \"massive changes\" proposed and called on parents to \"stick up for their local schools\" by registering their views. Children as young as four will have to use public transport. It's an awful way to treat families. A lot of jobs are also at risk - teaching staff, grounds staff, ancillary staff.

Is this a Lip Service consultation or a meaningful one.\nAt no point have the Tories in Northumberland said they were planning to change the education system to Two Tier apart from a recent leaflet from them in the West.\nI have always valued the importance of village schools and the funding is making it impossible to survive.

That rollout will happen in the next few months in Northumberland. With most of the country reporting that through the rise of the gig economy and massive numbers of people working cheaply as false self employees, pressure has been taken off universal credit as we move towards an unemployment level of 4.5%. That is the level when Governments can state we have full employment nationally. The problem we have in Northumberland is that as most of the County, through its vastness and low population, suffers transport deprivation, a higher than average number of people will need to claim universal credit. To move from other benefits onto universal credit takes six weeks from application to first payment. If you’re an applicant who has to wait until the state decides you should be helped with the new benefit how do you pay your rent or feed yourself and your family for that first six weeks? Here in Northumberland the help you as a claimant will need to get assistance over the six week delay period normally comes via the Citizens Advice Bureau, CAB. CAB like many third sector organisations are feeling the pressure a decade of austerity has brought. They are considering reducing their County-wide service down to a call centre type activity. Many of those who are unable to get work and find themselves on benefit do not gel well with telephone instructions and need the help face to face contact brings. A Labour Party spokesperson said: “ Its now urgent that the protectors of the rich become the benefactors of those in need. Northumberland Tories need to get up off their backsides and urgently put a report to Cabinet to help CAB and aid those people who may starve without that help. Although benefit claimants will have to wait 42 days for their cash to come through, the maze prison hunger strikes showed that fit men began dying after 45 days, without urgent action from Northumberland Tories to fund the help people require, some my be in great difficulty through this massive change to their benefit payments.”",

Dear Tamsin, I write to you in relation to planning application 18/03055/FUL | Erection of 14 dwellings for social housing | Land North West of Hadston Community Centre St. Johns Estate South Broomhill Northumberland. Firstly, I want to make absolutely clear to anyone reading this, that I am in FULL support of Social Housing to meet the need in my community, but I cannot support the chosen site or plans as they currently stand. I welcome the intentions of the Social Housing provider to try and meet some need but feel a more active approach with the community may well have brought about a more palatable and well thought through scheme. The allocated site may well be owned by the applicant, but it plays a significant role in this community as an open space. Somewhere enjoyed by many hundreds of residents who pass the space while coming from estates to the shopping centre, community centre and doctors. I would not welcome the removal of this site for housing, while it is not our job to comment on other sites in the community, it is clear to me that far more suitable sites exist which are also in the applicant's ownership. This former Castle Morpeth Land was transferred so many years ago along with all the housing stock, I believe this was a huge mistake of the then Borough Council. Therefore, in my opinion this open green/public space should remain as such and in the ownership of the community to enjoy. It appears to me that the \"in use\" Castle Morpeth Planning Policies protect this land as a public space. I appreciate the age of these plans, also that they relate to a Council that no longer exists however, that is a fall-back position created by the Council itself since the removal of the Core Strategy for Northumberland. I, therefore, believe that the mechanism for refusal stands clear in those aged but relevant policies. However, should that itself not be enough I turn my comments to that of access. It is my firm belief that the housing estate of St. Johns is NOT in anyway shape or form a suitable access for a site like this. Built in the 60's, St. Johns was not designed for modern day vehicle numbers per property and most definitely not to furnish another estates access. I am sure highways themselves will raise issue and would be happy to meet an officer on site and show them exactly the issues that makes this unacceptable. Given that this estate is a difficult estate to navigate at the best of times, it would trouble me on a safety aspect, as well as noise and disruption were this to be approved. You only need to visit St. Johns to see an estate under pressure and that is without the additional access proposals. I have major concerns about the highway safety using St. John's as an access, I believe that an adjoining road to another estate will provide a sever risk to those already living there and those that use the estate to connect to other parts of the village. During the time of construction if this site is approved it would cause even greater risk to those who live there. My community welcomes social housing in appropriate locations, we want homes to furnish the needs of our community and support our independent traders thrive on the shopping precinct, but we cannot just allow development in any area to achieve that, especially at the loss of green space for children and residents to enjoy. I would urge a rethink on this, I would urge the applicant to work with the community to look at suitable sites that could accommodate everyone's needs while ensuring we have appropriate levels of green space maintained in the centre of our community. I hope the planning department listen to the views of locals, recommends refusal of this application and the applicant works with the community to find a site supported by all. Best wishes Cllr Scott Dickinson County Councillor Druridge Bay",

Life in our county is enriched by the efforts of very many people who give up their own time to run groups and organise events. So it’s great news that Northumberland County Council have set up a brand new fund to help people organising events with the cost of traffic management, closing roads and litter collection at any events they’re organising. The bit they’re not telling you they needn’t have had to set up a fund if they hadn’t decided they were going to start charging groups for these things from June this year Clearly the county council thinks it needs to soften the blow of ceasing to provide this support to the many local community, sport and cultural groups in the county, so it is using private windfall cash to create this fund. We’re told the fund will give organisations the chance to hold their events as usual this year, then think how they’re going to raise funds to pay the council for closing roads, managing traffic and clearing litter for any events they hold from next year onwards. To put it simply, any group thinking of holding an event in 2020 better start fundraising now, though I can’t see many funders being willing to donate the cost of closing a road. The Community Chest Scheme, protected by Labour when it led the council, has been slashed by £70,000. Every area of council services has been slashed while your council tax bill has gone up. And, not content with that, the council want to charge you for the pleasure of helping you with your event. https://www.northumberland.gov.uk/Councillors/Community-Chest.aspx\nEvents like our wonderful Firework Display in Hadston where we all volunteer to make it happen.",

The annual figures for Hadston House, covering a period from the end of June 2017, to June 30, 2018, were released to the organisation’s trustees and directors last week. The impressive stats show just how important this resource is to people in the East Chevington parish and the vital services which are being offered.

We have a wide range of services and the forthcoming year will see the organisation grow with capital changes to the building proposed, additional staff roles and new services on offer. It’s an exciting time and it is unusual for a community to have so many services on offer. “Thank you to everyone who supports us. Everything is recycled back in to the community and the services we offer. I’ve been working here for 10 years and it’s a privilege to support our community. “It’s an exciting time with recruitment taking place for the café. We also hope to advertise for a Silver Service Coordinator for the Druridge Bay area in the next few weeks. “We’ve got our new partnership with AIM North East, which is based with us, and supports 16 to 26-year-olds into work, and we’ve already had successes. “Community support will soon come online about drugs, suicide and mental health.”",

We have some areas in Northumberland with high levels of fuel poverty before all this began.\nWhile we recognise the County’s efforts in looking at long-term inequalities but we must take immediate action to look at the response to what is a critical status for residents.\nNorthumberland Labour Leader said: “People are already making difficult choices while prices soar. Hardworking families are left in insidious positions trying to keep their families afloat.\n“The County Council has a duty of care for vulnerable residents and we must use resources in a strategic, targeted way. Residents are counting on the Council for support.\n“While many properties are still being repaired or are left in disrepair following Storms, and solar panels and other initiatives have fallen apart with providers, we need to look at how this will impact people with poor insulation and promises of cheap bills now out of the window.\n“In reality, we need to look at Council resource which is already directed to support people in many ways being ramped up in a different type of arrangement that can support people for the winter months.\n“As free school meal entitlement soars in Northumberland, use of foodbanks too and child poverty the facts are telling us what it’s like out there.\n“It could be achieved in many forms but it needs a cross-party group with relevant officers and a willing administration to look at any type of support package that could be offered.”",

This will create jobs and make our homes cleaner and greener. We also want to cut the red tape left by Brexit and make, sell and buy more in Britain.

The Government say the new system will also be “fairer” and match “funding with need”.\nCoun Dickinson believed the prioritisation of areas in need would see councils like Northumberland County Council receive more cash. However, leading members of the Conservative administration warned last week that the reforms would not prevent an increase in council tax next year.\nCoun Dickinson said: “This is great news for Northumberland. Labour hasn’t just announced more support for councils – a 3.2% real terms boost – the government is also reforming council funding to ensure that areas like ours get a fairer share of support.\n“Going forward, Labour’s plans to give councils multi-year settlements isn’t just an accounting issue – it will mean councils like ours have the ability to plan for the future, and ensure that we best use our resources to provide as much help to local people as possible. Councils have been crying out for sensible reforms like these for years – and now Labour will deliver where the Tories failed.”\n“It will take time for Labour to fix the foundations of a country that the Conservatives left broke and broken, but change has begun – and through today’s announcement we can be sure that means more support for the people in Northumberland who really need it.”\nAccording to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, under the previous Conservative Government, councils’ overall funding fell 9% in real terms and were 18% lower in real terms per person. Last year, Northumberland Labour pointed out that the Conservative Government had cut funding to the area by £130.18 million in real terms since 2010.\nThe Provisional Local Government Finance Settlement for 2025-26 includes a new £600 million Recovery Grant for areas most in need, an increase to the Social Care Grant by £680 million, a new £250 million Children’s Social Care Prevention Grant. The county council is currently facing significant overspends in both adults and children’s care costs due to spiralling demand.\nIn September, council leader Glen Sanderson warned the local authority was being pushed into an “unsustainable” position, having spent an overspent on adult’s and children’s care by £50 million over the last five years and with an additional £6.8 million overspend anticipated this financial year alone.",

One of the reasons being the removal of the Core Strategy.\nOne of the things the Local Tory to me in Amble was going round saying was they would stop the excessive developments in Amble and ensure that the \"March of the Developers\" as they called it on literature stopped. This hasn't happened they have made the situation worse.\nLabour warned as did I specifically making references to key issues in a Withdrawal report provided by the planning department. In that it said a range of worrying things. The Labour Group moved at motion offering an alternative. Removing the Core Strategy would create a free for all with communities trampled on and suggested leaving the Core Strategy in place and make modifications to it. This did not succeed. So now we have a Party who said they would halt developers actually offering them the keys to the county.\nI am in favour of house building in Northumberland, however for me it must be guided house building in areas that need them, where the demand is present. Ideally a plan would be available to guide developers in the right direction that was a cross party document created over many years ( oh wait that's just been removed).\nMajor Land Agents now advertise Northumberland as a free for all and call on those with land banks to come forward. It's just a complete mess, all created because of fantasy election pledges they knew they couldn't deliver and this shocking attempt to try and appease those who voted for them simply to remove the Core Strategy is disgraceful disaster. All it has done is put ALL communities across the County at risk.\nOne Tory Councillor told me \"We were told it would be fine, the leadership said a few months until we submit one and now its potentially 3yrs. Our lot haven't got a clue\".\nWe have seen 2000 homes approved so far with nearly 1000 being in Amble alone. They've even cancelled the new school, car parks and other infrastructure being offered for the town.

It affects up to 5,000 adults in the UK at any one time, and six people die every day from the disease.\nCouncillors have an important role to play in helping to shape the services which people with MND rely on, such as social care, housing, health care, and public transport, as well as supporting the Champion the Charter campaign.\nThe five-point Charter was launched to improve people’s understanding of the disease as well as the care and support on offer, by coordinating efforts and improving local standards of care.\nColin Hardy, from Berwick, is the Campaigns Contact Volunteer for the MND Association Group. As a carer for his sister, he has campaigned tirelessly to get local authorities to adopt the MND Charter.\nColin said: “As somebody who has lost family and friends to this disease, I am so proud of Northumberland County Council for making this commitment.\n“It means there will be a more joined-up approach to providing care for people with MND, and a better quality of life for people living with terminal and long-term illnesses in Northumberland.\n“The campaign has been an amazing journey and it should encourage everyone out there who is affected by MND. It’s a massive landmark by a forward-thinking council and a beacon for others to follow.”\nCounty Councillor Susan Dungworth, cabinet member for adult care and public health at Northumberland County Council, said: “I am delighted that we have agreed to adopt the charter, in response to Colin’s campaign. It is essential that we all work together to promote a better understanding of MND and look at ways to improve the standard of care and treatment on offer for people who live with it.”\nJulie Compton, Campaigns Manager North for the MND Association, said: “The importance of the MND Charter is undeniable. We want everyone to be clear that access to the right care, in the right place, at the right time, as set out in our Charter, can transform lives.”\nFor further information please visit www.mndassociation.org/mndcharter",

  "https_www_scottdickinson_net_/https_www_scottdickinson_net_single-post_ashington-works-pushed-back-again/content_164.html": "Ashington works pushed back again\n- Scott Dickinson\n- Dec 12, 2023\n- 2 min read\nOn Tuesday (7 November) Tory-run Northumberland County Council’s cabinet agreed to transfer money out of schemes to regenerate Ashington to others in the county with a view to reallocating in the next financial year. Council documents show the justification for this being slippage in the Ashington town centre schemes.\nLeader of the opposition Labour group Scott Dickinson said: “When a minority Conservative administration took control of Northumberland County Council in 2017, they immediately withdrew a scheme to put hundreds of well-paid jobs in the centre of Ashington, despite the cost to the taxpayer. Since then, they have proceeded to spend tens of millions of pounds on the County Hall site in Morpeth they said only needed a lick of paint.\n“South East Northumberland has been badly let down by Conservatives at both national and local levels, with the cost of living crisis pushing residents and businesses to the brink of calamity. That national failure has been made worse by the scaling back of projects and failure to deliver investment for the county’s towns. Schemes promised in Ashington and Bedlington have stalled and residents are rightly wondering what impact soaring inflation will have on promised funds.\n“Even the Ashington the Blyth and Tyne line, which is currently progressing well, lacks ambition for our communities. When originally proposed by the Labour council the scheme included a stop at Woodhorn with bus connectivity to Newbiggin and the rural coalfield. This was removed and the stations now being developed are little more than bus shelters on the platform edge.”\nCouncillor Caroline Ball, who represents Ashington Town centre, said: “This latest delay is another blow to Ashington at the hands of Conservative failure. While they have made grand claims of projects and money being brought into the town, these are yet to materialise.\n“Having served almost two terms in office, the Tory Council have sat on a development site in the heart of the town with vague promises of a cinema and now they are dragging their heels on the Wansbeck Square site.\n“When they tell us these things will happen we shouldn’t forget they have promised to dual the A1 in Northumberland for a decade with not one metre of new road laid.\n“It is clear that both in Northumberland and nationally Tory failure is holding back our communities and that we need a fresh start.”",

During the visit, Cllr Dickinson learned about the various opportunities the site offers to support young and adult learners from across Northumberland in accessing welding and manufacturing courses at the new facility.\nCllr Dickinson had a conversation with a learner named Joseph, whose story is quite a success. Joseph left school and aimed to secure an apprenticeship. However, he did not initially achieve the required math grade of 4 (C). As a result, he enrolled in our Level 2 full-time program while retaking his math exam. Joseph demonstrated exceptional attitudes and behaviours, ultimately impressing a local employer who offered him a Level 3 Metal Fabricator apprenticeship.\nCllr Dickinson was particularly interested in the business partnerships, including a program by the DWP in partnership with Universal Wolf/Stellex. This program offers a 6-week course for the unemployed to gain a qualification and work experience, leading to potential job opportunities.\nCouncillor Scott Dickinson said, \"I want young people, adults looking to learn new skills, and businesses to be aware that this facility is available to help create well-rounded and job-ready individuals to support the job opportunities here in Northumberland, as well as those that will come as a result of recent government successes. The facilities are fantastic for those seeking careers in a wide range of jobs in the welding and manufacturing industry.\nThe team there is dedicated, professional, and well-respected, and individuals are guaranteed to receive the support they need. It was great to see some of the local well-established businesses supporting the site, from Hadston up to Blyth and everywhere in between, providing learners with valuable placements. I look forward to continuing to work with them and deliver for the people of Northumberland, so that individuals with the relevant skills are homegrown and ready to take on new opportunities. I thank them for inviting me.\"",

Wonderfully hard working people who were dedicated to their jobs.\" \"Often the Ambulance Service isn't talked about in terms of funding cuts. We need to remember that they too have had huge cuts and resource is tight.\"\n\"These changes claim to be in the interests of the patient, I wonder if it's more about the current missing of targets repeatedly.\"\n\"In North Northumberland we know only too well the issues relating to response times in rural communities.\"\n\"The service is so lucky to have such dedicated staff who've seen pay cuts for the last few years with the Conservatives pay cap.\"\nFrom this autumn, the most serious calls, such as when a patient is not breathing or their heart has stopped, will be expected to have a response within seven minutes typically and a maximum of 15 minutes overall for 90% of patients. But it means millions of patients, such as those with suspected heart attack and some strokes, will now see the target for them relaxed. They will move from the life-threatening category to an emergency category. These patients will be expected to receive a response within a maximum of 40 minutes for 90% of patients and typically within 18 minutes. NHS England bosses said the move will save lives and crack down on many calls which are classed as life-threatening but turn out not to be. A quarter of patients currently classed as life-threatening are not transported to hospital. Earlier this week:\nShadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth blasted ministers for a string of missed targets. He said: “This Government have failed to hit any of their main NHS ambulance targets since May 2015 and an updated system that truly works for patients is clearly overdue. Labour's Jon Ashworth warned the standards must not be based on cost “NHS ambulance trusts must now be given every support to build a new system which has the support of paramedics and patients alike. “The truth is that the Tories’ underfunding and mismanagement of the NHS has pushed ambulance services to the brink and left record numbers of patients suffering and in discomfort. “The public will want to know that a new series of standards is truly based on the best clinical evidence and not just on the money which the Government are making available.”",

This new analysis of the Tory threat has shown that, if the current rate of deterioration under the Tories continues, by 2022 our health and education services could be facing huge problems. It could mean: In a Tory NHS and social care system: · 5.5 million people on waiting lists in England, 1.8 million more than at present · Almost 1.5 million older and vulnerable people with unmet social care needs In a Tory education system: · 650,000 pupils crammed into primary classes of over 30 · Families left almost £450 worse off per child as a result of the Tories’ plan to scrap free school meals for 1.7 million children The choice at the election is stark. The Tories have no plan to properly fund our public services, pushing them further into crisis. Labour will take a different approach, we will rebuild our public services for the many by modest tax rises for companies and the richest 5 per cent. Labour will build an NHS and social care system for the many: · Labour will invest £37 billion in our NHS and take one million people off the waiting list by the end of the next Parliament · Labour will invest £8 billion in social care over the course of the next Parliament and lay the foundations of a National Care Service to integrate health and social care Labour will build an education system for the many: · Labour will cap class sizes at 30 for 5-, 6- and 7-year-olds · Labour will provide free school meals to all primary school children by introducing VAT on private school fees\nScott said: \"Our NHS is important to us all and everyone should access healthcare without fear of not being able to pay the bills.\"\n\"We all pay in, Labour created the NHS free at the point of use and only Labour will protect it\".\n\"Our schools are important for the development of our children and future development of our country.

Since 2010 the government has repeatedly cut funding to councils, leaving an increasing number of councils warning that they could effectively go bankrupt in the coming months.\nThe cross-party Local Government Association have warned that a combination of rampant inflation, rising homelessness, and the increased cost of delivering services such as children’s social care mean councils are facing a £4bn funding gap by March 2025.\nCommenting on the letter, Leader Scott Dickinson said:\n“Northumberland deserves a fair deal. Government funding cuts have been unfairly targeted at areas like Northumberland. The Conservative government has cut funding to our area by £130.18M in real terms since 2010, which is equivalent to -61% of the funding we received from the last Labour government.\n“Unfunded pressures are pushing council finances to the brink. Local family finances are still recovering from the Conservative government’s disastrous decisions that crashed our economy. The government should take responsibility for funding local services, rather than once again forcing councils to increase council tax bills.”\n“The Chancellor must use the Autumn Statement to deliver the fair deal for Northumberland that we deserve. If he cannot do that, the Conservatives should call a General Election and give the country the chance to vote in a new government that has a plan to give Northumberland its future back.”",

That was based on information from NEAS data which was given to me as Chair of Northumberland’s Health and Wellbeing at the time by someone who’d requested it. Now I remain concerned this report from Community Beat Manager clearly shows that Community Policing is being sucked in off our streets into a Prison that didn’t need that support at this level before being privatised. PC Paul Dent said that calls to HMP Northumberland are keeping police busy, adding: “The volume is getting sizeable.

What about Consultation? Rushed Tory closure proposals for\n- Scott Dickinson\n- Mar 5, 2018\n- 2 min read\nDear Editor,\nHaving read the Northumberland Conservative’s Northumberland News ‘Hexham Special’, where a statement has been issued that their administration’s plan is for a two-tier system of education across the whole of Northumberland, I thought I should steer my note to the public through your newspaper.\nThe document in question illustrates support by Northumberland Conservatives and is complete with a photo of Guy Opperman MP. There is to be no consultation as to whether three or two-tier education is the choice of people living in the West of the county, it’s simply what type of two-tier system do you want? Do you want to let Northumberland Conservatives close 13 or 16 schools?\nWhat I would like to know, as do a number of your readers who have contacted me, is does Anne-Marie Trevelyan MP support the closure of middle schools and small rural first schools in the North of the county without proper consultation with schools or parents? Is the proposed money-saving exercise of closing schools and losing jobs, and the heart of many small communities, simply to balance the books, given the Conservative Government’s under-funding and reduced funding of schools continues?\nI find it very worrying that four-year-old children will be put onto public transport to travel, in some cases, many miles each day to and from their new primary schools, and they will remember those experiences their whole life. Hearts will be ripped out of communities.\nWe still suffer many years on from the LibDem/Tory closure of Druridge Bay Middle. I was also saddened to see the withdrawal of funding completely from the Conservative budget for investment in Amble’s education system. It would appear that if you live outside Ponteland there was little in the budget for anyone.\nLocal Tories have failed to get any deal or investment locally from the Ponteland Tory leadership.\nThankfully, the new hotel in Amble, a Labour investment, continues while everything else has been halted and redirected. So at least those jobs will still be created.\nScott Dickinson\nChair\nNorthumberland Labour Group Read more at: https://www.northumberlandgazette.co.uk/news/schools-what-about-consultation-1-9041528",

It was only ever going to be a matter of time before the BBC said it couldn’t support the cost of providing free TV licence for our older people and the government could very conveniently wash its hands of whole sorry situation.\nThe free TV licence for people over 75 was introduced by Labour in 2001 and in 2015 the BBC agreed to to take this over as part of its charter negotiation. The BBC agreed to take responsibility for any future scheme and how it would be paid for from 2020.\nYou’ve got to question the wisdom of that agreement. The BBC agreed to something it probably had no intention of keeping to get their charter over the line.\nAnd who are the casualties here? Not the government or the BBC thank you very much.\nOnly last week the government and the BBC were paying tribute to our older people in the D Day commemorations. This week they are quite happy to forget them. Many older people see the television is a lifeline.\nWe’re reassured that the very poorest will still receive their TV licence free and of course there will be a small number of very comfortably off older people who may feel they don’t need this concession.\nBut what does it say about what the government and the BBC think of those very many ordinary people stuck in the middle who have to budget carefully to have any sort of quality of life?\nI am generally a glass half full person and try to find the good in situations and people. But sometimes I feel ashamed to live in a country where we think it is perfectly fine to honour people one week, then show them utter contempt the next.\nThere seems to be a groundswell of opinion protesting about this move.

Leader Scott Dickinson said: “The truth is that from 2010 when they came to power they systematically and deliberately stripped back public services (especially in Labour-led authorities), failed to get to grips with the housing crisis and presided over a period of economic decline for ordinary people. “Of course, it wasn’t a decline for everyone; the rich and wealthy got even more rich and wealthy under their watch. Yes, there has been an impact from the invasion of Ukraine and the pandemic but the rot had well and truly set in many years before that. “Labour wants decent housing, jobs, education, security and health for everyone and well as a greener, cleaner future and it has plans ready to implement to make this happen. Decent homes, jobs, schools, health and care services and police services are the signs of a civilised society. “A civilised society is not working people depending on food banks, people waiting in pain for treatment they badly need, not enough staff to look after older and vulnerable people, homes that are dangerous, expensive and unfit to live in, people forced to choose between eating and heating and people feeling unsafe in the street. “I am generally optimistic and I came into politics to serve the people who elected me and try and make things better. I see little evidence of this in our current government. “Parents want their children to have a better standard of living than they did; this government will go down in history as the government where children were far worse off than their parents. “Those at the top think party first and country and the people in it second. If they really cared about the people they are supposed to be serving they’d move over. They’ve run out of ideas and it’s only Labour who have a serious and costed plan for growth.”",

A recently answered FOI has blown that pledge out of the water. At the meeting of the full council in January Tory councillors voted in favour of slashing council tax support for our counties most vulnerable people. Their callous actions were allowed by the coalition of the silent when Bedlington independent and Liberal Democrat councillors failed to join a Labour led rebellion to halt the move. Now in an explosive FOI released by the council the level of cuts to the county’s most vulnerable and the unfair nature of balancing the county’s books is laid bare. Whilst the leader of the councils own ward in Ponteland sees a mere 21 people hit by the cut, across Ashington and Blyth almost 6,000 people are affected. All based on an anonymous survey that those who will be hit will never have seen. In Bedlington where the independents sat on their hands in the vote 1,113 residents are affected, taking £115,752 out of the local economy per year. Women are disproportionately affected and in Bedlington alone as the three male councillors refused to block the measure 573 women are hit. In Prudhoe where the two Tories voted for the supports removal, more than 500 residents are affected with 241 families with children hit. Councillor Susan Dungworth said; “The Tories promised to build a county that worked for everyone but their actions show a very different story. Their desire to balance their own financial mismanagement on the backs of the poor and the vulnerable shows their true colours. Not only will this callous move disproportionately hurt low paid women and the disabled it will hammer high streets already under strain. Taking more than a million pounds from the pockets of the county’s poorest residents will directly hit the local economy. High streets like Bedlington simply cannot afford to see tens of thousands of pounds lost from the pockets of local people.”",

But as they others proceeded with some no more than a commitment with no plans then a fully costed, designed and ready project should also have continued.\nThanks to everyone who's been in contact and offered support to us to fight this decision.

These people also take care of gritting and keeping our parks looking good. But there’s now 157 fewer of them to do the same work. Where have they gone? Nearly nine per cent of the workforce just disappeared as if by magic?

A partnership between local government and care and health providers is improving support for residents through a range of initiatives, which include the establishment of better links with GPs and pharmacists. The scheme, launched as part of the Better Care Fund (BCF) initiatives, improves healthcare in homes through training, education and improved medication checks and telephone access to GPs. The BCF was announced by the Government in 2013 to improve the provision of integrated health and social care.\nAt least £3.8billion of existing NHS and local-authority funding must be included in a pooled budget in each local area for BCF provision. The Fund aims to improve support to people with long-term needs and to protect social-care services from the impact of local-authority austerity savings by developing integrated services which reduce costs, including acute hospital costs.\nCoun Scott Dickinson, vice chairman of the Northumberland Health & Wellbeing Board, has been visiting care homes in the county to meet staff and patients and see how services are progressing. On a visit to the Acomb Court care home, in Hexham, run by Helen McArdle Care, he said: \"If care-home residents become poorly, it is often better that they are treated within the familiar surroundings of their care home. It is more comforting for them and avoids unnecessary transfers to hospital.\nQuality and clinically appropriate delivery of care in the care home is the goal and I’m pleased to see the progress being made to make healthcare as comfortable as possible for residents.\" Some of the improvements being made include: A lead pharmacist has been appointed to carry out medication reviews and improve the quality of prescribed medicines to residents; Better access to GP support with the provision of a dedicated telephone number for care home staff; The role of community matrons is being developed with a focus on improving emergency healthcare plans; Care home staff are being supported with training, education and awareness raising programmes.\nCoun Dickinson added: \"We are continuing to visit community hospitals and care homes throughout next year to see how the schemes are working and provide feedback to inform further improvements.\"",

I am proud of Labour’s strong record on animal welfare. It was Labour who brought in the landmark Animal Welfare Act in 2006, the most comprehensive piece of animal welfare legislation for nearly a century. It is now time to update existing legislation, in order to ensure that we still have the best standards of animal welfare in the world. The current penalties for animal welfare cases in England are amongst the lowest in Europe. It is time this changed – so we support increasing of the maximum sentences for those convicted of animal cruelty. Labour is proud of legislating to ban hunting with dogs through the Hunting Act 2004 and opposes any moves by the Tories to use the valuable Parliamentary time to repeal it. As well as protecting the Hunting Act the next Labour Government will go further to strengthen animal rights across the board. We will ban the use of wild animals in circuses, introduce a total ban on the trading of ivory and prohibit the third-party sale of puppies. We are against the culling of badgers to control bovine TB, and would immediately end the ineffective and cruel badger cull, instead focusing on an evidence-based approach driven by science, not ideology. The humane treatment of all animals should be a benchmark for any civilised society. National governments have a duty to work together to fight animal cruelty across the world. Thank you again for contacting me about animal welfare. As your candidate, I am grateful for every opportunity to set out my position to you. Ultimately, this General Election is a choice between a Labour Party who will stand up for the many and a Conservative Party which only looks after the privileged few, and I hope you will consider putting your trust in me, and in Labour.",

More than two million of these children are under five years old (53 per cent compared to 51 per cent a year earlier) and 700,000 of them are in what’s described as severe poverty (this figure was 600,000 a year earlier). The number of children in what’s described as absolutely poverty, another way of measuring poverty, rose by 200,000 to 3.7m this year. When one person is poor in a community where everyone else isn’t you might say that’s down to the individual, but when over four million children are classed as poor in our country then you have to accept that something is very wrong with the system. The government says its tackling this. But how can a government, whose Prime Minister is so out of touch that she recently described anyone earning less than £35,000 as unskilled, possibly think they have any strategies to tackle it. In fact, if you didn’t know better you might say they created it; austerity, stripping funds from local authorities (starting with the North East local authorities), allowing zero-hours contracts, transport cuts, education cuts, leisure cuts, universal credit, PIP payments, the bedroom tax. I could go on. This national picture is reflected in our area. Druridge Bay, which I represent, has the highest level of child poverty in the Berwick on Tweed constituency. And if there’s child poverty, there’s family poverty. In 2019 the safety net is food banks. The safety net used to be the welfare state. That was why it was created. While food banks do some amazing work, we should not need them in 2019 in the fifth richest country in the world. Child poverty is a political choice.

He criticised homeowners who “sit on a nice nest egg” but oppose housing developments. Mr Javid said: “I think all Governments, including previous Conservative governments, have not taken [housing] seriously enough in the past. We have been listening too much to those people that are against development under any circumstances.” Mr Javid also said the planning system needed an overhaul, as it had for too long been in control of those opposing development. His speech opens up the debate in Northumberland as to why the Tories removed the Counties safeguard from over development, the document known as the Local Core Strategy so that they can protect ‘nimbyism’ and stop the document being inspected by Sajid Javids department. People also want to know why, now that they are in control of the planning system in Northumberland, they are dumping housing numbers on the South East and Rural Coalfield areas of the County in order to pay back their Nimby supporters in the West and North? In his final speech to Council in April 2017 before retiring, one of the Counties most experienced planning councillors, Councillor Paul Kelly who led the strategic planning committee, spoke about the word Conservative and how he believed the Tories want to preserve rural Northumberland in aspic. At the time of his speech Councillor Kelly wasn’t armed with the knowledge that the Tory nimby crew would rush into blind panic and remove the Core Strategy from final examination but the Tory attitude towards rural growth in Northumberland will deny infrastructure improvements to 92% of the County, forcing growth in housing, health and jobs onto the remaining 8% of the vastness that is Northumberland.",

In the letter I signed to the Education Secretary it said the below 5 key safety tests were critical.\nTest 1 : Much lower numbers of Covid-19 cases\nThe new case count must be much lower than it is now, with a sustained downward trend and confidence that new cases are known and counted promptly. And the Government must have extensive arrangements for testing and contact tracing to keep it that way.\nTest 2 : A national plan for social distancing\nThe Government must have a national plan including parameters for both appropriate physical distancing and levels of social mixing in schools, as well as for appropriate PPE, which will be locally negotiated at school-by-school and local authority level.\nTest 3 : Testing, testing, testing!\nComprehensive access to regular testing for children and staff to ensure our schools and colleges don’t become hot spots for Covid-19.\nTest 4 : Whole school strategy\nProtocols to be put in place to test a whole school or college when a case occurs and for isolation to be strictly followed.\nTest 5 : Protection for the vulnerable\nVulnerable staff, and staff who live with vulnerable people, must work from home, fulfilling their professional duties to the extent that is possible. Plans must be specifically address the protection of vulnerable parents, grandparents and carers.\nWestminster have got this sadly wrong in many ways and our children or teaching/support staff cannot be another. That is why resource to combat the 10yrs of austerity needs to be provided to schools to allow them to adapt and protect all staff and students. We cannot have them trying to make do with the reduced money they have.\nRobust, resourced safety measures are most definitely needed and should be supported by all.\nI want to see normality and schools return as soon as its safe to do so, nobody wants children to miss out on education, I will fully support anyway I can with the safe reopening of schools.\nScott\nCllr Scott Dickinson\nDeputy Leader\nNorthumberland Labour Group\nShadow Cabinet Member for Children’s Services",

More than 1 in five households have less than £100 spare each month – twice as many as two years ago. 69% of families are more worried about their finances than last year as energy bills have risen 63%, fuel by 39%, food by 32%, rent by 26% and mortgages by 22%\nIn Autumn 2022, the Conservative government crashed the British economy unleashing runaway inflation and soaring mortgages.

We have pollution leaking into the sea, our bay is eroding at a worrying rate and the beach is littered with industrial waste. The Government has previously said that ultimate responsibility for both the landfill site and coastal defences at Lynemouth Beach lies with the council and despite assurance in June 2019 from Tory MP, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, that the situation was being “discussed at the highest levels”, there seems to be no help forthcoming from central Government agencies. “Time is running out to clean up pollution on Lynemouth beach.

At that time, it was recognised that all Northumberland families should know they can have theirs and their children’s needs met within the county.\nI’m pleased that the current authority holds the same view but I can’t help feeling disappointed that only academy trusts have been invited to find out more about creating and running a school.\nAs we know academy trusts, which are not under local authority control, have a chequered history. I’ve no doubt there are some inspiring and effective academy trusts but to ignore the very many excellent local authority-run schools seems to me a little short-sighted.\nThere is a wealth of knowledge, skill and expertise in our local authority schools which change and improve the lives of our children on a daily basis. To exclude them means the county, and more importantly our children and families, could miss out on finding out what our local authority-run schools which, after all, have been around far longer than academy trusts, have to offer.\nI understand that the requirement for academy trusts only to be invited comes at a national level from the Department of Education and that our local authority is only following the rules. It probably says more about the current government and their lack of faith and confidence in their own state schools.

This reinforces my concern for the wellbeing of staff that work in HMP Northumberland and the practices that need to be addressed. I'm concerned that 20% of Prisoners have become addicted to drugs when entering Prison, this clearly demonstrates the availability of drugs within the prison and confirms that 61% of the inmates in HMP Northumberland were correct that drugs are easy to get hold of.\nMy main concerns remain around the safety of the staff who work there and the resources that are being lifted from the local community into the Prison. Staff should be able to go to work and be as safe as possible and resource should be provided for them to do that. The local community and others need to feel assured that the environment within the Prison is improving and this doesn't seem to be the case.\nI'm concerned too that often vulnerable people are becoming addicted to drugs when they enter the Prison and therefore have long lasting issues to deal with when leaving. This also creates increased pressures on a system already under pressure on the outside world.\nThe Government promised intervention and investigations following the Panorama Programme clearly issues remain of great concern, I just wonder how far they plan to let it go before actually doing something. This is a continuation of a clear example that Privatisation does not work and Prison contracts should be returned to Government.",

This little lads face is what its all about, pleased to see someone enjoying it immediately. Local people will remember the consultation carried out by the then Labour County Council and a master plan shared to create a park facility for the community to enjoy. We wanted to go some way to replacing the school torn down by the then Libdem/Tory Council leaving a big hole in the village. Unfortunately, soon after the Conservatives took power most areas including ours had all plans stopped, contractors were taken off site and projects halted. No explination given other than Tory Councillors deciding to scrap plans in areas they didn’t believe deserved anything. Local people elected, for the second time a strong Councillor, knowing someone like me was never going to just walk away from the project nor let our area be bullied. So, I pulled together money to get one bit of equipment, the bit favoured most by the children and families who had participated in the consultation. It took bloody sweat and tears to get together but we did it and today we opened it for people to enjoy. I will continue to pursue facilities for my area in the face of Tory discrimination and bullying and I will not be pushed around or have the people who elected me left wanting because they don’t come from the right area in the eyes of the Tories. I’ve lived here all my life and love the place and the people, never will I not give it 100% !!! Anyway ENJOY everyone !!!!",

This same leaflet as part of its imprint advised it was promoted on behalf of Guy Opperman.\nThis week Mr Opperman has publically distanced himself from your plans to force this system on communities across the West of Northumberland many of whom have schools rated as “good and outstanding”.\nThe position of Labour group on these changes is clear and remains unchanged since 2014. We will back the retention of three tier education in areas county wide where that is the majority view amongst local residents and would not introduce changes without consultation and the initiative being driven by the schools.\nThese changes being proposed by your administration could see children as young as four being bussed to school. Furthermore in rural areas the local school is often the focal point of the community and this risks fundamentally altering that relationship.\nWith this in mind I would be grateful if you could answer the following questions;\n1. Do Northumberland Conservatives have a plan to move schooling in the county to primary and secondary as stated in your leaflet?\n2. If not why was this included in the leaflet and attributed to Guy Opperman MP?\n3. If it is not your plan why has the west of the county been singled out for such a change whilst the North remains as is?\n4. In the rushed out consultation why is a fourth option “That three tier education is retained unless parents and schools want a different system” not included?\n5. The Journal carried an article published 19thFebruary where you said “The council is committed to putting between £50m-£60m into making this a success so it’s not about penny-pinching.” Why is only £30M visible in the budget passed last week?\n6. What assessment have you made of the costs of the full county being moved to two tier education?\n7.

Let’s be clear about this. It won’t.\n“Truss lumps Labour in with what she calls the anti-growth coalition. But like all the people and organisations she’s accusing, Labour has plans to put money back in ordinary people’s pockets, address climate change and have a healthy economy. If anything this group are the pro-growth coalition, the difference being that everyone will enjoy the riches of growth, not just a tiny, already wealthy minority.\n“Labour’s plans are to build a fairer, greener future that this country deserves.”",

Paul Hedley, Chief Fire Officer at NFRS said: \"Our firefighters work hard throughout the community in both rural and urban settings. As a whole time firefighter you have the opportunity to become a role model within the community while developing your skills and beginning a new career path. If you are interested, we encourage you to apply, you do not need to have previously attended a taster session in order to apply.\" Firefighters now deliver a variety of roles, from attending to emergency incidents to working in their local communities, often with partner agencies, to support a number of safety messages and initiatives – from road and water safety; fire safety in schools and delivering Home Safety Checks. County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service’s Chief Fire Officer, Stuart Errington said: “This is a fantastic opportunity to become part of the fire and rescue service, the modern firefighter not only saves lives but they provide a vital role within the community to educate people on how to stay as safe as possible. “Educational initiatives in schools, colleges and community groups are also an important part of the work that our firefighters carry out.” “I would encourage applications from anyone, regardless of your age, gender or your ethnicity, who genuinely wants to make a difference to people of the northeast - Take it from me, it is at times a huge challenge but overall an extremely rewarding career.” The registration period is open for 5 days, and the clear message is, don’t let this opportunity pass you by. This is echoed in the short film that is going out across all the Service’s social media platforms. However, the fire services are hoping that would-be firefighters will help them by not all applying as soon as the window is open Chris Lowther, Chief Fire Officer, TWFRS commented: “This is an extremely exciting time for us, especially as we haven’t recruited firefighters for over eight years. We are committed to encouraging anyone who wants to be a firefighter to apply. Our firefighters should reflect our communities and we want the right people to apply – that’s irrespective of gender, age or ethnicity.\nOur firefighters don’t just fight fires and rescue people from road traffic collisions, they play an integral role in our community to help prevent emergencies and accidents occurring in the first place. They also help to educate children on the risks from fire, water and roads. “This isn’t a case of first come, first served. Each applicant will have the same opportunity to register and complete the online process. I can’t wait to meet our new recruits in October and wish all applicants the very best of luck.”",

But to our national shame, tonight and every night thousands of people will sleep in doorways and on park benches for want of a place to stay. Many thousands more will be stuck in hostels or temporary accommodation or ‘sofa-surfing’ with friends. Increasing homelessness is the most visible sign of Conservative Ministers’ seven years of failure on housing. In the last six years, the number of people sleeping rough on our streets has more than doubled, the number of homeless households has risen by almost half to nearly 60,000, and this year well over 120,000 children are without a home. The hard truth for Conservative Ministers is that their decisions have caused this crisis: record low levels of new affordable rented housing, lack of action to help private renters and deep cuts to housing benefit and charity funding. It is one of the proudest achievements of the last Labour government that we reduced rough sleeping by around three-quarters and managed an unprecedented decline in statutory homelessness. We set out a comprehensive intervention plan, ground-breaking legislation, fresh investment, and a target to cut rough sleeping by two-thirds – delivered a year early. The next Labour government will go further and end rough sleeping for good. We will establish a Prime Minister-led taskforce on ending rough sleeping by the end of the next Parliament, making the links between housing, health, social security and work. As a first step we will overhaul the way we measure rough sleeping so that we know how many people are sleeping rough and more about how we help them. You can’t help people who are homeless if you won’t provide the homes so we’ll transform our capacity to get people off the streets for good by making available at least 4,000 new homes for people with a history or rough sleeping. We’ll explore how this might develop into a ‘housing first’ approach to provide a long-term solution to those rough sleepers with complex needs. We will also take action to tackle the wider causes of homelessness beyond rough sleeping. We will halt the government’s plans to change the way supported and sheltered housing is funded which charities, housing associations and councils all say will lead to the closure of homelessness hostels and other vital housing for some of the most vulnerable people in our country. We’ll work with the housing sector to bring forward a new plan to fund this vital housing adequately for the long-term. We will protect the housing cost element of Universal Credit for 18-21 year olds which the Conservatives have cut, and we will undertake a review of the adequacy of support for housing costs through the social security system given the huge reductions in the housing safety net over the last seven years. We will build thousands more affordable homes to rent, to give those on low incomes more options for a place to stay. And with the failure of a private rented tenancy now being the single most common cause of homelessness, our plans to increase security for private renters with predictable rent rises will help people remain in their homes. I am grateful for every opportunity to listen to you views and to set out my own position to you. Ultimately, this General Election is a choice between a Labour Party who will stand up for the many and a Conservative Party which only looks after the privileged few, and I hope you will consider putting your trust in me, and in Labour",

Not only that but it is hidden behind a twisted capital scheme headline and penalises the most vulnerable in Northumberland.\n\"In the middle of a pandemic, where it will take residents and services years to recover, they level the largest cuts at adult and children's services. We have seen all year at every twist and turn the need for us to fight to get children in particular the deal they need, whether it be free school meals or digital support. U-turns have happened in the council but only at our intervention.\n\"They continually defend political spend nearly £400,000 on toilets which could run a small department within the council. They are looking at slashing education and skills or careers support and advice which at this time should surly be a priority. Young people need hope, support and care to come out of this pandemic and find work, education and skills. They need to know that life is bright and possibilities are out there, young people's mental health especially this week in Mental Health Week should really be a focus and focus the minds of leaders, but clearly not.\n\"They tell us that social care will get the money it needs while levelling an increase in council tax and levy to local residents, but at the same time slashing social care at the back door.\n\"They propose to remove £2m from one team that works on independence which is something we should really be boosting not cutting. They're taking £400k from Telecare services; the red cords that people pull in their properties when they need help. We want absolute reassurance that this service won't impact users' ability to get the help they need nor will we be turning into the Tory Council from down South that charges elderly people when they fall......remember those headlines.\n\"The capital budget is a fudge and a hidden lie. Earlier this year for instance, the cabinet removed the capital spend on James Calvert Spence College and Seaton Valley Federation, yet here in this budget they chuck a nominal fee in and levy the rest of the budgets in multiple years after the election. This is election trickery at its worst.\n\"Last year we were told a late amendment for Berwick too but here we are a year on and no mention of Berwick. They've already delayed many of these schemes by four years and are now pretending, through creative presenting, to suggest they are still on the agenda. You can't have it both ways and hope that the public won't see it because there is so much heartache and anxiety in the world today.\n\"And more than £20m million is just listed for third party loans. These are similar figures from previous years. In brackets it says these are to companies like Advanced Northumberland. At the current time would that be wise? This is public money that needs to be paid back. They are already about to hit £1bn pounds worth of borrowing; the highest the council has EVER seen. This is hundreds of millions more than was borrowed when Labour was in control.\n\"We are appalled at the budget target areas. We are saddened that the capital arrangements are less than truthful in our opinion. We will be holding urgent meetings with the council's executive officers to seek further advice.\n\"We have little or no confidence in the ability of the council's leading politicians to do anything properly at present, and this appears to just be another example of that.\"",

With six days to go until voting, Theresa May has still not ended the uncertainty facing millions of pensioners. The Tories are: · Planning to scrap universal Winter Fuel Payments – which could hit as many as 10.8 million pensioners, according to a Labour analysis of Pension Credit data · Still refusing to give a figure for the cap they will put on their dementia tax, the name given to their plan to force people to pay for social care with their homes Analysis by the Labour Party shows the effect of the Tory dementia tax on older people living in a house worth the average UK price of £217,500 if the cap is set at £72,000 or £100,000 and they find they need home care at the capped level. At a cap of £100,000, a person in this situation needing the capped amount of care would lose 42 percent of the value of their estate. The more someone’s house is worth, the lower the percentage they would lose. Labour will: · Maintain the triple-lock on state pensions to protect incomes · Invest £37 billion into the NHS · Invest £8 billion into social care over the next parliament · Protect Winter Fuel Payments and free bus passes\nScott said: \"it's a very important issue for lots of families up and down the Country, people need to know clearly what will be taken from them.\"\n\"Care is so important in later years a clear plan is required, only Labour are offering the detail to people.\"\n\"I have visited Valley Care on a number of occasions (pic above) and the work they do supporting older people is important.\"\n\"Families know where they stand on care and paying for care with Labour don't risk it on June 8th and vote Labour.\"",

Northumberland residents can now access free home sampling kits which enable them to get tested for HIV.\n● As the Annual Report of the Council’s Director of Public Health says, Northumberland residents are in good health overall - and getting healthier. The 2015 report (published in 2016) identified a number of key achievements over the last 12 months and sets out a new approach to meeting the challenges that lie ahead. The report finds a population with high levels of happiness and low levels of anxiety. Northumberland residents can expect to live on average 63 years in good health (more than 75% of their lives) but this varies across the county and there is work still to be done to narrow the gap where health inequalities exist. It also sets out a new strategy for making Northumberland a healthier place to live, which stresses the importance of involving communities in identifying and building on activities which improve their health and wellbeing. The Better Health at Work programme is growing, with eight new businesses achieving the Bronze standard, with an additional reach of 1,265 employees.\n● We have also seen several other marked improvements in public health over recent years, including: an increase in the proportion of adults who do not smoke from 81.9% in 2012 to 83.4% in 2015; a increase in the proportion of pregnant women who do not smoke by the time of delivery from 80.6% in\n2012/13 to 85% in 2015/16; and a dramatic decrease in the numbers of teenage pregnancies from 239 in 2007 to 121 in 2014. The Council will continue to work with partners to improve the health and wellbeing of the population of Northumberland.\n● We have comprehensively updated our arrangements for adult social care to meet the enhanced expectations of new national legislation (the Care Act). We have developed a coordinated approach to “early intervention”, to ensure\nthat people get immediate help to recover after an illness or accident, and that people who currently have low-level needs, or who are currently able to meet their needs without our help, can get comprehensive advice and information about support in the community which can help to prevent their needs from becoming more serious. Where people need long-term support from us, we have introduced a new approach to assessing their needs and planning their care and support, aiming to make sure that they are fully involved in the process, and have access to the same information as the professionals working with them.\n● We have risen to the challenge of new legal requirements introduced by the Supreme Court for the protection of the human rights of people with cognitive impairments who need 24-hour supervision, and are now legally regarded as being “deprived of their liberty”. We have achieved this despite the cumbersome requirements of the existing Act of Parliament, which was not designed to meet the Supreme Court’s interpretation of human rights law, and despite the Government’s failure to give local authorities funding to cover the ongoing costs.\n● In 2015, our adult social care service, with funding from Macmillan Cancer Support, appointed a team of four Macmillan social workers to support people with cancer and a range of life-limiting or long-term conditions. The social workers also provide ongoing support to family and friends. The aim is to improve the quality of life for the patient, their family and friends, by helping people get timely, joined up community support, with tailored health and social care plans which reflect the individual’s own wishes. The team also helps to arrange and coordinate hospital discharges, helping people to spend more time at home or in their preferred place of care.\n● In 2016 Macmillan social worker Heather Kent won the Adult Social Worker of the Year category in the prestigious national Social Worker of the Year Awards.\n● The Northumberland Carers Guide to hospital services, a collaboration between social care staff and in-patient acute services, is now available as a standard information booklet on hospital wards.\n● Our Ageing Well Allies training has been developed to help anyone who works with older people, including volunteers, to become more confident in signposting people to activities, services and groups which might help them reconnect with their communities.\n● We are investing £2 million in sporting facilities in Bedlington; with improved facilities at the new Bedlingtonshire Community High School and\ndevelopments at Gallagher Park. The park will be modernised with a new pavilion and new facilities, including toilets. The new Bedlingtonshire Community High School will have new facilities and will be open to the public from September 2016. Developments include a new studio for health and fitness classes, a multi-functional 4-court sports hall for activities including badminton, basketball, netball and 5-a-side football.\n● The new £21m state-of-the-art Ashington Leisure Centre opened to the public in January 2016. The flagship leisure facility in Ashington is a regional centre of excellence for sport with facilities including indoor cricket nets; a six-lane,\n25-metre swimming pool, exercise studios, and a six-court sports hall with extensive floor space and equipment for gymnasts. It is also home to the library which has an extensive range of books and digital resources, a dedicated IT hub with 18 computer terminals for research, free wi-fi, and a bespoke children’s library. The leisure centre has also won a number of awards, including the Tourism and Leisure category of the RICS North East\n2016 Awards. The new Ashington Leisure Centre has won a prestigious RIBA North East Award at last week’s 2016 Awards ceremony.\n● There is further investment in improving our leisure centres across the county.\nState-of-the-art facilities are coming to Cramlington, Blyth, Prudhoe, Berwick and Ponteland, helping to regenerate areas, improve health and wellbeing and placed at the heart of local communities. This includes:\n○ £3.1 million in Concordia Leisure Centre to provide state-of-the-art climbing facilities; including the north east’s only Clip 'n Climb climbing wall. The refurbishment includes a refurbished gym, a dedicated spinning studio, a new fitness studio, a revamped café and the relocation of Cramlington Library into the centre. There is also a new ten lane tenpin bowling facility improved party rooms, dry changing with the sauna converted into a new spa. The work was completed in July 2016.\n○ The Swan Centre in Berwick is to undergo a £3.5m transformation to modernise the look and feel of the centre and also address a gap in sports and leisure provision for children and young people in\nBerwick. A range of new facilities is now under consideration in consultation with local people and centre users and could include 10 pin bowling and a clip n’ climb facility as well as an upgrade for the pool changing village and lighting.\n● An exciting refurbishment is now underway to bring a state of the art gym and fitness studio to Prudhoe Waterworld.\n● An immediate response service combining social and healthcare staff in\nNorthumberland is providing multi-disciplinary support to enable people with a sudden illness, medical condition or change in circumstance, who are at risk of hospital admission, to remain at home safely.\n● We were identified as working at “silver” level in the Local Government\nAssociation/ADASS standards for person-centred safeguarding. This covers:\n○ Information packs for service users and carers explaining person centred outcomes\n○ The Josephine project - using a life size, anatomically correct cloth woman to support women with learning disabilities to explore a range of health and sexual health issues with a particular focus on ensuring women with learning disabilities are able to ‘keep themselves safe’.\n○ Arrangements for engaging young people in adult safeguarding processes.\n● Newbiggin sports and community centre is to become a vibrant new hub for local people and a one-stop shop for many council services. As well as sports and leisure, the centre will become home to library services and a range of other council services, including the Men with Sheds project, and a key facility for local groups to use.\n● A £500,000 project funded by the council will see the development of Druridge\nBay Community Centre in Hadston. Proposed developments include a\n2-storey extension of the community centre to provide a fitness suite on the ground floor and a new space and ring upstairs for the boxing club. The new gym will be equipped with the latest state-of-the-art fitness equipment and an instructor will be employed to provide advice and guidance on health and fitness training programmes. Phase two will the former school site and will feature fitness and play facilities.\n● Morpeth Road Primary, in Blyth is creating a £45,000 BMX track for the following an investment by Active Northumberland and the Council.\n● We are continuing to protect our libraries and co-locating them with other services where possible. With an annual running cost of £3.9 million our libraries attract over one million users and all our libraries now provide Wi-Fi access.\n● Every year the Summer Reading Challenge encourages children to read six or more books of their choice during the holidays, with incentives and rewards up for grabs, plus a certificate and medal for every child who completes the challenge.\nCllr Scott Dickinson Vice Chair of Northumberland's Health and Wellbeing Board out meeting frontline NHS staff and experiencing frontline services for the day.\n● A Risk and Independence Team has been launched to offer personalised support for adults with complex support needs with a focus on finding more personalised, community-based solutions.\n● Across the county one stop shops are being created to protect frontline services and to keep services local whilst making it easier for residents to access council services under one roof. To date Ashington library has moved into the leisure centre, the library and customer information centre in Cramlington have moved into the refurbished Concordia Leisure Centre and Ponteland library will be moving into the leisure centre later in 2016. At Hexham the council and Active Northumberland are working with Queen’s\nHall Arts to develop a cultural hub for the town which will include an integrated\ntourist information and library services, alongside arts provision. Library and customer services in Morpeth have a new temporary home in the recently refurbished Royal Sovereign House in Manchester Street, providing a\none-stop shop for customers. In Berwick the library, registration, tourism and customer services are now housed in the newly refurbished Walkergate building in Berwick, providing a one-stop shop for customers, along with the adult learning service.\n● Working with Northumbria Healthcare NHS Trust we have been chosen to take a national lead on transforming care for patients. Building on our already successful work to integrate health and social care in one of the most rural counties in England, the Vanguard project will deliver an integrated primary and acute care system for the county, leading the way nationally. It will further enhance the provision of local services, empowering local communities to live longer and healthier lives at home, with an increased focus on prevention.\n● We introduced ‘Hospital to Home’ at Wansbeck and Hexham Hospitals, offering a two hour response to help people stay in the community rather than going to hospital. We really care, protect and develop our young people. Our fostering service and all our children’s homes are judged by Ofsted as being good or outstanding. A social media campaign identified over 300 people who were interested in fostering or adopting.\n● A combined Northumberland Carers’ Guide and Wellbeing Check has been developed for use by all health and social care practitioners to help carers think about their needs and how to meet them.\n● We’ve invested £1.5 million building three new children’s homes and improving our existing Kyloe House facility.\n● Our performance in placing children who are five and over is almost twice that of the national average and the number of children in care in the county continues to be low.\n● We have delivered over 83,000 concessionary travel passes, providing 2.5 million free public transport journeys to older people and other eligible residents.\n● An innovative Northumberland project, the Haltwhistle Integrated Care Facility, which integrates health, housing and social care, was named Inspirational Project of the Year at the Chartered Institute of Housing’s Celebrating the Region Awards, in 2015.\n● The council’s adoption service and children’s safeguarding board were praised by government inspectors. Following an intensive four-week inspection, Ofsted have rated as “good” the council’s performance around adoption, as well as the effectiveness of the Local Safeguarding Children Board, which oversees some of the most vulnerable young people in the community.\n● Northumberland County Council’s Youth Offending Service (YOS) has been praised in a recent inspection by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation (HMIP). The report, which was published on 6th July, praised the service and described work being carried out with children and young people as exceptional.\n● In January 2016, fire services in Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, Durham and Darlington and Cleveland joined forces with NEAS to respond to patients with emergency life threatening symptoms. During the six month Emergency Medical Response trial, fire crews have attended a total of 2,904 patients across the patch as a result of 999 calls, of which 136 were in Northumberland, 395 were in Tyne and Wear, 1,811 were in Durham and Darlington and 562 were in Cleveland. The trial has been so successful it will continue up to February 2017.\n● In February 2016 NCC helped support the publications of a ‘Happiness Issue’ magazine to help Northumberland residents aged 50-plus to beat the blues. The new edition of the ‘Golden Guide’, a free magazine for the over-50s, features a special 16-page supplement on happiness, taking a light-hearted look at the subject, but with a very practical message. The Guide is packed with local information on topics including leisure, health, money and care, and new listings include activities from amateur radio to orienteering, and allotments to orchestras.\n● Northumberland held its first ever Ageing Well conference in February 2016;\nto celebrate the positive contribution older people make to their community. It featured a range of speakers and workshops, the extra smile awards, a marketplace showcasing information from organisations and charities and\nwas open to older people and professionals who work with them.\n● During a visit to the county in March 2016 the chief executive of Public Health England, Duncan Selbie, described Northumberland County Council’s approach to public health as ‘exceptional’. He visited Northumberland County Council to find out more about the public health work that is going on locally and to share best practice from other areas.\n● Northumberland communities are benefitting from a new and improved community transport scheme from April 2016. Northumberland County Council supported the Getabout voluntary car scheme for the last six years – a service that provides door-to-door transport for people with mobility problems or without access to public transport. To ensure the best possible\nservice for the future, and responding to calls to help more people and expand the service more widely across Northumberland, the council awarded Adapt North East to provide the scheme.\n● A new day service for people with dementia was officially opened in March\n2016. Essendene Day Service which moved into the previous day centre space connected to Tynedale House, Cowpen, Blyth is open seven days a week. It is a residential and respite service which is better suited to support the dementia day service than the previous site at Foundry House, Bedlington. The building was refurbished to a high standard, with many of the facilities better than the previous site.\n● In April 2016 the county council and its partners in health, tourism, and transport launched an ambitious new strategy to increase cycling and walking in Northumberland. The plan aims to embed a new sustainable travel culture in Northumberland by 2025, and encourage 90% of residents to make at least one journey a week on foot or on a bike. Currently only 13% of journeys in Northumberland under 5km are made on foot or on two wheels.",

In so many areas things are coming home to roost; industrial unrest like we’ve not seen in generations, hospital waiting times and lists out of control, more and more people relying on foodbanks, people not feeling safe on the streets, a cost of living crisis, a lack of clean, green affordable housing and now schools and public buildings that aren’t fit for purpose.\n“Make no mistake about it, these are political choices.

His own government has said no cash will come the North East’s way until a devolution deal is signed covering both sides of the Tyne.\n“The leader says he doesn’t want to be forced into a deal on the promise of funding but my guess is the average person in the street wants this badly we need investment in our area.

Coun Scott Dickinson with one of the hens.\n'Picture by Jane Coltman\nThe first coops have been set up at The Alnwick Garden and Briardale Community Centre in Blyth in response to requests for more activities of interest for both older men and women. The idea behind the project is that hens are sociable creatures with which people can enjoy interacting.\nThey reduce stress levels, are harmless and can help people tap into early memories, especially those suffering from dementia. Over recent weeks, residents have been busy feeding and cleaning the hens and collecting their freshly-laid eggs.\nThe project is part of the Ageing Well programme, which is funded by Northumberland County Council and aims to help ensure people stay active, connected and well as they grow older. Although the project seems light-hearted and quirky, it has a serious purpose.\nA 12-month study by Northumbria University in 2012/13 found that looking after hens improves the health and wellbeing of older people, reducing depression, loneliness and the need for antipsychotic medication in care homes.\nAt The Alnwick Garden, the six hens have been named and Delila, Cilla, Mildred, Herb, Henrietta and Chucky are already proving very popular especially with members of Blooming Well, a gardening group for people living with memory loss. Other elderly visitors to the garden and children with disabilities are also playing their part in the care of the hens.\nCoun Scott Dickinson, vice chairman of the health and wellbeing board at Northumberland County Council, said: “It’s really important for older people to keep busy and, if they are able, to learn new skills and enjoy new experiences. “Those involved in the project are not just interacting with the hens, but with each other, sharing their experiences and making new friendships.”\nFor more information about the Ageing Well programme, visit http://tinyurl.com/p2hw2gr",

Scott, Local Councillor and Director at Hadston House said: \"It is always a privilege to represent my community, but taking funds they worked hard to raise over to something so special was just great. I knew of Little Miracles following the use of the service by some local parents, apart from that I didn't know much. \"After today that has totally changed, spending some time with the families and playing with some of the children made me realise how special this place is. I will ensure that Hadston House and our community continue to support this service as much as we can.\" Hadston House project officer Rose said: \"it was a very special visit and something we were very proud of, the community came together to raise that money and it will be enjoyed by many.\" Susan Dickinson Community Nursery Nurse with Northumbria Healthcare said: \"Thank you so much for visiting our group today, our parents really appreciate it when outside professionals take an interest in their children and the daily struggles they face, everyday life for the children and their families can and is for a number of them very challenging and stressful.

Our group offers practical support which meets the individual needs of each child and their family. The group supports parents/cares in promoting their child’s overall development. The group aims to build confidence and encourages socialisation for both parent and child. Many of the children who attend our group have severe complex health needs and life limiting conditions and many of the families who attend it is an important part of their social network. Our group has no designated funding, trips and outings for the families are funded by donations and fundraising events. The Little Miracles Ashington has their own private website where parents support each other and gather relevant information on a daily basis.

Supported by the Parish Council we worked over a number of months to hold workshops and events for members of the community to participate. The final consultation took place in March and the plans published. This happened over an 18month period and thank you again to all the members of the community who took time to participate. This was proposed to create a community space on the area that was formally Druridge Bay Middle School that the Libdem/Tory administration pulled down. It was trying to fulfil a promise made by them during public meetings to ensure the space had something for the community once the School had gone. They didn't provided anything so we were attempting to put that right for the community. Play facilities for a community that has grown and has lack of facilities for play have always been identified by the community as need. The community became rightly excited, youth clubs and others became involved and passionately participated to make sure young people's views were heard. Now we have a Tory administration deciding on the future of the park. Work has stopped and nothing seems to be progressing anywhere in the County apart from Ponteland. The timescales previously announced will obviously not now be met. What happens next nobody knows......I will of course continue to fight for the best deal for the communities I represent. I will keep you all posted.",

Of course our business leaders will say if you work hard you get rewarded but that’s just not what’s happening in our country. In fact, it was a former Tory leader, David Cameron, who echoed the words you can tell how civilised a country is by how it treats its most vulnerable people. So, in 2019 one of the richest countries in the world has levels of poverty not seen since the Victorian era with children bearing the brunt of it. The price of poverty is also poor mental and physical health with early deaths on the rise. In the North East, the rate of poverty has risen to 25 per cent. Just think of that, one in four people living in this area does not have enough money to provide even their most basic needs. Waiting five weeks while your Universal Credit come through leads people to rely on food banks and no doubt drives some to suicide. It’s a national scandal. Even though a number of independent national and international reports bear these dismal facts out, our government is in complete denial. While they’re busy fiddling while Rome burns with their party is disarray, another child will go to bed hungry tonight, another parent will have to decide between heating and eating. While they’re busy telling us that the number of people in work has gone up, they’re not telling us about the nature of those jobs; low paid work with poor working conditions. While they’re busy throwing any scandal they can lay their hands on at the opposition in an effort to make it unelectable, they’re glossing over their own complete contempt for the people they are supposed to be serving. Just to remind them, their job is to serve everyone who lives in our country, not just their already privileged friends. Here in Northumberland we’ve seen so many cruel and heartless cuts by the Tory-run council that you can’t help but believe that they’re no better than their national counterparts. Yes, and while people are down why not kick them even further by removing council tax subsidies and increasing care charges. Here’s what you can believe. Plunging people into poverty is a political choice. There is enough money in this county and country to provide everyone with a decent standard of living. We will never reverse the scandal of poverty with the current government. Where you put your cross on the ballot paper matters.",

Instead, they had their heads in the sand and ignored warnings and advice about the growing issues, only now looking at emergency measures to get the country moving again.\nNorthumberland Labour lead Scott Dickinson said: “Whatever your view about Brexit, the fact is we were always going to be short of people like lorry drivers, hospitality staff and fruit and veg pickers. The pandemic may have masked this but Brexit is the major cause.\n“Even before the pandemic the situation with lorry drivers was serious but Brexit has made this 100 times worse. The best the government can come up with is asking lorry drivers to work longer hours. In what world would this ever be common sense or safe? We’re urging the government to add job roles like this to the shortage occupation list.\n“Employers and trade unions need to work together to see how this crisis, which the government was warned about, can be addressed.\n“Nhs staff, lorry driving, hospitality and fruit and veg picking need to be held in higher regard than they are now; they need to appeal to local people. These are vital jobs to keep the country safe and fed.”",

Research from the TUC finds that the average UK household is £750 worse off than we would be had disposable incomes grown in line with similar economies. The average G7 economy saw disposable income grow at 3.5% since 2019, while in the UK it has contracted by 1.9%. Had we grown at the same rate as the G7 families across Northumberland would be a combined £109,950 better off.\nThe first mission of a new Labour government will be to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7 – with good jobs and productivity growth in every part of the country making everyone, not just a few, better off.\nPublishing the analysis, Labour Leader Scott Dickinson said,\n“The Conservatives have utterly failed to get Britain moving. Last year saw stagnant growth – in spite of the Prime Minister’s promise to get the country going again, the Tories crashed the British economy in 2022 – leaving working people to pay the price – and since 2019 household disposable income hasn’t just failed to grow – it’s got smaller. Meanwhile, our competitors have sped ahead.\n“It doesn’t have to be this way – and as we begin 2024 it is time for change. Families in Northumberland can’t afford five more years of the Conservatives. Labour has a plan to get Britain building again. We will make growth the central mission of the next Labour government – ensuring that there are good jobs and higher productivity in every part of the country making everyone better off.”",

These behaviours are not currently as widely understood or discussed in the public sphere as physically violent relationships.\nThe film highlights the dangers of emotional abuse in teenage relationships. Too many young people are coerced into controlling relationships by their partners, who use their power to emotionally control every aspect of their lives. Stories like 50 Shades of Grey and Twilight confuse uncontrollable passion and love with emotional coerciveness and control, embedding an unhealthy picture of relationships into our culture.\nFor this to change, NDAS want young people to recognise it.\nEmotional abuse is name-calling, isolating from friends and family, emotional mind games and threatening behaviour or language.\nMaggie Martin, Children’s Service Coordinator for NDAS, explains;“Young people are especially vulnerable, we hope this film will raise awareness of the issue and get young people thinking about their own situation, or that of those around them.”.\nThe film was produced by RAW Productions as part of their charity initiative. Ryan Wilkins, CEO, said, “We chose to make this film to change the way people see and understand domestic abuse. Many people believe domestic abuse is physical abuse, and that’s just not the case.”.\nThe will be film is being launched on Valentine’s Day and its is free to share across Northumberland and further afield as long as you could highlight NDAS work in developing the video\nBack ground information\nIn 2015 a Northumberland planning group was formed in response to the North East Violence against Women and Girls Strategy to develop lessons based on raising awareness of Domestic Abuse, Child Sexual Exploitation, Rape and Consent. The planning group consisted of Northumberland County Council Health & Well-Being Team, Northumbria Police, Northumberland Domestic Abuse Service (NDAS), Northumbria Health Trust and focused on strengthening learning for year 11 students. Dame Vera Baird spoke at the initial teacher training event funded by the Northumberland County Council Health & Wellbeing Team supported by Northumbria Police, NDAS, Northumberland Adolescent Services Health Participation Group, Open Clasp Theatre Company, BAIT Arts Programme and R.E.A.C.H. Our partnership won the Northumbria Health Partnership Award 2016 for this work.\nA sexual exploitation drama project for year 9 students has developed from this work, this has become possible through funding from The Arts Council, Grants for the Arts Award Scheme. NDAS, Open Clasp, West End Women and Girls (DV Peer Supporters) and the Northumberland Planning team will work together with young people to develop the drama performed at the event, create peer educator workshops and training which will follow each performance. The performances are to be delivered in every high school and a range of community venues in Northumberland. A total of 37 performances and workshops will take place to ensure an equal chance for wider community to access the drama and workshops. The project will be evaluated throughout the whole process from the planning and development stages to delivery to audiences. The film will be used to highlight this project.\nMore about the film\nIn order to have a broad reach, the film focused on the general issue rather than the specifics of the work that NDAS carries out. To suit social platforms, the film is short and no more than 90 seconds long with an attention grabbing opening, a complex emotional journey and a hard-hitting ending. .\nOur main objectives for the drama and film are to:\n• Open up the conversation about psychologically damaging relationships\n• Speak to young audiences by focussing on your young person’s service, in schools or youth/community settings\n• Highlight the difficulties of living in a remote area\n• Prevent young people engaging in unhealthy relationships/sexual exploitation.\nThis can be used to provide basic awareness or to initiate discussion with young people about domestic abuse and abusive relationships.",

It is disturbing to read in research released in a new report for Carer's Week called Breaks or Breakdown that fewer than one on five carers are confident that the support they receive with caring with continue after the pandemic.”\nNearly three quarters of carers have had no break at all and, of those who got a break, a third used the time to do practical tasks and housework and to go to their own medical appointments.\nThree quarters of carers reported that they were exhausted and more than third said they feel unable to manage an unpaid caring role.\nScott added: “The charities who are supporting Carer's Week* are calling on the government to provide £1.2bn funding for unpaid carers' breaks, so those proving upwards of 50 hours of unpaid care can take time off for their own health and wellbeing.\n“We agree with this. We also call on the government to reform social care as it clearly isn't working for individuals, families and carers.\n“It is often said that you can tell how good a society is by how it looks after its most frail people. It's clear to Labour that the current government is letting individuals, families and carers down.\n“There are hundreds of carers across our county whose efforts go unnoticed and unrecognised, but without whom their sick, frail or disabled relatives or friends would have no one to care for them.\n“It is taking its toll and this needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.”\nFind out more at https://www.carersweek.org\nRead the report Breaks or Breakdown at https://www.carersweek.org/media/u4jby32a/carers-week-2021-research-report.pdf\n* The six charities supporting Carers' Week are:\n• Carers UK\n• Age UK\n• Carers Trust\n• Motor Neurone Disease Association\n• Oxfam GB\n• Rethink Mental Illness",

The Northumberland Core Strategy which was worked on for nearly a decade by cross party groups and officers gave a clear plan until 2031. He’s now making reference to 2016 - 2026 inclusive. Therefore the calculations show little change for data over a 5yr shorter period. Why wasn’t a major modification as advocated and proposed by the Labour Group not made following the release of these figures rather than leave communities naked and vulnerable. This doesn’t show they were right to withdraw the document at all, it merely reaffirms that it was wrong to remove the document, wrong to leave Northumberland vulnerable and a lie to suggest that housing number modifications couldn’t have been done using a modification process to the plan.\nIf all the Tories wanted to change was the housing figures opportunities exist to do that, there always has been, if it’s about land then I’m sure lots of declarations of interest will need to be made.\nIt just demonstrates the failings of the Tory Leadership to understand the processes before jumping in with size 10s. We’ve seen the damming letters from the Inspectorate we’ve already seen refusals overturned with reasons relating to the withdrawal of the Strategy and this stance is simply confirmation that the mess they created is set to continue for some time yet. All they’ve done is allow thousands of homes to be approved while they dither and try to con voters to believe they are somehow delivering on promises.\nThose rammed through plus the planned numbers will now probably far exceed what the projected figures were in the first place and with a number of years until another plan is submitted goodness knows what will happen.\nWe are seeing places like Amble saturated with no protections and a Council left powerless, a Council at the same time cancelling all the infrastructure planned like school, Queen Street car parking halted etc....we also see New Hartley being overrun with housing that was turned down too with appeals firmly and squarely naming the removal of a governing document as a reason for approval.

If staff are safe, then the public we serve will be safe.\n“This is definitely a case where first is not best; there will be no prizes for rushing to be the first local authority to reopen services and facilities if they need to be closed again because of a re-emergence of the virus.\n“In our view, the operational managers are best placed to know what will work in their area, so we’re urging the council to work closely with them and only ask them to do things that they would be prepared to do themselves.\n“We have heard over and over again that we’re all in this together. If we were in all this together at the lockdown, then we should make sure we are all in this together as we reopen facilities.\n“I’m sure the public wants to know that the arrangements are in place to protect them and to protect the staff who work there. That way, everyone stays safe and that’s the important thing.”\nThe council closed almost all of its facilities as the lockdown began, although it has continued to operate key services such as bin collections.\nThe first public facilities to reopen – with new restrictions in place – were the county’s 12 household waste recovery centres on Monday, May 4.\nThe authority waited a week-and-a-half after some of the lockdown measures were relaxed before reopening some of its coastal and visitor car parks – on Friday, May 22 – although those in the likes of Bamburgh, Craster, Holy Island, Rothbury and Seahouses have remained shut.\nA spokeswoman from Northumberland County Council said: “Our overriding priority is the health and safety of our own staff and that of members of the community in Northumberland.\n“At all times, we are following the latest guidance and against this considering very carefully which services are required at this time, and which can be operated safely.\n“We are keeping this continually under review, working very closely with service teams and operational managers.\n“Covid-19 has changed the way that we can provide some of our services and we are actively looking at how we can adapt to ensure that we can deliver them safely, both now and in the future.”",

He is saying it should be sped up by three months.\n“We think it should be sped up by a lot more than that, we want the core plan reinstated as quickly as practically possible.”\nMr Javid said: “Whilst most councils rightly recognise their responsibilities and most have worked hard to meet the housing challenge, some have failed.\n“I expect those authorities we identified in November to continue to make progress.”",

This comes just a year after the Conservatives crashed the British economy.\nThe Household Support Fund is an £842m fund to help families with food and energy costs. Incredibly, as the cost of living crisis deepens, drivenin no small part by the largest tax burden in 70 years, the Chancellor has abolished the fund – cutting\n£4,960,660.00 in support for households in Northumberland\nLabour’s letter to the Chancellor is reproduced in full below\nDear Jeremy,\nUnder the Conservatives families in Northumberland have faced 13 years of stagnation, low growth, falling wages, rising taxes and crumbling public services. Last year, your party recklessly crashed the British economy, setting off run-away inflation and hammering working families further. The cost of living crisis you have delivered is hurting each and every one one of us.\nYour Autumn Statement was an opportunity to fix the mess you have created. Labour has set out a plan to deliver the growth this country needs – it is a real shame you failed to take it up.\nNow, to add insult to injury, it has emerged that you not only failed to offer the support struggling families need – in secret you are taking it away. The household support fund provides much needed assistance to those who need a little help to make ends meet through the cost of living crisis your party helped create.\nTaking that support away is an attack on hard working families in Northumberland who are doing everything they can to get their families through the worst parliament for living standards in history.\nThe Conservatives have utterly wrecked the British economy – and you are asking families in Northumberland to pay the price.\nNorthumberland needs an end to the unthinking incompetence. After 13 years of failure we badly need a plan for growth.\nI look forward to your response – and your plan to properly support families in Northumberland through the Conservative cost of living crisis.\nBest wishes\nScott Dickinson\nNotes to Editors\nThe Housing Support Fund was created to help the most vulnerable households across England with essential food and energy costs.\nFollowing the Autumn Statement it has emerged that the Government will be ending the scheme",

They’ve met in good faith, prioritised and allocated their own budgets, only to discover that the county council has moved the goalposts and decided to reduce the frequency of hedge cutting, grass edging and shrub maintenance to contribute to the £4m of cuts they are proposing to make to local services.\nThere’s also a question over Christmas lights and what support the county council will be able to give to parish and town councils to put up lights and stage the switch-ons, which so many of our residents look forward to.\nThe county council appears to have little regard for our parish and town councils which work hard to maintain and improve their local areas. Our parish and town councils meet and plan for the future but it seems the county council, not content with coming in at the eleventh hour, waltz in after midnight and say they’ve changed their plans. This is not how we should be doing business in Northumberland.\nAt the very least the county council needs to delay these proposed changes to give our parish and town council a chance to respond, and open up a proper and respectful dialogue with them.

One way or the other our high streets are not what they used to be. The answer to that is our shopping habits are not what they used to be.\nWhether you think supermarkets were the greatest invention because you could get what you needed in one place, out of town shopping centres gave you all the big brands under one roof and on line means you can shop without leaving your armchair, we’ve all got to take responsibility for what’s happened to our high street.\nIt’s that way because we’ve made it that way. And we can’t have our cake and eat it.\nSo, what to do? A recent report in our county’s high streets by retail expert Bill Grimsby said we all needed to be thinking – NOW – about what to do when the big brands pull out of the high street. It’s no good waiting ‘til they’ve gone as can already be seen in some of our towns.\nIt’s clear to see that towns with tourism like Morpeth, Hexham and Alnwick do a bit better than towns without. I’m not saying it’s easy but they can attract visitors with independent shops and cafes. But what about towns like Ashington, Blyth, Bedlington and Prudhoe? Somehow they’ve got to make their high streets attractive to the people who live there.\nIn the last few weeks alone, we have seen a meddled with Bedlington plan pause. We are told it will be back on track soon. This is a typical picture of the Tory administration pausing, costing a fortune to meddle in projects and plans that would be revitalising to towns.\nPart of Bill Grimsby’s advice was to use old buildings for business start-ups and make old shops into community spaces for art, leisure and entertainment; basically find ways to bring people into the high street for reasons other than shopping.\nI support this view. The Council, who are major property owners and can support this type of thing, should indeed be bringing it forward. With the soon to be extinct enterprise and start up grants from the EU someone else, the council needs to step up to the mark.\nLet’s look at Ashington, one of the biggest towns in Northumberland, totally abandoned regeneration initiative as part of the Market Town Initiative set up by the Council previously. It was driven by nothing other than political spite and disrespect for the people of that town.\nFor example, in Hexham the Labour-led council invested more than £2m to open a new bus station to provide a welcoming facility for residents and visitors. Hexham also has a new wedding venue, Hexham House which were run down Council offices. In addition to weddings it now has holiday accommodation and the town also has a new fire station.\nThis is why I just can’t understand why our Tory council has scrapped the Market Town Initiative we introduced a couple of years ago. The initiative was a way of getting everyone’s heads together and thinking of how we could breathe new life into our high streets. Working with communities, town and parish councils, business clubs and others, the Labour administration plans ensured Northumberland towns would buck the trend.\nFrom 2010 to 2020, the council was told it needed to make savings of £200m. It took some unpopular decisions like putting leisure centres, libraries and tourist information centres together. But do you know what – this meant longer opening hours for all of these services. It also meant we could keep these services open for people to use, something many councils didn’t manage to do. You don’t have to look very far back to remember libraries and leisure centres closing down all over the country.\nThe Market Town Initiative gave the council a way of really understanding what was going on in each of the towns in our county and finding ways to work with businesses and local people to see how they could be revitalised.\nSo what a backward step it was to drop it, a forward step would be to realise the mistake and get on with the job. The Labour-led council was trying to bite the bullet. Our Tory friends just seem to have their heads in the sand. This is so disrespectful of people living in our towns who need the council’s leadership and support to make their towns lively and vibrant.",

Instead they’re too busy making life unbearable for the officers whose teams carry the work out. It’s an absolute shambles.\n“With an election in 2024 we can only promise to respect and serve the people of this county. However we’ll be judged our track record of delivery in holding the council to account. Personally I pledge to ensure that a Labour-led council devotes itself to the people of this county.\n“The council has done nothing new; not a single affordable home built. A council that puts local people first is critical and essential in these dreadful times. The Conservatives have done nothing but continue Labour investment and have glorified themselves in projects come to fruition during the six years they gained control of the county council. While doing that they have not delivered on essential basics or the much needed support for the most vulnerable.\n“We believe in putting local people first and providing better and properly funded schools. Improved roads and building stronger communities.\n“On being elected leader of Northumberland Labour the opposition last year I was immensely proud and will stand to convince Northumbrians that under my leadership none of the dreadfully embarrassing County Hall actions will happen. All I can do at this stage is promise that.\n“Locals who know me and elect me know I deliver on my promises. So at the next local elections I hope people will vote Labour for my colleagues so we can deliver the change we need.\n“Housing, schools, social care and more all need urgent local reform for Northumbrians. We can’t have the same old same old which is all the Conservatives offer.”",

Years of Tory Government and Tory Council Control in Northumberland have been a perfect storm.\n“For more than a decade this government has singularly failed the people it’s supposed to be serving. In the last general election, the Tories won many seats in old Labour heartlands with the promise of levelling up and responding to the needs of those who put their faith in them at the ballot box.\n“Instead what we have seen is no less than a catastrophe; suppressing wages to the extent that there has now been massive industrial unrest and a government which refuses, until the very last moment, to even get around a table with trade unions asking for decent rates of pay, prime ministers who fly in for a short period and destabilise the economy by claiming to make the rich richer will trickle down to ordinary people. It’s never worked, it doesn’t work and it will never work. It’s not rocket science, but rather a total disregard for the people of this country.\n“While the government is trying out its various experiments on the British people it’s the people in our county who suffer. This has got to change and it will under a Labour government committed to serving people in the way that an effective and responsible government should.”",

Clearly with this Tory administration we are moving back in time to where only major Towns are cared about or invested in.”\nIn a recent meeting the new Leader said the project hadn’t reached business case stage and therefore couldn’t be approved. The former Labour administration pointed out that email correspondence had a business case being ordered by the then Chief Executive back in March 2016 so it should have been easily ready by now to provide to Cabinet in support of the Cabinet advisory Groups recommendations.\nCouncillor Susan Davey Labours Chair of the advisory Group at the time said \"After the many years of discussion to ensure we made the right improvements to help Amble's young people I'm pleased we have decided to advise the Cabinet that the necessary works have our blessing and we see this investment as beneficial for young people in a very deprived part of the rural coalfield\".\nThe School had been asked to complete the educational brief back in July of 2016 which is the document required to aid in the internal planning.\nDocuments are also available for viewing that show the Architect was appointed and all other wheels in motion. So it is utter nonsense to suggest it wasn’t ready for approval at this stage.\nTerry Clark the local Labour member in Amble said \"I see that the Tories are once again ignoring Amble whilst pushing ahead with pouring money into new schools in Ponteland. Its noticeable the the new schools there, sitting in the Tory Leaders ward, will have many millions poured in to support some the wealthiest kids in Northumberland, yet some of the Counties poorest young people from Amble are to be denied similar levels of investment as to the Tories, Amble's children just don't matter.\"",

Many people are feeling much worse off; food banks have become the norm in one of the richest countries in the world, hospital waiting lists are at an all-time high, and water companies can pay their executives millions while they get away with polluting our rivers and seas, there aren’t enough police to deal with crime and make people feel safe on the streets and the costs of living are making life a challenge for many people.\n“This is not a legacy to be proud of; it’s a legacy to be ashamed of. Make no mistake about it, this is the result of political choices. The political choices made by this government have let down the people they were elected to serve.\n“The role of government is to take care of people. This government is failing that most basic test, spending more time back-biting and thinking about itself than the people who voted it in. A Labour government will never put itself before the people who elect it.”\nA Labour government will:\nensure the country has the highest sustained growth in the G7 (the group of seven countries representing around half of the world’s economic output);\nshift to preventative healthcare and an NHS fit for the future;\ncut bills and create jobs by transitioning to zero-carbon electricity by 2030;\nmake Britain’s streets safer and lowering violent crime;\nensure every child has the opportunity to reach their potential.",

They say they want people to live longer but not just that, live longer and stay healthy for longer. They also say they want to reduce the gap between our most and least deprived communities. We know that people living in deprived areas of our county can die up to 15 years earlier than those living in affluent areas. This is no different than the picture is nationally and has been a very difficult thing to tackle because it’s not just about what the health service or local authority can provide.\nOne of the aims of the strategy is to tackle some of the wider determinants of health This is all about having a home, being able to afford to heat it, a pleasant environment, leisure facilities, good education, a decent income, access to a car or affordable transport and a job.\nI really welcome this strategy, but I’m not seeing evidence of a council committed to these standards. I would love nothing better than be part of a county where every baby born has the chance of a long, healthy and happy life but when I see young children not having access to pre-school care, children receiving free school meals, people depending on food banks, people feeling suicidal because they haven’t got their Universal Credit, people having to make decisions about whether they heat their homes or feed their families, job losses and the swathe of cuts being imposed in the latest budget round, I’m not filled with confidence that any of the (in their words ‘aspirational’) things can happen.\nI am involved in an organisation which support people of all ages in the Druridge Bay area and, in the wider SE of Northumberland, another organisation which works with young people to get them opportunities for training, work placements and jobs. These things are just small pieces of a bigger jigsaw which improve health and wellbeing in our area.\nIn my view if you’re serious about improving health and wellbeing you have to put your money where your mouth is. I’d like to see clearly set out targets for each of the 10 years of this strategy with money allocated to each area, a bit more detail about how these things are going to be achieved and regular updates to show we’re going in the right direction.\nThere are four themes in the strategy:\ngiving children and young people the best start in life\nempowering people and communities (in other words giving people more control and power to do things which help them live healthier, happier, longer lives)\ntackling some of the wider determinants of health (housing, education, diet, alcohol, employment, income)\nadopting a whole system approach to health and social care (everyone working together to make it better for people who live here. You’d like to think you didn’t need a strategy to tell our local organisations to do this)\nI recommend you read the 10 page document which is available on Northumberland County Council’s website at https://www.northumberland.gov.uk/NorthumberlandCountyCouncil/media/Health-and-social-care/Public%20Health/Northumberland-Joint-Health-and-Wellbeing-Strategy-2018-2028.pdf.\nIf this strategy is successful, then the county will feel different. In fact, it will be different. All of things in the bullet points above will have happened and we’ll see the gap closed between the health and life expectancy of people in our county.\nI will do my best to make this strategy happens because it’s what I think the county needs but the county council needs to put its money where its mouth is and put effort and money into areas such as education and housing if they are to have an impact on the people they serve.",

However, to say this situation is concerning is an understatement.\n“The council has many plans to ensure the voices of children and young people are heard and they pride themselves on their aim of making our county and great play, to live, study, take part in activities and work.

Undoubtedly this is a big issue here in The Berwick Upon Tweed Constituency. Local pharmacies are vital to our community. They offer important services to the elderly, disabled and those with long term illnesses and provide vital to support to over-stretched GP surgeries and hospitals. Last autumn, the Tories announced that they would push ahead with huge cuts to community pharmacy budgets. It was suggested by a Tory Minister last year that these cuts could lead to the closure of up to 3,000 community pharmacies. Labour opposed these cuts. At a time when NHS is at breaking point with A&E waiting times up and GP surgeries struggling to cope, Labour is clear that putting extra strain on our community health services is unacceptable and would let patients down. That’s why Labour has pledged in its manifesto to halt pharmacy cuts and review provision to ensure that all patients have access to pharmacy services, particularly in deprived or remote communities. As your candidate I am grateful for every opportunity to set out my position to you. Ultimately, this General Election is a choice between a Labour Party who will stand up for the many and a Conservative Party which only looks after the privileged few, and I hope you will consider putting your trust in me, and in Labour.

It is a real alternative to the Conservative doom and gloom that they want to force on to Northumberland. Voters now know it doesn't need to be that way.\"\nThe plan includes new leisure centres for Berwick, Ponteland, Blyth and Morpeth, new school projects like James Calvert school that serves Amble and Druridge Bay and in Ponteland and Seaton Delaval.\nThe plan would see council jobs and services spread across the county market towns as they move these from centralised County Hall as part of the Market Towns Initiative and would see the council concentrate on embarking on huge infrastructure projects like the Ashington-Blyth-Tyne line which would see thousands of new jobs created and a huge boost to SE Northumberland’s economy.\nBut Labour will continue to focus on building 1500 more affordable houses to add to over 1000 added to the affordable housing stock from 2013.\nLabour inherited a record housing waiting list in 2013 from a Liberal led coalition with the Conservatives but have reduced it to around 7,500. 1500 new affordable homes would see the list dip below 5,000 for the first time since the 1970’s.\nLabour say in May, there’s a stark choice between a Conservative party which has campaigned to stop projects like free car parking and the move of council jobs and services back to market towns across Northumberland and Northumberland Labour’s plan to invest sensibly in projects which will benefit the whole county.\nThey say Tory plans would ‘halt investment in South East Northumberland putting projects like Bedlington town centre redevelopment in doubt.\nBut Labour are warning that Conservative plans are ‘silent on cost’ and ‘silent on the future of council services’ with policies like scrapping the county development arm Arch likely to cost over 500 jobs and leave the council with a £25m ‘black hole’ in its budget. Conservative silence on services and jobs have raised fears that they’re intent on resurrecting a 2013 plan to privatise services and slash council jobs.\nLabour are also highlighting that Tory plans would see a ‘halt to investment in South East Northumberland in communities like Bedlington, Newbiggin, Cramlington, Blyth and Ashington’.",

Its own guidance on what should be in food parcels is strikingly similar to images circulating on social media in recent days – with less than a 50p daily difference. A couple of tins and a bottle of milk isn't the difference between acceptable or unacceptable.\n\"The government's response has yet again been far too slow, with national food vouchers only becoming available from next week - two weeks after schools moved to remote learning.

In a democracy it’s the voters who are supposed to determine what happens in the country, not the people who donate to the political parties.\n“The whole country would be far better off with a transparent state funded party system which couldn’t be influenced by millionaires who give money in return for influence. It’s undemocratic and unhealthy.\n“In the meantime the Berwick MP should consider her position and get her local association to give the donation back.\n“I shouldn’t think there is anyone who’d support Russian or Russia-related political donations while Russia is being led by such a ruthless aggressor.”",

Apparently the council carried out a survey and people agreed that everyone in the county should pay something towards their council tax. So, the council is planning to recoup £1m from those 12,000 families to help balance its budget.\nTo me this move will cause terror in families already struggling and push many over the edge. Many of the families we are taking about are in extreme poverty, visiting food banks, choosing between heating and eating.\nThe council will spend more money chasing money that simply doesn’t exist in these families.\nIt’s easy for people to sit there thinking some of these people are scroungers with big televisions who haven’t worked a day when actually many are on the breadline, using food banks, working in low paid jobs or made redundant through no fault of their own. We also have people with mental health or other issues that prevent them from lifting themselves out of needing this level of support.\nIn rural Northumberland it costs £7 to get to the job centre and that money has to come out of the tiny amount of support they receive. They can’t claim it back. When the weather is harsh people in fuel poverty have to choose between heating and eating. All this has been lost in the top level argument and nobody appears to be shouting on behalf of these people.\nWhatever happened to support being available when you need it? And why is this £1m cost saving being imposed on the poorest people?\nIt may be stating the obvious, but if you’re talking in your health and wellbeing strategy and how you’re going to close the gap between those who live long, healthy lives and those who don’t, this doesn’t sound like the best way to do it.",

To date none of those people have been invited to a meeting and little information can be found about what’s going on”.\n“The Windfarm is now in place; the communities have been patient during its construction and have dealt with TV signal issues amongst other things and now they should be able to access the funding promised”.\nOver £100,000.00 a year was to be shared between communities surrounding the scheme but yet not a penny has been allocated. That equates to over £1million for the lifetime of the project.\nCouncillor Dickinson is now asking where the money is, how long it will take before groups in the community can apply because it has been some time since the Windfarm became operational which is when the fund should start.\nCouncillor Dickinson added “Rumours are around that the site has been sold or is being managed by someone else, I have had no communication on this from anyone. I have written following questions being raised from members of the public but await a response from Northumberland County Council”.\nNOTES\nLink to Infinis website confirming timescales and numbers HERE\nAn annual fund of £5,000 per MW, index-linked, will be established for the Sisters Wind Farm to provide direct benefits to the local community for the 25 year life fo the wind farm.

In 2017 it was £1,116, but in some years it has been more than £1,200.\nAdding up the annual amount consumers have paid above the 2010 level, the total cost to an average household is £957, figures compiled by the House of Commons library show.\nLabour said this extra cost could have been avoided if the Conservatives had intervened earlier to stop suppliers raising prices.\nThe result was big six profits had continued to thrive, leaving around 2.5m households in fuel poverty, the party said. Labour’s proposed price cap would keep typical bills below £1,000, lower than the £1,050 that some analysts expect the government’s price cap to come in at\n“The next Labour government will radically reform our broken energy market, creating publicly owned, locally accountable energy companies and co-operatives to rival existing private energy suppliers,” Long-Bailey said.\nThe government responded by pointing out that Ofgem had referred the energy market to the competition watchdog four years ago, and had since taken steps to put in place a price cap.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “Energy prices have gone up and down since 2010, driven by external factors including wholesale and network costs, and policies that have led to investment in networks, energy efficiency and low-carbon generation.\n“Freezing energy prices would have meant a lack of important investment in infrastructure and would have damaged businesses when market-driven costs went up.”\nThe analysis assumed that energy use has remained constant when in reality it has been falling over the past seven years due to more efficient products. The real amount consumers have paid due to tariff increases is therefore likely to be lower than £957.\nMinisters took the decision to move ahead with a cap last autumn after a series of price rises by the big six across 2017. The companies blamed the increases on a variety of reasons including rising wholesale prices and government policy costs.\nAnalysts have warned that another round of price rises is imminent. E.ON was criticised last week for announcing a backdoor way of increasing energy bills for a million customers.\nThe legislation underpinning the government’s price cap passed its second reading in the Houses of Commons on Tuesday, and a committee of MPs will take evidence on the draft law from experts next week.\nIf the cap comes into force by the year’s end, as hoped, it will not stop prices going up periodically, but will put a ceiling on the amount suppliers can charge consumers.",

He first became interested when standing for Chair of the School Council and being successful in his first election. He then went on to continue his election winning successes at Parish and County Council Elections.\nScott has worked as an elected representative for the last 4yrs representing Northumberland Locally and Nationally. He is known for his hard work in Health and Social Care Services in Northumberland.\nScott is an all round caring, passionate local politician that would represent Northumberland well in Parliament. He understands the issues faced by hard working families in Northumberland and has been pained watching people suffer locally because of the Tory policies.\nScott had the following to say when he was confirmed at the Candidate today:\n\" I am delighted to be put forward once again to the people of Berwick Upon Tweed Constituency.\"\n\"To represent my home Constituency where I have lived and worked all my life would be an honour.\"\n\" I increased the vote in 2015 with limited resources, putting a positive alternative forward and I will be doing the same again in this short campaign.\"\n\"People cannot continue to suffer under this Tory Government and here with this early election we have an opportunity to rid ourselves of them.\"\nLabour have put forward a 10 point plan that I and local activists will be campaigning on:\n1. FULL EMPLOYMENT We will create a million good quality jobs across our regions and nations, and guarantee a decent job for all. By investing £500 billion in infrastructure and industry, backed up by a publicly-owned National Investment Bank and regional banks, we will build a high skilled, high tech, low carbon economy to ensure that no one and no community is left behind. We will invest in the high speed broadband, energy, transport and homes that our country needs and allow good businesses to thrive, and support a new generation of co-operative enterprises.\n2. A SECURE HOMES GUARANTEE We will build over a million new homes in five years, with at least half a million council homes, through our public investment strategy. We will end insecurity for private renters by introducing rent controls, secure tenancies and a charter of private tenants’ rights, and increase access to affordable home ownership.\n3. SECURITY AT WORK We will give people stronger employment rights from day one in a job, end exploitative zero hours contracts, and create new sectoral collective bargaining rights. We will strengthen working people’s representation at work and the ability of trade unions to organise, so that working people have a real voice at work. And we will put the defence of social and employment rights, as well as action against undercutting of pay and conditions through the exploitation of migrant labour, at the centre of the Brexit negotiations agenda for a new relationship with Europe.\n4. A SECURE NHS AND SOCIAL CARE We will end health service privatisation and bring services into a secure, publicly-provided NHS. We will integrate the NHS and social care for older and disabled people, funding dignity across the board, and ensure parity for mental health services.\n5. A NATIONAL EDUCATION SERVICE We will build a new National Education Service, open to all throughout their lives. We will ensure there is universal childcare to give all children a good start in life, allowing greater sharing of caring responsibilities and removing barriers to women participating in the labour market. We will bring about the progressive restoration of free education for all; and guarantee quality apprenticeships and adult skills training.\n6. ACTION TO SECURE OUR ENVIRONMENT We will act to protect the future of our planet, with social justice at the heart of our environmental policies, and take action to fulfil the Paris climate agreement. We will ensure a fair transition to a low-carbon economy, and drive the expansion of the green industries and jobs of the future, using our National Investment Bank to invest in public and community-owned renewable energy. We will deliver clean energy and curb energy bill rises for households – energy for the 60 million, not the Big Six energy companies. We will defend and extend EU environmental protections.\n7. PUT THE PUBLIC BACK INTO OUR ECONOMY We will rebuild public services and expand democratic participation, put the public back into our economy, give people a real say in their local communities with increased local and regional democracy. We will act to ‘insource’ our public and local council services, increase access to leisure, arts and sports across the country, and expand our publicly controlled bus network. We will bring our railways into public ownership and extend democratic social control over our energy.\n8. CUT INEQUALITY IN INCOME AND WEALTH We will build a progressive tax system so that wealth and the highest earners are fairly taxed, and shrink the gap between the highest and lowest paid. We will act to create a more equal society, boost the incomes of the poorest and close the gender pay gap.\n9. ACTION TO SECURE AN EQUAL SOCIETY We will ensure that the human rights of all citizens are respected and all are protected from discrimination and prejudice. We will take action to tackle violence against women and girls, racism and discrimination on the basis of faith, and secure real equality for LGBT and disabled people. We will defend the Human Rights Act and guarantee full rights for EU citizens living and working in Britain – and not allow them to be used as pawns in Brexit negotiations.\n10. PEACE AND JUSTICE AT THE HEART OF FOREIGN POLICY We will put conflict resolution and human rights at the heart of foreign policy, commit to working through the United Nations, end support for aggressive wars of intervention and back effective action to alleviate the refugee crisis. We will build human rights and social justice into trade policy, honour our international treaty obligations on nuclear disarmament and encourage others to do the same.",

Capital borrowing in the name of Northumbrians will exceed £1 billion.\n“All this is set against a background of secrecy and frittering away public money removing officers from their posts and forcing compromise agreements (‘gagging clauses’) to prevent them from speaking out.\n“Contrast this to the last Labour administration which opened its doors to share information with the opposition and even undertook a peer review by the Tory-led Local Government Association to ensure its dealings were carried out correctly.\n“This budget will make more young people and families have to leave Northumberland and find accommodation in other areas; it’s really not good enough.\n“We will be holding the leaders to account and asking them what they propose improve the lives and opportunities of the people who live in this wonderful county.”",

I appreciate that, even though we are so close to Christmas, people’s plans are having to change and families and friends are facing yet another year of not being able to be with the people they love.\nIn preparing to write this message I’ve looked back over the issues Labour was highlighting; Covid (of course), the economy, business, health and social care, transport, housing, education and the response to Storm Arwen. We believe there is no excuse in a rich country such as our own that you, the voter, should expect :\neffective management of the pandemic (instead of the UK having the dubious pleasure of having one of the highest death rates in the world, not helped by continuous mixed messaging and the appalling behaviour of No 10, government departments and cabinet ministers throwing parties while we were all making huge sacrifices and following the government instructions to the letter);\nproper support for business which enables them to keep going during these uncertain times (instead of contradictory messages leaving many businesses wondering if they can even survive, never mind grow and prosper);\nmore help for people and families when they desperately need it (instead of taking away the £20 uplift in Universal Credit which meant some people were not able to put food on the table or heat their homes;\nproper rewards for health and social care workers (instead of the paltry and insulting pay offer to the NHS and a promise to ‘fix social care’ which means the better off will be, well, better off and as usual those with fewer resources have more to lose);\na decent transport system which supports people in their work and private lives (rather than the ongoing debacle over the Ashington, Blyth and Tyne line started by Labour but hit with endless issues because central government quite clearly do not care about people in our county);\na warm, comfortable and safe home (we’re still waiting for affordable social housing to be built. Not one social home has been built in Northumberland in the life of the Tory-led council);\nan education system fit for our children which support all education staff and the vital work they do (instead of stripping funds out of schools forcing them to cut staff at a time when our children need as much support as they can get);\nan appropriate response to an adverse weather event (instead of lacklustre response which saw some people being without power for two weeks).\nDuring the year I, along with the Labour group members, have listened to people right across the county, no matter how they voted in previous elections. From individuals, families, public sector workers and businesses we’ve heard that people need support, and their contribution to the economy and the life of this county needs to be properly rewarded and acknowledged. We’ve also heard that people need the basic things we should all be able to have; a decent home, a decent education, a decent job.\nThere is light and we have also seen and heard this. The people in our wonderful county have stepped up on many occasions when the government has not. The care and kindness from the community we saw in the response to Storm Arwen was heartwarming. I want the thank everyone who helped in any way.\nWe’ve also seen the emergence and continual development in green technology and we welcome the opportunity to be world leaders in this area because there will be well-paid jobs and we can address climate issues at the same time.\nSince the Hexham East bi-election the Tory-led council, while still the leaders, do not have a majority. I want to thank candidate Jonathan Wheeler and everyone who worked on his campaign.\nNorthumberland Labour will continue to hold this Tory council leadership to account. We will work together where it is in the interests of people living right across the county. We worked hard to get a cross-party consensus to introduce parental and carer leave for councillors, making the role accessible to people with those responsibilities. I thank county councillors for their willingness to leave party politics aside and see the bigger picture, which means that we can all look forward to having councillors who better represent and reflect the population we serve.\nAs we begin another uncertain year, you have my assurance that we continue to listen and we are open to hearing all views. We still have a vision to make Northumberland the best county in the country to live in, and that means for everyone.\nPlease get in touch at nlandlabour@gmail.com if you’d like to be part of that discussion.\nI wish you, your families and friends the happiest Christmas possible and a safe, peaceful and healthy New Year.\nWith my very best wishes\nCouncillor Scott Dickinson\nLeader, Northumberland Labour",

I am grateful that you took the time to write, and I am glad of the opportunity to set out my views to you. The UK should aim to lead the world with high animal welfare standards and so Labour will continue to press for the highest standards in food quality. We will not allow Brexit to be used as an excuse for food standards to be reduced or to allow cheap and inferior produce to flood the UK market. We recognise that as a country we need to change our relationship with food and as such Labour will bring forward new proposals on food labelling as well as bringing forward plans to reduce waste. On farming, we will reconfigure funding to ensure that community benefits and sustainable practices are promoted so that the industry can thrive and succeed whilst benefitting local communities. We will promote cruelty-free animal husbandry and will consult on ways to ensure that agreed standards are better enforced. As your candidate, I am grateful for every opportunity hear what you think and also to set out my views to you. Ultimately, this General Election is a choice between a Labour Party who will stand up for the many and a Conservative Party which only looks after the privileged few, and I hope you will consider putting your trust in me, and in Labour.",

It is also a step towards encouraging existing councillors who may want to start a family or those who find themselves with caring responsibilities to remain as councillors.\n“In reality it’s difficult to understand why the council has not brought this in before now. Bringing equity and equality into councillors’ terms and conditions should have already happened. We need to bring the council out of the Dark Ages.”\nBeccy Wilczek, member for Bedlington East, who is seconding the motion said: “Analysis of the 2019 local election results by the Fawcett Society found that only 35 per cent of councillors in England are women. This makes little sense when over half the population is female. Dozens of councils have brought in policies on parental, adoption and carer leave for councillors. It’s about time we followed suit.\nScott Dickinson added: “On the Labour side of the chamber over 50 per cent of the councillors are women. We already have a range of people of different age and gender.\n“This is in stark contrast to the Tory side which has only four women out of their 34 seats in the chamber. That message, in 2021, says to women, potential parents and people with caring responsibilities that the chamber is not a place for them.\n“In the 21st century our council should be supportive, inclusive and it should reflect the population it serves.\n“We believe if you get this right for councillors who are parents and carers, you get it right for everyone.”",

Quite rightly the public don’t trust people who they can clearly see are working the system in their own interests.\n“We just have to look at the Partygate scandal to see how the public’s trust is cast aside so freely. At a time when people were going through the most difficult time for a generation and making huge sacrifices, it was business as usual for politicians and cvil servants at a national level.\n“Then we look at the goings on in our own county with the chief executive being suspended without good cause and senior officers of the council resigning because they are finding it increasingly difficult to work with the Tory cabinet. The trouble is the public think all politicians are like this, which is simply not true.\n“When the council becomes Labour-led I will be judged on my own performance and behaviour as will other Labour councillors.\n“My pledge is that standards, honesty and high codes of conduct will be maintained.\n“To serve local people is a privilege. If we have to regain the public’s trust lost by the behaviour of our local council and the national government, that’s what we’ll do.”",

These funds will be used to deliver a fully funded Business Support programme which will strengthen our provision of business support services across Northumberland and beyond. This programme will be known as Business Northumberland 2016-19.\n● In March 2016 Northumberland County Council launched a new web tool to help users find career information from the region.

This is what nearly 12 years of Tory rule have given us\n“We’re better than that. People deserve better than that. Northumberland Labour is pleased that we’re setting out these ambitious and positive plans to give everyone the opportunity of a good standard of living. If the will is there, everyone’s life chances can be improved. The will is not there under this government. It can and will change under a Labour government.”",

Do the children of Amble, Hadston, Widdrington and surrounding areas not matter as much as Morpeth and Ponteland?\"\n\"Why plough on with public commitment to some schemes and not others, did the Amble Tory not press his team for the same commitments Ponteland and Morpeth got ?\"\n\"It's a crying shame for the JCSC staff, children and families, it was potentially a once in a lifetime opportunity.\"\n\" I'm also disgusted that the JCSC Leadership team found out by reading the paper.

I remain convinced that the vast majority of people living in Northumberland want a decent home, a decent job, support when they need it and an education which equips them for the world in which we are now living. Residents in Northumberland deserve a thriving, cleaner and greener county to live in.”\nCllr Dickinson is a well-known political figure in the region, having previously represented the Labour Party as a Parliamentary Candidate in several General Elections. Raised in Broomhill, Cllr Dickinson has outlined his commitment to ‘community politics’ and is keen to lead a strong opposition which speaks for every resident in the geographically challenging and diverse county of Northumberland.\n“I will seek consensus whenever possible, but our role in opposition in the council is to hold the elected majority to account when we feel they are not acting in the interests of everyone living in our county.”\n“We want be an effective opposition and work towards securing a majority in the council at the next election which meets the needs of each and every person living in our county.”\nCllr Dickinson has been deputy leader for the last two years working alongside previous group leader Susan Dungworth. He has worked in the charitable sector for 15 years delivering initiatives supported by Children in Need, the Greggs Foundation, and the National Lottery. He has held various roles across the county council from business chair, chair of the health and wellbeing board and a number of other high-profile posts. He has also served on the North of Tyne Combined Authority.\nCllr Liz Simpson, Scott Dickinson’s elected deputy has a degree in business management from Northumbria University and a range of secretarial qualifications. From 1988 she worked at Wansbeck District Council, then she went on to work for Age UK Northumberland for 20 years and became the day services development manager; a role she loved.\nCllr Simpson said: “My role in Age UK took me right across the county. I met some wonderful people along the way and saw first-hand the different issues each community in Northumberland was facing. Having been a member of the Labour Party for many years before being elected to represent Newbiggin, It’s a great honour for me to chosen to support\nCllr Dickinson as his deputy. I know Scott will give a strong voice to all in our county. I will be supporting Scott to form an effective opposition which seeks consensus and agreement where possible, but quite properly holds the council leaders to account where their actions will have a negative effect on our county's residents.”\nENDS\nNotes to Editors\n· More information on Northumberland Labour Group can be found at https://northumberland.laboursites.org/\n· Requests for further comment or information can be requested by contacting the Office of Cllr Scott Dickinson on 07736630404 – Votedickinson@aol.com Twitter - @Scottdickinson0 Facebook Scott Dickinson – Druridge Bay",

He referred back to inadequate investment in infrastructure and that it was usual for parts of Northumberland to be without power for a period following adverse weather.\nScott Dickinson said: “This type of weather is going to become more and more regular, so we need to encourage more investment in the network to enable it to stand up what are going to be more adverse weather events.”\nAs well as visiting a GP practice and local business owners, Sir Keir met people with children and people who may not be able to spend Christmas in their own home. He also met older people without electricity and those who need support. He helped pack hampers for meals on wheels users who are vulnerable and often isolated for Christmas.\nHe heard from the Mayor of Blyth about the issues in the town and the impact on small businesses. Representatives from Ashington raised concerns about issues in the town. Sir Keir also heard about the properties still off in parts of Hexham and how those people, two weeks on, were really struggling.\nScott added: “It was important that our national leader saw for himself how the storm had affected people in our county. He was here to listen and I’m sure he will take back what he has seen to inform discussions on increased planning and resilience at a national level.”",

From September 2017, school funding will be determined by the national funding formula for all schools. Local Authorities will continue to distribute funding for two years and then it will be directly allocated to schools from 2019-20.\nThe f40 group wants more local flexibility for councils to decide how to allocate money to schools in their areas.\nGrant Davey, Leader of Northumberland County Council, said: “Delivering the best possible education is a priority for us and we have been working closely with small schools ahead of the funding formula being issued.\n“Our concern, and the concern of other local authorities, is that the changes impact adversely on the opportunities for young people. Small schools are clearly vulnerable, and face the biggest funding squeeze.\n“Our joint letter to the Prime Minister highlights that >schools in lower-funded areas have reached the limit of where cuts can be made and we cannot understand where more cuts could be made in the lowest-funded authorities.”\nThe government's consultation on the funding formula ends on 22 March.",

Many families are now trapped without Dental Health because of cost to other providers.\nScott has been lobbying for the return of Dental services in Hadston to serve the community and Healthwatch Northumberland are now holding an event in Hadston House to listen to people.\nPlease come along if you can.\nThursday 5 April 2018\n10pm – 1pm\nHadston House\nBondicar Road\nHadston\nNE65 9SR\nIf you can't make the event please get in touch to share your views you can email: Votedickinson@aol.com or drop in a written note to the Hadston House Offices.\nScott who has been liaising with Healthwatch to organise this event said: \"I am pleased Healthwatch Northumberland have taken this matter seriously and are coming to speak to the Community who are affected.\"\n\"I have submitted a range of comments to the Health Scrutiny Committee at Northumberland County Council who took my points forward.\"\n\"It is really important that local people come and share views if they wish to see NHS England re-provide the service.\"\nYou can read the points submitted by Cllr Dickinson below.\nI would note a couple of points:\nWhilst the “consultation” had many errors and numerous patients hadn’t received the information I suppose that is now irrelevant after the immediate cease of operation. Therefore I see no point in raising those issues again other than to simply make the point.\nThe information then sent to patients indicated that “local” practices (Alnwick and Morpeth) had space, I pointed out to NHS England and the Health and Wellbeing Board that this is a £7 round journey obviously more if a family is attending. It also mounts to a 40minute journey each way putting off local people that need to access via expensive infrequent public transport links.\nPatients within my ward were left in mid-treatment with no emergency provision being offered, one resident who is 87 midway through treatment, has an eye condition and cannot travel to the practices indicated are now left. These vulnerable people need a service within our community to access.\nStruggling families in the deprived parts of my ward simply will not be able to afford to attend treatment, both Amble and Widdrington (the closest) indicating no space and not listed on NHS England’s alternative sites. At a time when nationally we are being advised of poor dental hygiene with young people should we really allow people to be put off in this way?\nThe provision had been irregular, unreliable and this was due to a range of issues but resulted in patients not accessing appointments. The demand for a fully operational site is there, a dental practice has operated in Hadston for many years and is sadly missed at present.\nCoquet Medical Group in Hadston recently had over £1million+ refurbishment including the Dental Practice within the centre, this was brilliant for my ward, a real encouragement for local families to access dental services in a fresh pristine environment. We all know poor dental hygiene leads to an entire range of other medical conditions. Will this part of the centre just now stand empty? It would be ideal for a branch operation from a local provider in an environment that is purpose built.\nI am appalled that the community found out after immediate withdrawal, therefore they feel upset and anxious that the consultation responses were wasted time, that the consultation didn’t reach the end and that they are now left. Alternative information was poor and as indicated above remains inappropriate.\nThe Parish Council and others fed in responses to articulate the issues this service has experienced over time, the loyalty shown by patients and the need for services to be delivered within the community.\nWhat are my desired outcomes as the local member?\nProvision is found to deliver at Hadston using the new facilities, whether this is a couple of times a week/month or more to ensure local people have access to dental services.\nThat one of the local practices be approached to offer an outreach service operating from the site.\nThat we are clear as a Council about the way this has been handled and the urgency for a solution to be found and pressure for a procurement of service ASAP.",

There has also been an increase in children in care and families accessing food banks across the County. Direct results of bedroom tax, sanctions and many other government inflicted policy changes. Families who are struggling are rightly seeking additional support. Many of these families are hard working families too.......\nAs an experienced member of the Fostering Panel and other supporting organisations across Northumberland I see first hand the support NCC and third sector organisations are being asked to provide. All as a result of government policy changes.\nReported in the Northumberland Gazette this week:\nhttp://www.northumberlandgazette.co.uk/news/child-poverty-increased-in-northumberland-in-the-past-year-1-8317698",

In all we filled nearly 20 black bin liners with clothes collected at the Trap Inn and Hadston House, the main collection points. Brother and sister Scott and Gemma, together with Scott’s nephew, loaded them up and delivered them to a homeless volunteer centre in Westerhope near Newcastle. People become homeless for many reasons and it’s worrying to know that relationship break up, losing a job and addiction can result in living without the one thing many of us take for granted; a roof over our head. It makes me very proud that people are compassionate and want to help people less fortunate than themselves. Thank you so much.",

So many people have lost the things we should all expect in a modern rich country; a decent house, a decent job, a good education and care when you need it.\n“People are even feeling less safe on the streets. These are all things that, if the will is there, can be addressed. The trouble is this government doesn’t have the will to do this.\n“Labour wants to focus on providing the security, prosperity and respect everyone in this country deserves.”\nLabour has pledged to:\ncreate jobs and apprenticeships so young people have choices and chances where they live\nhelp our high streets thrive, freeze business rates and make, buy and sell more in Britain\nfund 100,000 new start-up businesses to grow our economies and harness ambition\ngive communities the power to make decisions for their area\nCouncillor Scott continued: “Sadly we’ve seen the behaviour of the national government reflected in our local council.

However, on this occasion, Mr Grant, who submitted the letter from a delivery driver’s perspective about a planning application in my ward, was inaccurate. He claimed my residents needed support and I was ‘sitting on the fence’ in relation to a planning application. So, for accurate information for readers, in the way of support for my residents, it goes as follows.\nAn official objection from me was published on the council planning website on September 25.\nIn addition, I have sought extensions for the community and parish council to make comments from the planning officer. On September 11, I held a drop-in session with locals and supported residents who needed it to make comments online. On October 1, I presented to the parish council, and received unanimous support on, my views, which helped it to formulate its own objection.\nIn addition to that, the staff at Hadston House have been supporting residents’ list comments on what can be a tricky system and scanning in handwritten documents – it’s part of the advice and support we offer daily.\nAnyone locally in the community knows only too well that more social homes are needed. However, this can’t be at any cost.\nIn addition to my list of support, a drop-in session was being held by Karbon Homes itself on October 17, where the community could express its views directly to the applicant.\nSo, while he makes valid points in his letter about the application itself, nobody could suggest residents in my community weren’t being supported by me, nor could anyone suggest I was ‘sitting on the fence’.\nI’d like to thank all the residents and the parish council for sharing their views with me as we wade through this as a community together.\nBest wishes\nScott\nCllr Scott Dickinson\nCounty Councillor Druridge Bay",

Since buses were deregulated in 1985, bus services in England’s regions outside London have collapsed, with:\n• 1.5 billion fewer annual bus journeys in 2019 than in 1985\n• Almost 300 million fewer miles driven by buses per year since 2010\n• Thousands of bus services cut since 2010\nLabour’s plans will ensure better value for money for the taxpayer, deliver a better service for passengers and give local authorities a choice over the bus system that works best for them. It will require no additional central government spending.\nWhere bus franchising is in place, in London and Manchester, buses have thrived. Greater Manchester has improved reliability and significantly grown passenger numbers less than a year after bus franchising went live.\nLabour has announced it will pass new legislation to support local transport authorities to take back control of their bus services and has set out a five-point plan to deliver better buses. Labour will:\n1. Empower local transport authorities and reform funding: by giving local leaders more control and flexibility over bus funding and allowing them to plan ahead to deliver their local transport priorities.\n2. Allow every community to take back control of their buses: by removing barriers that currently limit bus franchising powers only to metropolitan mayors.\n3. Accelerate the bus franchising process: by supporting local leaders to deliver better buses, faster.\n4. Step in to safeguard local bus networks: by providing more accountability over bus operators and ensuring standards are raised wherever you live across the country.\n5. Support public ownership: by removing the Conservatives’ ideological ban on publicly owned bus companies and building on the success of award-winning public bus services still in operation.\nNorthumberland Labour Leader Scott Dickinson MBE, said: “After fourteen years of Conservative failure our local bus services have been driven into the ground.\n“Labour will call time on the broken bus system that is holding far too many people in our community back from opportunities.\n“Labour’s plan for better buses and jobs will give every community the power to take back control of their bus services, and will support local leaders to deliver better buses, faster. “And our plan means vital bus services being created and saved across our region.”",

At the last election when Labour promised action the Tories opposed it, putting themselves on the side of protecting the big energy companies’ profits rather the interest of working people. \"Only Labour can be trusted to deliver a country for the many rather than just the few. All the Tories offer is broken promises and a record which has seen working people worse off.”\nScott said: \"working families in Northumberland are on the breadline, worse off under this government. It cannot be right that so many people are accessing food banks. There's a misconception that it's only people out of work accessing them but it's untrue, it's hard working families that need support to feed their families.\"",

And we know good public transport is essential to get people out of their cars. What we have at the moment just isn’t good enough to persuade any car owner to choose public transport.\n“We want to expand the rail network and make sure it integrates into other forms of transport.\n“We’ve just seen plans for rail network expansion in the North scrapped and Network Rail’s improvement fund has been cut by £1bn.\n“These actions hardly seem like a government serious about levelling up. It’s just empty words.\n“Labour believes the whole transport network needs to be transformed to make it safe, convenient, affordable and environmentally sustainable.\n“This can be done but it will take sitting down with people and finding ways to spend money wisely to create a system fit for the future.”",

The formation of the European Union after World War II was to bring stability and peace to a previously war torn continent and it succeeded in that aim. It is tragic to see Ukraine, which is stuck in the middle of Russia and the EU, being made to pay the price of being alone without the protection it needs to enable Ukrainian people to live freely and independently.\n“There is strong evidence that Russian people themselves are not in favour of this invasion, though they are also being kept in the dark because the media is state run and the word ‘war’ cannot be used.\n“It is good to see that so many organisations, businesses, sporting bodies and governments are turning their back on Russia, though it is very sad for the Russian people themselves who will undoubtedly suffer as a result of a conflict which, evidence says, they do not want.”",

Around 180 affordable family homes have been built in Blyth at South Newsham, Tynedale Drive and Hodgson’s Road and over 80 new homes in the north, across Amble, Shilbottle and Embleton.\n● A new £1.9 million, 16 home development in the coastal village of Embleton opened in 2016 meaning local people can rent affordable homes in their local community.\n● In July local residents moved into a new 20 property affordable housing development in Shilbottle which has been funded and developed by the Council.\n● In April 2016 work started on a £2.8million Council funded scheme to build\n26 new affordable bungalows in Morpeth Road, Blyth. The new housing development was finished in October 2016 made up of two bedroom bungalows, two of which have been built to accommodate wheelchair access. The dwellings are also built to Lifetime Homes Standard and include direct access ‘en suite’ facilities and provision for future hoists as well as level access showers. There are also dementia friendly elements such as glass fronted kitchen cabinets.\n● A major £700,000 scheme to refurbish some of Alnwick’s oldest council houses in the heart of the town has been completed by the Council. The interiors of 20 council properties in Kings Street have had new floors, walls, doors, insulation, heating and energy efficient boilers installed. At the same time they have been rewired and given new kitchens, bathrooms, blinds and carpets, with the tenants choosing their preferred colours, styles and materials.\n● Council housing tenants are benefiting from a five year £31 million housing improvement programme to upgrade properties. The work includes kitchen and bathroom replacements, electrical rewiring, new heating systems, replacement roof coverings and windows.\n● £2.9 million has been invested in environmental improvements at our 350 home estate at Newsham and New Delaval. The work has included rendering, improved pathways, garden walls and roads and is due for completion at the end of the 2016.\n● In September 2015 Homes for Northumberland, the arms-length organisation that has been managing the council’s portfolio of over 8,000 homes , was transferred back into the council to reduce running costs and save money.\n● 2016 was the 5th year for the annual Spirit of the Community awards. They are held to celebrate and recognise council tenants and community groups who have helped other residents to enjoy life or who have made a difference to others.\n● Our ground-breaking work around tenant involvement was the focus of attention at the prestigious national tenants conference in Blackpool in June 2016. Representatives from the council and the tenants forum were invited to speak about the new Tenants Voice sub committee that had been set up and which puts tenants at the heart of decision making. The committee, the first of its kind in the country is made up of four tenants and four councillors and gives tenants a seat at the table with key decision makers and a direct voice and influence over decisions affecting housing services.\n● In March 2016 Northumberland County Council launched a campaign to bring vacant properties back into use and help ease the county’s housing shortage. In the first quarter of 2016, 64 properties were brought back into use.\n● In July 2016 the council submitted an ‘Expression Of Interest’ to central government for support in developing proposals for a new garden village on land owned by The Dissington Estate, north of Darras Hall, Ponteland. It includes proposals for a garden village of approximately 1,800 dwellings with associated local services, facilities and infrastructure provision. While physically separate from Ponteland, the proposed development would be capable of delivering “significant benefits” to the town. These would include the provision of more than 500 affordable houses, delivery of a Ponteland Relief Road, enhanced community transport and infrastructure, and delivery of a flood alleviation scheme for Ponteland.\n● We’ve installed over 1200 solar panel arrays on social houses, giving tenants access to free electricity during daylight hours.\n● With the new streamlined planning committee system we are seeing an increase in approvals of applications for new housing development across the county.\n● We were awarded Bronze in the prestigious ‘National Clean Britain Awards’\nlarge council category for our care of the local environment.\n● Hexham’s iconic bandstand is back in place after being restored to its former glory in May 2016 and work has started on the Sele Fountain following\n£125,00 from the county council, Hexham Town Council and a number of private donors.\n● We have completed work to refurbish Berwick Breakwater at a total cost of £2 million, providing flooding and coastal erosion protection to 145 properties.\n● We continue to support those in need through the local council tax support scheme (£23 million) despite significant cuts in funding.\n● Through the £721,000 Supporting Families Programme, we have turned the lives around of hundreds of families who have needed our support, and due to the success we’ve been invited to take part in the next phase of the programme.\n● Our children’s centre services (which cost £4.2 million net to run a year) have supported 84% of children under the age of five in our most deprived communities.\n● Our performance in placing children who are aged five years and over is almost twice that of the national average.\n● Our £1.2 million annual expenditure on maintaining and protecting our parks has resulted in many of our parks across the county being awarded the prestigious Green Flag status – that means they're rated amongst the best in the UK.\n● Our county won more gold awards than any other council in the latest Northumbria in Bloom awards – a credit to our local services teams and local parish and town councils who work so hard to keep our towns and green spaces clean and tidy.\n● We launched ‘Bin it for Good’, our anti-litter campaign; around 250 people have received fines ranging from £50 to £400 for littering so far this year.\n● In 2015 we launched a ‘Love Northumberland Hate Litter’ campaign. The campaign involved a combination of littering enforcement, community group litter picks, a programme of school engagement and over 300 visits to food businesses, with the campaign being highly commended in the prestigious\n‘Keep Britain Tidy’ campaign of the year awards. In the first 12 months over\n350 littering fixed penalties were issued, 42 of which resulted in prosecutions,\n400 tonnes of fly-tipped rubbish has been removed and 17 cases of fly-tipping\nhave led to prosecutions. In May 2016 Northumberland County Council became one of the first councils in the country to use brand new legislation to tackle fly-tippers on the spot. The council’s environmental enforcement team made quick use of the new powers by issuing a £200 FPN to a Lynemouth man for tipping four bags of garden waste onto a grass verge - just 25 yards from his house.\n● In 2015 we trained our civil enforcement officers to begin taking action against dog fouling and litter and since in the first 12 months a total of 1,612 waste control investigations were carried out, along with 1,885 for dog fouling. A record 54 successful prosecutions for environmental offences were taken by the Council; including 42 for littering, six for fly tipping and eight for dog\nfouling. Along with the prosecutions, 455 fixed penalty notices were issued for littering and dog control offences. This is the highest number ever issued by the council in one year and represents a 37% increase from 2014.\n● All of our street lights will be modernised within the next three years – a £25 million project replacing 17,000 lampposts and 29,000 lights – ultimately it will save £300,000 a year in reduced energy and maintenance costs. Free wi-fi is also being fitted onto lamposts as part of the project. Pilots in Blyth,\nAshington and Berwick could be extended to other parts of the county. As well as the streetlights, around 500 illuminated signs will be replaced, and all 1,207 illuminated traffic bollards will be changed to use the new efficient lighting.\n● Our frontline staff have new mechanical sweepers and ride on mowers to improve our street cleansing and grass cutting services thanks to £1.75 million being spent over the last three years.\n● Northumberland suffered substantial damage to homes, businesses and infrastructure during flooding and severe weather in December 2015 and January 2016 – leaving it with a repair bill of more than £24 million. Firefighters, local services teams and other staff worked tirelessly to support communities affected, in particular Corbridge, to keep them safe during the worst floods in the Tyne Valley since 1771. Almost 200 homes were flooded across the county and in Corbridge more than 50 homes were evacuated as the swollen River Tyne burst its banks. Staff also worked hard as part of the clean-up operation afterwards. In March 2016 confirmed it would provide\n£14.6 million from the Department of Transport towards these repair costs. The allocation will allow the council to progress work on a number of vital schemes in the county, including repairs to Ovingham Bridge, landslips at Bywell and Widehaugh and works in Corbridge. 23 small and medium sized businesses with up to 250 full time equivalent employees successfully applied for flood recovery grants and so far 102 householders and businesses that were flooded in December 2015 applied for a property level resilience grant of up to £5,000. In addition to the larger projects planned, a programme of minor works has also been produced - with £4m scheduled to be spent on over 57\nworks across the county to roads, bridges, fords and drainage systems, and\n£300,000 repairing the numerous footpaths, bridleways and footbridges impacted by the high winds and heavy rain.\n● The council also received £1.1m funding towards pothole repair costs. Before the storms in early December, the county’s pothole backlog had been eradicated – but a combination of heavy rains followed by sub-zero temperatures have led to further problems. In January 2016 figures showed almost all the potholes reported to the over the previous two years had been repaired. Between November 2013 and November 2015 a total of 12,500 potholes were reported to the council and of these 12,472 were repaired – which equates to 99.775%. During the same time a further 50,605 potholes were identified and repaired during routine inspections by the council. A massive £1m repair (March 2016) programme is getting underway to repair the county’s roads damaged by the winter weather in 2015/16. Jetpatchers can each repair around 145 potholes a day, at an average cost of less than\n£10 a hole. Meanwhile “hotbox teams”, a more traditional method of repairing potholes, will be repairing a further 60 holes a day at a cost of around £12 a hole. Extra staff have been drafted in to repair highway drainage systems which have affected by the prolonged periods of heavy rainfall and flooding including clearing debris from gutters, re-cutting verges and digging out ditches. In addition, the council will be carrying out patching works ahead of the annual road surface dressing programme, to repair the extra damage caused by the extreme weather.\n● Between 2013 and 2017 £75.3m is being invested in the county’s infrastructure through the Local Transport Plan programme. This included the B6344 road at Crag End, near Rothbury, which had been closed completely after a land slip and was re-opened in March 2016 after nearly\nthree-and-a-half years and £10million spent on repairs. The physical construction work involved driving hundreds of concrete filled steel tubes up to\n80 feet into the ground, with a large concrete beam across the top and 144 ground anchors connected around 100 feet into the ground to stop the land from moving. A length of approximately 400 metres of road has also been fully rebuilt. The project won an Institute of Civil Engineering (ICE) North East Award.\n● Working with partners across the county we are investigating the feasibility of reopening a train station at Gilsland; providing a gateway to Hadrian’s Wall.\n● Hirst Park in Ashington is being restored to its former glory following development funding of £139,300 from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Big Lottery Fund, and £12,400 from Northumberland County Council and Ashington Town Council.\n● Bolam Lake near Morpeth is celebrating its 200th anniversary in 2016 with\nhelp from a £55,000 grant was awarded to the Council by the Heritage Lottery\nFund.\n● Butokokan Judo Club which teaches the art of Judo to students aged five onwards from Newbiggin Sports Centre and Ashington have new sports mats after being awarded a grant of £3,167 from the Council’s Community Chest Scheme to purchase new equipment for their club. The Council has given\n£1.78m in grants since 2013 to support xx voluntary and community groups and organisations through its Community Chest Scheme.\n● £4m has been invested by ward councillors in schemes in their wards and local areas over the last four years.",

Since they came into power they have systematically stripped resources from our much loved services. They deliberately put ordinary people in a bad place and the pandemic and the war in Ukraine only made it worse. They blamed the situation on everyone but themselves but it is they, over 12 years, who have turned their backs on ordinary people who create the wealth in the country.\n“Britain has so much potential. But right now we’re facing a Tory economic crisis that’s holding us back.\n“After today, people will be asking themselves: am I and my family better off with the Tories? The answer is no. The mess we are in is a result of 12 years of Conservative economic failure.

It’s even more shocking when we have been led to believe that it’s the Conservatives who can be trusted with the economy.\n“The UK is the only G7 economy that is still smaller than its pre-Covid level. It’s also being forecast to have the lowest growth rate over the next two years, behind countries like Italy and Greece. Thirteen years of Tory failure are holding this country back. They can blame it on the pandemic; they can blame it on the war in Ukraine but in reality it’s they who are to blame.\n“Labour has plans to put the country back on its feet again by ensuring more goods and services are made, sold and bought in Britain and we create jobs and help the climate making homes greener and cleaner.\n“Families are asking if they are better of with the Tories. The answer is no, they’re not. We want everyone to share the resources of the amazing country and make sure they and their families thrive in the future.”",

If you pay people properly they can afford to look after themselves and their families and the economy improves; it’s not rocket science. However we’ve had 11 years of the Tories chipping away at pay and working conditions. It’s going to take some work to turn this around but it’s quite clear that things can’t stay as they are. We’ve got people who can’t get on the housing ladder because they’re paying high rents and which stop them from being able to save, working people depending on food banks to get by and people having to make the choice between heating and eating.

At least 4 locations in the town will see investment and services return and the Labour leader promised an ‘ongoing conversation’ with local communities to create the best possible opportunities to maximise the twin aim of ‘making services more accessible and investing economically to create thriving town centre’s across the county’.\nThe council will be unveiling plans to develop existing facilities like the Lionheart Depot coupled with significant investment in specific buildings to deliver council services and house new council jobs. As part of the initiative designed to bring services and jobs back into convenient locations for residents, the authority is looking at least 4 locations in Alnwick including the Playhouse, the Lionheart depot for street scene services, Northumberland House and the council is in negotiations for at least one other location for a currently unused building. The move out of County Hall and the so called ‘jobs bonanza’ for Alnwick closely follows news that Arch, the Development company has picked up to complete, 37 luxury apartments on the Western outskirts of the town centre for completion after a stalled housing development.\nGrant Davey, Leader of the Council and leader of the Labour group said\n“Our Market Towns Initiative will see significant investment in locating services in town centre’s across the county and we’re seeking to use that investment to create the conditions to lever in more investment. In Alnwick, we see ways to work in partnership with the community to develop the best value for money services that will support and sustain our market towns as an absolute must. We’ll be starting our local conversations with communities like Alnwick very soon and we want this to be very much a two way dialogue”.\n“We want to work with anyone who is serious about developing economic opportunities for our market towns. We promised to devolve services and jobs out of County Hall in 2013 elections and we intend to keep that promise”.",

As widely reported Caller pointed to toxicity between members and behaviours that we unacceptable, many members of all groups then spoke of the issues they had experienced at the hands of others.\nParticipating in the cross-party group the Labour Group Leaders regularly remind all of the issues raised over and over again by members and later clarified by Mr Caller. What it also reminds people is that lines can only be drawn and partnership work can only be achieved if Leaders of all groups stamp out the poor behaviour branded as toxic between members and officers. We cannot just suggest that a new top team can be installed and all will be well, clear behavioural change is needed. The Caller report was not just focused on Officers but unfortunately in political spin, the member issues and political issues have been lost.\nNorthumberland Labour spokesperson said: “All our members got into local politics to serve communities, not battle in school ground bullying nor accept intimidation as the norm. Residents of Northumberland deserve better than this and we have seen where this has led us.\nWhile officers grab the headlines and release after release points to officers, critical parts of the report are going unreported, unnoticed and remain to be dealt with.\nWe reached a farcical position where members advocated the end of anonymous blogs which had members passionately speak about the impact on them and their families and their mental health. Later that day some members were “outed” as authors and admins of one of the most vicious sites and this cannot go on.”\nAs we move on in the coming weeks and try to attract new key officials that the Council needs we need to bear in mind the issues that need to be addressed by elected officials themselves before we reach a similar position in months to come. Officers are key to our success and treating them with professionalism and respect and understanding they are in A political position is critical.\nWe need confidence in officers, removal of open bias and cross-party appointments to these roles is fundamental to building trust. In recent years opposition leaders have been treated with respect, sat around cabinet tables, included in major briefings and information readily shared. Mr Caller talked of the “winner takes all” mentality which has shut out all other Groups from the Council and led to this festering position of distrust, maverick decision making, decisions made behind closed doors and decisions being taken in meetings classed as “informal” with no proper powers to do so. He talked about members not receiving the information they are entitled to and which resulted in the use of FOI’s and SAR requests this includes information opposition Councillors should be provided with and not resort to other mechanisms other than asking for it.\nWe are all up for the change that’s needed and get the Council back to the standards of pre-2017 but urge caution at any suggestion that officers alone and a new top team will solve all the problems without politicians recognising their part in the change that’s needed.\nAs recent as Wednesday we saw members break down in the Chamber when people referred to bullying, residents send their community champions to the Council to work for them not be broken in a toxic environment.",

The Covid Crisis called for us all to look long and hard at how best we could create a safe and supportive net around our residents, especially the elderly and vulnerable. Having a good working relationship with Scott, not to mention a brilliant rapport, has meant that we could work together in areas of need to keep our residents safe and well looked after.\n\"One of our planned projects was the installation of some specialist equipment in our beautiful park. As soon as Scott knew of our plans he offered his help financially immediately, understanding the need to look closely at the provision of equipment suitable for the disabled was an important project. Obviously after our consultations with the company that would be providing and installing the equipment, was put into Lock down, so our plans had to be put on hold for the time being.\nHopefully we will get the project underway in the coming New Year. !\nCaring for our communities is always high on our list of priorities and this difficult year has been no different. There will be challenges ahead I am sure, which is why working together for the benefit of our communities is vital and I look forward to keeping our working relationship not to mention our support for each other, going from strength to strength.\"\nScott Dickinson said: \"As soon as I heard about the Widdrington Station Parish Council's plans to install disabled access play equipment in their park, I was keen to offer some help.\n\"Play is vital for all children and should be accessible for every young person. I very much value the relationship I have with the parish council. We work together to benefit local people and make sure they are safe and well looked after.\"",

On 24th May 2017 Councillor Peter Jackson announced to the tax payers of Northumberland that the County Council is “A Council struggling to pay its bills”. At its meeting on 5th July Northumberland County Council Conservative Group considered a motion and withdrew the Northumberland Local Plan Core Strategy from Government deciding instead to carry out a review of some aspects of the document. Labour Party Councillors objected to the withdrawal lodging their objections and linking the withdrawal to the opening of a housing free for all, noting that the Conservatives were quickly becoming the ‘agents of the developers’. Labour Group Leader Councillor Grant Davey said that “the loss of protection of the emerging core strategy will remove the protection from unwanted house building for towns and villages across the County.” Councillor Allan Hepple reminded the meeting how many years of consultation and meetings it had taken to get the strategy ready for inspection. The Tories won the vote and withdrew the strategy from Government inspection, hailing its withdrawal as a success. Since then the Tories have shown they are only interested in protecting Ponteland and Hexham from additional housing as they have accepted applications for thousands of new build homes on green spaces across the south east and rural coalfield areas of Northumberland, including hundreds in Bedlington and Ashington. A planning application that had been accepted for refusal at New Hartley was called in for appeal against its refusal to a planning inspector by a developer. Prior to making his decision to grant permission and load costs onto Northumberland’s taxpayers, the planning inspector wrote to Northumberland County Council and asked a number of questions to ensure that the Council were not relying on a withdrawn core strategy to argue that the village of New Hartley who’s residents and Councillor Susan Dungworth argued correctly should not be subject to a planning application which will increase the population of their village by 45% and put pressure on its very fragile infrastructure. A Labour Party spokesperson said: “Northumberland Conservatives have proven that the withdrawal of the core strategy from inspection by Government has been a costly mistake for residents of the County and the Tory Leaders manifesto promise that he would ‘halt the march of the developers’ is simply political rhetoric without substance”.\nEmbarrassing letter received from the Planning Inspectorate below.",

Legal are also of the opinion that the County Council doesn't even have the POWER to set up 5 NEW AUTHORITIES.\nMaybe they should focus on getting funding for Adult Social Care like Surrey in a special deal rather than creating 5 new costly Councils.\nMaybe the agreement between the Libdems and Tories should be relooked at. I doubt Libdem voters will be happy about them jumping back in to bed with the Northumberland Tories.\nWe then move on to another point within their Manifesto which unfortunately is a LIE and should be described only as one.\nThey have used the following figures for the County Hall move which returns jobs and services to Market Towns.\nLies to date:\n1) on a number of occasions it has been described as £40million\n2) it was then recently described as £70million\n3) it then peaked at £75 million\n4) and now they claim £80 million\nQuestion must be when will the lies stop????

On 3 seperate occasions a Full Council meeting needed to be stopped to ask the Conservative Leader to STOP misleading the public.\n3) The Contract for the HQ which is smaller and more efficient is FIXED at £32million and has already been awarded to a contractor and building is underway. This capital cost has already been covered by the sale of EMPTY BUILDINGS across Northumberland.\n4) The new County Hall is a service centre and will act as a multipurpose facility and generate income for the Council Services.\n5) ALL the Market Towns - Bedlington, Berwick, Amble, Morpeth, Prudhoe, Hexham, Cramlington, Blyth and Ashington benefit from this move.",

In addition, refurbishment of existing accommodation on the site will be carried out, to form one large college to cater for nine to 13 year olds.\nInitial designs and architectural plans have now been developed and a team of quantity surveyors are currently developing accurate project costs to enable the project to move to the next phase of design.

The school will also provide more opportunities for the local community to use the new facilities outside of school hours.\nCouncillor Robert Arckless, Cabinet Member for Children’s Services at Northumberland County Council, said: “Delivering the best possible educational environment for pupils is a priority for the County Council and we are committed to deliver a high quality environment for pupils at James Calvert Spence College.”\nExecutive Head Teacher, Neil Rodgers said: “I am absolutely delighted that Northumberland County Council have pledged a significant capital investment to James Calvert Spence College in order for us to radically upgrade and remodel our current educational facilities.\n“Councillor Scott Dickinson, our former Chair of Governors, and I have worked closely on this project for over a year as we are both committed to ensuring that the young people of Amble and the surrounding area get the facilities that they deserve, and an entitlement to a first class education in modern, well equipped surroundings.\n“Having a new build for the middle school aged children on the high school site is the logical progression for us, having become one 9-19 school last June. It enables us to have the seamless transition between years, and between key stages, that will ensure all students make the best possible progress with all our talented and dedicated staff together on one site.\n“This is a real turning point for JCSC, and for the community it serves.”\nCouncillor Scott Dickinson, Business Chair of Northumberland County Council ,said: “This investment is wonderful news for the coastal strip of Northumberland. The building work will will see a pre-war building replaced with fantastic new facilities, which will make a huge difference to daily life in the school.and will create the best possible educational environment for our young people.”",

These are things which will make a real, practical difference to people being able to afford to live in a comfortable home. “We’ve had 13 years of excuses and a government that’s let many people down. It’s time for a change.”",
  "https_www_scottdickinson_net_/https_www_scottdickinson_net_single-post_2017_11_30_the-budget/content_505.html": "The Budget......\n- Scott Dickinson\n- Nov 30, 2017\n- 2 min read\nBelow is the statement I gave, obviously they can't print it all but the article below also shares the views of the others, clearly we were reading different budgets or living on separate planets.\nThis budget did nothing to address the real needs of the Country and certainly didn't listen to ordinary people, it was a completely out of touch budget by a government that is not fit to govern. No mention of Schools, Social Care or Policing, no funding for the vital services that need them or that the public said they want to see funded properly.\nUniversal Credit U-turn was welcomed but it didn't go far enough, plummeting families into debt and despair for 5 weeks instead of 6 isn't really worth the pat on the back local Tories are desperate to give themselves.\nPrevious Labour Governments lifted millions of Children out of Poverty, the Conservatives have willingly placed an extra 1million children and 1.9million pensioners into poverty and the budget did nothing to address this. Worst rate in Western Europe and clearly no concern about it, only Labour will look after the most vulnerable.\nThe NHS was robbed, given a token amount to make people believe they support it, yet the Leave camp £350m a week is still nowhere to be seen, one of the chief Leave Campaigners was AMT maybe she can tell us where it is? Or better still why spend £1billion on the DUP rather than the NHS? Crucial questions she never answers.\nSlowest growth since 2009, poorest performance of the G7 Countries with a forecast of more failure. Little in the budget to address this, yet the Conservatives wish to crow on about being \"fit for the future\" and a \"strong economy\" but its simply not true.\nOrdinary hard working peoples living standards are down, to pretend they are better off is simply a pretence, on the 26th of November Labour in Alnwick, Rothbury, Seahouses, Berwick, Druridge Bay all held activities that reported people feeling much poorer under the Tories with a staggering 90% reporting being worse off. People need wonder no more why we have food banks operating at the level we have in Northumberland, you only need to look at the lack of understanding about the ordinary person from this government and its MP's.\nThe North of Tyne Devo deal was announced with a mass Tory scramble to pose for pictures, Cllrs and Politicians who hadn't been part of the deal-making. It will be good for the North if the powers are exercised properly, luckily the deals were thrashed out by the Labour Administration at County Hall despite the pretence from the Tories that they achieved this in the last few months. With Newcastle and North Tyneside I'm confident that the Tory Administration won't make a mess of this like they have with the Core Strategy and other things they created mayhem with.\nIn summary, the budget lacked reality, the statements from local politicians lacked reality of local ordinary hard-working people and rightly people are angry, change is coming and a budget for the many and not the few will be on the way soon.\nBerwick Advertiser",

That’s why we’re investing the £238 million in delivering\nthings most people take for granted, like access to broadband, street lighting and roads, such as the Morpeth Bypass. We’re investing £30 million to build the new road, which will significantly reduce congestion around Morpeth and could inject around £50 million into the county’s economy once it is completed in late 2017.\n● We have invested £370,000 in a much needed extension to car parking at Alnmouth Railway Station to alleviate congestion at and around the station and are supporting plans to expand parking at Morpeth station.\n● More than 140,000 properties can now connect to fibre broadband and at least\n91% of homes and businesses in Northumberland are streaming, downloading and uploading – with superfast speeds - thanks to £7 million in funding from the Council.\n● We have invested £1.9 million to subsidise bus services, recognising the rural nature of our county, despite other councils no longer funding them.\n● We have built a new £2.2 million bus station in Hexham which opened in November 2016 providing modern facilities for bus users including an enclosed waiting area, toilets, refreshment facilities and travel information. Work has also started on a mixed development on the existing bus station site at Priestpopple to allow a retail and residential scheme providing 31 apartments and five affordable homes and generating 126 jobs.\n● We are investing £19 million this year to maintain and improve the roads and transport network.\n● We supported Blyth and Northumberland Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty in securing Coastal Community Team status, a programme that revives seaside towns and aims to bring jobs, growth and prosperity back to the area.\n● Working with the Environment Agency, the £27.1 million (with a contribution from the Council of £12 million) Morpeth Flood Alleviation scheme was completed and officially opened in August 2015, protecting many properties from flooding. They were put into use in the storms in December 2015 and early 2016.\n● Since the first green fibre street cabinet went live in January 2014 hundreds of kilometres of underground fibre optic cable has been laid and 219 new cabinets installed in what is one of the county’s largest civil engineering projects in recent years.\n● More than 146,000 households and businesses in Northumberland are now able to connect to fibre broadband as a result of the Council’s £18.9 million iNorthumberland programme and BT’s commercial roll-out of the high-speed technology. Work is underway on the second phase of the roll-out with the first homes and businesses expected to be connected late summer following an additional £4.1 million investment, meaning fibre broadband speeds within reach of a further 3,700 homes and businesses across Northumberland by June 2017. The programme has won a number of awards including one for promoting digital inclusion and skills with a win at the Next Generation Digital Skills Awards.\n● Following a restructure of NCC’s planning processes there has been a significant improvement. The percentage of major planning applications determined within target has risen from 45% in 2013/14 to 79% since last year, with minor planning applications rising from 53% to 69% in the same period in 2016. ‘Other’ planning applications, which include those from individuals or householders have also gone from 77% to 92%. Having greatly improved its overall performance the council is now focusing on improving its planning enforcement.\n● We are in the final stage of preparing our Core Strategy – the Northumberland Local Plan - before it is submitted for review by a Government inspector. Still protecting more than 99% of Northumberland’s Green Belt, and only proposing boundary changes in exceptional circumstances the Plan will be submitted in March",

We aim to provide a range of quality community and cultural services, and facilities to inspire creativity and participation.\n● Woodhorn Museum (through an annual investment of £1 million from the\nCouncil) was the first - and is one of only three - venues to host the iconic\n‘Weeping Window’ - the installation attracted over 125,000 visitors to\nWoodhorn during the seven week period in autumn 2015.\n● Visits to Northumberland funded museums have increased by 30% in the previous year.\n● Three of Northumberland’s most popular tourist spots have scooped top honours at 2016s BBC Countryfile Magazine awards. Northumberland National Park won the National Park of the Year award; Hadrian’s Wall scooped the Heritage Site of the Year; with Bamburgh Castle taking the title of Landmark of the Year.\n● In February 2016 the council approved major plans for the redevelopment of Hexham House, a grade 2 listed building with dramatic views over Hexham Abbey. The £1.5m scheme will involve the creation of a new Register Office and two wedding ceremony venues with seven luxury holiday apartments in the remainder of the building.\n● In February 2016 a new scheme to celebrate and promote food and drink produced entirely in Northumberland was launched. ‘Produced in Northumberland` is a joint initiative between Northumberland County Council, Active Northumberland and Northumberland Tourism, which recognises producers and businesses that use and promote food and drink made in the county. The verification scheme aims to raise the profile, value and public confidence in Northumberland food and drink. The economic impact of food tourism in the county is worth nearly £276m a year and it’s hoped the scheme will help to add value to the visitors’ overall experience as food and drink is such an important and memorable part of their visit.\n● For the seventh year running residents benefited from free or discounted entry to top attractions in Northumberland during a weekend in March as part of the Residents’ Festival organised by Active Northumberland and the Council.\n● Northumberland County Council in partnership with Northumberland National Park Authority secured a four year funding deal for a busy Northumberland bus route which should bring legions of tourists to Hadrian’s Wall. The AD122\nbus service which runs along the most spectacular stretch of the World Heritage Site from Hexham to Haltwhistle during Northumberland’s peak tourist season (Easter-September) is used by both residents and tourists allowing them to visit stops along Hadrian’s Wall. In 2015 there were around\n5,000 more journeys on this bus service than the previous year.\n● Berwick is to get a new town centre coach park at Chapel Street to support tourism and boost the economy of the town.\n● Following a £400,000 investment from the government, the Hadrian’s Wall Connect Project is set to boost tourism numbers in 2016 through a range of improvements to make it easier for visitors to access the unique World Heritage Site. The grant led by VisitEngland has helped to secure the popular Go North East AD122 bus service for a further four years and will also see the introduction of ‘Hadrian’s Wall Welcome Hubs’ at key visitor locations including Carlisle, Haltwhistle and Hexham railway stations.\n● A popular coastal footpath, known locally as Lover's Walk and part of the Coast path and St Oswald's Way trail, has been reopened in Alnmouth following repairs by Northumberland County Council and Northumberland Estates.\n● In 2015 Northumberland Live was launched, a free music festival which took place in Blyth. Due to its success events took place in 2016 in Blyth and for the first time in Bedlington; attracting 12,000 and 6,500 people respectively.\n● We are keeping our communities safer through our £7 million investment in two new fire stations at Hexham and Alnwick and have improved our emergency response equipment with a new £200,000 incident command and control vehicle and a new special rescue vehicle. Hexham fire station is due to open in December 2016 whilst Alnwick, combined with a new depot is set to open in Spring 2017.\n● Staff from our adult social care direct payments team are offering a range of support to people who prefer to employ their own care and support workers. The service makes it easier to manage the technicalities of being an employer\n– making it less intimidating to handle issues such as tax, insurance, criminal record checks (Disclosure and Barring Service, or DBS checks) and immigration status. For those who wish to use it, employment can give more personalised control over who provides support and care, and how it is provided. It is available both to people who qualify for public support - through cash Direct Payment or Personal Health Budget - and those who fund support themselves.\n● Our annual ‘LOVE Northumberland’ awards – now in their seventh year - celebrate the very best in community and voluntary environmental work\nacross the county making the county the great place it is; preserving and improving the environment in the county, celebrating community spirit and promoting county pride.\n● More than 50 local residents have been honoured as local heroes for the contribution they’ve made to their community in the Northumberland Local Heroes Awards launched in 2012. The awards highlight how much good work is done by local people for the benefit of neighbours and their local area.\n● Our adult social care support planner service is working in conjunction with Northumberland Clinical Commissioning Group to encourage GPs to refer adult patients who are lonely and isolated to our support planner service. The initiative supports the national Social Prescribing agenda which aims to improve health and wellbeing by helping people access local community activities and support.\n● The national organisers of the Tour of Britain hailed the Northumberland stages of the race in September 2015 as a major success showing that the direct economic impact of hosting the event was £2.13m. The county was showcased across 129 countries during the two-day event with 115,000 spectators, of which 21% of spectators came from outside the North East region and 23% stayed overnight. The North Sea Tall Ships Regatta is estimated to have generated £8m in economic benefits to the county.\n● The 2015 Kielder Marathon, sponsored by the Council and Active Northumberland, saw an increase of 43% participation over the Marathon weekend compared to the previous year. 52% of participants came from the local area with 79% of participants booking overnight accommodation.\n● Over £1 million has been invested in improving and developing our parks over the last three years with the regeneration of two parks in Berwick and the development of a new water play area in Amble. Investment of up to a further\n£2 million is planned over the next three years to undertake enhancement projects in the parks in Hexham, Ashington, Bedlington, Cramlington, Blyth and Morpeth.\n● Developments will take place at a number of existing sports pavilions as well as the development of a new community pavilion at Gallagher Park, Bedlington which will create community and changing facilities. £137,000 towards this development was secured from Sport England.\n● Investments continue to be made to ensure we can provide top quality outdoor playing pitches in the county. Over the last year we have invested over £330,000 in the refurbishment of all-weather pitches at Prudhoe and Hirst Welfare, Ashington, as well as securing an additional £483,000 from the Football Foundation for the development of a new artificial turf pitch at Bedlington High School.\n● In 2014, 9.3 million people visited Northumberland, a rise from 8.8 million in\n2013.\n● The overall economic impact of tourism in Northumberland increased by 2.3%\nin 2014 to £765 million, up from £747 million in 2013.\n● Residents in Northumberland are benefitting from a new scheme which will see free central heating fitted to a number of homes without, or with only partial, central heating. NCC successfully bid for a £6.5m Government grant on behalf of other local authorities in the region to tackle fuel poverty. Twenty projects nationwide were awarded funding, totalling £25 million as part of the Central Heating Fund scheme which will improve the energy efficiency of more than 7,000 households across England.\n● We continue to invest significant resources in helping schools to improve despite central government’s move to take this responsibility away from local authorities.\n● We act as champions for children and parents and challenge schools and academies to provide the very best. We have two very significant issues of challenge; firstly the number of pupils in secondary schools that are not good enough and secondly the progress made by our most disadvantaged young people. An impressive 98% of parents got their first preference in 2016 for a secondary school place, an increase of two percent over last year’s 96% figure and one of the highest in the country. The council processed 4,957 applications for places at middle and high schools across the county.\n● Apprenticeships, traineeships and study programmes provided through our Learning and Skills team are rated ‘Good’ by Ofsted. We are keen to develop the skills agenda in partnership with colleges and other local authorities.\n● We have supported 732 families through the Government's Troubled Families programme\n● Since it was introduced in 2012 some 800 young people from across the county have taken part in the National Citizen Service (NCS) programme, which is designed to equip school leavers between the ages of 16 and 17 with skills in community leadership and organisation.\n● Whilst many councils have completely stopped supporting Post-16 school’s travel investment we continue to invest £1.4 million, recognising the rural nature of the county.\n● An exciting new combined education and leisure facility is being developed for Ponteland. The council is investing £57 million of capital in new buildings for a Ponteland Secondary School and Ponteland Primary School on a shared site,\nwith leisure facilities. The investment will allow state of the art facilities to be developed and new buildings constructed for a Ponteland Secondary School and Ponteland Primary School on a shared site, along with the community leisure facilities. New school buildings will also be developed for Darras Hall First School to support it in becoming a primary school on its existing site.\n● We have worked with over 70 schools across the county to promote sustainable and healthy travel to over 15,000 pupils encouraging more walking, cycling and scooting to school.\n● The Council is contributing more than £4 million to new high schools being built in Alnwick, Bedlington and Prudhoe. This means from September 2016 more than 2,800 pupils will have a better environment in which to learn as well as the communities having new and improved leisure facilities to use in the evenings and weekends. More than £3.3 million has been invested in maintaining schools across the county and £5.02 million is being invested in\nan extension to Ashington High School.\n● £14.9 million is being invested in improving and extending ten schools in Alnwick following a reorganisation of schools in the Alnwick Partnership, as well as building a new high school in the town.\n● We are focussing on developing our provision for children with special educational needs and disabilities in partnership with local special schools and the Department for Education.\n● We continue to work with the regional schools commissioner to ensure new academy sponsors are well matched to meet the needs of schools in Northumberland who they wish to sponsor.\n● The variation in GCSE results across secondary schools and academies is far too wide and we are determined to continue to challenge schools and academies to do better.\n● Our Northumberland School meals team was shortlisted in the north east catering awards, North East LACA Awards Excellence 2016 for the Catering Management team of the year for the improvements it has made to the school meals provision. Stamfordham First school was also shortlisted for the Primary School Catering team of the year for its high level of initiative, creativity and passion and for the extra steps is has taken to engage the children and the wider community.\n● Working on behalf of the North East Combined Authority we have secured\n£3.3 million to support unemployed jobseekers with mental health conditions into paid employment.\n● The Council, working in partnership with Northumberland Voluntary and Community Sector (VCS) organisations has been successful in attracting £3 million from the national Building Better Opportunities programme to support residents who have multiple and complex needs into work. This will be delivered by a partnership of six Northumberland VCS organisations who will provide a flexible range of peer support and mentoring across the County.",

They are our last chance for many voters to express a view on the state of the country, as well as who should be running local services, ahead of the general election.\n“We can all see the Tories in Westminster have failed – a cost of living crisis, stagnant economy, public services on their knees, and filth clogging up our rivers. And new figures published today reveal the Tories are failing to keep up with Labour at a local level as well.\n“However you look at it, the coming elections are a straight choice between a Conservative Party that has practically given up, and a Labour Party working every day to get Britain’s future back.”\nLabour Councils vs Conservative councils – comparative analysis of 2023/24 budgets:\nCouncil Tax:\nFor 2024/25 the average council tax bill is £276 lower for Labour councils compared to Tory councils:\nLabour controlled councils average bill: £1495\nConservative controlled councils average bill: £1771\nCrime and security:\nLabour councils invest more per head of population than Conservative councils on key services to keep residents safe and secure:\n– More than twice as much on crime reduction (121% more per head), including paying for extra police where the government have reduced numbers\n– 85% more on street lighting, making residents feel safer at night\n– 30% more on community safety, including extra neighbourhood wardens and advice to keep you safe at home\n– 13% more on CCTV to keep streets safe and provide evidence to convict criminals\n– 31% on services like graffiti removal and cleaning up fly-tipping\nBoosting local economies\nLabour councils invest:\n– 164% more on economic development per head, supporting the economic well-being of the area and boosting jobs and local business\n– 238% more on community development per head, to promote social inclusion, build neighbourhood resources, and build stronger communities\n– 75% more on economic research to drive local economic growth policy and strategy\n– More than twice as much to boost local tourism (131% more per head)\nA bright future for every child\n– Labour councils spend 54% more per head than Conservative councils on SureStart children’s centres, supporting every child to thrive and arrive at school ready to learn\n– Conservative councils spend 15% less per head on youth services than Labour councils, leaving too many young people without positive activities in their local area\n– Every key service to protect children – from family support to child protection, and from youth justice to children in care – all see higher funding per head from Labour councils in comparison to Conservative councils\nGetting the basics right\n– Labour councils invest 31% more in street cleansing than Conservative councils, including street sweeping and graffiti removal\n– Labour councils spend 83% more per head on structural maintenance of local roads, including resurfacing and pothole repair\n– Labour councils spend 36% less on costly landfill charges and other waste disposal costs – protecting public money AND the environment.\nClimate change\n– Labour councils are spending more than double than Conservative councils on meeting the challenge of climate change (71% more per resident)\n– 95% of Labour councils have formally declared a climate emergency and will meet the challenge of Net Zero ahead of the government’s target of 2050.\nCulture, parks, and leisure\nLabour councils spend more per head of population than Conservative councils on key culture and leisure services:\n– 17% more per resident on library buildings and library services\n– Almost twice as much (97% more) on culture and heritage such as local museums, public entertainment, theatres, and arts development\n– 37% more on keeping open spaces well looked after and open to the public, including local parks, playing fields, and play areas, as well as country parks and public allotments\n– 64% more on sports, leisure and community facilities, including swimming pools, leisure centres, and grants to local sports clubs",

Therefore the ‘hubs’ are adapted classrooms within the school buildings.\nThe ethos of the hubs is for the children who attend them, to be included within mainstream activities as far as possible. How much time a child spends in the ‘hub’ as opposed to a mainstream class will be dependent upon the child’s needs and their response to inclusion opportunities.”\nCllr Dickinson Leader of the Group supported Cllr Scott’s comments by saying: “The Labour Party started change on SEND services back in 2015 recognising the need of the young people and their families.

It is a mark of the staggering chaos at the heart of Government under the Conservatives that four years after they promised to fix the problem, nothing has changed.\n“The cost of living crisis is suffocating families in Northumberland, and the utter failure of Conservatives to provide competent government is making things harder and harder and harder.\n“People in Northumberland need a change – they need a government with a plan to get Britain building again so we can build the homes we need to get out of the housing crisis.

Scott Dickinson says: “The Tories talk tough and claim to be the party of law and order but the their record shows they are the party of crime and disorder. They cut our police to the lowest level in a generation and cut funding for services that prevent crime from happening. They are letting down the people they are supposed to be serving “Northumberland Labour has a strong partnership with the police and crime commissioner and, despite being in opposition in the council, we are working hard to make our street safer.” Research shows that police in England and Wales are still faced with a £1.6bn shortfall in funding under the Conservatives, and that between 2010 and 2020 thousands of officers have been lost from the frontline. Latest figures show that this year alone police recorded over two million incidents of antisocial behaviour; the highest in seven years. Even then this is still a fraction of the estimated 13.6 million adults who have witnessed or experienced antisocial behaviour during that same time. This includes incidents of people using and dealing drugs, fly-tipping, vandalism and threatening behaviour. Scott adds: “In Northumberland we’re delighted that, nationally, the Labour party is campaigning for safer communities, with pledges to crack down on anti-social behaviour and end violence against women and girls. “Firstly Labour would take money from vanity projects such as the government yacht and put resources where they need to be. Just think of all the money wasted on ridiculous things like this that benefit very few people which could be used to make people feel safer and improve their quality of life. “Secondly we’d strengthen legal protections for victims of anti-social behaviour to give victims of persistent, unresolved anti-social behaviour the same rights that the Labour Party is proposing to enshrine for victims of crime. “Thirdly we’d work to end violence against women and girls. We’ve already set out a set of proposals to tackle this epidemic, including increasing sentences for rape and stalking, reviewing sentencing for all domestic abuse, and better support for victims of rape and sexual violence; delivering where the Conservatives have failed to step up. “In addition we’d also put more police on the beat in our communities and we’d ensure provision of youth clubs and treatment services.\n“It shouldn’t be like this – and it doesn’t have to be.

The combination of higher prices and lower wages is that living standards are set to be squeezed. This time last year, at the Budget 2016, the OBR was forecasting real average earnings growth of 9 per cent between 2015 and 2020 (average earnings adjusted for CPI inflation). However, at this year’s Budget, this was revised down to growth of 5 per cent between 2015 and 2020. Converting this to income values, Budget 2016 was forecasting that real average earnings would be almost £2,500 higher in 2020 than in 2015. However, at Budget 2017 this was revised down to £1,300. This is a difference of £1,200. Today’s analysis comes on the back of IFS analysis last year which showed that the “outlook for living standards has deteriorated rather sharply”, describing the prospects for real earnings growth as “dreadful”. The Resolution Foundation has also said that the “outlook for living standards in 21st century Britain does not look promising” and that “weak and regressive nature of income growth in the years ahead should concern us all”. This analysis looks at the effect on living standards resulting from changes to OBR forecasts at this year’s Budget. Tax and benefit changes, as well as previous OBR forecasts will impact on living standards; however, this analysis focuses just on inflation and earnings outlook. Scott said: \"it's clear that the Tories are not interested in ordinary hard working people. Living standards are falling and people suffering. Here in Northumberland we have hard working people using food banks to feed the family, this cannot be right. Voting Labour and getting rid of this Tory government is the only way to tackle these issues.\"",

Across the country, 1.3 million more people have fallen into poverty since 2010/11, with living standards falling by the largest year-on-year drop since records began in 2022/23.\nThe analysis comes as the new Labour Government announces a £421m boost to local authorities to help vulnerable families with the cost of their energy, food and water – through an extension of the Household Support Fund.\nPublishing the figures, Northumberland Labour’s Leader Scott Dickinson MBE said,\n“The Conservatives left Britain broke and broken. But here in Northumberland, the new Labour government is already taking action to fix the foundations of our country and get Britain moving again.\n“The Tories mismanaged our economy so badly that we’ve all taken a battering in recent years – and the children and families pushed into poverty by Conservative incompetence have been hit harder than most. That’s why Labour has announced the £421m extension to the Household Support Scheme – to help families in places like Northumberland get through the winter ahead.\n“And Labour won’t stop there – the new government is taking further action to fix the foundations through our plans to grow the economy, make work pay, and Get Britain Working again.\nGiven the dire economic inheritance Labour has been faced with, the Government has had to take difficult decisions to put our public finances on a sustainable footing as we tackle the £22 billion black hole.\n1.3 million more people have fallen into poverty since 2010/11, with living standards falling by the largest year-on-year drop since records began in 2022/23. For over a decade people have also been denied the security and dignity that good work affords with more than a near record 2.8 million people out of work due to sickness.\nAs Labour continues our work to deliver growth, make work pay and develop our child poverty strategy in the long term, the extension of the Fund prevents councils and vulnerable households experiencing an immediate cliff edge of support with a tough winter ahead. Further details on the latest scheme for local authorities and councils will be communicated in the coming weeks.\nThe government is exploring options around how best to provide sustainable support to vulnerable households in the longer term while the ministerial Child Poverty Taskforce develops an ambitious strategy to tackle the root causes of poverty, and the Get Britain Working White Paper, to be set out in the Autumn, will develop measures to reduce inactivity and help people to find better paid and more secure jobs.\nBy growing the economy and unlocking investment through the National Wealth Fund; launching Great British Energy to drive home-grown clean energy and lower bills; making work pay and developing a new Child Poverty Strategy to give children the best start in life – the Government is looking at all levers available to unlock the potential of millions across the country and give them the platform they need to thrive.",

However, it is essential not to be swayed solely by substantial financial projections.\nDuring a recent briefing, the Council Leader acknowledged the potential to generate hundreds of jobs at the site, a notable shift from the previously touted thousands within the past week. It is worth noting that data centers themselves typically provide minimal employment opportunities, with an average of up to 50 jobs per site across Europe. While we hold onto optimism for the creation of indirect jobs, it is crucial to recalibrate expectations. Initial estimates of 8,000 jobs, then revised to 3,000, along with associated housing and infrastructure plans, may need reevaluation given the limited job prospects.\nA significant unresolved query, due to reasons of “commercial sensitivity,” pertains to the £110 million capital payment. This payment, disbursed over several years subject to predefined milestone criteria, aims to eliminate the Council’s current buyback clause on this vital parcel of land.

Should these entities not express interest, construction may be unnecessary, impacting the anticipated instalments from the mentioned £110 million figure.\nScott Dickinson MBE Leader of Northumberland Labour said: “The devil is in the details, and unfortunately, these intricate specifics deemed commercially sensitive by the Council cannot be disclosed, leading us to cautiously welcome the recent developments.\nHistorically, we have witnessed the Council swiftly announcing partnerships like British Volt and Recharge, only to face delays in funding and then collapse. Presently, Blackstone stands as the latest partner, with a notable change being their financial backing. Understandably, communities in Northumberland and opposition Councillors harbor reservations regarding the project’s execution due to the lack of transparent information available. But everyone wants something to succeed.\nThe sudden nature of these announcements and the surrounding secrecy raise questions about potential electioneering motives. While we hope for swift progress, the limited transparency restricts many stakeholders to a ‘wait and see’ stance, creating uncertainty for all but a privileged few. It would have been beneficial for Leaders to receive more detailed briefings to instill confidence within their groups.\nOur commitment to supporting investments in Northumberland remains unwavering, fostering bipartisan backing for previously rejected initiatives. It is essential to emphasize the necessity of collaborative efforts across party lines to ensure the council’s effectiveness in serving the people of Northumberland. Investors recognize the potential impact of electoral changes on projects, underscoring the importance of comprehensive cross-party engagement and information dissemination for any significant agreements.”",

And in a speech to a national planning conference in London, he said: “You’ll have heard me express my frustration about some local planning authorities that are still lagging behind on this score.\n“I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: these plans are absolutely key to helping us build the right homes in the right places.\n“So, it’s vital that you get them in place quickly and keep them up to date to ensure that permissions turn into homes.\n“The alternative – speculative development and neighbourhoods that are poorly planned, lacking strong communities – is something that none of us want to see.”\nNorthumberland was one of 15 councils put “on notice” by the Government last year for failing to agree a plan setting out how land will be used for new homes and jobs.\nIt is now unlikely to adopt a new Local Plan until 2020.\nThe Government has warned that failure to agree plans and keep them up to date “will no longer be tolerated” and threatened intervention to force them to act.\nBut Northumberland’s Conservative administration says it had to axe the previous plan, drawn up when the council was Labour-led, because it would “concrete over Northumberland”.\nLabour Group Chair Scott Dickinson said: \"The Northumberland Tories withdrew the Core Strategy leaving Northumberland in a FREE for all. Now it's being criticised AGAIN from one of its own Tory Ministers. It's a complete mess\".\n\"This shows a completely inexperienced administration, making decisions based on political gains rather than the best interests of Northumberland and this is another example of this approach spectacularly backfiring\".\n\"The Leader of the Council said it would be replaced within 8weeks, we now know the real timescale is 2020 some 3yrs+ meanwhile Northumberland County Council Planners are left battling developers with no document to work from.\"\n\"Labour offered a motion alternative which would have modified the numbers without leaving the whole County unprotected, but they continued with the maverick approach which has left communities in a vulnerable position.\"",

Any investment into the county’s children and their future is to be welcomed and I’m sure families in the town are pleased with this announcement. It’s also good to see this finally progress after the disappointment two years ago when the government turned down the then Labour-led Northumberland County Council’s application to merge Haydon Bridge High School and Hexham Queen Elizabeth Academy and establish a new multi-million pound academy in the area. The proposals at the time were to consult on removing Academy orders from Haydon Bridge High School and and the sponsorship arrangements of the Bright Tribe Trust to come up with a long term solution for education in that part of our county. In our view that proposal was rejected, simply because the government was determined to make all schools academies. While some have undoubtedly been successful, there have been some shocking examples of what can happen under organisations such as Bright Tribe, in the west of Cumbria for example. When it boils down to it, we all want the best education possible for our children. The announcement about Hexham is brilliant, even if it has been a bit of a bumpy ride to get there.",

The consultation on our small community schools is really important. People need to understand what a primary and secondary system versus the current first, middle and high would look like.”\nNorthumberland County Council has said it will be holding a public event to answer questions about the consultation on school reorganisation in Widdrington, Hadston and Amble.\nThe event will take place on Saturday 11 June 2022 from 10am until 3pm in the Amble Masonic Hall, Gloster Hill, The Wynd, Amble NE65 0LN.\nScott added: “I have asked if more local meetings can take place for affected areas like Hadston, Widdrington and Red Row because it’s difficult to get to meetings, find out information or express an opinion on the future of your schools if you have no car.

Instead they’re too busy making life unbearable for the officers whose teams carry the work out. It’s an absolute shambles.\n“With an election in 2024 we can only promise to respect and serve the people of this county. However we’ll be judged our track record of delivery in holding the council to account. Personally I pledge to ensure that a Labour-led council devotes itself to the people of this county.\n“The council has done nothing new; not a single affordable home built. A council that puts local people first is critical and essential in these dreadful times. The Conservatives have done nothing but continue Labour investment and have glorified themselves in projects come to fruition during the six years they gained control of the county council. While doing that they have not delivered on essential basics or the much needed support for the most vulnerable.\n“We believe in putting local people first and providing better and properly funded schools. Improved roads and building stronger communities.\n“On being elected leader of Northumberland Labour the opposition last year I was immensely proud and will stand to convince Northumbrians that under my leadership none of the dreadfully embarrassing County Hall actions will happen. All I can do at this stage is promise that.\n“Locals who know me and elect me know I deliver on my promises. So at the next local elections I hope people will vote Labour for my colleagues so we can deliver the change we need.\n“Housing, schools, social care and more all need urgent local reform for Northumbrians.

All government departments will be required to look at the impact on people’s health of anything they’re planning.\n“For example, banning junk food advertising until after 9pm and banning marketing vapes to children is just common sense, but the current government has not seen it as a priority.\n“To make the improvements in health that have been eroded over 13 years of a Tory government we will need government departments to think and act in a different, joined up and much more responsible way.\n“We know poor housing affects people’s health, either because people can’t afford to heat their homes or, worse still, they’re living with things like mould in damp houses which particularly affects children. Tragically in 2023 we’ve seen children dying in mouldy homes because the government has not tackled the irresponsible landlords who let these awful properties.\n“Surely in 2023 we can do better than this and under a labour government we can. A new ‘decent homes standard’ will ensure landlords meet standards we should all expect; a clean, decent home that is economical to heat.\n“It’s also good to see that a Labour government will prioritise mental health support for people of all ages. Mental and physical health go together and a Labour government will be committed to reversing the fall in life expectancy and rise in inequalities which we’ve seen in the last 13 years. Our legacy will be one of being on the side of ordinary people, not just the chosen few.”",

Taxpayers deserve to know their money is being handled with great care and that any risks of its misuse through tax havens is monitored by this government.\n\"This government cannot continue to brush worrying patterns like this off. They must commit to cleaning up their contracts now and be far more open to restore public confidence. These revelations raise yet more serious questions about how taxpayer money is being spent during the pandemic and how the government is being run.\n\"The Prime Minister must be transparent about the processes he has put in place to allow such potential breaches of public trust.\n\"We should expect the highest standards of national leadership on finance and this should filter down.

  "https_www_scottdickinson_net_/https_www_scottdickinson_net_single-post_2019_02_23_labour-mess-is-the-usual-tactical-lie/content_481.html": "Labour mess is the usual tactical LIE\n- Scott Dickinson\n- Feb 23, 2019\n- 4 min read\nLabour mess is the usual tactical LIE On 20 February we voted on the 2019-20 budget plans of our Tory-led county council. And you’ll hear them saying that, because the Labour-led council couldn’t manage their money, they’ve had to set a stringent budget to get us out of the mess left by Labour. If for one minute you think this is true, can I point you to the council’s own document which said the Labour-led council did not leave the council in debt. The council’s report has even been externally verified by auditors Ernst and Young. Labour not being able to manage its money is an urban myth put around by the Tories so you’ll be lulled into a false sense of security by thinking they will look after the money better. I have to tell you; this is just not true. Actually it’s illegal to set an unbalanced budget, so whoever was running the council would not be allowed to do this. It doesn’t stop our friends throwing these accusations around though. It’s so predictable and it’s so untrue. It’s the decisions made by the Tories since they came to power that have resulted in a financial back hole. The difference between us and the Tories is how we prioritise what’s spent. It’s a purely moral decision in my view. Look after your rich friends and put poor and vulnerable people under even more pressure; theirs. Try and look after all our residents in a more compassionate way by minimising cuts where possible and maintaining services for poor and vulnerable people; ours. We’re in the middle of budget discussions and it’s depressing. Things that look glaringly obvious to me are just overlooked by our Tory council. The plans are being made by people who wouldn’t know hardship if it hit them in the face and who think if someone’s poor it’s their own fault. It might just be worth going back to basics here and asking what local authorities are actually for. In 2015 the government itself said local authorities are responsible for providing an extensive range of public services. In addition, they are there to promote the interests of their local community, including the social, economic, environmental, recreational, cultural, community or general development of their area. We would do well to remember this. It might just be me but I can’t see how any of their plans could ever promote the interests of the community. Nearly half the 315,000 people living in our county live in rural areas. Many have no transport and are miles away from an appropriate tip. So, say our Tory friends, let’s charge them more to have big items of waste collected. The other half live in our towns, some of which enjoy health and wealth while others do not. There are pockets of comfort and pockets of deprivation everywhere. Some have good public transport links, some do not. Some have high levels of car ownership; some don’t. Some have plenty of resources to eat well and heat their homes; some have to make the choice between eating and heating. Call me old fashioned but my idea of running a council properly is to support the poorest and most vulnerable, build communities, support organisations that help local people, provide leisure and cultural activities, provide our children with the best education we can give them, take care of older and vulnerable people and generally make the county a great place for everyone who lives in it. I don’t get this sense from the Tories. What I get is take away support to charities and not-for-profit organisations which support poor and vulnerable people. Oh, and while we’re at it, let’s pass on the costs of closing roads and other measures which need to be put in place for local events (measures which we say are necessary!) to anyone organising an event. And while we’re at that, why don’t we increase the cost of burials and cremations? So let’s put a further hit on these costs at what is already a very difficult and costly time. If you didn’t know better you’d think the Tories had utter contempt for the people they’re supposed to be serving. The Northumberland Labour group has been working on an alternative budget. And it adds up. In our budget we would pledge to: • use your money properly, dealing with the massive Tory CUTS in Northumberland. We would prioritise money where it’s most needed. Our costed plan is different to the Tories • protect our most vulnerable people by NOT increasing Care Charges and restore the Council Tax Support for the most vulnerable • protect the Youth Services for young Northumbrians • maintain the cost of waste collection to reduce fly tipping and encourage recycling • build low cost rental homes in areas of need through Advance Northumberland • support those in need by ensuring proper investment is provided to support low paid workers and families claiming Universal Credit I am a very proud resident of Northumberland and I consider it a privilege to serve local people. I want to make sure all the people living in our county feel their council is working for them, not just a chosen few.",

However, Northumberland Labour group Chair Scott Dickinson has pointed out the sheer hypocrisy of the situation. Scott said: “I am delighted to hear our chancellor Philip Hammond has seen fit to give £260m to the borders to stimulate business and growth. In case people didn’t see it, the grant ring fences £5m for Lilidorei, the proposed children’s play village, at Alnwick Gardens. “In other words, £5m of your money is going to be given to the already quite well off Alnwick Gardens. “But rewind to a few years ago when the then Labour-led council wanted to lend Alnwick Gardens £8.5m to get the project off the ground. Uproar from the Tory ranks! “Is it me, or is giving £5m of tax-payers’ money away to this project just a bit hypocritical? “Our Tory friends have just voted in, on the grounds that they’ve had ‘some difficult decision to make’, a mean, cynical budget that will do absolutely nothing for the most vulnerable people in our county. “And nationally, the Tory government is presiding over levels of poverty not seen since the 1800s, food banks, homelessness and rising crime. “It seems hard to believe that, after criticising the previous Labour-led council for offering a loan to kick start the Lilidorei play village, they’re happy to support a £5m give away. “We could have had a repayment of £8.5m with interest and a boost to the council’s finances or we could just support giving the money away, ensuring we could do that by making further cuts in education, social care and housing locally and nationally. “I welcome the jobs this is going to create but giving away tax payers’ money, when the council could have enjoyed a repayment with interest on a loan just beggars belief. “it looks like a fabulous fantasy play village. The Tories in our council and in our country are in a fantasy land of their own.”",

When you hear that people who have left have been required to sign what are effectively gagging clauses.

We’re very concerned to discover that working groups have been set up without any consultation with opposition councillors. We need faith in that membership which may scupper the chances of us being able to help the Council out of the situation.\n“We want to work together with the leadership and all elected members to make this council a great place to work and to provide the excellent services local people need.

Here in Northumberland we have seen figures that could see Northumberland schools collectively lose £16million pounds.\nThis weekend we read Ian Lavery calling for a fair funding deal for Wansbeck schools that could see up to £4.9million lost from his constituency alone.\nLast week Cllr Jackson the new Tory Leader in Northumberland said the County would benefit from £2.2million extra which simply isn’t the case. Whichever way you look at it and calculate it Northumberland loses money. Its quite concerning that the Leader of the Council doesn’t know that.\nIn North Northumberland schools across the area are set to see thousands vanish from already cash strapped rural schools. Scott fears that many of these schools will simply have to close and see boards on windows of what are generally the hearts of communities.\nScott has asked that the Government recognise the rural nature of education and the pressures that can often bring to schools and the additional costs often incurred from schools in rural areas.\nOver the last few months we have seen the unprecedented actions from headteachers in Northumberland asking parents for contributions, considering merging to save more money and closures out for consultation. On all these things Tory MP’s remain silent, hoping that no action will come.\nIf they can find £1billion to buy in votes they can find the money to provide the next generation with the right level of funding to help them achieve.\nScott said: “ Small rural schools cannot sustain this attack on their funding, we will see many schools close and children being asked to travel unacceptable distances. Currently protections are in place for smaller children about travelling but I fear these protections will be lost as the County will struggle to meet them.”\n“This is a blatant attack on young people, removing the opportunities for young people to access good education. We see schools having to spend much of their budgets on repairing schools since the building programs were scrapped to make them safe. Questions are being asked as to whether part of this is about forcing schools into a position of educational decline through lack of funding and suitable buildings to then Ofsted can rate them inadequate and hand the assets over to the Academy Chains. This does nothing apart from Privatise children’s education and puts at risk our valued and committed staff.”\n“I would urge the government to look again at it’s plans and back down from these austerity cuts to education that are risking the future of young people.”\nNotes of additional information:\nSchools with the most deprived intakes would face the greatest average losses in real terms - £579 per pupil in primary schools, and £784 in secondaries.\nThe average real terms loss for primary schools would be £96,481, or £401 per pupil.\nThe average real terms loss for secondary schools would be £290,228, or £365 per pupil.\nIn addition:\nNine in ten schools in England (92%) could face budget cuts in real terms over the next four years.\nNo local authority area is likely to see a real terms funding increase for its schools and academies, even after the redistributive impact of a new formula.\nAverage budget cuts could be 6.5% in primary schools and 9% in secondary schools.",

The decisions are made in Whitehall, not by someone living locally who can see what the local people need.\n“As lovely as it is for the PM to swan around the country giving money out like sweets it would be better to allocate local authorities the appropriate amount in the first place so they can run and develop services.\n“We’ve been very fortunate to get £14.7m to improve cycle and walkways in the county, but this is not tackling the lack of social housing which is a basic factor in levelling up or the fact that people can’t afford to keep warm.\n“Labour has plans in its Take Back Control Bill to devolve more power to local people so they can decide where money should go rather than have to go cap in hand to Whitehall.”",

But if the principle has been accepted that further business rates income should be available to support social care, I am sure that you imminently be announcing a mechanism for sharing this additional income across all local authorities on the basis of need.\nSince Northumberland, like every local authority, is now at a late stage in the process of setting its budget, I would appreciate an urgent reply confirming that extra funding will be available.\nYours sincerely\nCouncillor Grant Davey\nLeader of the Council",

Something vigorously opposed by the Tory Councillor for Amble on the run up to the election. Grabbing headlines like \"Amble under seize\" from developers and such like were continuously muttered on a daily basis.\nNow another surprise U Turn took place at planning where he passionately spoke in support of the planning applications for the Town........\nOne might have been in agreement had the infrastructure planning like the new school etc....not been stopped by his Party and the offer for Amble's young people's education had been set for improvements to house all the children that will come with nearly 1000 homes.\nInstead support was given for hundreds of homes despite the pressures on Schools, Doctors, Roads and many other amenities that were an issue before the election but apparently not now.\nIn the election material pumped out in Amble they were going to \"stop the march of developers\" and Amble Tories repeatedly mislead people about developments and who did or didn't make approvals at planning.\nNow I must point out I am all in favour of appropriate housing, all in favour of housing where its needed and housing that local people can access. But to vigorously oppose more rented accommodation and fully support hundreds of homes with only 15% affordable then that is something that needs to be challenged.\nThe reality is that more rented accommodation for local young people who can't get on the ladder is something that's needed. More people are being asked to move away to find suitable accommodation leaving family and friends behind.\nLocal people are right wondering whats changed since before the election to make opinion change so quickly ???\nTruth of the matter is with the Council and Communities left powerless without a Core Strategy for guidance its a free for all. I suspect there will be many more in the pipline not only for Amble but smaller surrounding communities.\nAmble's Town Council Objected to the scheme saying:\nAmble Town Council object due to the access. With a redesign of the site, it should be possible, practical and much safer to construct an access from the developers land to the existing roundabout at the junction of the A1068 and Percy Drive. The current planned access will lead to congestion and a build- up of traffic when approaching the estate from the North and queuing to cross the highway; similarly exit problems when coming from the estate to travel South.\nCurrent guidance obtained states that lengthening a roundabout for the purpose of access or adding a second round about is permitted and we urge this to be looked into further. This will also help alleviate speeding problems in this area which is already a huge concern on this road.\nGuidance also refers to Disconnected Zones and states that developments should be connected by roads and streets with mixed use although we accept that this is not sometimes the best option, specifically with this development as there is a main road. Concerns over whether the town in its present form can sustain as large a development and would urge a reduction in number to alleviate the impact on the town’s infrastructure.\nIt is vital that parish and town councils are consulted along with NCC to assist in developing agreements to enhance the educational, medical, recreational, youth facilities and healthy transport routes which will be needed with the influx of population should such a development go ahead. Amble Town Council would also welcome the opportunity to work with the schemes Travel Plan Co-ordinator to analyse the existing cycle/walking routes and form a comprehensive plan for the whole town which could be utilised when addressing assistance from developers.\nWhilst there are detailed mitigation plans regarding the environment, the ecology and open spaces, little has been determined about their future maintenance- this must be addressed. Concerns over drainage aspects must be addressed to the authoritys satisfaction and the use of permeable materials should be considered wherever possible. Energy conservation should be addressed with the use of solar panels The proposed footpath installation along Percy Drive may impact upon the trees in the verge which were installed by Amble Town Council to commemorate the Queens Golden Jubilee.\nCare must be taken not to damage these trees or their roots; if any trees are adversely affected, the developer must replace them with suitable semi mature stock. Storage on site of all materials and equipment with wheel washing and road sweeping facilities.\nSummary of Responses:\nSite should be accessed from Percy Drive roundabout; Route of Amble bypass should be safeguarded;\nNeed for pedestrian/cycle links with Hindhaugh Homes site Highway safety concerns including spacing between proposed access and Percy Drive roundabout and car parking around site access if frontage dwellings to the A1068 have rear parking court car parking;\nNo need for this number of new houses; Increased pressure on infrastructure such as schools, GPs, recreational facilities, drainage; Flood risk;\nAdverse impact on wildlife within and outside the site including impact of designated sites nearby; Potential impact on archaeology",

If you’ve got a bit of money in your pocket you can think about spending more on your home and family, investing in retraining for the job of your dreams, eating out, enjoying some entertainment and taking a holiday. All of those activities create jobs for other people who, in turn, spend their money in the economy. Conversely, depressing pay means people have less to spend and jobs are lost if people are unable to afford goods and services.

I have visited Care and Nursing Homes across Northumberland and we have some wonderful facilities and passionate and caring staff. Most Carehomes are part of a chain of some kind, these companies drive to provide care but also make a profit from it.\nMy concern is those people who work as carers, those invaluable people who we trust our loved ones with, are often themselves not cared for or valued.\nThe skills required of them to work with older people often with challenging behaviour or requiring support with the most personal of care needs means they should be respected and paid sufficiently which, in my view is more that the minimum wage.\nI wonder how does the average state paid hourly rate goes from £24ph down to £7.20ph for staff? Yes overheads and other costs must come from that but surly, the staff should be the highest percentage of that money.\nThis is true not only for carers working in Care and Nursing Homes but also out in the community visiting vulnerable people.\nThe living wage is important too, surly care workers should at least receive the Living Wage. These are people who give their all and care for our elderly and those with additional needs.\nI believe we should be putting this issue high on the agenda fair pay for carers, who in the main, do a wonderful job.\nWhile I can't directly influence what companies pay staff what we can do is lobby providers who engage with local government for contracts and set out clear expectations.\nI am proud the trade union I am part of Unison has led on this campaign.\nLeading the way to highlight this issue but also challenge organisations.\nI will contribute to support the campaign and do all I can.",

It sends the wrong signal about his commitment to tackling climate change. “It’s also very disheartening to hear that the new environment secretary Thérèse Coffey sees COP27 as ‘just a group of people meeting in Egypt’ and the best she can think of when asked what she is doing in her own life to contribute to tackling the climate crisis is not throw away the cups she uses at home. Really, we deserve better than this. “What the Tory government seems unable to grasp is climate change signals the end of life on earth as we know it for humanity; ie for you, me and our children. Planet Earth will survive, in fact it will do a lot better without us as we continue to pump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, clear forests and drive many creatures to extinction. “We only need to look at the rising temperatures, floods and wildfires to see the damage that climate change is doing to the planet.

I applaud strong financial performance but not at the cost of residents and services.\n\"In February we voted against a budget that targeted some of the most vulnerable in our communities for increase, we tried to defend service cuts that local people are now seeing an impact on them personally and we are asking rather than put it in the “council coffers” how can people at most need be supported or can some of the damaging cuts to public services be reversed, halved or cushioned.\n\"Many Northumberland families are struggling, some are on the brink. We have seen rents for council tenants increased by eight per cent, service charges by eleven per cent, brown bins, rubbish collections, recycling centre day closures, sheltered accommodation, regeneration schemes, and much more all hit by the Tory February council budget.\n“Now the administration are thrilled about underspending by a couple of million, and I am too, but I want to see that money used to help those in most need.\n\"It's impossible not to smile at the comments from the leader of the council who said the council has kept council tax under three per cent when we all know that a council has to hold a referendum if they want to charge more than three per cent.\n\"So local council tax paying residents have had a 2.99 per cent hike; the most the council could get away with without having to ask residents for their views.\n\"If the council has done this well at the expense of local people, we'll be looking for services to be restored in this financial year..

This manifesto shows a fairer Britain is possible with a Labour government putting the interests of the many before those of the few. Under the Tories, the NHS and social care have been pushed into a state of emergency, with soaring waiting lists and hospitals in financial crisis. Schools across the country face cuts and class sizes are rising, while those young people who want to go to university face huge debts. House building has fallen to its lowest peacetime rate since the 1920s. And our safety has been compromised with more than 20,000 police officers cut since 2010. The Tories have spent the past seven years giving the super-rich tax breaks, worth tens of billions, while working families are set to be on average over £1,400 a year worse off. This general election can be the chance for a fresh start with a Labour government. Labour's fully-costed manifesto sets out a credible vision for the many not the few. Labour will invest to create shared prosperity. We will protect our public services, give the NHS the money it needs and deliver good teaching in good schools for all our children. Labour will guarantee no rise in Income Tax for 95 per cent of taxpayers - those earning under £80,000 a year - and no rise in VAT or National Insurance for everyone. Labour will raise income tax only on the highest five per cent of earners, and will increase corporation tax while keeping it the lowest in the G7. Labour will ask those with the broadest shoulders to contribute more to ensure that schools, hospitals and other public services have the funding they need. Labour will create a National Investment Bank, and regional development banks, to invest in infrastructure and finance growth and good jobs in every region and nation of the UK. This manifesto is about unlocking Britain's potential, so that people are no longer being held back. Labour's key manifesto pledges: 1. Making work pay: A real living wage of £10 per hour by 2020. 2. Investment in Britain: Labour's £500bn big deal to upgrade the economy. 3. Take back control: Rail, energy, water and Royal Mail in public ownership. 4. Jobs and economy first: A Brexit for the many not the few. 5. Extend childcare: 30 hours for all 2 to 4 year olds. 6. Our children's futures: Increase schools funding, cut class sizes and free school meals for all primary school children. 7. Free education: Scrap tuition fees and college fees. 8. End the NHS crisis: Extra funding for our health service. 9. Dignity for all: Towards a National Care Service. 10. Your community safer: 10,000 extra police officers. 11. Decent homes for all: A million new homes to rent or buy. 12. Tax guarantee: No VAT, national insurance or income tax rise for 95%. Labour will build a Britain for the many not the few.",

The group was tasked to develop a strategic and workable framework for all partners to follow, ensuring the opinions of young people are heard and fed through to key decision makers, along with allowing responses and action to be passed back to the young people. The group is the key link between all parties engaging with and working for and on behalf of young people and the key decision makers.\nRecently, the Participation Group was involved in the national Make Your Mark ballot. The campaign involved the Participation Group consulting with 7,000 young people across Northumberland, asking them to vote on the issues that they think Members of the Youth Parliament should campaign on for the year ahead.\nAs a result of the development of the Children’s and Young People’s Strategic Participation Group, the Northumberland Youth Service and Youth Parliament were recently asked to host the Holocaust Memorial Day event which took place in County Hall.\nCynthia Atkin, Chair of Healthwatch, said: “ The Northumberland Youth Service has demonstrated fantastic support in developing the Young People’s Strategic Participation Group which has delivered some fantastic results, the framework that has been developed allows a clear channel of communication to ensure the opinions of young people are listened to by the key decision makers. The voice of young people is very important when developing health and wellbeing services as they are the future of our local area.”\nCouncillor Scott Dickinson said: “Working with young people and ensuring they are given the opportunity to voice their opinions is vital. Young people are the next generation of voters and it is important that they realise their opinions matter and will help towards shaping their future.”",

Chantry Middle School, Newminister Middle School, Goosehill First School and KEVI secondary academy would have relocated in the plan put forward in Nov 2015 but were mysteriously rejected by the schools excluding Goosehill First school which subsequently decided to take up the offer of a new school on the site. That has been put on hold pending the Conservative Secretary of State call in of the school planning application along with two others.\nPlanning experts are said to be ‘bemused’ by the call in and Cllr Grant Davey has called on the Secretary of State to explain why the plans were halted amidst allegations of political interference in planning.\nGrant Davey, Leader of Northumberland Labour group said\n“Cllr Jackson has once again demonstrated he’ll do anything to play politics with decisions of interest to hard working Morpeth folk. He seems to have ‘forgotten’ that the current plan is PLAN A was rejected by a coalition of interested parties. He might want to answer whether any Conservative Cllrs were involved in the decision to block the 4 new schools and a leisure centre plan for the County Hall site. He’s frequently calling for transparency so can he categorically state that no Conservative Cllrs or his Lib Dem coalition partners were involved in scuppering PLAN A?",

Its inability make a decision about Universal Credit leaves families wondering how they are going to feed their children over the coming weeks and months.\n\"Many more people are claiming Universal Credit and they are under tremendous pressure just trying to stay afloat. It's disappointing that the Conservative Government refused to vote with Labour to provide families with certainty and secure our economy. But they can still do the right thing and drop their plans to cut Universal Credit.\n\"The government isn't just incompetent, it has the wrong priorities. It wasted £22bn of taxpayers' money on a testing system that doesn't work and spent billions on contracts to Tory donors - but now can't find the money to support families. Dominic Cummings' £40,000 pay rise alone would have spared 40 families this brutal cut for an entire year.\n\"The government's chronic mismanagement of the pandemic has caused Britain to suffer the worst recession of any major economy. Now it is trying to make low income families pay as a result of their incompetence.\n\"We hear the Prime Minster saying the government is wrapping its arms around the people of Britain. This phrase is being made in such a glib way and doesn't not in any way, shape or form reflect what is going on.\n\"Millions of families are relying on this lifeline as we come through this crisis, especially as they face increased costs associated with the pandemic. Now is the time for more support, not cuts.\n\"By delaying a final decision on whether the cut will go ahead, the government is adding to stress and uncertainty for low income families at an already extremely difficult time. The Tories need to put families first and cancel the cut.\n\"This government doesn't understand what families need. Whether on exams, free school meals, access to remote learning or childcare, families are not a priority for this government.\n\"It's time the government listened properly and responded to the genuine need families find themselves in through no fault of their own.\"",

Brodie McHugh, 22, and Shannon Parker, 21, from Blyth, and Sophie Greenley, 21, of Embleton, all joined Homes for Northumberland, the former arm's-length organisation which manages the council’s housing stock, five years ago. Now, all three have secured full-time positions across the council - Brodie is a project support officer and Sophie and Shannon are housing assistants. Sophie has completed three separate apprenticeships, in customer service, business administration and housing, while Brodie completed one in business and administration, and Shannon completed one in housing.\nThe council is celebrating its commitment to taking on apprentices as part of National Apprenticeship Week, which runs until Friday. Over the last five years, the council has taken on more than 1,000 apprentices, with the NHS in Northumberland taking on 65 and schools in the county taking on 295. Brodie's skills and commitment to her work meant she was highly commended at the Direct Works Forum Repairs and Maintenance awards in 2015, in the non-construction trade apprentice category. She said: \"The skills I have developed over the course of my apprenticeship allow me to look at problem solving in a more creative way.\nThis is essential in my current role, and I may not have got these skills without this apprenticeship.\" Sophie added: \"The apprenticeship has really helped me to improve. The things that I learned, from working in a variety of roles during my apprenticeship, gave me confidence in my ability and were invaluable in securing my current role with the Alnwick housing team.\"\nCoun Scott Dickinson, business chairman of Northumberland County Council, said: \"Apprenticeships are incredibly valuable to the council and to businesses in Northumberland. We support hundreds of apprentices each year at the council and they play a huge role in the work that we do.\" Coun Allan Hepple, cabinet member for housing, added: \"These apprenticeships are great for the whole council, and especially for the housing department.

It's about the immediate community, its about mental health and its about affordability of those close by.\nI'm going to talk about Druridge Bay Country Parks its the only one I know about inside out. Since the announcement I have had a range of correspondence from people outside the area but more worryingly to me those that live near by.\nMrs X wrote:\nDear Cllr Dickinson\nI attend Druridge Bay Country Parks 3 times a week with friends, its part of an informal group I attend that helps us meet, walk and improve our mental health, being surrounded by such beauty in the fresh air has really helped us. I am concerned we will be unable to afford up to £9 a week to park and continue this, can you make this point please.\nBest wishes\nMrs X\nMr A wrote:\nDear Cllr Dickinson\nI attend a running club and it is a massive part of what I do, we are there for over an hour (therefore it wont be free) we often use the cafe and socialise afterwards. It has been a comfort to me for a variety of personal reasons. Is the proposal that we should complete our activities under the hour, rush back to the car and leave. Surly this is a false economy the Council would have made more from us in the cafe? Please get them to see sense.\nBest wishes\nMr A\nI could really go on.............\nThe contact I have had are really from older people in the immediate community that say things like:\n1) We have lived through the Opencast that created the Country Parks, I have paid my Council Tax all my life and now you want me to pay to use the facilities close to us because we are not fit enough to walk to them.\n2) Druridge Bay Country Parks was always supposed to be FREE to locals, it was part of the promise when plans were approved.\n3) I love visiting the site, my doctor has said I need to excercise more, I need to drive to the site but wont be able to afford the charges.\n4) Congestion on the Beach Road will now be unsafe, everyone will go there and park for FREE.\n5) We are being hit by an extra 8% in Council Tax why isn't that paying for these so called improvements.\nRecent coverage in the Gazette & Chronicle\nRead here Northumberland Gazette\nRead here Newcastle Chronicle\nMy desired outcome, (should I have been consulted) would have been a pass for locals and regular users. This would have been an approach that allowed the continuation for those who use the parks for a variety of reasons. They would then not have been pushed out because of cost. This would also allow the additional benefits experienced by the system such as cafe usage and others, this would continue the benefits experienced by local businesses too with people visiting shops etc...",

Almost all councils that provide social care have opted to levy an average £30 charge to help meet the spiralling cost of adult care services, official figures show.\nCouncil leaders warned that despite the steep rise, town halls would still have to reduce services. They said they had little choice but to ask residents to\nLord Porter, the Conservative chair of theLocal Government Association, said: “The extra income this year will help offset some of the financial pressures they face but the reality is that many councils are now beyond the point where council tax income can be expected to plug the growing funding gaps they face. This means councils will have to continue to cut back services or stop some altogether to plug funding gaps.\n“The need for adequate funding for local government is urgent. We have repeatedly warned of the serious consequences of funding pressures facing services caring for the elderly and disabled, protecting children and tackling homelessness for the people that rely on them and the financial sustainability of other services councils provide.”\nThe shadow communities secretary, Andrew Gwynne, said: “This shows that under the Tories you pay more for less. Over the last eight years, council budgets have been reduced by 50% and services cut, with local people forced to pick up the slack as council tax bills soar.”\nThe communities secretary, Sajid Javid, said council tax bills were 7.6% lower in real terms compared with 2010, when the Tories came into government. “Under the last Labour government council tax doubled and in Labour-run Wales it has trebled. It’s Conservative councils across the country who are delivering high-quality services while managing taxpayers’ money more effectively.”\nOn Tuesday, Javid sent in government commissioners to directly control the finances and governance of Northamptonshire county council, which declared effective bankruptcy in February. The Tory-run council is putting up council tax bills by 5.98% from April while pushing though cuts of £40m, including closing 21 of its 36 libraries.\nMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government figures show the biggest year-on-year rises of £86 are found in predominantly Conservative-run county councils, where the average bill is £1,749. The lowest, at £55, for an average bill of £1,405, are in London. The rise is the biggest annual increase since the height of New Labour in 2004-05.\nA National Audit Office report earlier this month said the finances of many local authority finances were unsustainable in the long term, with one in 10 councils providing social care responsibilities vulnerable to insolvency because of rising demand and shrinking financial resources.",

What is not as common is the same openness around mental illness that is seen with some physical conditions. It is important that we remove any stigma around mental health and promote good mental wellbeing.\nIn a recent poll only 14% of the UK population in a survey of over 6000 said they didn't know anyone with mental health issues so we are getting better at talking about it and sharing our difficulties. I welcome the work that is taking place in Northumberland during Mental Health Awareness Week as a way to help people with mental health issues get the early support and advice they need.\nIn Northumberland services work hard to deliver for sufferers ensuring that they have services to support them. Unfortunaltey challenges exist within those services and sometimes people do not get the help they need.\nMental Health is often seen as the poor relation in the Health Service and the Government really needs to look at Mental Health services and the funding of those services. Staff who work in Mental Health services work extremely hard and often find it difficult to cope with the demands on them .\nI would urge the government not to simply add on mental health at the end of speeches, not just play lip service to sufferers but look deeply at the issues in mental health services. After all a mentally well population are a healthier population and early help is best.\nThe Charity Mind is a great support service and if you need support I suggest you given them a ring.",

I hope such frank comments from senior people of their own political persuasion change the behaviours they are presenting. However to date we have seen no change\".\nAside from the Peers concerns around the Tory Councillors the positive findings of the report were: The Local Government Association (LGA) carried out a Peer Challenge of the County Council's corporate management arrangements in November 2014. Feedback was very positive and highlights included commentary on the Council's: Strong and decisive political leadership Effective and empowering senior management Positive relationships with partners, particularly Town and Parish Councils and Health Strong financial position Integation of social care with health Use of ARCH as its economic delivery arm What shone out from the LGA’s feedback, though, was the passion and pride in Northumberland that they found with Members, staff and partners and an energy and enthusiasm to deliver for the people of Northumberland. In their words, they found not only a ‘can do’ culture but a ‘want to do’ culture.",

We also know that regular check ups, apart from the obvious thing of making sure our teeth are ok, can spot other health issues. Dental health and hygiene is important and it should be accessible for everyone.\nSo I was delighted to get a letter from NHS England telling me that a contract has been agreed to provide NHS dental services in Rothbury and Hadston/Amble.\nI have done my best to take part in the process. I've written submissions to scrutiny committee, worked with Health Watch and NHS England to host consultations in the community working in partnership with Hadston House. I've raised this at the Heath and Wellbeing board and other senior boards I am part of. The Local Parish Council has worked on this all providing submissions supporting my view after I presented to them.\nI explained to all these bodies that the practice at Hadston had recently had a £1m refurbishment and the new facility had been attracting patients. I explained how people simply wouldn’t be able to afford to travel; it’s a £5.80 bus ride for anyone without their own transport. I explained how people with a number of other health conditions would not be able to travel for dental care.\nI kept the faith with the consultation, although in many ways it was flawed. I encouraged those who could to take part; they would be listened to.\nI felt like I was given assurances that a new provider would be asked to provide in Hadston.\nSo, imagine my anger when I read in the letter from NHS England that, if planning permission is granted, people living in Rothbury will have a practice in the town and people in ‘Hadston/Amble’ will have a practice - in Amble.\nWhat is the point of taking part in consultations if no one listens? Well they might have been listened to, but they weren’t heard. They feel let down and like it was a waste of time.\nOnce again Hadston is becoming the even poorer relation with another service stripped from the village. Health planners have cars; they make a passing reference to ‘transport issues’ and think that they will magically ma\nke them go away.\nI am deeply disappointed on behalf of the people of Hadston at this outcome. Yet another service gone leaving them an even poorer relation.",

This state of affairs should never have happened and, given that the government has a duty of care to the people it serves, it has let them down monumentally.\n“The safety net of the welfare state is being removed and people are supposed to rely on charities and food banks as their safety net. This is uncivilised in what is supposed to be a civilised society.\n“It is absolutely shameful and, with the hike in energy bills, it is an extremely worrying time for many people. The best the government can do is to lend people the money while energy companies make obscene profits. The government and business do not care about ordinary people.\n“We will be working in the council and nationally to hold this government to account. This situation needs to change and we will work tirelessly in the interests of Northumbrians to address this desperate situation.”",

The lack of action and commitment to young people and struggling families from this government should do nothing apart from give deep feelings of shame to politicians.\nSpending more on services, providing real determination and commitment to stop the rising costs, and a return to the Victorian era championed by nobody apart from Reece Mogg must be worth the investment needed in these services.",

It doesn’t and history has proved that.\n“In the meantime, all the previous Prime Minister’s fine words about levelling up have crumbled into dust. I honestly don’t know how these people sleep at night when they are quite happy to subject millions of ordinary people to a life of struggle so they can reward a few already very well-off people. The county is less equal than it’s ever been and this will only get worse, with thousands of human casualties. It’s truly shameful.\n“Labour believes the answer is paying people properly for the work they do, putting the time, effort and resources into supporting our fabulous NHS and social care who we were only on our doorsteps clapping for a couple of years ago.\n“The Tories want to throw money at energy companies and borrow even more money to pay us to soften the energy cost blow; money that we will as taxpayers will have to find in future years. Labour wants to employ people to insulate homes to make them greener and cut down on energy use and build the homes that people need.\n“The government must hold ordinary people, the people they are supposed to be serving and many of who switched allegiances and voted for them, in utter contempt.”",

Most of us take this for granted. But in our county in 2019, 15 people had no roof above their head and no bed to sleep in. They slept rough. In 2018 this figure was zero in Northumberland.\nWhile most people agree that the way we count who's sleeping rough on our streets is not perfect, currently it's the only way we can measure what's happening. It's done by estimating who's sleeping rough on a single night between 1 October and 30 November every year. In a rural county like ours, counting who's sleeping rough is more challenging.\nThe figure of 15 is more than double the number recorded in any of the years since this way of counting rough sleepers was brought in 10 years ago. And the figures don't take account of sofa surfers; people who've got no home, but rely on the kindness of friends for shelter.\nIn my view the rise in rough sleepers and a Conservative government is not a coincidence. Since 2010 we have seen the harshest and most cruel changes in welfare; the system that is supposed to act a safety net for people who find themselves without the basics of human life.\nRemember, homelessness could happen to any of us. A marital breakup, unemployment, the death of parents who were living in social housing\nOur council has a strategy to tackle homelessness.\nIt was 'refreshed' last year and will be reviewed at the end of the Conservative council's five year term in 2021. I expect the council is questioning why its rough sleeping numbers have actually gone up, even though they have strategy to tackle it.\nThe council's head of housing and public protection (the clue's in the job title) Phil Soderquest, tells us the council can't tackle homelessness on its own and they are working with partners.\nThat might be true but they, as a local authority, should be leading the charge to tackle an issue that simply should not be happening in 2020.",

Last autumn the scheme to reopen the ruined 15th century pele tower at Cresswell was awarded £93,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund - with the county council adding a further £6,000. Once restored with a new roof and refurbished interior, the fortified landmark is intended to be a key tourist attraction in the region as well as a new community facility. Project organisers plan to install electricity in order to host exhibitions among a range of events. The development phase of the project is now underway which will involve a more detailed structural survey, producing a range of business and management plans, commissioning an ecology survey and developing a new website.\nIn addition, the community archaeology project which includes excavation in the large field to the east of the tower, is ready to start. The work will take place over the coming weeks, culminating in an open day at the tower on February 19.\nCommunity project manager and local resident Barry Mead is delighted with the number of people who have volunteered to help with the archaeology scheme.\nHe said: “We’ve had a fantastic response to calls for volunteers to help with the archaeology project and it really shows how much interest there is in this important Northumberland landmark.\n“All the volunteer places are now filled and we’re looking forward to seeing what we discover during this phase of the scheme.” County councillor Scott Dickinson, ward member and business chair, has supported the project with £3,000 from his council capital allowance, matched by a further £3,000 of heritage funding. He added: \"It’s great news that we’re now entering the next phase of this exciting project. The tower has the potential to be a major draw for the increasing number of visitors to the county, and I’m delighted the local community is playing such a key role.” \"This work is another example of the council working to boost economic growth in towns and villages across Northumberland.\" Once the development phase is complete and approved, the final delivery phase is scheduled to get underway next summer and complete by summer 2019.

And the government must have extensive arrangements for testing and contact tracing to keep it that way.\nTest 2 : A national plan for social distancing\nThe government must have a national plan including parameters for both appropriate physical distancing and levels of social mixing in schools, as well as for appropriate PPE, which will be locally negotiated at school-by-school and local authority level.\nTest 3 : Testing, testing, testing!\nComprehensive access to regular testing for children and staff to ensure our schools and colleges don’t become hot spots for Covid-19.\nTest 4 : Whole school strategy\nProtocols to be put in place to test a whole school or college when a case occurs and for isolation to be strictly followed.\nTest 5 : Protection for the vulnerable\nVulnerable staff, and staff who live with vulnerable people, must work from home, fulfilling their professional duties to the extent that is possible. Plans must be specifically address the protection of vulnerable parents, grandparents and carers.\nScott added: “Ten years of austerity which have plunged many more children into poverty and severely compromised what schools are able to offer have made this bad situation worse.\n“Resources are needed urgently to provide schools with the necessary staffing, materials and equipment to allow them to adapt and protect all staff and students. We cannot have them trying to make do with the reduced money they have.\n“No wants a case of this being more haste, less speed. It's important in the interests of children, teachers, support staff and families to do this, but do it correctly. Robust, resourced safety measures are most definitely needed and should be supported by all.\n“I want to see normality and schools return as soon as it's safe to do so, nobody wants children to miss out on education. I will fully support anyway I can with the safe reopening of schools.\n“It would be tragic if all the sacrifices people have made to stay at home and stay physically distant from each other were lost as the restrictions are lifted.

Northumberland County Councils Labour Group who were the Administration at the time loaned £25million to Northumbria Healthcare Trust in order for a new Hospital facility to be created. This was to ensure that investment in facilities in Berwick took place. Scott, who chaired the meeting that agreed the investment support said at the time it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to help provide these facilities for Berwick. It was also a far better financial solution that that of an expensive PFI with private companies taking funds out of future resources. Many consultation events and public meetings took place over a period of time and then the project stalled. The governments change of direction on the NHS and the additional pressures the NHS faced seemed to be a contributing factor. Scott has continued to be supportive of the scheme and is working to find answers and solutions to delays from the Trust. The public have been assured that the project will continue but Scott continues to seek timescales on that. He said \"it's important momentum is maintained and focus on the scheme continues. The money was loaned to the Trust for the specific purpose of delivering modernised health care provision in a new facility at Berwick and that is what everyone is working towards. We will continue to be supportive and ensure that happens.\" In a recent statement when the plans were pushed back to Summer 2017 the Trust Chief Executive said: \"I would like to firmly reassure local people that all partners remain fully committed to a new healthcare facility for Berwick.

This money is to be used for working with volunteer groups, training, buying litter pickers (those things with handles that save you having to bend down and pick up rubbish, not people!) and other equipment needed when you’re cleaning up an area. It’s all good stuff and Northumberland County Council has done better than its neighbours with a grant of £55,925. I’m not sure how the government did its sums at a national level but something seems to have gone wrong at county level. The trouble with this end of year money is it doesn’t give proper time for planning or serious thought about how it should be allocated. Northumberland County Council has decided to allocate it to the 12 largest towns in the county, depending on size. Great news for our biggest town Blyth and the towns in between like Berwick, Hexham, Prudhoe, Ashington and Cramlington, but nothing for Newbiggin and Bedlington which could really do with the clean up cash.\nNothing also for Belford, Rothbury, Bellingham, Seahouses and Allendale Town. There are 14 towns in our county apparently and the money is being split up over 12 of them. It makes you wonder if anyone actually looked at the litter problem across the county and thought ‘let’s allocate it where it’s needed most’. It doesn’t look like it…",

The plan has been branded a ‘OAP’s Bedroom Tax’ and is set for introduction as part of the government’s new ‘welfare reform’ bill.\nNorthumberland Labour have identified ‘hundreds of potential losers’ across Northumberland if the policy gets the go ahead and it could see some pensioners across the wider region lose up to £1700 per year.\nAge UK have already started to campaign to stop the measures which have been described as ‘as vicious as the bedroom tax’ by Frank Field MP.

It make absolutely no sense.\n“Since the Conservative government came into power 13 years ago literally millions of pounds have been wiped off the council budget. At a time when the county council was led by Labour, officers, staff and councillors came up with imaginative ways to minimise the impact of these cruel cuts. Maybe the first questions this Tory-led council should be asking is when are they going to get the appropriate level of funding needed to support people in our county.\n“If you speak to officers and staff they often know where savings can be made. People on the receiving end of services can often see where inefficiencies lie as well.\n“If the council directed its efforts into listening to those who work for it and ensuring that staff can be retrained and relocated, keeping any job losses to those who wish to leave or change their job within the council, then these savings could be made without engaging expensive consultants.\n“These companies are famous for doing the equivalent of borrowing your watch, telling you the time and charging you millions for the pleasure.\n“We firmly believe the expertise already lies within the council and the county.

This is with the backdrop of reducing Full Council Meetings and reducing Scrutiny Meetings which are the only opportunities that exist for ALL Councillors to ask questions.\nThe previous Administration had a mixed Cabinet which included the Leaders from ALL political groups. This isn’t now the case, it is a Tory only Cabinet and therefore the ability to scrutinise, ask questions and challenge has never been so important. The secrecy and single party changes have locked openness and transparency out of Northumberland County Council.\nIt is my belief that members, elected by the people regardless of Party have the right to ask questions of the Administration.\nSince the formation of the Unitary Authority there has been a Libdem Administration and a Labour one, neither have attempted to restrict members from carrying out duties as elected representatives of the communities they serve.\nIn fact all administrations have put up with repetitive Questions from Leading Tories, Grandstanding by Leading Tories and general misleading by Leading Tories over the years because as an elected member they had the right to ask questions however bizarre they were.\nSo after trying to cut off democracy and winning the vote the meeting took a turn for the worst, rules thrown out the window and behaviour experienced that in my view is completely unacceptable and definitely not something I would have tolerated during my time as Chair in the Chamber.\nTory Councillors allowed to give big intros to questions, yet others were shouted at and heckled, verbally abused and generally intimidated and bullied whenever they tried to speak. I found it most concerning.\nFemale members of the Council talked over the top of and silly childish smirking and laughing was experienced when none Tory members spoke.\nClearly it would seem the fact the Conservatives won the Council by fluke for the first time in 50yrs the power has gone to there heads. The arrogance and behaviours experienced clearly upset members of the public who came to tell me they were complaining at the end, they also felt the need to thank me for sticking up for one female Councillor who was being continually bullied and intimidated during the entire meeting. She was being mocked and appallingly treated in my view.\nNow as a previous Chamber Chair I have smashed the gavel down on Labour members, Liberal Democrat and Tory members to ensure order is kept and that ALL members are heard whether I disagreed with them or not. As Chair your role is to ensure ALL members get the opportunity to speak in a controlled and fair environment abiding by the rules. It can get excited at times and that’s to be expected as everyone is passionate about what they are saying, but it needs to be in a controlled and fair environment.\nFull Council had only been in full swing for an hour and 50 minutes when the chair just decided he would break for comfort. Constitution of the Council states that after 3hrs the meeting can be asked to take a break but members must approve the pause. It would seem now that we just pause whenever they fancy or if it's getting a little hot under the collar.\nI just thought yesterday was a crying shame for Democracy in terms of trying to stop Opposition Members from asking questions and I thought it was a terrible display, if there ever was one on how NOT to allow a meeting to be conducted.",

We have also had schools in Hexham writing to parents asking for donations for basic equipment.\nThis funding formula if they implement it as the plan will see an estimated £16million out of the budgets across Northumberland resulting in the potential closure of Rural Schools who are already struggling.\nWe are promising to protect school budgets, this will give schools the opportunity to refocus from worrying about finance to caring for and educating children.\nWe need strong and decisive leadership on schools without meddeling and budget cuts.\nThe Grammar School project and that of FREE Schools should be scrapped and funds redirected to the schools we already have.\nIn Northumberland the Labour Administration at County Hall from 2013-2017 had one of the biggest School Capital Build programmes that invested in the future of our children, but schools need the allocated funds to operate in the best way they can and help children achieve.\nBelow is the Labour Party Manifesto for Education.\nEducation manifesto. What will a Labour government do for young people in Britain?\nHere are the seven things you need to know: 1) We’ll protect the entire education budget We must invest in education if all young people are to have the chance to succeed. We’ll ensure the whole budget - including early years, schools and post-16 education and skills - is protected. 2) We’ll restore the role of Sure Start There are now 763 fewer Sure Start centres than when David Cameron took office. We’ll put Sure Start Centres back at the centre of communities and obliged them to provide childcare. 3) We’ll deliver smaller class sizes The Tories have spent millions on their wasteful Free Schools programme. We’ll put that money to better use to deliver smaller class sizes for five, six and seven-year olds to give children the best start. 4) We’ll tackle failing schools The standard of education a child gets still depends on where they live. We’ll change that. We’ll create new Directors of School Standards to support local schools to improve and respond to the concerns of parents. 5) We’ll make sure our children are taught by qualified teachers David Cameron scrapped the requirement for teachers to be qualified. That can’t be right. We’ll require all teachers to get qualified and build their skills throughout their careers. 6) We’ll build a gold-standard vocational route through education For decades, governments have ignored the 50 per cent of young people not going to university. We’ll change that with a gold-standard Technical Baccalaureate and an apprenticeship for every school leaver who gets the grades. 7) We’ll guarantee all young people face-to-face careers advice Young people who haven’t got the connections or the guidance to make the right choices are missing out. We’ll guarantee all young people face-to-face careers advice and support young people from school to work.",

The complaint alleges that the Conservative party have continued to mislead the public about the cost of the new ‘hub’ in Ashington even though as far back as Dec 2016, Cllr Jackson was publicly admonished by the council’s CEO and s151 officer Steven Mason over the use of inaccurate information. The £80m ‘fake news’ story has been repeated and reprinted on a number of social media sites including Morpeth Matters which is administered by senior Conservatives and their supporters.\nThe decision on a planning application for the County Hall site has also been called in by Conservative Secretary of State Sajid Javed in a move branded as ‘blatantly politically motivated’ by Labour group leader Grant Davey. He went on to describe the call in as a ‘political hijacking by politicians set on dividing communities’.\nCllr Gallacher said “Cllr Jackson has and is engaging in ‘fake news’ on County Hall in a deliberate attempt to mislead the public. His councillors repeat this ‘fake news’. My town and other market towns stand to benefit from the move from Morpeth and it’s time Cllr Jackson and his party were held to account for their blatant attempts to mislead the public”.\nCllr Webb said “Every councillor signs up to a code of conduct and while they are councillors they should adhere to it. Local Tories now aided by their government seem to be intent on spreading their own version of ‘fake news’ about County Hall. I’m urging that they are held to account for a blatant misrepresentation of the facts. They’ve been corrected in public by the independent CEO about the use of ‘fake figures’ yet they continue to use ‘fake news’ to peddle their brand of setting communities against each other. They’re bringing the council into disrepute”.\nEnd\nOfficial Council Minute Extract",

At the National Pensioners Convention I went along to show my support and that of the council. I really hope the Tories who now run the Council ensure that dignity in care and the code is championed across services. Treating everyone with dignity is a fundamental part of our council’s service ethos but we can all do our bit to support vulnerable people whether at work or in our communities. In this country we continue to hear terrible stories of the elderly being abused, neglected, abandoned and humiliated. Children are protected by law but there is nothing there for the protection of older people. Championing the code and dignity in services also gives everyone working in care services the chance reflect on their work and the positive impact it has on the lives of the people they support they carry out wonderful work and are not often properly rewarded. Over two million health and social care staff in the UK work around the clock to provide care and support for those most in need. Thousands of staff provide a dignified service in their place of work and continually strive to give the best care and support possible 365 days a year to people who are at their most vulnerable. The ‘Ten Point Dignity Challenges’ are I championed and I hope the current leaders will champion are: 1.Have a zero tolerance of all forms of abuse. 2.Support people with the same respect you would want for yourself or a member of your family. 3.Treat each person as an individual by offering a personalised service. 4.Enable people to maintain the maximum possible level of independence, choice and control . 5.Listen and support people to express their needs and wants. 6.Respect people's right to privacy. 7.Ensure people feel able to complain without fear of retribution. 8.Engage with family members and carers as care partners. 9.Assist people to maintain confidence and positive self-esteem. 10.Act to alleviate people's loneliness and isolation.",

Yet in the papers and speeches it was all justified by the need for the money to repair properties.\n“With the last Labour Council hundreds of Council houses received essential repairs, hundreds of Council homes were built, and decent home standard improvements began, why have they let it build up for 7yrs and now on the run up to an election suddenly pledge money.\nThe Council Leaders keep talking about inequalities but target the most vulnerable for more money to fix poor decision making and political choices.”",

Labour spokesperson said: “Our rivers and sea are the pride of the county, attracting local people and visitors for recreation and leisure. The result of this FOI request is extremely disturbing, with the potential to spoil areas of natural beauty and risk public health.” Analysis of Environment Agency figures obtained under Freedom of Information requests by the party, shows that since 2016 raw sewage has been pumped into Northumbrian Water’s area natural environment for a total of 551,851 hours. This equates to a duration of 22,993 days or 62 years of sewage discharge taking place across the Northumbrian Water area; with a raw sewage spill somewhere in the Northumbrian Water area every 23 minutes. They added: “This highlights that the situation is only drastically worsening under the Tories who cut two-thirds of the Environment Agency grant, which covers environmental surveillance and enforcement. “It’s yet another example of where the government has thought, quite wrongly, that if they cut surveillance companies will do the right thing. “Here we have a government that shelved sewage discharge reduction plans at the beginning of August but has since had to do a u-turn due to mounting public pressure.

It would still encourage people to use buses and allow companies to generate cash.”\nMeanwhile, on the winter fuel payment, he said: “People get it whether they want it or not, but we should just make it something you have to ask for – you have to request a payment.”\nThe issue was then raised in Derbyshire, where the Tory council leader was reported to have said he supports Lord Porter on this issue. An online petition has been launched – http://bit.do/save buspass – and now Northumberland Labour has said that ‘every pensioner in the county can expect to be asked to sign the petition on paper and online’.\nLabour leader Grant Davey said: “The health, wellbeing, social and economic life of most pensioners is enhanced by free access to buses and assistance with payments for winter fuel with the worst-off older people benefitting the most.\n“The idea that the crisis in health and social care is caused by these benefits and that pensioners should pay for this is completely misguided. Indeed, it is bus travel and help with heating that keeps people healthy and reduces the overall care bill. No one should doubt that if these two benefits were to go then the crisis in health would worsen rather than improve.”\nScott Dickinson said: \"I am appalled, pensioners up and down the Country need and use bus passes. Especially in a place like Northumberland where places are so rural and far between\"\n\"In rural Northumberland and along the coast we can experience some harsh temperatures and the winter fuel allowance introduced by Labour helps older people keep warm. I can't believe people who've paid in all their lives could be targeted in this way.\"",

As the weather gets colder this will mean people make the choice between heating and eating. It’s just not good enough in a modern country like ours.\n“Bringing the prepayment energy prices into line with those for direct debit customers would provide relief to four million households whose disposable incomes are, on average, half that of households paying by direct debit.\n“Labour would eliminate the gap between the two price caps and reimburse energy companies for the difference.

The Tories are a threat to pensioners. The Tories have launched an all-out attack on pensioners and now you face four major burdens under a Conservative government. The Tories have announced they would: 1. Scrap the “Triple Lock” on state pensions after 2020, this means your pension is not guaranteed to increase by 2.5 per cent every year 2. Raise the State Pension Age, meaning 34 million people will face the prospect of working longer 3. Means-test Winter Fuel Payments, this means 18080 pensioners in Berwick Upon Tweed Constituency could be left without the financial support they need to heat their home in the winter 4. Make even more people pay for their own social care. In the last parliament £4.6 billion was cut from social care budgets and now the Tories want to use the value of your property to contribute to the costs of social care at home, making it even harder for pensioners to receive the care they deserve. The Tories are failing to guarantee a decent standard of living for older people. Only Labour will stand up for pensioners and protect your pension. If you have contributed all of your life it is only fair you have access to a secure and dignified retirement. That is why Labour will protect pensioner incomes by legislating to keep the Triple Lock on state pensions over the lifetime of the next parliament. This means your pension will rise each year by whichever is highest: average earnings, inflation or 2.5 per cent. Labour will also keep Winter Fuel Payments and free bus passes for everyone over the age of 60. Labour will ensure that there is no rise in the State Pension age beyond 66, and we will give the NHS and social care the funding they need, making it easier for you to access the help and health care you may need. This election is a choice between a Labour Party who will stand up for the many and a Conservative Party who only look after the privileged few. The Tories have failed to protect pensioners, only Labour will stand up for pensioners to provide the dignity and security in retirement that you deserve.

Great bit of partnership work between the two Parish Councils and me as the County Councillor.\nSixteen remote cameras have been placed around the shopping precinct in Hadston, to protect local businesses from antisocial behaviour and shoplifting.\nFour cameras have also been installed in the park and community centre at Widdrington Station, to reassure local people and deter would-be vandals in the park and village centre.\nCounty Councillor Scott Dickinson used his small schemes fund to pay for the community centre scheme and contribute to the other two, in partnership with East Chevington Parish Council, and Widdrington and Stobswood Parish Councils.\nHe said: “The CCTV gives local people and businesses a feeling of extra safety and is also a very good crime prevention tool for the community and the local police, who have said that they find the cameras useful.\n“The park is the latest of the three schemes. It’s a well-used route into the village centre and we felt it was important to have the added reassurance of a responsive and modern CCTV system. It means that people will feel safer and more confident using the park, whether they are spending time there or just passing through.\n“The whole of the community will benefit from the cameras and I would like to thank the parish councils for their support in making these schemes possible.”\nPaul Claridge, of East Chevington Parish Council said: “The Parish Council believed it was very important for local residents to have a sense of security. The old CCTV System was failing, so I am delighted it has been replaced.”\nAt Widdrington Station the system is monitored by the parish council and is password activated. Local police can also log on to the system and keep an eye on key locations.\nKevin Batson, of Widdrington Station and Stobswood Parish Council said: “This is a very large park which was completely transformed a few years back and is a very important space for the community.\n“However, there have been a few problems lately which have threatened to spoil the park for other people and the parish council was determined not to let things get out of hand.\n“Having CCTV is another way of letting people know that we won’t tolerate things like anti social behaviour, dog fouling, or vandalism.\n“The path that runs through the park is used by a lot of residents going to and from work, and also elderly people going to collect their pensions. Putting in the cameras is a step we had to take. It even monitors against young people climbing the fence over to the railway tracks. It’s a form of safety for everybody.\n“We went for a system that we think people will feel comfortable with. We are very fortunate in this community to have a phenomenal local officer. He is a credit to the role he plays and he has helped us choose the equipment.”\nResidents can report any suspicious activity in the park and other key locations by dialling 101. Activities can then be monitored in real time by the police.",

It is also a step towards encouraging existing councillors who may want to start a family or those who find themselves with caring responsibilities to remain as councillors.\n“We bent over backwards to ensure the way the motion was phrased was acceptable to all councillors because we strongly believe this development will encourage a wider range of people to come into politics. To witness the Liberal Democrat leader says it’s acceptable for councillors to just not turn up to meetings is living in the Dark Ages. Labour councillors take attendance at council meetings very seriously and they turn up, as those who put them there would expect them to.”\nRebecca Wilczek, member for Bedlington East, who seconded the motion said: “Dozens of councils have brought in policies on parental, adoption, and carer leave for councillors. It’s about time we followed suit.”\nScott Dickinson added: “Our council should be supportive and inclusive and it should reflect the population it serves.\n“We’re pleased that the motion gained overwhelming cross party support. The vast majority, with one or two notable exceptions, could see that it makes complete sense and brings the council into the 21st century.”",

By 2012/13, this had fallen to 66% and then by 2013/14 it took another sharp fall to 62%.\n• Students are graduating with debts of £44,000, which is putting off so many talented young people from perusing a university education.\n• Theresa May has done nothing to address the education problems caused by seven years of Tory-rule; instead, she has pursued a host of meaningless and uncosted policies, like a ‘new generation’ of grammar schools, which will do nothing to help the majority of families across the country.\n• Higher education should not be a mark of privilege, and we need to ensure that those from lower income families are supported. That is why we will be abolish tuition fees, one of the biggest injustices being meted out on students.\n• As early as this Autumn, 400,000 university students will be freed from an average of around £27,000 of debt if Labour is elected next month.\n• Although tuition fees will be abolished from 2018 under the next Labour Government, we will write off fees’ debt for students planning to start this September.\n• The change from maintenance grants to loans is a regressive policy that will leave students from low and middle income backgrounds facing higher debts that they may never be able to repay. Bringing back the maintenance grant is an investment in our young people, helping them access a university education, and providing us with the highly educated and highly skilled workforce that we need.\n• Around half a million students from low and middle income backgrounds were entitled to the maintenance grant, but under the Tories’ change from grant to loans, the would face a much higher debt burden than their more affluent peers.\n• English students already face some of the highest levels of student debt in Europe, with the average student graduating with £44,000 of debt;\n• This is a particular problem for students from low and middle income backgrounds, who are more likely to need to rely on loans to fund their studies. This means that increasing the amount of debt they face by replacing grants with loans could act as a disincentive that will stop them pursuing higher education at all;\n• This latest Tory policy to increase the debt faced by students is likely to exacerbate the growing crisis in the number of state school pupils at university, which has fallen since Labour last left office, with a particularly sharp decline after tuition fees were trebled;\n• Reversing this policy is an investment in our young people, and will help to ensure that all young people are able to access higher education, whatever their background;\n• By investing in our young people and their education we will ensure that Britain has the highly educated and highly skilled workforce it needs to compete in the globalised economy.\nScott said: \"I'm pleased Labour's policy is to ensure that young people who want to can access University education fairly. The introduction of fees has again divided access between the rich and poor with students having to think about not going because of cost.\"\n\"As someone who works with young people I want opportunities for all and accessibility for all regardless of background so everyone's talents can be unlocked.\"",

It’s practically impossible for people to plan their lives, look after themselves and their families and simply enjoy a decent standard of living under these working conditions.\n“Northumberland Labour wants to see that change and that’s exactly what’s promised under a Labour government.”\nLabour’s new deal for workers includes:\nBetter and fairer workplaces by giving workers full rights from day one on the job, outlawing fire and rehire, a new right to work flexibly and strengthening trade unions\nUsing government contracts to support British businesses so we buy, make and sell more in Britain and a strong industrial strategy that delivers investment in green jobs including building electric cars.\nA fair and level playing field on tax between multinational and local businesses; tackle harassment and discrimination at work.\nA jobs-promise for young people with a guarantee of quality education, training or employment, creating tens of thousands of apprenticeships by ending the Treasury raid of the apprenticeship levy\nMaking sure that work pays enough to bring up a family with a real living wage of at least £10 an hour for all with more workers covered by collectively agreed deals which boost pay",

However, the announcement comes after seven years of delays which have effectively brought any signs of improvement in the town to a standstill.\nLeader Scott Dickinson said: “While this investment is, of course, very welcome it’s a long time coming. We really must thank Labour North of Tyne leaders, strong Labour councillors and our Labour MP for their support and for pursuing this.\n“The council officers, local councillors, residents and businesses have all worked tirelessly on this. The scheme should never have been rejected by government originally and made as an afterthought. It should not be claimed as ‘council approving the money’; it’s them accepting donations from others based on the work done by others.\n“Labour has always invested in Ashington and will continue to do so. People only need to look at the start of the improvements to the town before the Conservatives pulled the plug.\n“Our councillors will work with residents to ensure that it is spent with them in mind and with them being consulted. We will ensure that we hold to account the spend on that money to get the most out of it for the people of Ashington; now we have something, we can’t let it be misspent.\n“I can also give this commitment today, as previous Labour councils before. After the next election if the public chooses a Labour council, investment in Ashington and all towns that need it across Northumberland will only build on this money. Nothing will be done half-heartedly.”",

And through this campaign we are hoping to ensure that every household in Northumberland that is eligible gets every penny they are due.\n“So our message is clear – if you are pensioner please check if you could be due around £4,000 through Pension Credit and the Winter Fuel Allowance to help with bills this winter, and if you know a pensioner please do everything you can to encourage them to apply.”\nChancellor, Rachel Reeves, said:\n“The £22 billion blackhole inherited from the previous governments means we are having to take tough decisions now to fix the foundations of our economy – including making the Winter Fuel Payments available to those most at need.\n“1.3 million pensioners are already going to get help with fuel bills this year because they’re claiming pension credit – but thousands more are eligible. So, if you know someone who could get pension credit and help with their fuel bills, now is the time to help them apply for pension credit.”\nWork and Pensions Secretary, Liz Kendall said:\n“Thousands of pensioners are missing out on Pension Credit worth on average £3,900 per year. That needs to change.\n“It’s easier than ever to check if you are eligible, including with our online calculator, and if your circumstances have changed since the last time you looked – I urge you to check again.\n“Friends, families and neighbours can also encourage their loved ones to apply, so that they are not missing out on this vital benefit.”\nMartin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said:\n“It’s a national tragedy that nearly a million eligible low-income pensioners who’ve paid into the system for years are still missing out on the crucial Pension Credit financial lifeline – a better name for it would be the State Pension Top Up.\n“So whatever your age, take a second to understand how it works, so we can all ensure the message is spread to every nook and granny (and grandpas too). Especially as the government has just severed Winter Fuel Benefits eligibility for millions, yet if you claim Pension Credit you’ll still get it.\n“While for most single pensioners, you need total weekly income, including from savings, under around £218 (pensioner couples under £333) to be very likely to qualify, my rule of thumb is spend a few minutes to check even with weekly income up to £235 (pensioner couples £350) as there’s still a chance some may be eligible.\n“Pension Credit can pay out £1,000s a year, but even if it’s only going to pay you thruppence, still claim it! As once you get it, it’s a gateway benefit that opens the door to other entitlements – including council tax reductions, free TV licences (if age over 75) dental and optical support and more.”\nPensioners whose weekly income is below £218.15 for a single person or £332.95 for a couple should check to see if they are eligible for this support which is worth £3,900 a year on average, using DWP’s online calculator.\nPeople with a severe disability, carers and those who are responsible for a child or young person who lives with them could get more. Pension Credit can also include extra amounts for certain housing costs, such as ground rent or service charges.\nThis work is part of a wider plan to ensure economic stability for pensioners by protecting the Triple Lock and supporting households with their energy bills through the £150 Warm Home Discount and the Warm Homes Plan – upgrading millions of homes this Parliament.\nOver the next five years, more than 12 million pensioners could see their State Pension increase by over a thousand pounds as a result of the commitment to the Triple Lock.",

It’ll be interesting to see if appeal wins the day.\nWith the lack of a Core Strategy and the continued issues surrounding planning relating to allegations of bullying and intimidation of Council officials by leading Tories trump this decision?\nBids for new homes on the edge of two north Northumberland villages have been unsuccessful, after councillors refused both schemes. Planning officers had suggested that the applications, for Bamburgh and Embleton, be rejected at last Thursday’s (June 21) meeting of the North Northumberland Local Area Council. And in each case, the committee did so unanimously. The Bamburgh application was the first to go to committee since the North Northumberland Coast Neighbourhood Plan passed referendum last month, although a plan in Seahouses was discussed on the day of the vote. In line with the key policy in that plan which aims to limit second/holiday homes, the proposal was for 10 principal occupancy dwellings, ranging from two to four-bedroom, on land east of The Friars, Radcliffe Road. However, according to the planning officer’s report, it falls foul of other policies as it ‘proposes an inappropriate form of development outside of the settlement boundary’ and ‘would not represent appropriate development in the open countryside’. Tim Ferguson, speaking on behalf of The Friary Management Company, described it as ‘a speculative development’ which ‘risks sprawl along the B1342’.Coun Andrew Bardgett, from Bamburgh Parish Council, said it would be ‘a complete kick in the teeth’ for everyone who worked on the neighbourhood plan if it were approved.\nBut Nicola Allan, the applicant’s agent, said there was no way it would set a precedent for ribbon development or other development in the open countryside.She also pointed out that this scheme had been earmarked for approval earlier in the year and was a victim of the progress of the neighbourhood plan.Moving refusal, Coun Guy Renner-Thompson said: “I do have some sympathy with the applicants, but a week is a long time as they say and policies change. You take that risk. ” In the case of the Embleton proposal, for seven detached homes on land west of Station Road, the applicant’s planning consultant, Rod Hepplewhite, described it as ‘a travesty’, claiming his clients had been led to believe approval would be recommended. “To say we are disappointed with the officer recommendation is a massive understatement,” he said. But it had sparked 51 objections from neighbours, a large number of whom were at the meeting, as well as concerns from the parish council and neighbourhood plan steering group. Parish council chairman Terry Howells said: “It’s the wrong houses in the wrong place with absolutely no need for them. ” The planning officer had concluded that the development would represent ‘an incursion into the open countryside’ and ‘impact upon open views over the surrounding countryside which are afforded from the site’.",

You’ve got to question the logic of increasing care charges for older and disabled people, taking away council tax support from families who are struggling and somehow discovering you’ve got an £11.2m underspend. What is that about?\nWhen the Conservative Council took charge they said they’d discovered a £65m black hole in the previous administration’s finances. There wasn’t one by the way. But in any case, the non existent black hole has magically disappeared.\nAnd here’s another thing, this council is depriving so many of our vulnerable people with the support they need and deserve but have decided that putting money by to pay for legal fees relating to a number of ongoing disputes is a bigger priority.And this reserve for legal fees is over £1m. I think the council owe you an explanation of what these relate to.\nI’m pleased that money is being reserved to resolve an equal pay dispute. It’s totally right and proper that people of both sexes should be paid the correct rate for the job.\nThe other bit of ducking and diving we read about is moving money about to make it look like departments are doing better than they are. The council’s human resources department finds its overspend reduced from £450,000 to £120,000, largely ‘due to external legal fees are now being funded corporately.’\nI know it can be difficult to allocate and reserve spending when projects either happen faster or take longer to bring about. But here’s the thing. This year it’s a whopping £18.3m that’s being ‘reprofiled’ to next year.\nWe were told that this administration would manage its finances far better than the previous Labour-led council. From what we’re seeing here it doesn’t look like it.\nCouncils have to remember that it’s your money they’re spending.

He then voted against his own advice as the Tory whip was out ahead of Northumberland's interests.\nOne of the main additional reasons is that we believed the changes they wished to make could simply have been achieved via the modification procedure.

We need to change the settlement of our country back in favour of those who built it.”\n“For levelling up to truly deliver on this promise, the Government must meet the ambitions people have for our own communities, specifically, this means:\nGood jobs in our home towns, so young people have choices and chances and don’t have to get out to get on.\nOur high streets are thriving because the local economy is thriving, with good local businesses and money in people’s pockets – not just papering over the cracks.\nOur towns and villages are better connected to jobs, opportunities, our family and our friends through good transport, digital infrastructure and affordable housing that we have too often missed out on.\nWe get the power to take local decisions for ourselves – ending the system where we have to go cap in hand to Westminster to do things we know will work for us.\nOur town centres are safe and welcoming instead of plagued by anti-social behaviour, with criminals being let off and victims let down.”",

On 28 June 1969 USA Police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar, in Greenwich Village New York. The raid was an attack on anyone who did not fit into conventional gender roles and there was a massive backlash with demonstrations by gay men and lesbians. Three years later on 28 June 1970 the first gay pride marches took place in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and San Fransisco.\n“The move to stop cruel prejudice against gay men and lesbians crossed the Atlantic and Pride marches and events began in the UK. The Pride movement expanded to include transgender, bi-sexual, non binary and queer people. And the joy of the movement is that is has given lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) people a place to belong and campaign.\n“The need to recognise that people do not fit neatly into two genders, but they are individuals in the own right, needs to continue. It's a tragedy that people have suffered or even ended their own lives because of the lack of understanding or prejudice they face.\n“Many steps forward have been made in recognising and celebrating gender diversity. In fact we find a joint statement by a number of world governments on the government's own website https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-statement-celebrating-pride-month. This is a recognition that respecting difference is part of being a civilised society.\n“I am so pleased that the Northumberland Pride Festival is to go ahead in Ashington on 28 August and even more pleased that Britishvolt, the company behind the proposed battery gigaplant in Cambois near Blyth, has been forward thinking enough to sponsor it.”",

It shows me that they neither know nor care about the business needs of retailers and organisations who service those areas. Not content with directing savings and lack of investment against those in greatest need, they are planning to impose what I would consider to be stealth taxes on those living in these rural areas and who care about their environment. The council has a good record of recycling and sits just below its target level. As councillors we can’t understand why the cost of bulky waste collection and white goods is being forced up, People who live in rural villages like myself have much less opportunity to recycle these goods than those who live in our more urban centres; the collection service is essential for us. As well as bearing huge council tax rises, people wishing to get their garden waste recycled will be charged an additional £40 a season, a rise of 11 per cent. Taking garden waste and other items for recycling to the tip can be a 20-mile round trip and a 30-mile round trip to dispose of white goods. That’s if they have a car. People without their own transport are left with no choice but to pay unreasonably high prices for items to be collected. The council’s bulky waste collection service is the most expensive in the region. In my view these charges are an unfair burden on people living in rural areas. Every gardener is aware that a compost bin will handle the average household’s green waste but if you’re elderly, and the majority people who use the service are, then how do you handle the very heavy compost you produce? This is an unnecessary tax on the elderly in Northumberland. Not only will these stealth taxes damage the Green Credentials of the council but, more importantly, it will really hit those who are striving to live within the rules of society on fixed incomes hardest of all.",
