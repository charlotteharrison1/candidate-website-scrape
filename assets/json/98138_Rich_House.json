Many thanks to Hampshire County Council & Test Valley Borough Council for making this happen. We understand from a HCC councillor that it is ok to cycle along these paths as they have been designed for cycling, even though they won't be signed as such for a while.",

We plan to work with local councils and regional cycling groups to bid for Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) money this June to make some of these happen.\nAs a first step please we asked you where you cycled and how often. Here are the results. Many improvements come to mind for future surveys of this sort, such as including Eastleigh (partly covered by it being mainly reached through North Baddesley). A question listing all the neighbouring villages might also be informative. We'll try and incorporate these improvements in a subsequent survey.\nWe will next use the information to create a short list of the suggestions. Then we will ask you to vote on these to choose which to take forward in the current bidding round.\nAs a first step please we asked you where you cycled and how often. Here are the results.

  "https_romseycyclehub_weebly_com_/https_romseycyclehub_weebly_com_cycle-parking-priorities-agreed_html/content_48.html": "Romsey Cycle Hub are working as part of the Romsey Future partnership to improve cycle parking in Romsey (see previous article). We met on 8th February and agreed the priorities for the £5K quick win spend on cycle parking. Parking at the Memorial Park, Woodley Stores and Phoenix will be assessed and costed with a view to progressing these first if they prove feasible. Market Place and Bell Street are high priorities, but the plan is to include parking as part of the planned overhauls of these areas.\n|\nThe top priority was felt to be the Market Place. Cycle parking on the roundabout would be visible, conveniently located, covered by CCTV and non-obstructive to pedestrians. However Market Place is planned to be revamped. As cycle parking should be covered by this work it was felt that the £5K would be better spent elsewhere.\nSimilarly Bell Street is planned to be overhauled in Jan 2018, so the shortlisted parking near Dukes Mill will be left to then. Romsey Cycle Hub will be involved in the planning of these developments to ensure they support cycling.\n|\nMemorial Park (above) is next highest priority. It is a popular destination for cyclists. The Park and cycling are a good fit as both are concerned with healthy outdoor activity. TVBC will now plan and cost the work.\n|\nWoodley Stores will also be a high priority . These are well used by cyclists. We hope to encourage people to leave their car at home for trips to their local shops. The stores are next to a large recreation area with a play area, heavily used by children in the vicinity. TVBC will begin looking at the feasibility, land ownership, options & costs. Initial thoughts are to locate the parking near to the Coop. We mill be liaising with these shops to get their backing and buy in. Does anyone have any contacts in these shops?\nOur next priority is to add capacity to the parking outside the Phoenix in The Hundred (see home page header photo) as this well known central location is often overflowing.\n|",

I have gone through current the planning documents pulling out bits relevant to cyclists. Hopefully we can collectively review them and put forward suggestions to shape the plans so they are better for Romsey cyclists. As money is short new developments offer our best opportunity to improve cycle provision in Romsey as this can be bundled in as a condition of development.\nThis article looks at the plans from a Romsey cyclist's perspective. I have gone through current the planning documents pulling out bits relevant to cyclists. Hopefully we can collectively review them and put forward suggestions to shape the plans so they are better for Romsey cyclists. As money is short new developments offer our best opportunity to improve cycle provision in Romsey as this can be bundled in as a condition of development.\nThe documents I've included extracts from come from TVBC Planning Application 17/02183/OUTs. It proposal is just at outline planning stage as yet. It would be great if cyclists could send comments directly to TVBC (they have a comment button on their page). We of course also welcome your thoughts at Romsey Cycle Hub.\n21 Aug 2017 - Drawing - AERIAL OVERVIEW\nI've cut out the relevant bit of this below. The planned development is shown bounded by red lines. Here it is referred to as \"Land West of Baroona\" rather than \"Land West of Cupernham Lane\". Possible Cycle access South through Oxlease Meadow to Fishlake Medows is mentioned in other documents, but is not clear how this is connected to from this and other planning application's maps.\n21 Aug 2017 - Supporting Information - TRANSPORT ASSESSMENT\nThe development should encourage cycling ....\n2.0 TRANSPORT POLICY SUMMARY\n[ ...]\n2.7 The Test Valley Borough Council (TVBC) Revised Local Plan (2011-2029) was adopted in January 2016.\n2.8 Objective 13, relates to transport and states that TVBC sets out to 'encourage use of public transport, cycling and walking networks to help reduce reliance on cars and provide choice'.\"\n2.9 The key transport policy relating to this development proposal is Policy T1: Managing Movement, which states ‘Development will be permitted provided that:\na) its location is connected with existing and proposed pedestrian, cycle and public transport links to key destinations and networks; and\nb) measures are in place to minimise its impact on the highway and rights of way network and pedestrian, cycle or public transport users; and\nc) the internal layout, access and highway network is safe, attractive, in character, functional and accessible for all users and does not discourage existing and proposed users; and\nd) it does not have an adverse impact on the function, safety and character of and accessibility to the local or strategic highway network or rights of way network; and\ne) Provision is made to support and promote the use of sustainable transport, including the submission of a site travel plan where appropriate.’\nExisting cycling provision relevant to the development is summarised. However all is not as good as it is seems - follow the buttons or hyperlinks for key clarifications by Romsey Cycle Hub as to how good cycle routes are. Should the developers be asked to fund improvements to these?\n\"3.0 EXISTING CONDITIONS\n[...]\nWalking and Cycling\n3.10 On Cupernham Lane, to the north of the roundabout junction with Fishlake Meadows there are only footways for c.100m north used for access to residential dwellings. North of this point there are no definitive footways on Cupernham Lane as it becomes a typical country lane, with verges and hedgerows either side of the carriageway. The extent of footway does however connect to the footpath network being provided as part of the Abbotswood development, refer to the plan in Appendix A.\n3.11 As part of the approved Baroona development there will be footways provided either side of the site access from the eastern side of Cupernham Lane and a pedestrian network through the residential development. There will also be a footpath connection from the eastern side of the Baroona site to the western side of the Abbotswood development, where further pedestrian facilities provide safe access to the local centre.\n3.12 South of the roundabout there are footways on both sides of Cupernham Lane through the residential area. This provides good accessibility to the local facilities in Romsey.\n3.13 There is a circa 2.0m wide footway on the southern side of the Fishlake Meadows, with no footway on the northern side. This footway runs the length of Fishlake Meadows providing connection to the A3057 Greatbridge Road to the west, to Cupernham Lane to the east and to the footways within the residential area to the south of Fishlake Meadows.\n3.14 As part of the approved development for Oxlease Farm [...], an emergency access / shared footway / cycleway will be provided connecting both developments [see drawing]. This link will be retained whilst footways are to be provided along the extents of the spine road of Oxlease Farm as such providing a footway connection to Fishlake Meadows from the proposed development. There is an existing cycleway that starts c.170m south of the Cupernham Lane / Fishlake Meadows roundabout and connects to both Romsey railway station and the town centre, as well as on to Romsey Sports Centre, refer to Figure 3 and Appendix B. This cycle route has part of its path alongside the canal. It is also part of the National Cycle Network’s Route 24 which also continues northwards past the site along Cupernham Lane as an on-road signed route.\n3.16 There is another key cycle route between Fishlake Meadows and Romsey School [ .. ] These two cycle routes and the proposals associated with Oxlease Farm give good cycle accessibility from the site to key destinations within Romsey, thus making local travel by cycle safe and feasible.\"\nIt will look to retain the cycleway connection to Oxlease Farm. This sounds like it may provide access through to the Fishlake Meadows & canal cycle paths, but its a bit woolly sounding. Cycle spaces will be provided for the new dwellings.\n\"4.0 PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT AND SITE ACCESS LAYOUT\n[ ...]\n4.4 The primary site access will look to retain the emergency / shared footway / cycleway connection to the consented Oxlease Farm development to the south. This will enhance the sustainable connectivity of the proposed development by providing a safe link with low traffic flows and slow vehicle speeds to Fishlake Meadows\n[...]\n4.11 All on-site car and cycle parking will be provided in accordance with the minimum residential parking standards set out in TVBC Revised Local Plan Annex G – Parking Standards (T2); as set out below:\n• 1-bedroom houses\no 1 vehicle spaces per dwelling;\no 1 cycle space per dwelling;\n• 2 - 3-bedroom houses\no 2 vehicle spaces per dwelling;\no 2 cycle space per dwelling;\n• 4+ bedroom houses\no 3 vehicle spaces per dwelling;\no 2 cycle space per dwelling;\"\n21 Aug 2017 - Supporting Information - RESIDENTIAL TRAVEL PLAN\nPedestrians will have internal footpaths, but cyclists will use the roads. Residential properties will have cycle storage.\n\"1.1.3 Over the course of the planning and design process, following this outline application stage, the\nsite will be carefully planned so that:\n• The footway network through the site will allow safe pedestrian access to provide a high level of pedestrian accessibility;\n• The internal road network within the site will allow safe passage for cyclists; and\n• All residential properties have sufficient space for cycle storage facilities.\"\nThere will be cycle access South to Fishlake Meadows, though this appears to be mainly via the Oxlease Farm Development roads. Pedestrians will be able to cross over the canal to the towpath - should cyclists be able to do this as well to link to the forthcoming towpath cycle path extension north?\n2.2.2 The proposed site has permeable access throughout and provides pedestrian, cycle and vehicular connection east to Cupernham Lane, together with further pedestrian and cycle access south to Fishlake Meadows, and pedestrian access west over the canal to the towpath and Fishlake Meadows.\nShould the internal footpaths be widened and made into shared cycle/pedestrian paths?\n2.3 Travel on Foot or Cycle\n2.3.1 Walking and cycling offers the cheapest, healthiest and most convenient way to travel over short distances. It is considered that walking is attractive at distances up to 2km (1.25 miles) and cycling up to 5km (3.13 miles).\n2.3.2 Within the site the following pedestrian and cycle facilities will be provided to attract new residents to use these sustainable modes of travel:\n• The footway network through the site will allow safe pedestrian movement, with 2.0m wide footways and sections of shared surfaces within a 'home zone' environment to provide a high standard of pedestrian accessibility;\n• The internal road network within the site will allow safe passage for cyclists; and\n• All residential properties have sufficient space for cycle storage facilities.\n2.3.3 There is an existing cycleway that starts c.170m south of the Cupernham Lane / Fishlake Meadows roundabout and connects to both Romsey railway station and the town centre, as well as on to Romsey Sports Centre, refer to Figure 3 and Appendix B. This cycle route has part of its path alongside the canal. It is also part of the National Cycle Network’s Route 24 which also continues northwards past the site along Cupernham Lane as an on-road signed route.\n2.3.4 There is another key cycle route between Fishlake Meadows and Romsey School, as also shown on Figure 3 [Key cycle route between Fishlake Meadows and Romsey School]. These two cycle routes give good cycle accessibility from close to the site, via the Oxlease Farm development, to key destinations within Romsey, thus making local travel by cycle safe and feasible.\n[...]\n2.4.6 Romsey railway station is located c.1.5km (20-minutes) south of the site and it can be accessed by foot or cycle via the previously discussed routes.\"\n2.5 Key Travel Destinations Within Romsey\n2.5.1 There are several day-to-day local facilities that can be accessed from the site by sustainable modes of travel; walking, cycling or public transport\"\n21 Aug 2017 - Supporting Information - PLANNING, DESIGN AND ACCESS STATEMENT\nHouses will have garages & cycle storage sheds for storing cycles. Apartments will have communal cycle stores. Will the storage sheds be easy to access?\n\"On the southern edge of the site is a footpath approved as a pedestrian/cycle access between Cupernham Lane and the approved Oxlease Farm development.\"\n\"Cycle parking is provided for houses in the form of garages and cycle storages sheds whilst the proposed apartments will be catered for through the provision of secure communal cycle stores.\"\n\"The illustrative proposals for the southern parcel includes the provision of three flatted blocks arranged in a crescent and each containing ten 2-bedroom units. [..] Access to this part of the site is via a simple priority junction in the location of the existing field gate. A short access way leads to a landscaped parking courtyard that has been designed to accentuate the crescent arrangement of the flats. Visitor parking spaces are located close to the entrance of the site, while cycle and bin storage is provided in dedicated communal structures located conveniently for future occupiers and refuse tender operatives.\"\n\"A potential footpath connection could be made to the Oxlease Farm pedestrian/cycle route to maximise the connectivity between developments currently being built and the wider area.\"\n1 Sep 2017 - Consultation Responses - HIGHWAYS (TVBC)\nTest Valley Borough Council say inadequate facilities have been proposed for pedestrians & cyclists going to and from the site ...\n\"Are the access (including visibility requirements) and manoeuvring arrangements acceptable? No\nPlease give reasons:\n[ ... ]\nA further impact on the access design is the need for an island to be provided in the centre of Cupernham Lane to enable pedestrians and cyclists to cross Cupernham Lane.\nThe Safety Audit contents are noted, but in view of the alternative route for pedestrians from the southern area travelling north being relatively inconvenient a further route from the eastern end of the car park north to the northern access is required through the area of Open Space between them.

The bid reflects our aspirations. We will be working closely with TVBC to flesh out the bid in terms of costs and feasibility over the coming months.\nLee Lane/Station Rd is a popular, flat & scenic route for cyclists traveling between Romsey & Southampton. The route connects the new planned shared path along Southampton Rd (funded in the 2018 CIL bid) to the planned Southampton Cycle Network SCN 2 route at Dairy Lane.\nFast traffic, poor surfaces & poor lines of sight along narrow sections can deter less confident cyclists. This scheme will improve safety which should increase the numbers choosing to cycle. The scheme includes: measures to slow & reduce motor traffic; improvements to the surface; signs & road markings to warn traffic of cyclists at dangerous places & signs to encourage cyclists to use this route as a safe scenic option.\nCycling improves mental & physical health, reduces congestion, lowers carbon emissions & attracts visitors. The lane is frequently used by walkers – the scheme will significantly improve their safety and ability to enjoy its beautiful countryside.\nFast traffic, poor surfaces & poor lines of sight along narrow sections can deter less confident cyclists.

Many of the paths are designed for just pedestrians and unsuitable for cyclists.\nThe problem parts are shown in yellow on the Google map extract below.\nThe Duttons Road crossing which forms part of the purple route is particularly dangerous for cyclists and pedestrians as it is a very busy road and the crossing is on a curve. A lollipop person once helped children cross here, but this has been discontinued. Funding should be sought from the developers to add a Toucan crossing here.

You may remember taking part in our usage surveys - thank you all who did. The bid was drawn up and submitted by Test Valley Borough Council. £270K of funding for this has now been recommended by the council's planners. A big thank you to TVBC for the work so far on this. TVBC's cabinet will meet on Weds from 17:30 to 19:30 to hopefully approve the bid. The meeting is open to the public should anyone wish to attend. Please see the agenda for more information. CIL is a levy on local housing developments to fund local infrastructure projects. The money is collected together in a pot by councils and allocated to worthwhile schemes. The report recommending this and other bids will be looked at in item 7. If it is approved its not the end of the journey. The report says:\nRecommendation – Approve the release of £270,000 towards the Southampton Road shared Pedestrian and Cycle Route.

If anyone could shed some light on these it would be great.\n- Circular Path\n- Track serving Ganger Farm\n- Ganger Farm Lane\n- Jermyns Lane Access\nThe Layout maps above also suggest there are many more paths, but it is unclear what transport methods these support.\nCycle Path from South West of Site to Woodley Close\nThere will be a 3m wide shared pedestrian & cycle use path between Woodley Close and the South West of the new site.\n\"Cyclists will be able to use the shared footway/cycleway network that will link through the site including the direct 3m footpath/cycleway link between Braishfield Road and the site\" TRANSPORT ASSESSMENT PG 1-77 # |\nPedestrian and cycle access is also proposed [..] to the south west, towards Woodley Close to enable improved connectivity to the wider area and encourage sustainable modes of travel.\" DESIGN AND ACCESS STATEMENT PT 2 |\nWill cyclists and pedestrians living in the Western residential area first need to head East or South East to this path before heading back West and on to town? Or can they access Woodley Close more directly via a connecting road?\nWoodley Close connects to an existing shared use path along Braishfield Rd to Abbotswood. However it is unlikely that cyclists heading to the town centre would double back to Abbotswood. Instead they are more likely to head down Woodley Lane, which is as yet a little trickier to get to safely on a bike. With the increase in car traffic from Abbotswood the Woodley Lane / Brashfield Rd / Ganger Farm Rd cross roads is now quite dangerous and I believe an accident has already occurred here.\n\"The Council identified some traffic issues on Braishfield Road that will be tackled through the mitigation measures of the Abbotswood scheme. These include [..] improved pedestrian and cycle links between Abbotswood and local services and facilities (including footways on Braishfield Road), including a link to the entrance of Sir Harold Hillier Gardens (on Jermyns Lane, accessed from Braishfield Road)\".

Are you a cyclist? 10. Is there anything else you would like to do to help support cycling in Romsey? |\nTheir Answers\n|\nIan Callaghan - Green Party\n|\n\"1. What percentage of the transport budget is proposed for cycling?\nGreen Party financial measures relating to transport are based on two principles. Firstly, transport should pay for its environmental costs through taxes and charges (the polluter pays principle). Secondly, these should be used to finance measures to support a change to more sustainable modes of transport. See also answer to Q2. 2. What investment is forecast and in which areas of cycling?\nGreen Party policy is to ensure that signing of pedestrian and cycling routes is given priority, with clear signs to those places that people actually wish to travel to, e.g. shops and public facilities, including public transport stops. The Green Party will encourage the development of car-free city centres, aiming to make these the norm. (Romsey should certainly be a candidate for this.) A national network of longer distance cycle routes will be encouraged, within which local networks will be connected. However, the priority in cycling provision will be for local needs. |\nIn residential streets, priority will be given to residents. This will go beyond the use of current speed reducing measures to more effective redesigns to increase pedestrian space and restrict vehicle carriageway, with physical features effectively limiting speed of vehicles to 10mph, while making the environment more inviting to pedestrians and cyclists, such as \"Home Zones\". Funding for these measures would come from funding that at present is used for road building.\nAs policies on reducing journeys made by motor vehicles start to take effect, the Green Party will actively seek to reallocate road space away from traffic and parking to more sustainable uses.\nAs policies on reducing journeys made by motor vehicles start to take effect, the Green Party will actively seek to reallocate road space away from traffic and parking to more sustainable uses.\n3. What targets have you for the amount of journeys to be taken by bike?\nGreen Party policy is to reverse the current trend towards increasing car use and to encourage a switch to sustainable methods of transport through transport planning based on a hierarchy of modes of which walking, disabled access and cycling are the top three. We have not currently set specific targets for the proportion of journeys by bicycle, but we recognise that the general shift away from walking and cycling to less sustainable methods of transport needs to be reversed and the aim of its transport policies is to make it possible for walking and cycling to account for most short distance journeys made.\n4. What incentives are you planning to achieve Q3?\nThe Green Party recognises that the keys to promoting the use of bicycles are: reducing the need to travel long distances for work, leisure and shopping, and improving road conditions to make them safe, convenient and comfortable to cycle on, including reallocating road space.\nThe Party would alter funding of transport to the polluter pays principle, using charges and taxes on transport to support the development of sustainable methods of transport, and make a requirement that developers must show how their development can be fully accessed by more sustainable modes.\nIn rural areas, apart from trunk roads, the maximum speed limit would be 40m.p.h. Local communities would be encouraged to set lower limits on country lanes where pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders would be particularly vulnerable. They would also be encouraged to designate green lanes where these modes would have priority, and where feasible, to close lanes that act as through routes to allow only for these modes plus local access.\nAll public transport providers will be obliged to fully consult with and provide for cyclists, both on their vehicles (train, ferry, bus, light rail/tram, etc.) and at all the boarding and termination points where they run along fixed routes.\nAll large employers and organisations that are publicly accessible must provide for cyclists to be able to leave their bicycles and belongings in safe, secure dry surroundings. For clusters of small shops or workshops, the local authority or estate owner must make such provision. This should also apply to council and private housing. Provision for cycle storage should be made in all new developments.\nThe Green Party will encourage all other initiatives that may encourage a change of mode to cycling, for example alterations to allowances paid by employers to their employees for their necessary travel, and government tax relief for work related cycling, on a scale no less generous than car allowances.\n5. Are you for road space re-allocation/cycle paths/cycle roads or mix of these or none?\nThe shared use of pedestrian space with cyclists is recognised as a source of nuisance and conflict to pedestrians. Green Party policy is to reduce these conflicts through measures to make roads safe for cyclists. Where proposals are made for shared use, all other measures will have to be first studied to ensure that there are no other ways of making safe cycling. There will be a hierarchy of measures to create this provision. The primary objective of these will be reducing speeds and volume of motorised traffic. Where this cannot achieve a safe cycling environment, various forms of segregation from vehicles will be implemented, including routes completely away from the road system. Loss of road space from other vehicles to accommodate cyclists will be seen as preferable to loss of footway space from pedestrians. Where the cycle infrastructure is shared with pedestrians or horse riders, or where the cycle provision on roads is shared with bus priority measures, adequate space must be provided for the two users to share it safely. Where cycle routes are provided which give some form of segregation from other road users, the cycle route will be given priority at junctions over motorised traffic.\n6. a) Do you think that the stretch of Southampton Rd between the rapids and Lee Lane is dangerous for cyclists?\nAs dangerous as any stretch of road where vehicle traffic can attain high speeds. This stretch is also congested at rush hours\nb) Have you cycled along this stretch / would you?\nNo/yes (I live the other side of Romsey)\nc) Do you think it should have a cycle path during this parliament?\nYes. There is probably a case for putting the track on the verge for most of the way, given that the road may not be wide enough for a proper width cycle lane in both directions. Here, it should be separated from the pedestrian footway.\nd) If you do what will you do to help make it happen?\nWork with local cycle groups to approach the right authorities\n7. a) Do you think it is right to encourage more children to cycle to school in Romsey?\nGenerally speaking, yes. Safe routes to schools would be given the highest priority by the Green Party, so that most children are able to walk or cycle to school. We note however, the very carful planning of facilities and measures that are needed to make routes truly safe.\nb) If you do what tangible improvements do you think should be made to encourage them to do so?\nChildren and parents must be involved in the process of deciding what transport provision the school needs. Children must be educated about the issues of transport's impact on the environment and society so that they can make informed choices. Training for children in all practices relating to cycle use, e.g. riding and maintenance, will become an integral part of the education system, and will be supported by the provision of safe places for children to learn to cycle. Provision for the training of adults will also be supported and must be an important element in promoting cycling in the short term whilst road conditions are particularly hostile to cyclists.\nc) How will you help make these happen?\nWorking with local cycling groups and school management and governors and then lobbying the local authority to improve cycling facilities on routes around schools.\n8. a) Do you support the addition of charging points for electric cycles in Romsey to encourage less fit people to switch to cycling for transport?\nYes\nb) If so what will you do to help make this happen?\nLobby the relevant authorities\n9. Are you a cyclist?\nYes. I was also on the Board of the London Cycling Campaign from 2003-2009, as Chair from 2006-2009. During this period, cycling in London doubled, so I have some experience of cycle planning and politics.\n10. Is there anything else you would like to do to help support cycling in Romsey?\nAll of the above, and as mentioned, the town centre could quite easily be car free\"\nCaroline Nokes - Conservative Party\n|\n\"Thank you for contacting me about cycling. The number of people choosing to get about by bike has grown over recent years and, following the success of our Rio Olympians, and I passionately want to see this trend continue.\nGovernment investment in cycling has tripled since 2010. My colleagues at the Department for Transport are spending £300 million on cycling funding and a further £500 million for infrastructure in local communities, which will include benefits for cyclists. The £300 million funding includes delivering the £114 million Cycle City Ambition scheme in full, a new 'access' fund for sustainable travel and providing 1.3 million children with cycling proficiency training through funding for the Bikeability scheme. When I worked as a PPS at the Department for Transport, I regularly raised the importance of cycling and was delighted at the positive response I received from Government. |\nMinisters are also looking to local authorities as partners to deliver on cycle infrastructure in local communities across England. There is long-term funding available to both local authorities and Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs), which could be used on cycling through the Integrated Transport block, Highways Maintenance block, and the new 'access' fund; and billions of long-term local transport funding available through the Local Growth Fund.\nI am pleased that LEPs, which are responsible for prioritising the use of Local Growth Fund allocations within their area, are showing that they understand the value and benefits of cycling, with around £280 million of the Local Growth Fund currently being allocated to cycling projects.\nLocally, Test Valley Borough Council were one of the first councils to use Section 106 agreements to improving cycle provision in and near new developments. This generates new investment in cycling facilities and we have seen a large increase in the amount of cyclists on the road. I regularly discuss local cycling issues with Test Valley Borough Council and raised the concerns of parents about unsafe roads.\nYou will, of course, know that we have corresponded about this particular route several times and I have forwarded the information to you from Viv Messenger at TVBC. Of course the stretch of road from the Rapids to Lee Lane is incredibly busy, the footpath is not adequate for dual use as a cycle way, and no I certainly wouldn't want to cycle along that part of Southampton Road. I will admit to not being much of a cyclist, but my daughter has been, and like any parent I used to worry about the interaction between vehicles and her on her bike. I don't think this is the only stretch of concern however, and the A3057 between the end of the cycle path in Timsbury and Romsey is horrific for cyclists. As you will know the completion of the cycle path from Stockbridge to Romsey is also on the agenda for the Borough Council.\nInevitably use of S106 monies relies on a) there being new housing development and b) there being sufficient funds to use for a wide variety of projects including the provision of other types of leisure facility.\nI would be delighted to organise a summit with the council and your organisation to discuss local cycling policy.I believe that by getting local stakeholders together, we can coordinate a cycling strategy for the area which encourages people of all ages and abilities to cycle safely in their communities..\"\nDon Jerrard - Justice & Anti-Corruption Party\n|\n\"You can be assured that the subject of cycling is very important to me. As you may know I was a candidate in last year’s Police & Crime Commissioner Election in Hampshire and I was one of only two of the 7 candidates who attended the Portsmouth Cycling Forum when invited to do so because of the problems of cycling in Portsmouth. The death rate for cyclists in Portsmouth is second only to that in London in this country.\nI also have a strong personal interest for two reasons. Firstly cycling is very popular in and around Liss and Liphook near where I live and has been for many years. A lot of my friends are involved, not me because I have a dodgy knee from my very unsuccessful football days, but it is the talk of the pub most days. Secondly my younger son cycles from Warsash to work in Southampton and back every day so I fear for his safety. |\nI don’t think it particularly helps for me to answer your specific questions with my limited knowledge at the moment. I have lived in East Hampshire for nearly 30 years and one of the huge personal advantages to me if I win the election is that my wife will agree to us down-sizing now and moving back to where I came from and even being able to cycle to watch the Saints, if I did not have the dodgy knee. I used to walk to the Dell from our home in Bassett Green but now it will have to be car or the bus.\nWhat I can promise is that cycling really is a very high priority for me as I think it should be for anyone concerned with the problems (or opportunities) that affect cyclists which is health and traffic safety. I hope my style has always been to listen a lot, think a lot and say comparatively little but try and get results where they are most needed. If I win you can be assured that I will talk to those involved in cycling, listen to what is said and try and help.\nI hope you will follow my campaign with interest. I believe that the best thing for the constituency at present is to have a candidate dedicated to a particular cause and to deal with local issues, rather than a career politician. The JAC Party website is www.jacparty.org.uk which we are struggling to keep up to date. That is because the man who manages it for us is one of the local keen cyclists whom I mentioned, with the disadvantage of having 4 daughters of school or university age who keep taking him out when he is meant to be loading the info onto the site!\nPlease feel free to call on 07969 891638 if you would like to discuss anything.\"\nWhat I can promise is that cycling really is a very high priority for me as I think it should be for anyone concerned with the problems (or opportunities) that affect cyclists which is health and traffic safety.

Our plans will encourage and enable people to get out of their cars, for better health and a cleaner environment.\nA Labour government will invite the National Infrastructure Commission to recommend the next stages for developing and upgrading the National Cycle Network. We reaffirm the commitments in the Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy. |\nIt’s right to encourage more children to cycle to school in Romsey, as and where there are safe routes that young people and parents are confident using. In the same way, I would seek to encourage local businesses to get their employees on bikes for the journeys to and from work, where practical. Ideas around cycle paths could go some way to encouraging more residents to do this, and it would be important for me to work with the local authority, schools, and groups like yours to ensure the design of any improvements is suitable.\nYes I’m a cyclist - sometimes a bit of a fair-weather one, but my journey to work is usually quicker and less stressful when on my bike rather than in the car.\nYes I’m a cyclist - sometimes a bit of a fair-weather one, but my journey to work is usually quicker and less stressful when on my bike rather than in the car.\nI am in favour of road space re-allocation, cycle paths, cycle roads or mixes of these as local authorities see appropriate, as it’s crucial to facilitate safe bike riding if we are to encourage people to get out of their cars and get on their bikes. I recently rode a bike around Amsterdam, and the experience was a very different one to riding in the UK! That culture of cycles having priority and a safe network of cycle paths and shared-use paths was inspiring.\nCatherine Royce - Liberal Democrats\n\"While I would like to be able to respond personally to you, we are receiving a large volume of emails at the moment and I regret that it is impossible to engage fully with the questions posed. I hope you will understand that in a very short General Election period I am extremely busy campaigning and meeting residents in the constituency and we do not have the resources to deal with the number of emails and questions we are receiving.\nPeople have been in touch on a varied and interesting range of topics which I know concern them greatly.

We plan to work with local councils and regional cycling groups to bid for Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) money to make some of these happen. Bidding for this years CIL money has just opened.\nLast year our CIL bid to improve Southampton Road's path to make it suitable for cycling was chosen and £270,000 has been allocated to it. Hopefully it will be implemented soon.\nLast year our CIL bid to improve Southampton Road's path to make it suitable for cycling was chosen and £270,000 has been allocated to it. Hopefully it will be implemented soon.\nBased on your suggestions and the results from our survey last year Romsey Cycle Hub has created the shortlist below. We will send out an electronic vote on these, but first we wanted to give you the opportunity to add to the list if you feel strongly we have missed something out. If you do please get back to me before 11 April 2019 with the improvment you would like to add, together with a brief justification.\nThere are of course many worthy suggestions which I have not included. Sadly we need to prioritise as money is likely to be limitied. All the shortlisted routes are near Romsey - we are Romsey Cycle Hub and as such looking out for the interests of Romsey cyclists. All are likely to be well used. All are likely to significantly improve safety. All have had multiple suggestions submitted. To keep things simple we have generally left the implementation options out of the shortlist. We will turn to these once we have chosen our favourite.\nFinally if any one would like to help put the bid together that would help a lot. Last year Viv Messenger of TVBC did much of the work based on information we provided. As Viv has retired we may need to do more of the work ourselves this time.\n1. Lee Lane Motor Traffic Slowing and Reduction\nMeasures to slow motor traffic and reduce volumes to make this lane safer for cyclists.\n- Our surveys show this is part of the busiest cycle route between Romsey & Southampton.\n- Although traffic is relatively light, this lane is narrow, winding and vehicles can travel up to the national speed limit (60mph), endangering cyclists.\n- Many cost effective options are available (e.g. reducing the speed limit, speed bumps, restricting accessing to residents and cyclists, Quiet Lane status, etc).\n- It is a beautiful lane to cycle along.\n2. Canal Path Extension\n|\nExtend the exising shared pedestrian cycle path along the canal north along the canal to connect to the A3057 cycle path in Timsbury.\n|\n3. North Baddesley Botley Rd - Firgrove to Castle Lane\nFill the gap beween cycle paths in between Firgrove Road and Castle Lane, through the centre of North Baddesley.\n|\n4. Pauncefoot Hill\nA cycle path up and down Pauncefoot Hill.\n|\n5. The Romsey School Routes\nConnect up & improve cycle paths used to get to and from The Romsey School, including:\n- tarmacing the path from the canal to Gecko Climbing\n- permitting cycling on paths linking to the canal path\n- permitting cycling on the path from the industrial estate to Duttons Rd\n- permitting cycling on the path between the Fisklake Meadows road and the Inustrial Estate and tarmacing it\n- permitting cycling on the path between Grayling Mead and the Inustrial Estate and tarmacing it\n- permitting cycling on the path between The Cloisters and the Industrial Estate and tarmacing it\n- putting in a crossing at the junction of Richmond Lane & Cupernham Lane\n- permitting careful cycling along most of the path from Lansdowne Close to Greatbridge Rd\n- permitting careful cycling along the path between Mill Lane and Priestlands\n- Many pupils of The Romsey School cycle to it and back home. Improved routes are likely to be well used.\n- We should be encouraging more children to cycle for their health, the environment and to reduce school drop off congestion.\n- The existing routes are disjointed and poorly surfaced, discouraging cycling. Many parts unnecessarily prohibit cycling.\n6. Tadburn to Town Routes\nThis route involves the path which parallels the Tadburn Stream, crosses Botley Road and goes under the Railway via that low and narrow arch. It continues to Southampton Road where a proper pedestrian and cycle crossing is needed to then continue on the path alongside the stream and the Bypass to Palmerston St. An alternative branch is to go in via the Harrage. An additional branch needs to be a signed shared route through Knatchbull Close to Winchester Road where one can cross into Brick Lane , traverse the Canal and follow the path parallel to the railway line and Mitchell's Close to come out by the Station Approach junction traffic lights (for Town or the Station itself).\nThis route will allow cyclists to more safely access the town centre and railway station from areas adjoining Tadburn. Some of the route is already in place - this option joins these together. The Bypass part of the route will also benefit cyclists travelling to and from Southampton Rd and town.",

A big thanks to Hampshire County Council for making this happen, as well as the input from those of you who reviewed the plans earlier this year. The following photos are courtesy of Julian Jones for sharing this news and the following photos. Let us know what you think.

The designs are for the path to be widened slightly and re-surfaced with a tarmac finish to ensure good quality year round access.\nHCC are currently seeking feedback on the plans. This can be provided by email to [email protected] or to Sam Jones, the Area Access Manager, on 02380 605109 by Wednesday 9th August. Anyone interested can also attend an evening meeting at 6.30pm this Thursday 10th August. It will start at the northern end of the path beside the ramp coming down from to Fishlake Meadows Road. HCC say they are conscious of the need to maintain a semi-rural experience for users. They will be looking to remove existing metal barriers and provide new staggered barriers and signage made from hardwood. They are also seeking additional funding to provide boards explaining the flora and fauna users may see along the path and towards Fishlake Meadows itself. HCC would like to begin work towards the end of September. The plans were discussed at the Romsey Future Coordinating Group meeting on Thursday last week. |",

The timetables don't say which platform trains heading directly to Salisbury depart from. Does anyone know?\nSouth Western Railway Trains\nSouth Western Railway run trains in a loop stopping at all stations along the way (see timetable below) . They have a web page for cyclists.\n|\n|\nIt is not clear whether reservation is required or not if you look at the National Rail Enquiries details for the service (see above). I've contacted South Western Railways who say ...\nthere are no restrictions at any of the stations on Route 25. However, where there are no restrictions in place it is on a 'first come - first served' basis. If there is no space on a train for them to be carried safely, staff can decline a request to carry them. Unfortunately, there are no reservations available for Route 25, only on the services to and from the west of England |\n|\nGreat Western Railway also run many of the services between Romsey and Salisbury. Their site has information on traveling with a cycle on their trains. Most services don't require you to reserve your cycle space. If both are taken you'll need to wait for the next train.

This is the first of several mini articles on what I found. In the past I've used a mix of trains and cycling to commute to work from Romsey to Southampton Parkway and found it fairly easy, but I confess I'm not a current rail user, so it would be good to hear about your experiences and things I should include in the forthcoming articles.\nNation Rail's plusbike\nFirst off, and in no particular order is National Rail's plusbike . \"PlusBike is a one-stop shop for information about your combined cycle and rail journey\". Their web site has a page explains what's on offer.\nOnce you've found your route using National Rail Enquiries, click on the details for a route and look for the plusbike logo and the cycle icon to it's right. Click on the cycle icon to view info for the route. Click on the plusbike logo to view info about the stations. The red annotations in the following screenshots are mine.\nClick on the \"more Information\" link to view detail about the station (see below). \"Getting to and from the station\" has the key info. The local area maps also look useful.\nThe station map is useful, though it doesn't show the cycle rack on Platform 1.\nMore on what Romsey Station offers to cyclists in another article soon.",

I have been an active cyclist until late 2019 ,when i was taken ill and havnt been able to ride since(lockdown also happened which has put me back a bit of not cycling) i have taken over from Rich House ,and hope to carry on his good work around romsey especially with sorting cycle paths out with the help of romsey future ,tsbc ,and other agencies. I feel strongly about the need of good,safe cycle paths ,as i have seen what a difference Bristol is with their huge cycle path network which is enjoyed by the commutors, or hobby or leisure cyclist young and old and it would be so great to have at least a few of these cycle ways here in romsey.

Otherwise his plan is just to leave it as it is in deep space stasis until we arrive at another organiser. Thanks for everyone who's read our posts and engaged over the years. Happy cycling. Here's an update on what's been happening.\nLee Lane CIL Bid Update\nDespite my fairly good efforts the Lee Lane CIL bid looks like it's not going anytime very fast. Sustrans are not saying they'll support it as the bid doesn't meet their higher specification for their cycle routes. They think it may form part of their network. It's currently stuck somewhere in HCC & TVBC local authority land.\nSouthampton Rd Path Update\nTest Valley Borough Council say \"The detailed design is underway and should be completed by the autumn and all being well tenders will be invited Oct/Nov with contract award shortly after.

We asked them what they will do for cyclists. Here are their responses ...\nHeather Butler - Labour Party [email protected]\"I live in Romsey and often cycle around town, when I lived in Dunbridge (for 15 years) I cycled around the Test Valley area with my family. I like the fact that in Romsey town there are many off-road and quiet cycling options and places to lock up the bike but I think that the rural cycle routes are poorly maintained with potholes and obstacles and I would like ongoing maintenance to be a priority. I think going forward that an overall transport strategy needs to put cycling at the fore. With a joined up plan seeing existing routes linked with new ones.\nIn the rural area around Romsey provision for cyclists seems patchy, cycle routes have a tendency to peter out and cycling on the roads can be downright dangerous especially for families. This contributes to isolation in the rural areas and leaves people with little option but to use the car. I would like to see speeds through villages restricted, green routes developed where possible and speed restrictions on dangerous corners with more cycle passing places to help keep the traffic moving safely\". |\nRoy Perry - Conservatives [email protected]\"The most important way we will help cyclists as with all residents of Hampshire is keeping the county council's finances sound. Nobody will thank us for spending money we do not have\nThat being said the County has a cycling strategy - set out on HCC website For environmental and public health reasons we see cycling as positive and our strategy is to incrementally extend the cycling routes The Government plans to allocate £50 million for cycling proficiency training for schoolchildren, £85 million to \"cycle proof\" 200 sections of A-roads and £389.5 million for councils to promote walking and cycling, including more dedicated lanes. Hampshire will apply its share of the programme and work through its Highways and Public Health teams to deliver these programmes. In Hampshire we have worked with the funder Sustrans to extend the cycling infrastructure and made substantial investment in cycle routes such as the Petersfield to the Queen Elizabeth Country Park. Specifically in Romsey Rural we are working to extend parts of the national cycle route network- extending the route from Castle Lane to North Baddesley and on through Nursling and Rownhams to Southampton and link to the projected Baddesley to Chilworth route.The initial part will cost approx £250,000 and the latter is estimated to cost in excess of £500,000 so will depend on a share from developers contributions. There isof course already the link from Chilworth to Southampton We have concerns about Child and Adult obesity and we see sport, and in particular cycling, as a major catalyst to behavioural change. Winchester has the CycleFest in June and we are looking to increase the family element of these type of events. In Andover we will help sponsor a family ride in September and an Elite cycle street race in Andover Town Centre next year.. We are linking these events to an Energise Me (was Sport Hampshire) programme to address obesity and health and wellbeing in general. We would be happy to work with Romsey Rural cyclists for a similar event in Romsey\". |\nCatherine Royce - Liberal Democrats [email protected]\nCatherine was understandable very busy campaigning, but found time to phone us. This is what I remember from our conversation (she phoned when I didn't have access to a pen):\n|",

The winner is:\nNorth Baddesley Botley Rd - Firgrove to Castle Lane\nNorth Baddesley Botley Rd - Firgrove to Castle Lane\nWe will now seek to work with Romsey Future, local councils and regional cycling groups to bid for Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) money to make this happen. Any help with this would be most appreciated. It may be the case that this improvement has already got funding as I understand some fasibility studies havetaken place. If this urns out to be the case we will bid for the Lee Lane improvement as this came second.\nIt was a close run thing. This year we said the winner will be the one with the least overall score, i.e. the one generally preferred.

This set me thinking about those in Romsey who use both cycle and rail to get about.\n- What facilities are available at Romsey station and nearby stations for cyclists?\n- Which trains allow cyclists to bring their cycles on board?\n- How easy is it to get on board trains with cycles at Romsey and nearby stations?\n|\nI started digging around and found a lots of patchy information. This is the first of several mini articles on what I found. In the past I've used a mix of trains and cycling to commute to work from Romsey to Southampton Parkway and found it fairly easy, but I confess I'm not a current rail user, so it would be good to hear about your experiences and things I should include in the forthcoming articles.\n|\nNation Rail's plusbike\nFirst off, and in no particular order is National Rail's plusbike . \"PlusBike is a one-stop shop for information about your combined cycle and rail journey\". Their web site has a page explains what's on offer.\nOnce you've found your route using National Rail Enquiries, click on the details for a route and look for the plusbike logo and the cycle icon to it's right. Click on the cycle icon to view info for the route. Click on the plusbike logo to view info about the stations. The red annotations in the following screenshots are mine.\nClick on the \"more Information\" link to view detail about the station (see below). \"Getting to and from the station\" has the key info. The local area maps also look useful.\nThe station map is useful, though it doesn't show the cycle rack on Platform 1. The red annotations are mine.",

To see the detailed plans and information about the work take a quick trip to Hampshire County Council's page https://www.hants.gov.uk/transport/transportschemes/marketplaceromsey. The page says the work will \"make Romsey town centre more accessible to pedestrians and cyclists\" and lead to an \"improved environment / experience for cyclists\". Do you think it will deliver on this? Should it have done more? The Market Place Street Furniture Plan shows cycle parking to the East of the Market Place (see our extract of part of the plan below). Test Valley Borough Council say:\nAfter those drawings were prepared, it was agreed that some cycle parking should be provided next to the seating and tree on the western side of the paved area, as well as on the eastern side. The exact location/numbers of cycle stands on either side will need to be agreed on site as the scheme is progressed\nThere will be a dop in event on Wednesday 28 November between 5pm - 7pm at Romsey Town Hall....",

  "https_romseycyclehub_weebly_com_/https_romseycyclehub_weebly_com_what-happened-at-romsey-future-walking--cycling-workstream-meeting_html/content_90.html": "What Happened at the Romsey Future\nWalking & Cycling Workstream Meeting By Rich House (May 2017)\n|\n|\nAt the meeting we mainly discussed how the Test Valley Borough Cycling & Walking Map should be updated. In summary we all agreed it should look similar to the My Journey Andover Cycling & Walking Map. This map looked modern and was easy to understand. There were a few minor exceptions, e.g. we decided not to keep the rings.\nWe thought that the reverse should have a zoomed in map of the town centre as well as a zoomed out context map showing major cycling routes from Romsey to other destinations and other the area covered by other maps. |\nAs a couple of cyclists (Bunty Wildblood and Alison Rosen) could not attend the meeting I offered to raise issues on their behalf, which I did. Unfortunately as almost all the meeting was taken up in discussing the map update we ran out of time to discuss anything else in detail.\nBunty asked if there were ...\n\"any plans to make the A3090 from Romsey to Ower cycle friendly, as this would allow safe access to the New Forest\"?\nThe Cycle Strategy & Network Supplementary Planning Document includes making the stretch up Pauncefoot Hill cycle friendly. TVBC's current thinking is that cyclists should then follow the lanes to Wellow and access the New Forest that way. They are happy to discuss Bunty's idea when we focus on route improvements at a future workstream meeting\nAlison raised the following points...\ngeneral situation about the shocking state of the cycle paths, and how they abruptly stop or end. Also that a lot of walkers are unaware that they share the paths and can become aggressive towards cyclists using them. General understanding of cyclists on roads by car drivers, as well as understanding that it is allowed in law for cyclists to cycle 2 abreast. A better understanding about how car drivers should overtake a cyclist - not cross into oncoming traffic in order to do so, but wait till it is safe, and pass with enough clearance next to cyclist. Also a general knowledge for drivers in Romsey that if a cyclist is crossing an intersection and has a right of way, then the motorist coming out of the intersection should wait; also when a cyclist is cycling down a road and there are parked cars on the other side forcing the traffic on that side to drive over the centre line, and into the other side of the road, the driver needs to apply the same law as they would to an approaching car travelling in the correct lane towards them, and NOT ignore the cyclist approaching them, and drive straight for the cyclist whilst the car driver is on the cyclists side of the road/on the wrong side of the road..basic common sense and basic common decency really! Thats all I can think of for now. What I do when I approach walkers who are walking in same direction I am cycling, is I ring my bell from a distance, to notify them I am approaching. If they don't respond or have earplugs in or something, I ring it again when I get closer. If they still don't respond, I slow down/stop and politely say excuse me as I pass\nWe briefly discussed the main points in the last few minutes of the meeting. There was general agreement that improving harmony between cyclists, cars and walkers is something that Romsey Future can help with that we would definitely discuss Alison's points at a future meeting.",

The money was for a quick win project. Cycle parking won! A group of cyclists then worked with the council to decide how to spend the money. The main priorities were Romsey Memorial Park, outside the Phoenix and Woodley Stores.\nWe recently heard that work is progressing. Completion is expected this autumn.\n|",

We asked them what they will do for cyclists. Here are their responses ...\nPS - We've also added an article for Romsey Rural Candidates.\nStuart Bannerman - Labour Party [email protected]\n\"It is important that cycle routes and cafe cycle parking facilities are developed further. It is equally important that existing dedicated cycle paths are properly maintained so that they are safe to use. I also think it should be an awful lot easier to take bikes on public transport, so that journeys can be undertaken using a combination of the two modes. This is especially true in an area like Test Valley, where public transport rarely fits the traveler's needs, and it is too easy to fall back on the car\".\n|\nMark Cooper - Liberal Democrats [email protected]\"I am an occasional cyclist and all my children cycled the roads of Romsey when they were youngsters, so I am very aware of the poor and limited provision for cyclists in Romsey.\nHampshire County Council and Test Valley Borough Council have cycling strategies but they are very limited in scope and ambition. There is, however, 'a sustainable thread' in their policies inasmuch as a proportion of Section 106 development money and CIL funds are earmarked for cycleway and footpath improvements. The need to make junctions safer for pedestrians and cyclists explains why traffic lights rather than roundabouts are employed, for example, at the relatively recent Cupernham Lane Junction and at the long overdue Braishfield Road junction. It is unfortunate that all these schemes depend on more development which in turn generates more traffic and therefore more safety issues. If Hampshire is serious about sustainable transport it should put some of its tax revenue resource into cycling and walking and not just rely on developer funding. For example, HCC resources should be used to join up what is, at present, a very disjointed cycle network. I strongly favour 'on-road' cycle lanes where there is capacity. The HCC habit of simply widening a footpath is not good enough, because cyclists are vulnerable at every cross-over. On-road cycle lanes would give the cyclist priority at cross-overs. I have been campaigning, and will continue to do so, for a 20mph zone throughout Romsey Town Centre and on Romsey Housing Estates where there are relatively few entry points. Slower vehicles equal higher cycle and pedestrian safety. But both HCC and TVBC seen reluctant to bring in 20mph zones for fear of upsetting the car lobby. I was happy to endorse the Romsey Future grant of £5,000 for improved cycle parking in the town. In response to requests from local cyclists I also had commissioned a left turn for cyclists only into Middlebridge Street from the Romsey By-pass. Additionally, as part of the drafting team on the Borough Local Plan I have ensured that the new Lower Whitenap development, imposed on Romsey by Test Valley Borough Council, will generate new and better cycle links into the town.\" |\nSimon Hayes - Conservative Party [email protected]\n|\n\"I would, as with any community or voluntary group, want to work in partnership with the Romsey Cycle Hub to understand and support the needs of cyclists in the Town. With an increase in cycling across the Town this relationship will become more important as time passes. It’s important that community groups have a voice to influence decision makers and in this case planners too. Your County Councillor is uniquely placed to do this.\nBeing a cyclist myself, potholes are perhaps the most frustrating and dangerous obstacle. I believe the main focus is on cars, not cyclists, when repairs are considered and done. Potholes close to the curb are as important as those centre lane; as is the general condition of cycle routes. There’s a need to take cycle lanes more seriously and not just squeeze them in, and tick the box. Cycle lanes and dedicated cycle routes are an important part of an integrated transport system, but I fear are seen as the poor relation. I’d want to see increased awareness of this point and, for example, a good structure linked to and through the new Fishlake Nature Reserve. More generally, there’s still a need for increased cycle parking throughout the Town. The upcoming environmental enhancement scheme for the Town centre is an opportunity to ensure improved cycle parking is included in the design. Although businesses are helping improve parking places, local authorities must support and enable. Again, with increased cyclists the demand will rise. There’s a need to better educate young people on cycle safety, as we encourage them to cycle to school. The problem of a safe crossing point at Duttons Road has not been resolved. In my view, it’s a sufficiently difficult place to cross that it is of concern to parents and may put children off cycling to school, which is a great shame. It needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency and would be a priority if I were elected. Finally, we need to encourage government to include awareness of cyclists more prominently in the driving test; but this is more of a campaign issue at national level than a specific Hampshire County Council election matter.\" |",

I can now announce that Test Valley Borough Council has now submiitted a Community Fund bid for the money needed to make it happen! Thank you TVBC.\nCurrently there is a narrow footpath alongside Southampton Road between The Rapids and Lee Lane. This route is frequently used by mainly commuters travelling to Southampton. Some use the narrow path, although technically this is illegal. Others use the road. With narrow lanes, heavy traffic and 50mph speeds this stretch is dangerous to cyclists. Motorists find passing cyclists inconvenient.\n|\nOur next step is to provide additional evidence in support of the bid. I have been out counting cyclists along the stretch. You may have seen me on Wednesday between 4pm and 7pm catching some rays and some fumes. I counted 38 cyclists, 11 on the path and 27 on the road. That's 27 lives we can remove from peril and 11 we can make legal, less foliage wacked and less puddle splashed! If you'd like to help count you can find a form here. During the 3 hours I did come across one pedestrian. Interestingly he was walking along the narrow verge across the road from the path.

Are you a cyclist? 10. Is there anything else you would like to do to help support cycling in Romsey? |\nTheir Answers\n|\nIan Callaghan - Green Party\n|\n\"1. What percentage of the transport budget is proposed for cycling?\nGreen Party financial measures relating to transport are based on two principles. Firstly, transport should pay for its environmental costs through taxes and charges (the polluter pays principle). Secondly, these should be used to finance measures to support a change to more sustainable modes of transport. See also answer to Q2. 2. What investment is forecast and in which areas of cycling?\nGreen Party policy is to ensure that signing of pedestrian and cycling routes is given priority, with clear signs to those places that people actually wish to travel to, e.g. shops and public facilities, including public transport stops. The Green Party will encourage the development of car-free city centres, aiming to make these the norm. (Romsey should certainly be a candidate for this.) A national network of longer distance cycle routes will be encouraged, within which local networks will be connected. However, the priority in cycling provision will be for local needs. |\nIn residential streets, priority will be given to residents. This will go beyond the use of current speed reducing measures to more effective redesigns to increase pedestrian space and restrict vehicle carriageway, with physical features effectively limiting speed of vehicles to 10mph, while making the environment more inviting to pedestrians and cyclists, such as \"Home Zones\". Funding for these measures would come from funding that at present is used for road building.\nAs policies on reducing journeys made by motor vehicles start to take effect, the Green Party will actively seek to reallocate road space away from traffic and parking to more sustainable uses.\nAs policies on reducing journeys made by motor vehicles start to take effect, the Green Party will actively seek to reallocate road space away from traffic and parking to more sustainable uses.\n3. What targets have you for the amount of journeys to be taken by bike?\nGreen Party policy is to reverse the current trend towards increasing car use and to encourage a switch to sustainable methods of transport through transport planning based on a hierarchy of modes of which walking, disabled access and cycling are the top three. We have not currently set specific targets for the proportion of journeys by bicycle, but we recognise that the general shift away from walking and cycling to less sustainable methods of transport needs to be reversed and the aim of its transport policies is to make it possible for walking and cycling to account for most short distance journeys made.\n4. What incentives are you planning to achieve Q3?\nThe Green Party recognises that the keys to promoting the use of bicycles are: reducing the need to travel long distances for work, leisure and shopping, and improving road conditions to make them safe, convenient and comfortable to cycle on, including reallocating road space.\nThe Party would alter funding of transport to the polluter pays principle, using charges and taxes on transport to support the development of sustainable methods of transport, and make a requirement that developers must show how their development can be fully accessed by more sustainable modes.\nIn rural areas, apart from trunk roads, the maximum speed limit would be 40m.p.h. Local communities would be encouraged to set lower limits on country lanes where pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders would be particularly vulnerable. They would also be encouraged to designate green lanes where these modes would have priority, and where feasible, to close lanes that act as through routes to allow only for these modes plus local access.\nAll public transport providers will be obliged to fully consult with and provide for cyclists, both on their vehicles (train, ferry, bus, light rail/tram, etc.) and at all the boarding and termination points where they run along fixed routes.\nAll large employers and organisations that are publicly accessible must provide for cyclists to be able to leave their bicycles and belongings in safe, secure dry surroundings. For clusters of small shops or workshops, the local authority or estate owner must make such provision. This should also apply to council and private housing. Provision for cycle storage should be made in all new developments.\nThe Green Party will encourage all other initiatives that may encourage a change of mode to cycling, for example alterations to allowances paid by employers to their employees for their necessary travel, and government tax relief for work related cycling, on a scale no less generous than car allowances.\n5. Are you for road space re-allocation/cycle paths/cycle roads or mix of these or none?\nThe shared use of pedestrian space with cyclists is recognised as a source of nuisance and conflict to pedestrians. Green Party policy is to reduce these conflicts through measures to make roads safe for cyclists. Where proposals are made for shared use, all other measures will have to be first studied to ensure that there are no other ways of making safe cycling. There will be a hierarchy of measures to create this provision. The primary objective of these will be reducing speeds and volume of motorised traffic. Where this cannot achieve a safe cycling environment, various forms of segregation from vehicles will be implemented, including routes completely away from the road system. Loss of road space from other vehicles to accommodate cyclists will be seen as preferable to loss of footway space from pedestrians. Where the cycle infrastructure is shared with pedestrians or horse riders, or where the cycle provision on roads is shared with bus priority measures, adequate space must be provided for the two users to share it safely. Where cycle routes are provided which give some form of segregation from other road users, the cycle route will be given priority at junctions over motorised traffic.\n6. a) Do you think that the stretch of Southampton Rd between the rapids and Lee Lane is dangerous for cyclists?\nAs dangerous as any stretch of road where vehicle traffic can attain high speeds. This stretch is also congested at rush hours\nb) Have you cycled along this stretch / would you?\nNo/yes (I live the other side of Romsey)\nc) Do you think it should have a cycle path during this parliament?\nYes. There is probably a case for putting the track on the verge for most of the way, given that the road may not be wide enough for a proper width cycle lane in both directions. Here, it should be separated from the pedestrian footway.\nd) If you do what will you do to help make it happen?\nWork with local cycle groups to approach the right authorities\n7. a) Do you think it is right to encourage more children to cycle to school in Romsey?\nGenerally speaking, yes. Safe routes to schools would be given the highest priority by the Green Party, so that most children are able to walk or cycle to school. We note however, the very carful planning of facilities and measures that are needed to make routes truly safe.\nb) If you do what tangible improvements do you think should be made to encourage them to do so?\nChildren and parents must be involved in the process of deciding what transport provision the school needs. Children must be educated about the issues of transport's impact on the environment and society so that they can make informed choices. Training for children in all practices relating to cycle use, e.g. riding and maintenance, will become an integral part of the education system, and will be supported by the provision of safe places for children to learn to cycle. Provision for the training of adults will also be supported and must be an important element in promoting cycling in the short term whilst road conditions are particularly hostile to cyclists.\nc) How will you help make these happen?\nWorking with local cycling groups and school management and governors and then lobbying the local authority to improve cycling facilities on routes around schools.\n8. a) Do you support the addition of charging points for electric cycles in Romsey to encourage less fit people to switch to cycling for transport?\nYes\nb) If so what will you do to help make this happen?\nLobby the relevant authorities\n9. Are you a cyclist?\nYes. I was also on the Board of the London Cycling Campaign from 2003-2009, as Chair from 2006-2009. During this period, cycling in London doubled, so I have some experience of cycle planning and politics.\n10. Is there anything else you would like to do to help support cycling in Romsey?\nAll of the above, and as mentioned, the town centre could quite easily be car free\"\nCaroline Nokes - Conservative Party\n|\n\"Thank you for contacting me about cycling. The number of people choosing to get about by bike has grown over recent years and, following the success of our Rio Olympians, and I passionately want to see this trend continue.\nGovernment investment in cycling has tripled since 2010. My colleagues at the Department for Transport are spending £300 million on cycling funding and a further £500 million for infrastructure in local communities, which will include benefits for cyclists. The £300 million funding includes delivering the £114 million Cycle City Ambition scheme in full, a new 'access' fund for sustainable travel and providing 1.3 million children with cycling proficiency training through funding for the Bikeability scheme. When I worked as a PPS at the Department for Transport, I regularly raised the importance of cycling and was delighted at the positive response I received from Government. |\nMinisters are also looking to local authorities as partners to deliver on cycle infrastructure in local communities across England. There is long-term funding available to both local authorities and Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs), which could be used on cycling through the Integrated Transport block, Highways Maintenance block, and the new 'access' fund; and billions of long-term local transport funding available through the Local Growth Fund.\nI am pleased that LEPs, which are responsible for prioritising the use of Local Growth Fund allocations within their area, are showing that they understand the value and benefits of cycling, with around £280 million of the Local Growth Fund currently being allocated to cycling projects.\nLocally, Test Valley Borough Council were one of the first councils to use Section 106 agreements to improving cycle provision in and near new developments. This generates new investment in cycling facilities and we have seen a large increase in the amount of cyclists on the road. I regularly discuss local cycling issues with Test Valley Borough Council and raised the concerns of parents about unsafe roads.\nYou will, of course, know that we have corresponded about this particular route several times and I have forwarded the information to you from Viv Messenger at TVBC. Of course the stretch of road from the Rapids to Lee Lane is incredibly busy, the footpath is not adequate for dual use as a cycle way, and no I certainly wouldn't want to cycle along that part of Southampton Road. I will admit to not being much of a cyclist, but my daughter has been, and like any parent I used to worry about the interaction between vehicles and her on her bike. I don't think this is the only stretch of concern however, and the A3057 between the end of the cycle path in Timsbury and Romsey is horrific for cyclists. As you will know the completion of the cycle path from Stockbridge to Romsey is also on the agenda for the Borough Council.\nInevitably use of S106 monies relies on a) there being new housing development and b) there being sufficient funds to use for a wide variety of projects including the provision of other types of leisure facility.\nI would be delighted to organise a summit with the council and your organisation to discuss local cycling policy.I believe that by getting local stakeholders together, we can coordinate a cycling strategy for the area which encourages people of all ages and abilities to cycle safely in their communities..\"\nDon Jerrard - Justice & Anti-Corruption Party\n|\n\"You can be assured that the subject of cycling is very important to me. As you may know I was a candidate in last year’s Police & Crime Commissioner Election in Hampshire and I was one of only two of the 7 candidates who attended the Portsmouth Cycling Forum when invited to do so because of the problems of cycling in Portsmouth. The death rate for cyclists in Portsmouth is second only to that in London in this country.\nI also have a strong personal interest for two reasons. Firstly cycling is very popular in and around Liss and Liphook near where I live and has been for many years. A lot of my friends are involved, not me because I have a dodgy knee from my very unsuccessful football days, but it is the talk of the pub most days. Secondly my younger son cycles from Warsash to work in Southampton and back every day so I fear for his safety. |\nI don’t think it particularly helps for me to answer your specific questions with my limited knowledge at the moment. I have lived in East Hampshire for nearly 30 years and one of the huge personal advantages to me if I win the election is that my wife will agree to us down-sizing now and moving back to where I came from and even being able to cycle to watch the Saints, if I did not have the dodgy knee. I used to walk to the Dell from our home in Bassett Green but now it will have to be car or the bus.\nWhat I can promise is that cycling really is a very high priority for me as I think it should be for anyone concerned with the problems (or opportunities) that affect cyclists which is health and traffic safety. I hope my style has always been to listen a lot, think a lot and say comparatively little but try and get results where they are most needed. If I win you can be assured that I will talk to those involved in cycling, listen to what is said and try and help.\nI hope you will follow my campaign with interest. I believe that the best thing for the constituency at present is to have a candidate dedicated to a particular cause and to deal with local issues, rather than a career politician. The JAC Party website is www.jacparty.org.uk which we are struggling to keep up to date. That is because the man who manages it for us is one of the local keen cyclists whom I mentioned, with the disadvantage of having 4 daughters of school or university age who keep taking him out when he is meant to be loading the info onto the site!\nPlease feel free to call on 07969 891638 if you would like to discuss anything.\"\nWhat I can promise is that cycling really is a very high priority for me as I think it should be for anyone concerned with the problems (or opportunities) that affect cyclists which is health and traffic safety.

Our plans will encourage and enable people to get out of their cars, for better health and a cleaner environment.\nA Labour government will invite the National Infrastructure Commission to recommend the next stages for developing and upgrading the National Cycle Network. We reaffirm the commitments in the Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy. |\nIt’s right to encourage more children to cycle to school in Romsey, as and where there are safe routes that young people and parents are confident using. In the same way, I would seek to encourage local businesses to get their employees on bikes for the journeys to and from work, where practical. Ideas around cycle paths could go some way to encouraging more residents to do this, and it would be important for me to work with the local authority, schools, and groups like yours to ensure the design of any improvements is suitable.\nYes I’m a cyclist - sometimes a bit of a fair-weather one, but my journey to work is usually quicker and less stressful when on my bike rather than in the car.\nYes I’m a cyclist - sometimes a bit of a fair-weather one, but my journey to work is usually quicker and less stressful when on my bike rather than in the car.\nI am in favour of road space re-allocation, cycle paths, cycle roads or mixes of these as local authorities see appropriate, as it’s crucial to facilitate safe bike riding if we are to encourage people to get out of their cars and get on their bikes. I recently rode a bike around Amsterdam, and the experience was a very different one to riding in the UK! That culture of cycles having priority and a safe network of cycle paths and shared-use paths was inspiring.\nCatherine Royce - Liberal Democrats\n\"While I would like to be able to respond personally to you, we are receiving a large volume of emails at the moment and I regret that it is impossible to engage fully with the questions posed. I hope you will understand that in a very short General Election period I am extremely busy campaigning and meeting residents in the constituency and we do not have the resources to deal with the number of emails and questions we are receiving.\nPeople have been in touch on a varied and interesting range of topics which I know concern them greatly. I think it would be most useful if I referred you to the manifesto page of the Liberal Democrat national website:\nhttp://www.libdems.org.uk/manifesto\nHere you can see our intent on many of the topics raised; topics that do indeed impinge on our lives.\nSome issues are extremely complicated and without the time to consider them very carefully signing a pledge could lead to misunderstandings on both sides\".\nPeople have been in touch on a varied and interesting range of topics which I know concern them greatly.

  "https_romseycyclehub_weebly_com_/https_romseycyclehub_weebly_com_bells-the-pedestrians-view_html/content_13.html": "Bells! The Pedestrian's View\nRich House 17 June 2018\n|\nMany of our cycle paths in Romsey are shared with pedestrians. As a historic town there is sometimes not enough room to allow otherwise. Our cash starved local councils can't always afford dedicated cycle paths. In fact we have only about 20 metres of cycle only paths! So we have to share.\nAs generally nice people I would encourage all cyclists in the town to share with courtesy. Please cycle past pedestrians and pets slowly. Please ring your bells when approaching those on foot (please buy one if you've not got one - they're very cheap). Please make sure they've aknowledged you before passing (they may be deaf). Please say thank you when walkers step to one side to allow you to pass. Please pass young children and animals with special care, as their movements may be erratic. As well as being just good manners it is in our own interest to improve still further our image in the town and become even more popular for the good we do for local traffic, cleaner air and a better environment. New signs will be coming to the Canal Path soon to help remind cyclists and pedestrians of the common courtesies of sharing.\nOne of our readers, Julian Jones, shared his concerns with me. I suggested he write an article explaining these. He and his wife Sue Jones have kindly written the following article for us. He makes many good points. Personally I agree with Mr Ward, although I may have worded it differently. My view is that pedestrians should also share courteously, thanking cyclists for ringing their bells and moving to the side to let them pass.\n|\nThere was an article in a recent Romsey Advertiser (1 st June 2018, page 35) about use of bells by cyclists in the New Forest. A Mr Ward of the New Forest Cycling Club says \"Yes we [cyclists] need to watch where we are going, but pedestrians have a duty to do the same\".\nMy wife and I felt strongly about that remark. We regularly walk to and from Romsey along Canal Walk. We walk side by side and adjust to single file when approached by other pedestrians, baby buggies, electric mobility carts and cyclists. Even with the current profuse undergrowth there is room to pass. As pedestrians, we look where we are going while walking forward, but cannot also look behind us to see what is overtaking us. It is this situation where use of a bell by the overtaking cyclist would be appreciated so that we know that we need to change from walking two abreast to Indian file to allow a cyclist to pass. It is certainly a daily occurrence on Canal Walk that many cyclists just appear at our shoulder and expect us to do something. A bell gives warning. One loud ting is sufficient. I hope you would consider this pedestrian's view when the bell/no bell discussion comes up in your circles.\nThanks\nJulian & Sue Jones",

Southampton Road from Rapids to Lee Lane\nMake the existing narrow footpath into a path suitable for cyclists.\n- Our surveys show this is part of the busiest cycle route between Romsey & Southampton.\n- The road is dangerous due to high volumes of motor traffic travelling up to 50mph on fairly narrow lanes.\n- From frequency of use it appears to be the major commuter route - unlike a predominently leisure route it may be difficult to choose viable alternatives.\n- It is a high profile route that will show the many travelling it that Romsey is serious about encouraging cycling.\n- There is enough space available along the verge to allow various implentation options.\n2. Lee Lane Motor Traffic Slowing and Reduction\nMeasures to slow motor traffic and reduce volumes to make this lane safer for cyclists.\n- Our surveys show this is part of the busiest cycle route between Romsey & Southampton.\n- Although traffic is relatively light, this lane is narrow, winding and vehicles can travel up to the national speed limit (60mph), endangering cyclists.\n- Many cost effective options are available (e.g. reducing the speed limit, speed bumps, restricting accessing to residents and cyclists, Quiet Lane status, etc).\n- It is a beautiful lane to cycle along.\n3. Canal Path Extension\n|\nExtend the exising shared pedestrian cycle path along the canal north along the canal to connect to the A3057 cycle path in Timsbury.\n|\n4.

The new surfacing and cycle stands near the Memorial Park Café will be installed in w/c 8 January 2018.\nA big thank you to Test Valley Borough Borough Council and Romsey Future for funding and arranging this.\nThe Hundred & Viney Ave Stores\nThe Viney Avenue rails work well in a limited space and must be fairly inexpensive to install. I understand from TVBC that the missing bolts were due to there being voids in the brick and difficulty avoiding the mortar. TVBC say a cycle parking sign will be installed on 18 December.\nUPDATE 3 Dec 2017 - I have heard that the Viney Ave rails have been pulled out. I've let TVBC know and asked them to fix them.\nJust one extra rack has been added to the Hundred racks just outside the Phoenix given the limited space. It looks well chosen to me. The litter bin has been moved to make room. This web site's home splash page photo is now out of date!\nUPDATE 3 Dec 2017 - I have let TVBC know about the mess on the pavements around the new stand in The Hundred. They think it will probably just brush away, but will check on it soon."
