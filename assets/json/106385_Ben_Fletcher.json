There are 200,000 children in the UK who start primary school without the skills to learn and 90% never close that gap. As a Conservative, I believe in ensuring everyone has the best start in life and if elected this I will campaign to improve these outcomes both nationally and in Crewe and Nantwich.\n“Alongside this personal passion I would want to be seen by my constituents as an outstanding champion for them. Living in Cheshire with my family we have come to love the area and the blend of towns and countryside that make the county so special. If elected as the next MP for Crewe and Nantwich I would want to use my experience to champion thriving high streets, planning that is transparent and effective, protecting the greenbelt and promoting sensitive development that commands the support of local people.\nBen, who is also a trustee of the National Literacy Trust which helps improve reading and writing skills for people from all walks of life, added that he believes only the Conservatives can be trusted to deliver on what matters to people in Crewe and Nantwich.\nHe said: “When people in Crewe and Nantwich go to the polls to vote for their next Member of Parliament, the choice is clear. Stick with the plan that is working under the Conservatives and which will deliver a brighter future for everyone or the Labour alternative which will just take us back to square one.”",

Not only is it a blight on our communities and green spaces, but the menace of fly-tipping also endangers wildlife and puts added strain on council services. I urge the local Labour Council to break it’s regular habit and take immediate action to snare this money makes a positive difference\nRecycling Minister, Robbie Moore said:\nI am determined the harm done by cynical criminals who carry out fly-tipping doesn’t go unpunished. We have increased the maximum penalty councils can issue for these offences, made sure money from those fines goes back into more enforcement and clean up, and now we are giving councils a further £1 million boost. Our previous funding has achieved significant reductions in fly-tipping across many parts of England – which is why we will build on our successes and ensure councils have more resources to carry on the fight.",

This announcement will build on this success, recruiting 8,000 more full-time neighbourhood police officers with the full power of arrest – equivalent to an additional police officer for every ward in England and Wales.\nThese officers will be specifically focused on policing the local neighbourhood they are assigned to, boosting the visible police presence in communities and helping families feel safer in their area. These strengthened neighbourhood policing teams will ensure every neighbourhood will have a genuine and more continuous police officer coverage.\nThere will also be a new requirement for police forces not to offset these additional officers by diverting police officers already dedicated to neighbourhood duties, to other purposes, ensuring neighbourhood policing is prioritised. The Conservatives will also roll out the Hotspot Policing Programme nationally following its successful pilot.\nIn contrast to the Conservatives’ plan to recruit 8,000 full-time neighbourhood police with the full power of arrest, Labour would recruit just 3,000 of these equivalent officers under their pledge, leaving neighbourhood policing teams without the resources they need to keep families in Crewe and Nantwich safe.\nCommenting, Ben Fletcher said:\n“Our police work incredibly hard to support our communities across Crewe and Nantwich, but we know our police need more resources to keep local residents safe.\n“That is why I welcome the announcement today that the Conservatives will recruit 8,000 more full-time police officers with the full power of arrest, over the double the number Labour have pledged.\n“The choice is clear in this election. Stick with the plan with Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives who will recruit more police and keep our area safe, or go back to square one with Keir Starmer and the Labour Party who have consistently opposed tougher measures to crack down on crime.”\nCommenting, Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister said:\n“Our 20,000 new police officers since 2019 have made a huge difference, with neighbourhood crime down 48 per cent as a result. We will now go further by hiring 8,000 more police officers, each one dedicated to their local community.\n“People deserve to feel safe in their neighbourhood. More bobbies on the beat and increased powers will give police forces the tools they need to drive down neighbourhood crime even further.\n“On the other hand, Labour has no plan and no idea how to fund more police officers. Without a plan crime will only go up, as we’ve seen in those living in areas with a Labour Police and Crime Commissioner. Our clear plan will create a more secure future for neighbourhoods up and down the country.”\nJames Cleverly, the Home Secretary said:\n“The Conservatives will always back our brave police and security services with the powers and resources needed to keep our country safe.\n“The new neighbourhood police programme we have announced today will make our streets safer.\n“The Conservatives will take bold action with a clear plan to build a more secure future for people up and down the country. Unlike Keir Starmer’s Labour Party who have no plan to keep the country safe. You only have to look to London where crime has risen under Labour rule to see the real damage the Labour Party can do to your community.”",

This will be done by replacing the worst performing university courses with high-skilled apprenticeships\nThe UK is home to four of the top ten universities globally, which play a significant role in boosting local economies. However, too many university degrees are leaving students worse off and saddled with debt.\nThat is why the Conservatives will assess the poorest performing university courses based on their drop-out rates, job progression and future earnings potential and replace these with high-skilled apprenticeships so our young people can learn the skills they need to reach their full potential.\nSince 2010, the Conservatives have created a world-class apprenticeship system that has delivered 5.8 million apprenticeships and now reaches nearly 70 per cent of all occupations.\nThe choice is clear: stick with the Conservatives under Rishi Sunak who have built a world-class apprenticeship system from the ground up and are securing the future of our young people alongside our National Service plan. Or go back to square one with Labour, who would slash apprenticeships in half across the country, denying young people of the opportunities they deserve and taking us back to square one.\nBen said, Only the Conservatives have a clear plan to give young people in Crewe and Nantwich the opportunities they deserve for a more secure future. Building on the delivery of 5.8 million apprenticeships since 2010, I am delighted that the Conservatives have now gone further by setting out a clear plan to deliver 100,000 new apprenticeships per year, helping young people to gain the valuable life skills they need for a more secure future alongside our National Service plan.\nRishi Sunak, Prime Minister said: Improving education is the closest thing we have to a silver bullet for boosting life chances. So, it’s not fair that some university courses are ripping young people off. Thanks to our plan, apprenticeships are much higher quality than they were under Labour. And now we will create 100,000 more, by putting an end to rip-off degrees and offering our young people the employment opportunities and financial security they need to thrive. That’s the choice at this election – the Conservatives with our clear plan to grow the economy and give people the opportunities they need for a secure future, or Labour who have no plan and would take us back to square one.\nGillian Keegan, Education Secretary said: There are no limits to where an apprenticeship can take you. Mine took me from a car factory in Kirkby to the Cabinet. When Labour were in power they pushed an arbitrary target to get half of young people to university, creating a boom in low quality degrees – leaving far too many students saddled with debt and little else. The choice is clear. Sir Keir Starmer and the Labour party who have contempt for apprenticeships, or Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives who have a clear plan to give young people the best start to their careers.",
